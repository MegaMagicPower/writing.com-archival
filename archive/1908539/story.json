Created to copy down the knowledge of its master, this book was meant to be used to carry on legacies. However the book was stolen by its creator\u2019s apprentice. The apprentice sent the book on a new mission. To record all perverted techniques, spells, potions, and objects. The book would then find a hero, and slowly corrupt him into a Harem God. From world to world, the Eronomicon went, gaining more knowledge of perversion.  Finally the Eronomicon has found a hero. The Eronomicon will hide its true self at first, only showing what its owner desired. However each desire will be twisted, and will reveal more of the dark nature of the book. Will the hero become a Harem God, or will they overcome their desires. Only you can decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is our Hero.</span></div></div>",

The groping wasn't as fun right now, but more over he needed some air. Tsunade then lowered herself, and placed her boobs on his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"WOW!!\" Naruto was caught off guard. Tsunade smiled, starting to move them up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"Master like?\" Naruto moaned out loud, so perhaps he did. She wanted him to be happy. She then began to notice some cum coming out. She decided to drive her master crazy. She began to lick it, causing them both to moan. She then decided to bring it on. She stopped licking, and started sucking. \"Oh...oh dear....\" Naruto was losing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade Wanted him to cum. she wants it. After a bit, he finally does.

I'll say that I have something more important at the moment, and say it will have to wait. Then, I'll hold out for as long as I can. Maybe Naruto will forget it after a while.' She thought as she started sweating due to the loss. She saw the slight glimmer of perversion in his eye. 'Jiraiya probably started to corrupt him on the training trip, but then everything happened with the war and all, so maybe Naruto forgot it for some time. Now that it was peace time though...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to Naruto, she spoke to him. \"Sorry Naruto, but I have more important stuff to deal with. Can it wait for a while?\" She asked, knowing she couldn't outright refuse him due to ninja code, rule 76. 'If you make a bet that doesn't include betraying your village, or if the mission requires it, you are honor bound to keep it. We are ninja, not dishonored bandits and thugs. If we are found untrustworthy, then who will go to you for missions?' Damn stupid ninja code of honor. It made no sense! They were assassins! Theives! Why did they need a code anyway? It just hurt the profession if you thought about it. Lieing and cheating was in their nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at her suspiciosly. \"You don't plan on making up excuses do you? I remember when me and Pervy sage found you. Running from debt collector because of your gambleing problems. I will let it slide this time grandma, but not forever.\" He said as he packed up the cards, almost making Tsunade ask for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back with the book, it was hopping mad. Or, it would be, if it could hop. The busty lady just tried to back out of the deal it had made under the influence of the cards of chance!  No one would have one over on its chosen. Not if it had something to write about it. (Get it? It's a book?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow it knew you ask? Well, the Eronomicon makes a connection to the marked one when the marked one first touches it. It slowly corrupts the morals of its user, if they aren't already corrupt. it also nows when ever the marked one is about to get a lady for his harem, and it knows when something goes wrong or right. That way, it can give the chosen what he needs. Just another little thing about magic that everyone loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was on his way back to his appartment. He was slightly miffed about the fact that Tsunade didn't uphold her end of the deal. He was going to make her teach him about how to be hokage, and other stuff. Maybe fondle her tits or something, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to look through the book that gave him the cards, he made his  home even quicker.</span></div></div>",

It growled loudly, surprising him. \"Guess I haven't eaten to day have I?\" He said as he scratched the back of his head sheepishly. \"Well, no better place to eat than Ichiraku's, so I'll go there!\" He said. He slipped on the ring, pocketed the earrings, and made his way to the little stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived there not to long afterwards, due to using chakra to hop along the rooftops. He made his way into the little family owned and run ramen shop, preparing to eat to his hearts content. He had the money. He could pay for as much as he ate easily. After all, those pay checks had to go somewhere didn't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Ayame! Old man! How are you two?\" He asked, not noting the lack of Ayames father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ramen waitress looked up to see the #1 customer of their stand. \"Hey Naruto! Daddy isn't here right now. He said something about some special sale in the market. He would have sent me, but he said I need expeience running the store on my own. So, he'll probably be gone for a while. Anyway, what can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know. Can you get me three miso, two beef, a shrimp, and five pork?\" He said with a smile. Ayame was always nice to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up!\" She said as she went into the back to make up the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was lost in thought as she made his order. She was always the best. She was there when he was a kid and no other store would let him in. The old man, Hiuzen, would take him there on his birthday. He would also get alot of his meals from here. Ayames dad was nice too, but never as nice as the girl infront of him. He made up his mind on who he would give the earrings to. Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting awhile, Narutos order was up. \"Here you go Naruto. When you finish up, just let me know.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ayame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you something. You know, for being there for all these years. You and the old man were some of the nicest people I ever met. All those times you gave me a free bowl of ramen when I was out of money and food. I just got something as a little thank you.\" He said as he reached for the earrings.</span></div></div>",

Please?\" He said as he finally pulled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame was in awe of their beauty. She saw herself wearing those earrings. Not because she was vain, but because Naruto gave them to her. She took them from him. \"I don't know wha to say Naruto. They're beautiful. Oh, I'll put them on now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proccedded to take her old earrings out, a gift from her father, and put the new ones in. Nothing seemed off at the moment, but that would change in a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later that night~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto lay in bed, wondering what would happen with the earrings. He still haden't taken the ring off, just like the book told him. As his eyes drifted shut, he realised how tired he was. After ramen, he had gone training. Missions still needed to be done because people still required them. And since they were required, they needed the ninja to be in top condition. He had trained until a half hour ago, after the moon had already risen a fair distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drifted of to sleep, he wondered how Ayame was liking her gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know, Ayame never took of the earrings. Right now, she was sleeping with them on. She never was one to move in her sleep, so she could easily keep something like earings on when she slept. That, and she felt for some reason that she should keep the earrings on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was fast losing consiousness, and did nothing to fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Dream~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was eating at Ichiraku's again, and Ayame was manning the shop alone. However, there was one tiny thing different. Ayame was only wearing an apron and the earrings he had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream Ayame was watching him eat, looking content. \"That was Deliscious!\"Dream Naruto said. DA smiled even more. Although, this smile was more seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you master. Now, would you like some dessert?\" Dream Ayame asked. DN nodded, a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Hold on for a moment.\" She said as she got up and turned around, giving DN a plain view of her ass. She swyed her hips as she walked, making him focus more and more on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDn heard the sound of a whipped cram can being emptied in the backround. When the sound had ended, her heard DA call him into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back, he saw that Ayame had covered herself in whipped cream and was laying on a table. \"Dessert is ready master.\" She said, shaking her hips slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Real world~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was sleep-giggling in a perverse tone. He was using his ring hand as a pillow, subconsioucly placing the ring near him. He was muttering things in his sleep to the ring. Some of the more interesting things he had said were 'Thats right, whos your master you naughty bitch? Thats right, Naruto.' and 'Oh yeah, shake that ass for your master.' And 'Yeah, who is a naughty little slave? You are!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the village, Ayame was starting to hear things in her sleep. She heard her own voice telling her that Naruto was her master, and she was his little slave, who would do anything for him. She would do anything he said with love and care, and be happy if he proccedded to fuck every which way, even in public. In fact, she heard it so much while she was asleep, that she began to dream of it as it began to rewrite her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would still be the Ayame of before, just Naruto's slave. And all through the dream, the earrings glowed in her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto saw that Ayame was still like she normally was, unlike the dream he had. Making his way into the stand, he ordered a few bowls of ramen to go, not noticing how Ayame blushed when she was near him and how she had to catch herself from calling him master once or twice. Naruto left the stand, going to the training grounds he frequented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way through town, he never noticed how the Eronomicon, sealed in his right hand, was leaking perverted energies through his chakra system, nor how it affect Kurama while he slept. Well, He wouldn't be a 'he' for much longer, as the timeless tome changed the very energies the Bijuu was made of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the day passed with Naruto training, stopping twice to eat his ramen. Once he was done training, he noticed how the sky was starting to turn purple, a sign that night was approaching. He made his way home, deciding to look in the old book again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing home, he unsealed the book, and began to browse through it. Finding something he figured he liked, he unsealed it, not noticing how a little bit of his chakra was corrupted into a perverse type of chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the smoke cleared, he picked up a pocket watch that had a small red button on the side. Looking back at the book, he read about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The watch you are most likely holding is a very special watch. If you think of someone while you press the red button, the watch will go back in time to your younger self, and lead up to a situation where it will hypnotize that person. Your younger self will give a command phrase, making sure that the person you hypnotize will only repond to your voice. The watch will then block off the memory of the event, come back to you in the presant time and unseal the memory.\" He read, smiling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this was short lived as he felt Kurama call him to his mind scape. Slowly losing consiousness, he sealed the Eronomicon back into himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~In the seal, Kurama's cage~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his eyes to find himself outside the golden cage that housed the most fearsome demon, and one of his best friends, Kurama. However, looking in the cage, he noticed a disinct lack of giant, red demon fox. Normally, he would be able to see him no matter how he moved inside the prison that was Naruto's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what could have happened to him, Naruto slowly made his way to the cage. He and Kurama had a pact. Kurama wouldn't try to kill him, if Naruto sent the occasional giant rabbit his way to eat. Kurama may have been made of chakra and had no need for food, but it was something to do while he crunched on the bones and tore at the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly making his way into the giant structure, narutop looked around for his demon friend. Not seeing him, he made his way further into the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes, Naruto made it to the back. He saw a figure off in the distance to his right. He wondered what it could have beeen, so he made his way over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer, he noticed the figure was human, and very much female. \"Hello?\" He called out, startling the figure. She looked up and noticed Naruto. The woman snarled as she got up, eyes blazing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't notice the anger rolling off of the woman, so made his way closer. Upon reaching a closer distance, the woman charged at him, obiously trying to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, eyes wide at the unprovoked attack, dodged out of the way as the woman punched the ground where he was standing not even a moment before. He watched, glad he dodged as the ground he just vacated exploded so violently, that it put Tsunades strength to shame and made it seem as if it was just a love tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned her burning red eyes at him, staring at him with so much hatred. She charged at him, roaring at him with the utmost amount of hate any being could ever posses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ran as fast as he could away from the woman, making his way back to the gates. He almost didn't make it as the woman got close enough that she could punch the ground at an angle, sending all the debris at Naruto. As Naruto slipped the the bars of the cage, he noticed how the woman slammed against them as hard as she could, only to be blown back by an unseen force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman kept trying again and again to get at him, to no avail. After about ten minutes of this, the woman contended herself with sitting behind the bars of the cage, growling and snarling at Naruto while she tried to burn him with her glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at her, wondering who she was. She had red hair and pure red eyes that currently were trying to bore holes in him. He also noticed how she was undressed, making him blush slightly. This only semed to aggrivate the woman, so he moved on. All he could note was that she was very beautiful. Well, that and she had two small lumps on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked closer to the lmps, and noticed one of them twitch. A second later, a fuzzy ear popped out from beneath her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait a second. Fuzzy ear?' He thought, knowing it was importent. Forgetting that he was in his head, which meant his thoughts were silently heard, the woman snarled at him once again, this time opting to speak once she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are to stupid to figure it oout Naruto, let me give you a reminder. Big, tall and scary? Furry all over? Being a god damned fox!\" She screamed at him, shocking Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kurama?\"  He asked, not believing that the beautiful woman infront of him was the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama noted the 'beautiful' comment, and snarled at him. \"Come into the cage and say that! I will rip you, and that book to shreds!\" She yelled, making Naruto look at the now  female, human Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Book? What book?\" He asked, not putting two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stupid book that did this to me! I knew that it would help you get some fine bitches, but this is too much!\" She yelled the demonic woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared back at her for a moment before he got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the book that gave me those cards and the earrings and the watch did this?\" He asked, not realising the full nature of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! What else could make me, the Kyuubi no Yoko, into a woman? What else could it have been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought back, wondering if there was anything else that could have done this. Not thinking of anything else, he shook his head. \"I'm sorry Kurama. I didn't know it would do this to you.\" He said, genuinly feeling bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the two never noticed the slight increase in corupption flowing from the Eronomicon sealed up inside Naruto. It sensed its master feeling bad about something wonderfully perverted, so had to slightly increase the speed at which it corrupted Naruto. However, this also made it start to drain it's own reserves by how much it increased the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought it over, not noticing how things started to get darker. Kyuubie was to busy making a fuss over the whole situation to notice as Naruto's thought got closer and closer to thinking about how to use the situation for his own bennifit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Until you find out how to reverse this, you won't be getting any of my chakra.\" Kurama stated, making Naruto look at the demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could he... she do that to him! After all they went through together? All the breakthroughs they made between Bijuu and their containers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at her for a moment, before he remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could use the watch to make Kyuubi his slave! Then, he would be able to have sa civil conversation again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing these thoughts, KUrama looked at the blond. \"Don't you dare!\" She screamed at him. \"Don't you even fucking dare! I will devouer your soul if you do this Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paid her no attention as he faded from the mind scape, smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama screamed in pure rage, and started to destroy everything she could in an effort to escape. She wouldn't go down like this! Never!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Outside the mind scape~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto awoke, watch just infront of him. He made to grab it, before he felt pain errupt in his skull. Kurama was not happy. He felt as her chakra began to leak out of the seal on his stomach, trying to take over. He made a wild grab for the watch, only to fel his arm seize up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnoqwing this was Kurama's doing, he used all the will power to grab the watch. As he felt the control slipping from his grasp, he managed to press the button on the side, making the watch simply disappear, going to the first time he spoke to Kurama to place the, at the time, male, fox demon under his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the seal, Kurama roared in anguish as she saw through Naruto's eyes him using the watch. She roared one last time, letting all her anger out in one last act of defiance. Having nothing left to do. She slowly set herself on the floor. She pulled her legs towrd her, and put her arms around them. She buried her head in her knees as she let loose an emotion she had only felt once before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt as Kurama's control retreated back into the seal. It was a close call. He sighed, noticing the watch reappear infront of him. He watched at it shot out a small beam from the hour hand into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, he went back into the seal. He noticed how everything was destroyed around him, showing just how hard she fought. Noticing her rocking back and forth, cring her eyes out, he said the command phrase, hoping to make her forgive him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet little vixen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama stopped crying and looked at him, her eyes red from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" She asked, eyes full of hope and love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and walked into the cage, hugging the woman as she cried tears of happiness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was flipping through the Eronomicon, looking for something to user to give the newly named Kurami an actual body. The Eronomicon was slow to pick up on his wish, having given a lot of energy to make him use the watch. However, it flipped through to a page with a seal on it with the words 'Bodies for soul transfer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this was good enough, Naruto channeled more chakra into the book, still not noticing how his chakra was changing. The tome let out a large plume of smoke, large enough that it covered Naruto and his table in it. Coughing as he fanned away the smoke, Naruto looked upon the body that came from the Eronomicon and stopped short, his mind reeling at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on his table was a corpse that was in perfect condition. It still had the look of life about it, the fair skin not blue tinged as one would expect a body to be. The clothes the corpse wore had a large hole in it, large enough for one of Kurami's old claws to have fit through. The red hair was set perfectly behind the corpse, looking just as it would if it was stood up. But Naruto knew who it was. He had seen her only once, but that was more then enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his mother, Kushina Uzumaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat still as he looked at it. She looked so peaceful. Serene, even. If it wasn't for the fact that it didn't breath and that there was a large hole in the dress, Naruto would have thought her to be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaintly, he heard Karumi crying in his head, apologizing for the fact his mother was dead because of her. But Naruto paid no attention to that. He just stared at the body of his mother, lain before him. He never noticed how beautiful she was when he met her in his mind scape. But now, he could truely admire her. She would be perfect for Kurami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back in the book for a soul transfer jutsu or something, he quickly found it. He noticed that it was a seal, so he quickly yet carefully, drew one. Following the steps, he went into his mind scape to draw the seal on the crying Kurami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he appeared though, she had quickly hugged his legs, begging for forgivness. Naruto smiled sadly at her, before hugging the poor girl as she bawled her eyes out, knowing how it must have been for her master and love to see the body of the mother he never had. The one she took from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShushing the poor girl, he had her lay down so he could draw the seal. Once the seal  was complete, he exited the mind scape and looked at the body on his table. Slowly, he began to push tiny amounts of Karumi's chakra into his mother. The seal he had drawn on her began to glow, signiling that the transfer had begun. He heard Karumi's sniffles get softer and softer, until he couldn't hear her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the body of his mother started to twitch with each passing second as the sound in his head got quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did this for over ten minutes, watching as his mother's body changed bit by bit. The first thing he noticed was the fact that her chest started to rise and fall. The next change was that the look of life around her got stronger and stronger, instead of fading as it had been not moments ago. Her already red hair became a darker shade, turning the color of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this and more happened as the sound of Karumi quieted in his head. Once he couldn't hear her anymore, the eyes snapped open. They were unfocused as they darted around before they settled on Naruto. The softend considerably as they watvhed him smile at her, tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarumi sat up slowly, getting used to a physical body, and a human one none the less. She looked at her new hands, twitched each finger to get used to them. She felt along her legs. Smooth as silk. She flexed her toes as she brought feeling into her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly swung her legs to the edge of the table, and tried to walk. Unused to them, the time in the mind scape she was human didn't count because she could copy movments Naruto had made, she tried to stand, only for her to almost fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to worry though, as Naruto caught her just as soon as her legs gave out. She fell into his arms, giving a small oomph as she did so. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders, before she looked at him, tears gathering in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-koi.\" She wispered before she felt the softness of his lips against hers. She melted in his armss as he kissed her, feeling like she was the luckiest demon alive.</span></div></div>",

He slowly started to massage her leg, giving her feeling in it again. It may have taken a while, but she was ready to try again afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up again, a little more steady this time. She made it five steps before her knees buckled. Once again, Naruto caught her in his arms. However, unlike the last time, Kurami was able to stand up after a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it continued like this for a good hour before she was able to walk to the dresser and back decently enough. She would soon get used to doing more stuff with her new body. Also, her demon ears came in. It seemed the chakra was starting to replenish itself inside the new body, changing it even more then the soul transfer did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went into his mind scape and saw a large chakra force behind the gates of the seal. He guessed that this is what remained of Kurami's chakra. It seemed that it would be absorbed into him soon. What effect this would have on him, he didn't know. But, as long as he got to stay with Kurami and any other girls he got, he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Several days later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched as Kurami got more and more used to the human body. Her canine's had grown longer and sharper, along with whisker marks appearing on her cheeks. She started to do exercises to get her familierized with the new muscle system she had. She did light jumping jacks, push ups, sit ups, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got better and better as time went by. Naruto never left her side the entire time. He also went to see Ayame, who he had been having dreams about ever since he gave her the earrings. However, he was shocked to find her with nothing but a collar on and calling him master. He wasn't going to object though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame soon moved in with him after that, her dad wishing her well, seemingly alright with this. Naruto also scanned the Eronomicon every day, looking through the contents of the book. He never used anything though, and he wouldn't until he was sur Kurami could handle her new body well enough. He figured that after another week or so he could start to teach her some ninja training, or at least find some one who can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the Eronomicon was happy that it pleased its master, knowing it chose right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later, Naruto saw that Kurami was a fast learner as she actually got used to her new movments. Her demon chakra also seemed to be helping her muscles grow, helping her keep her sleek form in the process. She also got her blazing red eyes back.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto made his way to Takigakure. He remembered how energetic and happy Chomei, the seven tailed beetle, was during the time he talked with all the Bijuu. It seemed like it was the most outgoing of all the bijuu. Chomei was actually happy to see him take down Obito and the Juubi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bijuu said that they didn't want to go back to being one entity with a singular consious. They wanted to be themselves, not a beast hellbent on destruction. In truth, only the Juubi wanted destruction, and sought it out. All the Bijuu looked up to the sage. All of them cried when he passed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~A few weeks later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was sitting near a stream, filling up his canteen with fresh water. He wondered how all the bijuu were doing in their homes. He wondered if any of them had been sealed up again. He hopped not, but he would do what he had to do to ensure they would be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back on Kurami and the village. All the girls there were now his to do with as he wished, but that didn't mean he was a heartless bastard like Obito or Orochimaru, let alone Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed at the thought of the traitor. He killed him in the war after Sasuke sent Kakashi away with a well placed <i>kamui</i>. Naruto didn't know what happened after that, but he woke up covered in blood that wasn't his. There was no sign of Sasuke, except for his eyes in Naruto's hand. Naruto knew that Sasuke would never leave him alive, with or without eyes. He knew that Sasuke was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to happier thoughts, he wondered how Kurami was enjoying the village women. He also wondered how the men were taking it. He wondered if any of them had tried to do something. The thought alone made Naruto growl as his eyes turned a burning crimson. If so, there would be hell to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing Naruto had talked to Kurami about was that her chakra would start to meld with him. It seemed that Naruto would become stronger and stronger as the Yokai changed him and he grew accostumed to it. Neither knew if he would become a demon though, but Naruto was reassured by Kurami that she would love him no matter what. Ayame wholeheartedly agreed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~One week later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had entered the jungle-like forest where Chomei made it's home. There were many different types of bugs, showing that Chomei's aura drew them to it. Naruto didn't disturb the bugs, even when they started to follow him, wondering who the strange human was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Several hours later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed as he set up camp in a dense part of the forest. He had hoped that Chomei would come out. But it seemed that the Bijuu was either avoiding him or was watching him through the bugs. He had seen weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set up a campfire. He had sealed about a months worth of supplies for campfires. He was running out though. He would have to stop by Taki on his way out if he would make it back home with a fire at least every other night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Naruto noticed when he felt the ground shake. The bugs that watched him were starting to act up, buzzing and what not in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked in the direction from which the tremors came from. The trees fell down to show him the form of a large beetle. The moonlight glinted of the shell which had seven spikes on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Chomei, the seven tailed beetle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at it, staring at it for a moment before he bowed. \"Chomei.\" He greeted in a respectful tone.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chomei starred at Naruto for a little longer, before the bijuu bowed back. \"Greetings Naruto. I am surprised to see you in my forest. Although it is not unwelcome. I am pleased to see the saviour of all the Bijuu well. If I may ask, why have you come?\" The beast asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked directly at the bijuu, eyes never faltering. \"I came to see if you were alright. I know the bijuu wanted to be left alone, but you never know. I have figured out how to unseal a bijuu without killing the host, so if you had been sealed, I could have freed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bijuu stared at him for a second, before letting out what Naruto was a bellow of laughter. \"I am fine as you can see. No one has tried to seal me again. Although, I can tell by your eyes that that is not all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked back at the bijuu before letting out a sigh. \"Your right. That isn't all.\" He said as he unleashed the Eronomicon from its seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bijuu seemed to recoil. Wether it was in fear or revulsion, Naruto didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put that thing away!\" The bijuu cried, prompting Naruto to quickly seal it. It took the beetle a little bit before it was calm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry if I scared you or offended you Chomei.\" Naruto said to the beetle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bijuu shook its head. \"No. Forgive me. I was so startled by the feeling coming off of that thing that I lost my cool.\" Narutop nodded at the bijuu. \"Although, I can sense some similarities between your energy and that things energy. Might I know why? Also, I can't feel Kurama inside your being. I sense my fellow bijuu's chakra, but I do not sense the consious behind it. Tell me, what happened to the fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Naruto told a short version of the situation. He left out a few parts, such as the hypnotizing of Kurami and the fact that he used her chakra in such a way. Although, he did put emphisis on the fact that Kurami now had a body on the outside and couldn't be sealed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done, Naruto looked at the beetle bijuu to see how it would react. Chomei sat there for a little while, thinking it over. Could it have a life outside of being a target hunted down for future wars? It was a hope that all the bijuu wished for and clung to, but knew was always out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere came Naruto, the saviour of the bijuu, telling it that it could lead a life that wasn't one filled with being sealed and used for war. To be considered as something else then a mindless beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Naruto, The bijuu spoke one word. \"Come.\" It said as it began to make its way through the forest once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled on the inside. Maybe he had convinced Chomei to join him? But, did he make extra sure and bring something out of the Eronomicon?</span></div></div>",

It was just big enough for Chomei to be albe to move around as she laid down in a large pile of moss. Said Bijuu was settling down in its bed, looking at him with eyes that Naruto couldn't read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the beetle seemed to hum in thought. \"I see what you are offering me, young hero. But I do have some reservations about this. What will you do with me and my power when you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up at the Bijuu. \"I can tell you what I won't do. I won't abuse your trust, nor your power. What need would I have for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-like bijuu regarded the blond ninja. \"Very well. But there is something you should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow. \"And what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bijuu regarded Naruto in turn before it answered. \"Do you remember when Akatsuki was ripping the bijuu from their containers?\" It asked, getting a nod from Naruto. \"Well, I should tell you that some of us held on to our respective containers souls.\" The bijuu revealed, shocking Naruto. \"Myself included. I had grown attached to Fu during our time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought this over, before he asked a question. \"Are you asking me to return her to life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bijuu let out an equivilent of a sigh. \"If it were possible, I would ask. But even I know that it is impossible. She will be a part of me at best, destroyed by my youkai at worst. I ony wish she could have a chance at her llife.\" The bug said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought about it. Would the soul transferal seal and ritual work for Fu? He didn't know, but it wouldn't hurt to try. \"Chomei, I think I might know of a way to bring Fu back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beetle scoffed at this. \"If you did that, I would willingly join you with no complaints.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid the soul transferal seal and ritual work?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto unsealed a bunch of ink and a brush, unsealing the Eronomicon which caused Chomei to flich slightly. Naruto opened the pages to the soul tansferal seal. He hoped that he would be able to draw Fu's soul from the Bijuu and into a mannequin that the book had said would be good for women who died too young and had their bodies destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he drew the seal on the mannequin. He wanted to make sure he got it right. Once that was done, he made a second seal on another mannequin for Chomei. He figured that he would draw her entire body, chakra and all, into the human body. He absently wondered what she would look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the large beetle, he asked a question that could have meant life or death for Fu. \"Chomei. Would you mind if I went into your mindscape? I have a feeling that Fu might be in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bijuu thought of it, before nodding in ascent. Naruto sat infront of the beetle as he began to meditate, drawing upon the natural energies to connect with the earth-oriented Bijuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Inside Chomei's mind~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his eyes to see that it was broad daylight. He looked around to find himself in a bonifide jungle, with trees taller the the ones in Konoha. Vines hung down. He was surprised he could even see the sun, the tree tops were so thick. The hum of bugs filled the air, letting Naruto know that he wasn't alone. Chomei was watching him, even if she wasn't able to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood up, looking for a path. Just as that thought entered his mind, the path infront of him opened up, a glowwing trail of lightning bugs shwoing him the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed the trail for a good eleven minutes, before he heard the sound of a girl crying out in pain. Running towards the sound of the screams, he found who he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFu, the previous Jinchuriki of Chomei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched as the youkai flowed into her, either turning her into a part of Chomei or destroying her very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't have time to admire her, as he drew the seals on her, using his chakra. Since it was someones mind, it was easy to use actual chakra to make seals and apply them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a good fourty minutes, due to the fact she was thrashing about in pain. But, due to his dillagence, he finished. He smiled at the girl, even though he didn't think she saw him. \"Don't worry, it will be over soon.\" He said, fading from the Bijuu's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Outside~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his eyes to see that Chomei was watching him with its bug eyes. \"It's done. She has the seals on her.\" Chomei nodded at this. \"Now, I need you to focus on her chakra. I want you to pull that out, and draw it into the mannequin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomei nodded again. Being a being made of pure chakra, it was a master of chakra manipulation. So, it was childs play for it to do as Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomei began to glow blue as it flared Fu's chakra, guiding it ino one of the knew vessals for them. The Mannequin started to change. Hair grew, mint gree. The would be skin actually transformed into skin, the insides replecating a human body perfectly. Eye's formed in the spot they were made for, turning a perfect orange as they gained life. The skin tanned, in accordence with the soul that was being placed within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transfer completed, the last of the human chakra flowwing into the new Fu. She gasped as she took her first breath in a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, noticing Naruto and Chomei. Fu instictually moved back, not quite understanding what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked kindly at the girl. He created a shadow clone to explain things to her and calm her down. He turned back to Chomei as he gestured to the other mannequin. Chomei nodded silently, pushing her entire being into the new vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the old body of Chomei vanished, drawn into the new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at the new Chomei. The former 'it' was now definatly a she, due to the rack on her. Her hair was green, like Fu's, but it was more of a jungle green then a mint color. When she opened her eyes, she had pure blue eyes, making Naruto's pale in comparisine. He body also tanned, obviously slightly copying Fu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at the new Chomei. \"Are you feeling well?\" He asked. The bijuu didn't answer, looking at her new hands and the rest of her body. She tried to move her legs, only to make them slightly twitch. It seemed that she would have the same problems as Kurami.</span></div></div>",

Shukaku represents insanity and bloodlust, even though that has been magnified ten times over with the ways it was sealed. The nibi, however, represents lust. While each of us, barring Shukaku, have tried to rise over our primal states of being and try to be civil. However, it seems that Matabi sensed your book there, and the changes it has wrought on your aura. It seems to have driven Matabi back to the primal phase, seeking lust. Because of Matabi's negative feeling, it mostly appears as a female and is drawn to men who can't keep it in their pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded as Matabi started to lick at his crotch.

He drew the seal on Matabi, having a hard time as she writhed in pleasure under the touch of the brush and his shadow clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Naruto thirty minutes, but he finished.

He felt warm, but not uncomfertably so. He looked around, to see that the house was furnished with various furniture made of different colored flames. The chair was made of brown flames, which Naruto had never seen. The bed, red fire sheets with blazing white for the matress. There were curtains, made from the black flames of amaturasu. There was also a fire place made from grey flames. In it, was a small green flame, crackling with the house around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked around, hoping to find someone in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at the bed, this time noticing that there were two people there. Both were female, that much he could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was standing tall beside the bed. She had cat ears, blue and flickerd like firwe. The rest of her skin, which was unclothed, was peach colored and smooth. It reflected all the light off of it, all of it. From the white flames, to the black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure in the bed, however, was what drew Naruto's attention. He assumed that it was Yugito. She was under the blankets, naked as far as he could tell. Her blond hair was sprawled around her, as sweat poured off her face. She didn't look like she was going to last for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood up, drawing the attention of the cat girl. \"Oh. Hello Naruto-san. It seems that you have met my primal side.\" She said, not asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think she...you felt the change in my aura. For what it is worth, I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi shook her head. \"No. It is quite alright. You didn't know this would happen.\" She said, placing a cloth, the one thing that wasn't made of firwe, to Yugito's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't look well.\" Naruto said, walking up to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi shook her head again. \"No. I know she will not last much longer. My youkai is attacking her, seeking to burn her from my body. I can do nothing to stop it. This house is the safest place for her, despite its nature.\" She said, dabbing at Yugito's head again, wiping sweat up from her brow. \"Soon thoug, her soul will burn up, fueling my fire for eternity.\" Matabi did not sound like she wanted that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at her. \"How long do you think she'll last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi looked at him, her yellow eyes looking up at him with resignation. \"I would give her about four more days at best. Tomorrow at worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed. He had found her just in time. \"Well, if it will hep, I think I can pull her out of here. Give her a new body and another life. Same with you, if you want. That way you will never have to be worried about being sealed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi looked at him, eyes half lidded. \"If you could do so, I would be very greatful. I know what my primal side wants to give you, and if you want that, I would be more then happy to give it to you. Just as long as you can sace Yugito.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at her. \"I want you to know, Matabi, that I want you, not your primal side. I want you, the bijuu that is in control of her life. Not some wild sex kitten. I want some one who wants to talk and be around me, not someone who is only after my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi nodded. She knew he would say that. He was as he was when she met him. But he was more mature it seemed. \"Veery well. If you save Yugito, I am sure she would agree to join you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded at her. \"Good. Now, for this to work, I need you to keep as much sweat as you can from touching the seal I am about to draw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi nodded, and pulled back the covers, showing that she was indeed naked. Getting his game face on, Naruto set to work on drawing the seals, Matabi faithfully wipping Yugito's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Fourty Minutes later, Out side the mindscape~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his eyes to see that the primal Matabi had started to grab his clones crotches when ever she could. Naruto unsealed two more mannequins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matabi, can you here me?\" He asked the strange primal Matabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi looked up at him, her eyes glazed over. \"Naruto... Save... Yugito....Seal...Soul...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matqabi, I need you to listen. I can't save Yugito if you don't listen. I need you to draw her chakra out of yourself and into one of the mannequins on the ground. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrimal Matabi nodded, and with great effort, she started to glow blue, showing that she was pressing the human chakra from her systems, and with it, Yugito's soul. It flowed into one of the Mannequins, taking on her appearence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Naruto get to do that to Matabi, or did she break free and jump his bones</span></div></div>",

They both moved their arms, looking at them, feeling the suns rays beaming down upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito had several thought running through her head. 'Am I dead? Did Matabi's flames consume me? Was it all... just a dream?' She mentally asked, recalling something of a house of fire and being bed ridden. She felt hot, burning even. Like she was turning to ash. But not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to sit up, but found her muscles were not responding as they should have. She was a trained kunoichi dammit! Why didn't her body respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she tried to use her arms as leverage to push herself up. Tried being the key word. For some reason her arms were weak. What had happened to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito felt arms around her, Pulling her up. She looked up to see the face of a smiling blond with three whisker marks on each cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito wanted to move away from the blond, but she just couldn't. Her body was too weak. So, she decided to ask a question. \"Who are you?\" Just the action of talking took a lot of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at her, seeing how weak she was. \"Name's Naruto. Naruto Uzumaki.\" He said, holding her up by her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito scrunched her face up. \"I think... I think... I've heard that name.\" She said. \"But, I think it was from someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gestured to the form of Matabi in her human body. \"I think that may have been Matabi. You were bound to her for a few years after all.\" He said, making her look up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few years? The last thing I remember was a searing pain in my stomach, and then nothing. I did have a strange dream though. I was in a house of fire.\" She said. \" I felt like... I was burning. Everything. My body... my chakra... my soul.\" Her eyes ganed a haunted look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hugged her as much as he could, considering she was naked. \"It's alright now. The nightmare is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito felt herself relax, but wasn't enitrly sure why. She subconciously felt like she owed him everything. Yugito's eyes widened however, as she remembered the people that were hunting her. \"Akatsuki! What happened to them?\" She asked, fearing that they were still hunting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head. \"Don't worry. They've been gone for two years, They won't be hunting us jinchuriki again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito looked up at him, confused. \"Two...years? That can't be possible. I was fighting two of their members just a feww days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head. He looked over to Matabi, who was getting help from a shadow clone to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortuanly kitten, it's true.\" Matabi said, making Yugito look at her. Her eyes widened after seeing the human Matabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mata...bi?\" Yugito asked, wondering if she could trust her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi nodded. \"Yes. It's me Kitten. You never saw me as a human, which I have done before, have you?\" She asked, making Yugito shake her head. \"Well, surprise. But, You should know. You owe your very life to Naruto. As do we Bijuu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito looked at Matabi, shock on her face. She pushed herself away from Naruto, adreniline coursing through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once she was free for Naruto's grasp, she felt her legs give out from beneath her. She would have fallen on her face and hussibly broken her nose, had Naruto not grabbed her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi, the same adreniline coursing through her, but more in Worry for Yugito, clawwed at the shadow clones hands, making it poof out of existance. Matabi was able to walk a few steps, closing a gap between her and Naruto, before she stumbled, Making Naruto catch her as well, one girl being held with one arm.</span></div></div>",

It seemed that Naruto had flung it off in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them had been talking about this for a few days when he wasn't around. Chomei had explained what she could about Naruto to both of the human girls, stating that he was the reason that the Bijuu were still around at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were surprised at that. He nearly sacrificed himself to give the Bijuu a chance to be themselves, and not a puppet beast that was used as a madman's toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomei also told all three of the girls about how he had given her the choice to join him, after he explained what it would mean.

It was just off hand, but Matabi agreed whole heartedly. It seemed that he would do that, even without the sage's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, all for of them were in his room, sneaking into his bed and cuddling with him as much as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomei and Matabi took his sides, wrapping themselves around an arm and pulling it between their chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito and Fu laid atop their respective Bijuu, half of each laying on Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bijuu didn't mind.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took the group a good month to make it back to the borders of the Land of Fire. Naruto had opted out of going to any of the major, or at least well known, villages on the way. If he absoulutely had to, he sent a shadow clone under a henge to a village to get supplies. He really didn't want any questions about the reason he had a quartet of naked women following him around, or questioning why he would buy woman's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was well known, as one of the most prominent hero's of the fourth shinobi war. He hated the hero worship though. He really couldn't have left the village and gone to any other civilized place without someone recognizing him and making a big fuss about it. It was so hard to relax after that, seeing as he would have to skip town to avoid the crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that in mind, the group of five made their way through the wilderness. They all agreed that it would be best. Besides, all of them enjoyed the splendour of nature, Naruto and the bijuu especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the time, the woman had started to regain control over their chakra. The Bijuu had a far easier time, considering that they had more practice in controling the energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomei had started trying to form her wings out of her youkai. She had said that she liked being able to fly when she was still a giant demonic beatle. She hadn't wanted to lose that ability. Though, she was having a slightly harder time then she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi had started trying to give herself the features of a cat. Her body, while toned and with a slight tan, though no where near as tanned as Fu or Chomei's, did not fit her standerds. She felt strangely helpless without her ears or tail. So far, she had started working on the tail, which was so far just a bob tail. It was a firey blue though, like her normal flames and hair. It was taking longer then she would have liked though, to get it down just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito and Fu busied themselves with relearning basic chakra control through various means. Tree walking, water walking, controling how much they would send to their muscles and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, now that the women had confessed to Naruto about what they felt, they all slept in the same bed, in the same position that Naruto had found them in the first night. Besides, they weren't going to make a fuss about him seeing them naked. He had seen them like that constantly for a good month and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were a little more bold around him, despite only Matabi actually trying to seduce him outright. Though, when Naruto was either off hunting for food or sleeping, Matabi did give the girls who had little experience on matters of sex, A.K.A. the other three in the group, her own version of sex ed. This led to many blushes and some wickedly perverted dreams by the two humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after so long, Naruto and his entourage were standing over the village, on one of the few mountains in the area that wasn't the hokage monument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, welcome to your new home.\" Naruto said, his enlongated canine teeth bared in a wide grin. Kurami's chakra had started to intergrate into him even more. He had gotten even better control over it during his time with the two Bijuu. They had given him tips on how youkai was different from regular chakra, and better way's to control it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. A real bed.\" Yugito said with a releived sigh. \"No offense, but having my own bed will be better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, does my little kitten not like sleeping with our foxy boy?\" Matabi teased, poking Yugito's cheeck with a cheshire grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito blushed lightly. \"It's not that. Though his is comfy, you are not fun to sleep on. Your claws keep poking my sides a little to sharply for my tastes. That, and you're kinda lumpy to sleep on.\" Yugito said, vein popping in her head at Matabi's poking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that back! You're just jelous that I have bigger breasts!\" Matabi said, before she made to attack Yugito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bring it on! You want a piece of me kitty? How about I kick your tail so hard that it disappears? Would you like that?\" Yugito said, taking on a brawler stance. She wasn't confident in fighting in some of her old taijutsu styles. Not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two, knock it off. You can fight as much as you want later. Right now, I want to see how much has changed in three short monthes. And I think Kurami might be a little more then happy to see me.\" Naruto said, making the two stop immeadietly. They really did not want to get on his bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Naruto and the girls were making their way over the large wall, keeping look out for any males. Though, it seemed they were lucky, because they only saw female kunoichi gaurding the gate walls. They gave a quick wave to Naruto, though they stayed silent. Their ears were hidden under their various head gear pieces. Those who didn't normally wear head gear had taken to wearing bandana's it seemed. There was no hiding the whisker marks though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them seemed to want to call out to him, but Naruto only put a finger to his lips , making them go silent. They guessed that he wanted it to be a surprise for mistress Kurami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, girls in tow, walked through the village. Though, he had motioned over a random kunoichi and told her to take the four women to get clothes and washed up in the hot springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kunoich smiled and nodded, happy to do something for her master. She motioned for them to follow, which they did so happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Chomei did look back at Naruto, wondering what was going on with the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk later, alright?\" He said, quickly running to the appartment that he knew Kurami would be at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, he noticed how he didn't see any men in the village. In fact, he saw more women, though without the fox ears, whiskers or that. Though they did smile and bow at him, more then a few giggling and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto put it off for now though, seeing as how he was close to the appartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hopped up into the tree that was, convineantly placed outside the window into his appartment kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked inside, seeing Kurami sitting at the table, ayame sitting next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss Naru-koi.\" He could hear Kurami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame put a hand on her shoulder. \"Me too Mistress. But, you know he won't be back for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami sighed. \"I know. But still. Now I'm thinking I should have gone with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame rubbed her mistress' back. \"I know you do. But it's better you stayed. Beside's, don't you remember that gift you had planned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that it wouldn't have happened without you here to do it. You kept us going when we needed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, think of how master would feel about you being so sad. He wouldn't want that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami sighed. \"I know. But still. It hurts, to know he's so far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, hearing enough, silently slipped into his window and shut it behind him. Seeing that the girls were facing away from him, he didn't have much trouble doing so without them noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto creapt up behind the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping his arms around the two, causing them to freeze up, he let out a loud cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami and Ayame both tensed, before it registered in their minds who the voice belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naru-koi/Master!\" They cried, before turning to him and returning the hug full force as best the could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hugged them hard, pulling them close to him, their breasts squishing against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We missed you!\" Kurami said, nuzzling into the crook of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you both too.\" He said, before he pushed both back gently. \"Now, what's this about a gift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami smiled at him. \"You heard about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, a grin plastered on his face. \"Yeah. So, c'mon. Tell me.\" He said, his grin turning a little feral looking with his fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami got a grin not unlike his. \"Well, I kinda...</span></div></div>",

Kinda hard not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami's grin widend to Matabi levels. \"Well, there is a reason for that. Do you remember that seal you found in the book while I was still learning to walk?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the one that said that it would replace any male with a female opposite? One from another universe entirely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami nodded. \"Yeah, that one. Well, after you left, I needed something to do. I looked at the seal that you copied out of the book. I remember you telling me what it did. Um... I can't remember exactly what it said. Mind breaking out the book?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, before he unsealed the book from his pocket. He set it down on the table, opening it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the master's want, the book flipped through the pages, coming to a rest on the desired page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here.\" Naruto said as he began to read. \"The seal of universal displacement. This seal will, when applied to a male in any form, replace him with a female version of himself. This woman is in no way a gender bend. She was never male, and no memories of being male will merge with her. She is, was, and will always be female. It is unknown what happens to the male, though it is most likely that he switches places with the female. Also, intergrated into the seal is a deaging seal that activates if the female counterpart is over a certain age when she is brought over. The woman will be de-aged until she is around twenty one if she is over that age limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami nodded. \"Yeah. That one. Well, since you were gone, I had some of the best female caligraphers in the village start on making the seal around the enitre village and some of the surrounding land. I talked with Tsunade about a plan in case anyone questioned it. She just said that it was increased protection incase of natural disaster's or some such. And, like sheep, the men bought it. Some of them even helped speed it up. It got finished up about a month ago. I, along with some of the more gifted women in the village, poured chakra into it. It took a good day, during which Tsunade had the village on lock down. Thankfully, none of the ninja or the merchants were gone from the village. So we got them all. Now, only those from outside the leaf village will notice anything wrong about the fact that there are only women.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat back, eyes widened. Had she really done it? It certainly seemed so. He hadn't seen any males around the town, something that was hard to miss in the hidden leaf village. The male population was a good fifty five percent of the village population in its entirety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was a big increase in the female population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I ever sid how much I love you?\" Naruto asked, kissing the humanoid fox demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many, many times.\" She said, breathing heavily. \"Though we haven't shown it much. Once or twice, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Naruto said, pulling his face away her neck. \"I'm going to have to change that, won't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, he scooped Kurami up into his arms, and shunshinned into his room. He threw his vixen onto the bed, glad that she was naked. If she had any clothes she liked on, he would be buying her a new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw off his clothes as fast as he could, ready for the main event.</span></div></div>",

They had too many important things that needed to be done, and when they weren't training her body and getting her used to living like a ninja, they were planning what to do. Naruto had talked about going around the world, gathering the Bijuu and possibly some women, though he had been up in the air about that until after the Enslavement cloud incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body had pent up desire for three months, and she would get her fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, my master. I have waited so long for this.\" She said breathily, sitting up on the bed as she spread her legs. \"Can't you see? Your vixen's pussy is wet for you already.\" She told him, fingers tracing around her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Kurami.\" Naruto said as he tore at his pants. \"Don't worry, I'll help you through that feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami chuckled. \"I see that you are ready as well. It must have been hard, travelling without any release for so long.\" She said throatily, teasing him for a harder fucking. She needed it badly, and only when she couldn't walk straight again would she be satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no Idea.\" He said as he tossed his boxers to the side. \"But enough about that. We got some catching up to do.\" He said, grinning at the fox-demoness, his cock already fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we do.\" She said, eyeing him up and down. \"Come here big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasted no time, getting on the bed quickly and moving to Kurami. He captured her lips in a searing kiss, grasping her arms and pulling her on top of him as he rolled over onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami reached back behind her, grabbing her masters meat, lining it up with her needy cunt, her juices already trickling down her thighs. She pulled back from Naruto, grinning at him as she plunged her hips downward, taking his entire rod in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a loud moan, arching her back. \"It's been too long.\" She said, her hips moving on their own. \"Fuck me master! Take your nine-tailed Vixen! Show her why you are king!\" She shouted, not needing to worry about anybody hearing since it wouldn't matter if they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned as he felt Kurami's lower lips engulf him, still tight as if she were a virgin. He bucked his hips up into her, making sure to grab onto her bouncing chest as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a good rhythm going, Naruto continued to buck up into Kurami's tight snatch. Her moans, jarred slightly by the force he gave his thrusts, even in the position he was in, only spurred him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of her breasts, Naruto grabbed Kurami's arms, flipping her over so he was on top, thrusting down into her. It was more pleasurable for both of them, and Naruto was able to pound her pussy harder and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered his head, giving Kurami a kiss as he continued to slam balls-deep into her, making her moan into his mouth. He moved his face down, giving her breasts more attention then he could with his hands, licking around her areola and leaving bite marks around the soft, pillow mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes master! Just like that! Don't stop please!\" She begged, her fingers entangled in his hair, her pussy tightening around him as the pleasure built. 'I'm...I'm....\" She tried to say, only to moan as she came, squirting her juices onto the bed, clamping her love hole around Naruto tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt the pressure build up in his loins as his vixen lover came, clamping tight around him. Naruto continued to thrust into her, despite how tight it was making it even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a beastial grunt, Naruto poured more speed into his thrusts, making the bed slam up against the wall with great force as he fucked the demonic woman beneath him. He knew he wouldn't last much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an actual howl of pleasure, Naruto slammed himself into his lover, shooting his load right into her womb, making her cum again with a cry of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pulled out after a moment, his breath slightly short but not by much. He looked down at Kurami, who lay panting beneath him, a grin spreading across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I'm done, you have another thing coming.\" He said, flipping her over and lining up with her luscious rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami could only grin.

He had granted her wish and turned her legs to Jelly, and she had mumbled about being a little sore before drifting to sleep. For him, he was basking in the afterglow, happy that three months of blue balls was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto?\u201d He heard Matabi's voice call out, door opening. \u201cYou sure this is the right place Kitten?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm sure. That kunoichi who helped us did say he lived in this appartment.\u201d He heard Yugito say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe might be out around the village.\u201d Fu, the most reserved of the bunch said. \u201cCho-chan, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm... not sure.\u201d Chomei said. \u201cBut I find it odd that there isn't a single man in this town. And why are most of them wearing bandana's.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the whisker marks, Like Naruto.\u201d Yugito added. \u201cYeah, that is weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got up, stretching as he did so. He didn't bother putting any clothes on, since it wasn't anything they hadn't seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw them, and it was only fair that they saw him. Besides, how else were they supposed to bathe when they were weak. Naruto decided he might as well have done it at the same time. And the few times he had dreamt that Matabi was using him as a diagram to sexual lessons had kind of made him just not care much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, those were dreams, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girls.\u201d He greeted, walking out of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi wasted no time, cuddling right up to him and latching onto his arm. \u201cHello, Naruto.\u201d She said, almost purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing about the Two-Tailed Neko-mimi was that her primal state and her civilized state had sort of... merged. She was sensual almost all the time, flirting with him and often 'accidentally' ending up in positions that screamed 'Fuck me!' Though she was in complete control of herself and knew when to stop, and was still respectful of others. With Yugito, it was more of sisterly spats than anything else. Oh, and she grew almost completely attached to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that was a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Matabi.\u201d He said, rubbing the girl's head. \u201cHow'd shopping go? Find anything that you liked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we did. And I found a few things for us that you might like.\u201d She said, rubbing her head against his hand. \u201cThough, they had to make adjustments for us, as well as make stuff that will fit us. After that, we went to the hot spring and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto, why are there only women in the village?\u201d Chomei interrupted, making her Fellow Bijuu growl at her at the interruption. She was ignored though, as Chomei looked Naruto in the eyes with an unwavering stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would be answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scratched the back of his head. \u201cWell, you might want to sit down. It's quite the story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gently pushed Matabi off his arm, leading the four of them to his kitchen table. They sat down, Naruto unsealing the Eronomicon. The Bijuu didn't flinch, used to the perverse Aura it gave off and the changes it had worked on Naruto's chakra, both human and demonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is our sister?\u201d Chomei asked, glancing around to see if she could catch a glimpse of their far more powerful sister. \u201cI was told that she spent most of her time here when I asked about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned foxily, made more pronounced by his fox like teeth. \u201cShe's resting up. Had to give her a gift for being gone so long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not lost upon the women, who blushed lightly. Well, except for Matabi, who grinned like she just caught the canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, alright.\u201d Chomei said, though she did sound a little disappointed. \u201cAnyway, I suspect it has something to do with your book there, with all the things it can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Well, it started like this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went on to explain most of what he had left out, including the hypnotizing of Kurami and how he had called on the mass enslavement cloud. He explained the universal male displacement seal, and was about to explain what Kurami had done with it when Chomei had slammed her fist down on the table, making it shatter under her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastard.\u201d She said, voice barely above a whisper. Her jaw was set, and her eyes shone with betrayal and tears. \u201cYou said that you wouldn't abuse our power. And Yet, here you tell me that you enslaved Kurami, no, KURAMA, And used her power for your own benefit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others in the room had moved back when Chomei had destroyed the table. Naruto was looking at her with worry, and the other girls were looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChomei, it wasn't like that.\u201d He said, trying to calm her down slightly so he could explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe silent! You took our kin, and enslaved her. Just like That Bastard Uchiha clan did.\u201d She said, tears starting to fall. \u201cIt seems that you're no better then them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen chakra gathered around her body as she started shaking in anger. She felt betrayed, she felt sadness, and she felt ill. She had trusted Naruto, and he had lied to her in the most painful of ways. He had played on her wish to be free from the danger of being sealed and used for war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed that she was only sealed with another purpose, and a different, permanent container. She knew that when she agreed to join Naruto, that she would be doing things with him. But she didn't think that she would be used to help power his strange, perverted abilities that the book seemed to give him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto braced himself for a fight, sealing the Eronomicon again. He motioned for the other girls to get out of there, since Chomei was building up her power to full strength. He would have to go demon cloak to fight evenly against her.</span></div></div>",

She really didn't care either way, since Being around Naruto and his aura for so long had made her accepting of her primal side. \u201cDid you Enslave Kurami out of lust for our power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head. \u201cNo, not at all. You see, when I used that watch I told You about, Kurami was trying to kill me because of what happened to her to turn her into a woman. She was being really uncivil, and I thought that I could use the watch to try and make her act on friendly terms again.

He saved all of us, and he didn't mean for this to happen. I'm mostly to blame, and I know it. I was acting like a complete and utter bitch to him, when it wasn't his fault.\u201d She said, glaring into her sister's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, Chomei. He didn't want to use the watch, but I forced him to use it. I wouldn't have even spoken to him if he hadn't, and when he tried to talk to me, I tried to kill him for it. I tried to take over his body, and his only thoughts of using the watch was to try and get me to be friendly again. I took it further Chomei. Me. He promised to find me a body, and he did. Using that same book. And you know what it gave him, huh?\u201d She said, tears gathering in her eyes. \u201cIt gave him his mother's corpse to use for my body. His mother, the one I took from him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito looked to Naruto for confirmation. He nodded, though not with sadness or regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just... nodded. There was no feeling behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls eyes softened slightly at hearing this, and seeing his nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know how Guilty I've felt? I use his mother's skin, and he has to see it every time he see's me. He has to look at the form of a mother He'll never truly know. That he had to live without, because I killed her in a wild attempt for freedom, even when I knew I wasn't going to get out of it. The Shinigami had his hand on my soul, and I tried to weasel my way out of it. I took everything away from him, and yet he still loves me.\u201d She said, tears falling onto Chomei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurami...\u201d Naruto whispered. He moved around behind her, kneeling and wrapping her in a hug. He pulled her off Chomei, letting the Bijuu get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Chomei laid there, staring up at where her sister used to be. She heard the sounds of Kurami sobbing into Naruto's shoulder, but they were faint to her. She felt the tears that Kurami had shed on her face, as if they were her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she done? She had assumed that the man who had saved them, had defeated the Juubi and returned it to the earth from which it came, and had made sure that her and her fellow Bijuu were free from enslavement, was just as bad as the ones who had plagued them since the Sage's passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had assumed that he had turned on his look on life, and had betrayed them all. That he had enslaved Kurama... no, Kurami as she called herself now, which is something that he admitted to hating just as much, if not more, then they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt two hands pull her up on her feet, her skin healing from the cuts that she had gotten from the table's debris as the swelling on her face went down. She found herself looking into the orange orbs of her former container, who had a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou messed up, sister.\u201d Matabi said from her right side. Chomei looked at her, to see her scowling at her as well. \u201cYou know better then I that he wouldn't do that to us. You were always the best at reading people, better then Kokuo or Kurami. But it you always were the most rash when it came down to it as well. You never did listen to the full story, even when we were young. And yet, Kurami represents anger.\u201d She said, shaking her head with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChomei.\u201d Naruto said, drawing everyone's attention as Kurami sniffled in his shoulder still. \u201cI understand that it seemed bad at first, and I could have explained that better. But that didn't give you the right to do what you did. If you had waited a moment or two, I would have explained everything. If you had wanted, I would have let you walk free. I wouldn't have bothered you again if you asked, and I would have done so with a smile on my face. I don't want you to think that I own you or anything, since that isn't what I want. I just want the Bijuu to be freed from being sealed again, and this is the only way I knew of. I lied to you, yes, and I'm sorry for that. But It was that, or risk having you kill me before I did what I did for you to the other Bijuu. The same goes for the rest of you. If you want to go, then fine. Go.\u201d He said, before turning back to whisper reassurances to Kurami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugito walked from behind Chomei, putting her hand on Naruto's shoulder. \u201cI ain't going, that's for sure. If half of what Matabi's told me about you is true, then you're one of the best people I could be around. You never took advantage, and you never held it above our heads what you did for us. Unlike what almost any person would do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFu moved second, sitting next to them on her knee's,wrapping Naruto and Kurami in a hug from the side. \u201cI won't leave either. You were one of the only people to reach out to me, and we Jinchuuriki gotta stick together, even if we aren't containers anymore.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatabi walked over last. Hugging Kurami from behind, she looked at Chomei. \u201cWhat are you going to do sister? Stay or go? If you stay, you will have to get used to things like this. I can tell that Naruto's going to go far, and he will surpass our father no matter what. That is, if he hasn't already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomei stood there, trying to come to terms with what she had done, and what she was seeing. She saw Naruto, the savior of the Bijuu, twice over it seems, consoling the strongest of them all, both emotionally and physically. The one who she had brought to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Chomei felt tears flowing from her eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomei moved slowly, but resolutely. She knew what she would do...</span></div></div>",

Forgive my insolence.\u201d She said, letting her shoulder's shake as she started to break down as well. \u201cForgive me for my ungratefulness. I will take any punishment you wish to inflict upon me. Any at all. Reduce me to your plaything, if that is your wish. Strip me of my power and send me away, never to bother you again. I will do anything, anything at all. Just say the word, and I shall do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, even the other girls, looked at Chomei in shock. Matabi even more so. She knew very well what her seven tailed sister was like, representing pride, thinking she knew better then almost anyone, besides their father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for her to do this? Wow... Never in a million years did she think that Chomei would do something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now Chomei. You don't have to do anything like that. I'd be happy if-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will be his personal servant.\u201d Kurami suddenly said, pulling her head away to look directly at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurami, wha-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, Naruto-koi.\u201d She said, still looking at Chomei with a dead-stare. \u201cYou will be with him at all times, doing everything he tells you with no questions. You will guard him with your immortal life, and you will be his personal toy whenever he wants, however he wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurami-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will do all this until the day he dies, which I will not allow. Am I clear?\u201d She asked, ignoring Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery much, Kurami-sama.\u201d Chomei said, not even having to try swallowing her pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on a moment here!\u201d Naruto said. \u201cChomei, you don't have to do anything like that if you don't want. Kurami, what are you thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto, I know my sister better then you. If you let her get away with this, she would have taken advantage of this. She did the same thing with our father for a while, until he put his foot down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's right.\u201d Matabi spoke up, still looking at Chomei with a slightly stunned expression. \u201cShe had heard Father talking about some people in the west being problematic. So, thinking that it would be best to destroy them, she went and buried them and their civilization so far beneath the earth that they'll never be found. What she didn't know, was that Father was making very good head-way into peaceful negotiations, and the survivors of that civilization were none too happy. There was more then enough for several armies of able-bodied warriors outside their borders when Chomei arrived, and these armies tried to retaliate. Thankfully, Father was able to renegotiate peace with them. Chomei had said she was sorry, and father forgave her. But when word of a rouge group of those people attacked, Chomei went and finished them all off, even those innocent who were looking forward to peace. Women, children and men alike. All buried.\u201d Matabi said, her face turning grim as those memories resurfaced. \u201cFather was most displeased at that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto struggled on that for few moment's, as Fu looked at her Bijuu partner in a new light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond sighed. \u201cAlright. BUT, only under the stipulation that after I think she's done enough that I can release her. I'm thinking, two months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne years, six months.\u201d Kurami countered, making Naruto growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurami...\u201d Naruto warned. She was testing him and his moral boundaries right now. His own Red, demonic chakra was starting to flare up, his eye's beginning to bleed crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him, looking upset that she was displeasing him, but she knew it had to be done. \u201cNaruto-sama, I know that you don't like that, but please understand. This has to be done this way, or it will just happen again.\u201d She said. \u201cI know you could order me to change my mind, and I know I would do it in a heartbeat, but please. Let this happen this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed, letting the chakra fade away. He wasn't happy, but he would do it her way. \u201cFine, but only after a year. No more then that.\u201d He said, making sure that he was understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me.\u201d Kurami said. Her face was marked with tear trails, though she looked amazing with her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d Matabi said. \u201cNot to break up the moment or anything, but now that we're back in the leaf, I believe Naruto said that we could have our own activities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, Yeah. He did say that.\u201d Yugito said with a blush, though she wasn't going to deny her needs as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami grinned foxily. \u201cOh did he now? Well, he never breaks a promise. You're not going to start now, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed. He wanted to do something about this Chomei situation, but it seems his hands were tied. \u201cAlright. Let me rest for a bit and grab something to eat. I'm starving after our long session earlier Kurami.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid vixen just gave a dreamy laugh, the adrenaline from her attack on Chomei fading. She could now feel the soreness in her lower body, though she would be up for more if she really wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then. Let's go see Ayame and her Mother. I'm sure they'll be happy to see you.\u201d She said, before looking at Chomei, who still had her head bowed. \u201cChomei, why don't you go tell Tsunade that the village should be gathered tomorrow around noon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. What does this Tsunade look like?\u201d She asked, raising her head to show a tear-streaked face, though it was blank otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlond hair, blond fox ear's, big bust. Looks like she's seventeen. Don't know why she insists on looking younger then she really is now, at twenty years old. She'll be in the large tower in the middle of town. Top floor, big window. Tell her Mistress Kurami order's it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt shall be done.\u201d Chomei said, getting up to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you hurry back, you can eat with us and other... activities.\u201d Kurami said, slightly teasingly. \u201cActivities which may include eating of a different kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomei blushed slightly, but kept her demeanor. \u201cYes mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Chomei ran out of the apartment, using her demonic chakra to run faster then even a ninja could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurami watched her sister run from the window, before she turned to the others. \u201cShall we?\u201d</span></div></div>",

After he had a little 'session', He went back to the book. He opened the book to a random page, wondering what else the book contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page he opened up to however, had something other than a seal on it. It had a strange picture on it. It had the illustration of an eye on it. However, there was something that was strange about it. Instead of a normal eye, there was an eye that had the kanji for harem god as the pupil, and it glowed a sutble blue. Literally, it was actually glowing on the page. There were also sparks forming around the eye, shaping themselves into little circles before disappearing into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was entranced. He wondered what the book was showing him. Looking below, he noticed more writing. \"Here lay the eye of the harem god. With it, thou shalt see the way into the hearts of all women. And lo, thou shalt see the way to make them thine own. To thee, thou shalt be marked as a god amongst men, above the standing of the mortal coil. Pray, if thou doth desire the eyes of the harem god, then thou shalt have to freely give of thine life force. Then, thou shalt recive life force freely back, to which thee shalt become blessed with many bitches!\" He read. 'That's weird. That really turned around at the end. Oh well. By the looks of it, it should be a new bloodline. Cool!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasted no time in pouring as much chakra as he could into the book. He noticed the eye glow more and more, shining right into his own. He soon felt that he couldn't stop the draining of his chakra, and grew worried. The light from the eye was starting to hurt, and it was also blinding. After about ten minutes, he couldn't see anything, and he was feeling very tired. Very shortly however, he felt chakra entering him. It felt strange though. Normally his chakra was sharp like the wind, and just as incontrollable. Now, it felt like he was in perfect control of it, and there was at least 5 times the amount he put in. It also felt more commanding, like he could bring people to their knees with just a pulse of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused thoughts to pop into his head of women he had seen around the village, on their knees, begging to serve him. His eyes felt weird as well. He felt a slight burning, before that went away. The light from the book was starting to dimm, and he noticed, once he could see again, that it was entering his own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the light had stopped, having fully entered his eye, he noticed something strange. He could see in 180 degrees aound himself. He also noticed that he could see something outside his apartment. It was a pink female shape, walking by. He wondered what it was, and so he went to his door, and opened it. It was a random civilian woman he had seen walking around. He also noted something above her head.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n'Yamanaka Chizuru. Catch in act of mastubating. Offer to keep secret, if she does what you say. Be dominate.'</span></div></div>",

Claim debt, even if you have to force her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked inside. That was what he planned to do any way. \"It's time to pay up Tsunade.

However, this time, they kept going. As she lost each round afterwards, Naruto made a shadow clone write seals on her. Slave seals. Loyalty seals. Mind seals and so many more. Once the seals were done, Naruto made his shadow clones start to do more. He made them write things like 'Naruto's cum slut.' And 'the Hoe-kage' all over her. Once that was done, Naruto made his clones fondle her as he played the last hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was happening, Tsunade was starting to crack inside. The power that she had for the last five years was slipping away from her. All because she couldn't help but gamble. Once they started to apply the seals, it became harder and harder to curse her luck, Naruto, and kami. Although, once the seals were applied, and the clones started to fondle her, she almost broke.

She would now do what he said, when he said it with as much efficiency as possible. All with a smile on her face. If he asked her to kill someone, she would do so. Not that he was going to, mind you. It's just that he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at the thought, he made his way into the shop. He was quickly stopped by the fact that Ayame was just like she was in his dream. The only difference was that she was wearing a collar that said, in bold letter \"PROPERTY OF NARTUO UZUMAKI.\" She was wearing an aparon and the earrings as well, but nothing else. She had no bra, dress, panties, shoes, nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a pleasent suprise.\" He said with a pleased tone. After all, it wasn't every day that a girl claimed herself yours, now is it? Well, Tsunade had earlier, but she gambled away her freedom. It doesn't count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame looked up at him and smiled brightly. \"Naruto-sama! There you are! I thought you forgot about me.\" She said, ending with a mock pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled at her. \"Now you know I could never forget about my ramen girl. Come on, give me some sugar.\" He said as he patted his lap. Ayame giggled happily, as she sauntered over to him, going out the side door to come in the front. She sashayed over to him, giving him a slow twirl so as to give him a good look at her, before slowly sat down in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh master! Is that a kunai in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?\" She asked as she felt his erection push up against her ass. She moaned slightly as she felt it twitch, moving its way to her nethers for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, just happy to see you, thats all.\" He said as he began to fondle her through the apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned at his touch.

He was picking up more and more info on the women in the village, finding out how to make them his. Noticing how they would stop and stare at him as he passed, blushes adorning their faces, he noted how simple it was to make them his it would be. 'I need to go to another village soon. There are many women out there, just waiting for me.' He thought as he passed by the Yamanaka flower shop. Stopping, he spotted two women in there that caught his eye. Sakura, who was already his because of Tsunade gambling away her freedom, and Ino, a girl that wasn't under his charms. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in, he made a show of looking for flowers, noticing how they both watched him and were blushing harder then the women outside. Picking up the flowers he was smelling, which happened to be roses, he made his way up to the counter. \"Hey Sakura, Ino. Whats up?\" He asked, making sure to sound friendly. Both girls blushed harder, starting to fidget slightly under his lust aura that the Eronomicon was supplying him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going good Naruto-kun. Business is just a little slow lately.\" Ino said, her legs starting to rub together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well I hope it picks up soon. How much for the flowers?\" He asked, sounding like he actually cared about her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Naruto. That'll be 500 yen\" She said, ringing it up on the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, thats kinda a little much for roses, don't you think?\" He asked, making a show of taking out his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was starting to think a little lewdly,starting to think that she could lower the price if he helped... scratch an itch as it was. However, she managed to stay strong, although bearly. That all crumpled when Naruto gave her a rose from the bouquet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Fuck it!\" Ino said as she grabbed Naruto by the collar and smashed her lips against his. Naruto wasted no time and got right into the kiss, soon dominating her in a tounge war. Sakura looked on hungrily, wanting to be able to fuck her master. The power of the cards was absolute, so she knew Tsunade esentially gave her freedom to Naruto. She knew Naruto was now her master. And she wanted some of him now.</span></div></div>",

So what was it? \" now I'm not going to tell you\" <br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \"Well i'm off to the store, I was gonna do some baking for my mothers birthday tomorrow but I don't actually have any eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A light went on inside Naruto's head. <br>\r\n\"Well we're pretty close to my apartment\" Naruto said \"You could just borrow a couple\" <br>\r\n \"Would you mind?\" \"Well if i did, i wouldn't have suggested it.\" Sakura shrugged \"Good point.\" They took a few steps in the direction of his apartment before he suddenly stopped. <br>\r\n\"I think I dropped my money when I fell, he then made a show of looking around wildly. As soon as Sakura took her eyes of him and <br>\r\nlooked at the ground, he created a clone and replaced himself with the expected speed of a ninja of his caliber. Luckily Sakura didn't notice.<br>\r\n\"Oh wait the clone exclaimed suddenly. I still have it\"  he patted his pocket. \"Silly me.\" Sakura rolled her eyes again and they headed off. Naruto watched from his hiding spot, then shunshined back to his apartment, knowing he had about four minutes before Sakura and his clone made it there. He flipped through the book, looking for something helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour minutes later<br>\r\nAnd I tell the guy \"If your wife looks like that, I would have stayed with the fish!.\" The Naruto clone finished loudly then began to chuckle. Sakura smiled and shook her head. The clone closed the door behind them as they stepped inside. They walked over to the kitchen in the apartment. Sakura started to talk \"Thanks again for...for\" Her sentence trailed off as she caught sight of something that was on the table. It looked like a small gold coin with a purple pearl in it's center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was connected to a thin but surprisingly strong gold chain. It was called the amulet of twisted justification, and Naruto had used his<br>\r\ntime bring it out of the book, then placing a charm of want on it. When Sakura stopped to stare at it, Naruto swapped back with his clone. Naruto picked it up and held it on one finger. Sakura's eyes remained locked on it. \"You like this?\" \"yes\" came an immediate answer. \"Wanna try it on?\" \"Yes.\"<br>\r\nThis answer came faster. Naruto placed it around her neck. Her hand shot to it and she started rubbing her thumb on it. \"It feels nice\"<br>\r\nShe said. \"I could give it to you\" Naruto said acting as if it were unimportant. Sakura looked at Naruto as if he had said <br>\r\nshe was going to be made queen of the world. \"Thank you\" She threw her arms around Naruto saying \"thank you\" a few more times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. Sakura couldn't see that. \"Well I can't just give it to you.\" He scratched the back of his head. Sakura's head shot up and<br>\r\nher eyes looked like they were about to start watering. \"What,\" She sounded betrayed \"You said that...\" \"You can have it you just need to do<br>\r\nsomething for me.\" Naruto interrupted her with. \"Sakura blinked a couple of times which got rid of the few tears she had. \"Ok, what? anything\" She pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave her his most disarming smile. And then he took her hand and placed it on his groin. \"Just a little attention from your mouth\" <br>\r\nAnger welled up inside the pink haired girl. How dare he? Just because he gave her this incredible necklace. This unique, beautiful necklace, he<br>\r\nthought he should get something like that? Well, the necklace was amazing. Maybe it wouldn't hurt to. And he was such a great guy. Had Sakura had more time to think she might have noticed how quickly and just how much her mind had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little hesitation Sakura dropped to her knees. She took her eyes off Naruto's and instead look at where her hand was, Of course the blonde had removed his hand from hers.<br>\r\nShe lowered his Zipper than reached in to release his dick from it's confines. It grew hard in her hand. As a medic it wasn't the first one she'd ever seen but, it was the first in this capacity. It was also a little bigger than she was used to seeing. She blushed then licked his head experimentally. Naruto exhaled in pleasure. She did this a few more times before eventually putting her entire mouth around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde was lost in how incredible it felt. She wasn't the best at it, but he chalked that up to inexperience. After a short time<br>\r\nhe let out a low groan, Sakura's only warning that he was about to cum. Her eyes widened as she felt it enter her mouth, warm and kind of salty.<br>\r\nTo her credit she took it all in, but as soon as it was done she stood up and spit it into the sink, turning the water on as she did. Naruto was slightly disappointed. She awkwardly started walking towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for the necklace.\" And with that Sakura left, eggs forgotten. Naruto zipped up his pants and smiled. This book was amazing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But just incase she's not quite so willing to be his lover tonight.\" Smirking once more she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wondered how to kill a good 8 hours. \"Well..... I could.... OH - I COULD VISIT TENTEN! I never get to visit her.\" And with that - he went off to the weapons shop - Tenten's job and home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tsunade decided to head to the Hyuga compound to fetch Hinata. Contrary to her lie, Hiashi was in a good mood. \"Hiashi - I need Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Tsunade told him of the events of the past few hours. \"Oh, well then take her.\" Tsunade was skeptical of his enthusiasm. \"Naruto would be good for her. With all he's accomplished, he'd be the perfect suitor.\" Tsunade didn't have time to question him. She had to \"prep\" her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was in her room, playing with something. The moment Tsunade opened the door,she quickly hid it, blushing a deep red. \"L--Lady Tsunade?\"\" She asked, caught off guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade decided to see what she was hiding. she pulled out 2 things from her covers: the 1st came as no surprise - a Naruto plushie. After Naruto defeated Sasuke, Madara, and Kabuto some stores sold merchandise biased on the blonde hero. He never really approved of it, but it made people happy to have one. Naruto never accepted a single penny, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second item, however, was a porn magazine. The magazine had (frighteningly accurate) drawings of Naruto having many forms for sex with a generic, faceless women - obvious the reader is supposed to imagine who the women is. It was an underground magazine that most people never knew about - not even Tsunade. \"Looks like you're not so Innocent...\" Tsunade said jokingly. Hinata just hid under her blankets. \"It's ok, Hinata. You're 21, you have desires for a famous man. But rather than masterbaiting to images... wouldn't you rather have sex with the real one?\" Hinata looked up, and turned the deepest shade of red that a human could get to be before dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R------R----Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow me\" She said, leading her to Naruto's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- as for Naruto -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was having fun at Tenten's. (Not THAT kind of fun - that's for later) He never thought weapons could be that interesting. \"I've never met a man with any interests in weapons, before.\" Tenten said, happily. The two never really get a chance to talk. Naruto is usually on missions, and when she's nearby, it's with Lee, who ALWAYS challenges Naruto then and there. Naruto felt kind of rude for never getting to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- back to Tsunade - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hokage and the Huyga girl both entered Naruto's house, which was unlocked. Tsunade decided to explain the situation to Hinata. \"W-Why would you bet me?\" Hinata asked, a bit angry at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you 2 to end up together. With what he's expecting, he couldn't say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-He doesn't know it's me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade, I.... I don't know if I can..... satisfy him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help\" said a dark voice. The two girls turned to a table that had a book on it. Normally, they'd be freaked out, but the book seemed to be messing with their minds - this seemed normal. \"So, ladies, I can help you please my master.\" the two seemed to be in a trance. Their eyes have glazed over, show their now brainless state. The book then made 2 things appear. One was a bigger, altered version of Hinata's porn magazine. The images of Naruto were precise, and the random women was now Hinata. \"Study this, Hinata.\" The book said. She picked it up, and went to Naruto's room. Tsunade's little present was a sexy maid outfit. \"You will clean my master, and his house, at his own will. Now get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, must please Master Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Back to Naruto; remember him? -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was following Tenten up to her room, she claimed to have something to show him. Her room wasn't girly; it was pink, but not girly. Naruto saw a Naruto-Plushie similar to the one Hinata had, though this one was piratically in pieces, which scared Naruto. \"Naruto, I d-didn't do that. Neji got it mixed with my training dummies when I was testing out some bombs, I swear!\" Naruto merely smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it'd be something like that. What did you want to shot me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....Um... No.. Nothing, I just wanted to show you my room....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um.. Ok. Naruto looked at the clock - 10:15pm \"I have to head home - I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten frowned after he left. She'd ask him out, if not for Hinata being her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto got home, he was surprised to see Tsunade dressed as she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello, master.\" She said, as she walked over to him in her sexual cleaning outfit. \"What would you like? Would you like some fresh milk? Or would you rather suck on some marshmallows?\" She said, fondling her HUGE breasts the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWOW!!! That was long. For the sake of hose who want to work off of this, what does Naruto do?</span></div></div>",

Then she noticed he was able to see her, and started making a fuss over that. She then told him that his family was in danger, and that he better not get in her way. After he had called her out on that, she bound him with some kind of energy that formed into ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when they heard the sound of a large crash, and Ichigo heard his little sister Yuzu cry out for him, he broke the energy ropes and ran to help her. Soon after, he saw what the strange girl was talking about. A large creature that was entirely black save for the white bone mask with an extremly large mouth and teeth. Grabbing a nearby chair, he attempted to get the thing holding his little sister to let her go. He was effortlessy swatted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was any constellation, so did the girl who said she was trained to kill these things. And they managed to make it let go of Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it turned on them. Oh, and he had to stab himself to get the power to kill it before it ate anyones soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. He could deal with seeing ghosts around town. They were peaceful and nice. Courteous too. But the thing infront of him had tried to eat his sister. No way in hell he would let it go without kicking its ass so hard that it would be half the size it was now. So yeah, he could deal with stabbing himself if it let him kill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after that rush, where he killed the thing relativly easily, he had promptly passed out. Waking up, he found that no one knew what had happened save for himself. His sister, and everyone on the block, thought that a drunk delivery man had driven into the side of the house because of the large hole what was lined up with the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, he went to school, not expecting to see the girl from last night ever again. But, lo and behold, because said girl was apparently a new student in his class. She had also threatend him with death if he told anyone what had happened, or if he even made any notion of knowing her. So, he didn't make it a big deal. That is, until she dragged him up to the roof and started telling him about how he now needed to fight off those things, like what he fought and killed last night, in her stead, because he apparently drained all her power. He also noted that she sucked at drawing when she tried to draw a diagram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he had to get knocked out of his body to become a 'Shinigami' as the girl called herself, and the others like her, so that he could fight the hollow that she knew was near. Well, she didn't know it was near, but she apparently had a phone that would let her know when one was close. So, hiding Ichigo's body, she had followed him away from school to direct him to the hollow. Once there, he kicked its ass and saved the kid it was trying to eat. Then, he had had to preform a konso on the kid to send his spirit off to the other side where it would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day or so afterwards, his crush Orihime had nearly been ran over, but was saved by a mysterious force. It turned out to be her dead brother Sora, as one last act as her brother before he hollowed and tried to kill her. After defeating him, and saving Orihime and Tatsuki, another one of his childhood friends, he had a day or so to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and the girl, who introduced herself as Rukia, moved into his closet. Yeah, that was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he had this strange book that he felt the need to keep close. It had appeared by</span></div></div>",

Even more so, it was strangely female. It also didn't use brute force like the other hollows he had encountered so far. No, what it did was much worse. It tried to fucking seduce him! It had gotten him half undressed before he even knew what it was trying to do. It made him feel... dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moans it made when he attacked it or it was near him didn't help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a hard time defeating it, as it kept dance away from his attacks and toying with him. It was fast and flexible, being able to bend around his sword at angles and in ways that shouldn't have even been possible. It couldn't hit very hard though. Atleast, he didn't think it could, as it kept trying to grope him when ever it could. And, despite other hollows clearly being aggresive, this one seemed to be lonely and just wanted someone to be around it. It obviously didn't want to die though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask it had didn't help much either. Instead of just a bone mask that was terrifying, it had bone mask that looked vaugly human. It didn't sit right with Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow he defeated it, he didn't like. As he tried to hit it, it had dissapeared, only to reappear behind him. He turned around on instinct, and had somehow managed to slap the things ass with the flat of his blade. It seemed to like it, because it started to let him hit it, as long as it wasn't a killing blow or one that took off limbs. However, this soon backfired on it as it seemed to not care about anything after awhile, so absorbed in the pleasure it seemed to get from the whole situation. After that, Ichigo slashed off the human-like mask, not caring anymore. He needed some mind soap desperatly. However, before he left, he noticed the hollow seemed to blow him a kiss as it disintigrated. It also left a book behind, which was odd. Hollows never left anything behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now here he was, with a book that he seemed to be drawn to with no possible explination, as he had to fight supernatural forces as a death god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't his life be normal?</span></div></div>",

He forgot one importent thing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hide the Eronomicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when Rukia came out of his closet to ask him something, she instantly felt like she was being assualted by the perverse feeling rolling off of it in waves. Not knowing what it was, just that it didn't bode well for any female who existed, she quickly tried to destroy it. She cast an extreamly low powered <b>Shakkaho</b> in this attempt, not wanting to burn Ichigo's house down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when the crimson ball of energy neared the book, it was absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eronomicon retaliated. In an effort to save itself for the marked one, it quickly gathered up all the perverted and lust filled energy that it had collected over the millenia scine it had last used the first defense mechanisim. It then lauched a beam of energy at the attacker, Rukia, and had it strike her in the heart. This caused the shinigami to fall over as the energy coursed through her. However, the Eronomicon had to 'shut daown' as it were. It seemed to fume at this, knowing that it wouldn't be able to compel the marked one to use it. However, it took great joy in making the one who attacked it become the epitome of pervertedness for its master. But, alas, it knew this would only last for a week as it drew the energies from the girl and the ambient lust of the universe it currently resided in until it had stored up enough energy again to either compel the master into using it, or to defend itself once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukia, meanwhile, was writhing on the floor as the energy shot from the book coursed across her entire being. The energy melded with her, changing her. She fought, but couldn't handle the feeling she was reciving from it. She felt, not pain, but lust. Lust and a deep desire for the one who had been marked by the book. She soon succumbed to the feeling as her rational mind took back seat, falling into a deep sleep as the energy took over, creating a new personality for her for one week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the energy finished the job it was made to do, the new Rukia sat up, feeling very hot under the collar for one man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ichigo...\"</i></span></div></div>",

No way the girl he had spent the last few days with would do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, he thought 'Might as well enjoy it. After all, how often does someone have a dream like this?' He turns his attention back to his sisters, still kneeling before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading his legs, he unzips his pants. \"Pleasure your king with your mouth.\" He said, pointing to Yuzu. \"You, pleasure the rabbit.\" He sadi, pointing to Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth smiled at him. \"Yes Ichi-onii-sama!\" Yuzu quickly got up to him and pulled his dick out, before she started to give him a surprisingly good blowjob, licking and sucking on it in just the right areas. Meanwhile, Karin had gone over to Rukia, and started to finger her as she began to make out with her. Rukia reacted in kind, fingering the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Karin decided that this would not be enough to please her king, causing her to pull away from the kiss. Rukia seemed dissapointed when Karin pulled her fingers from her wet pussy, But was over joyed as the girl replaced them with her tounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that while Ichigo was out of it, Rukia kept coaching the girls on how to please their master.  So, she taught them everything she could using the knowledge of sex the Eronomicon gave her. This also included how to eat out a girl while being sexy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that in mind, Karin moved to where Ichigo could see her ass and her wet vagina as she continued to eat Rukia out. She even began fingering herself infront of him, hoping that she was pleasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, for his part was taking it all well. He had the younger of the twins blowing him off, which felt heavenly he might add, while the other twin fingered her self while she ate out another girl on his command. It was giving him a rush, to have so much power over them. Even if this wasn't a dream, he would still be loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that thought in mind, he began to move his younger sisters head up and down, making her deepthroat him. She was surprisingly able to do, somehow. After another minute or so, during which both Rukia and Karin came, he let his load go down his sisters mouth and into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do next?</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't do this to them!\" She said, narrowing her eyes at the substitute soul reaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but you did. You, Rukia, are the cause of all that has happened in this last week. But, since you don't seem to believe me, I will show you.\" He said, taking a dvd from Yuzu and popping it into a dvd player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for the next few hours, Rukia was subjegated to the video's that her perverted side had made over the week. They showed her eating out the girls, being eaten out, giving Ichigo blowjobs, being fucked hard by him, watching as his seed spilled into her. All this and more was shown, while in the real world, Yuzu and Karin were petting her head, stroking her hair and cooing softly. Ichigo, had at some point gotten behind her and started to finger her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all to much for her to bear. She couldn't believe what she was seeing. The last scene on the dvd was of rukia, covered in Ichigos seed as she stared into the camera. \"I am Rukia Kuchiki, and I love my Ichigo-sama. I would do anything he told me. I would do it all with a smile. I would do it again and again, as long as it made him happy.\" She said, repeating over and over for five minutes before the dvd finished its run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, He had started to be eaten out by one of the girls, but she didn't notice. 'Was... That.... really me?' She asked, never noticing she ground her hips into which ever girl was eating her out at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo cupped her face, making her look at him. \"So, does my little bunny remember?\" He asked, soft smile on his face. \"Does my little Ruki-chan remember what she did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ruki-chan? Little bunny? Am... am I his little bunny?' She asked herself, the scene's she was shown, played through her head over and over. One thing repeated through it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo-sama? Did your little bunny do wrong?\" She asked, suddenly meek. Ichigo smiled at her, shaking his head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo made his way over to the dojo where he and his childhood friend Tatsuki would spar, knowing that she went there most days for practice. He also had something that the perverted Rukia had shown him in the Eronomicon. It would help him in his endevours to build up his harem. But, this one was specificly for Tatsuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the dojo, he heard her grunts as she beat down one of the training dummies. He entered to see her pounding away, making the dummy shake with each hit. He saw as she panted, taking a small break as he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Tatsuki!\" He shouted to her, grabbing her attention. She let down her stance as she started to pant. She had been training for better part of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. No ones seen you outside of school for the last few days. What've been up to?\" She asked as she grabbed the towel she kept handy and the water bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"Been having to keep the house held down. Yuzu was sick while dad was out on his buisness trip.\" He said, making Tatsuki stop drinking her water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Yuzu was sick? Well, I bet you were a good brother and decided to take care of her didn't you?\" She said, slightly teasing him. She did care for the two Kurosaki girls like they were her family, but she figured Ichigo would be more than enough to take care of a cold. \"Well, I hope she gets better soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, shes doing just fine. Dont worry about it.\" The two sat there in silence for a little bit before Tatsuki spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any reason you came by?\" She asked, drawing his attention to her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I came to ask if you wanted a spar.\" He said, before He grinned. \"I bet I could still kick your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki got a little tick above her eye, as she stared at him. Fine, if he wanted to be cocky, she would just have to wipe the floor with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I accept! We'll see who kicks whose ass this time around!\" She said as she moved into the sparring ring. Ichigo followed her, getting into a stance she never saw before. She didn't question it, although she did wonder where he learned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Tatsuki! Why dont we make this interesting!\" Ichigo called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" She asked, wondering what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about, winner gets to ask on thing of the loser!\" He asked, remembering the times they did this as kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki smirked. \"Sure, why not. Could use someone to be my servant for a day.\" She said, also remembering the times that she won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smirked on the inside. She was playing into his hands. He had learned a fighting style from the book that targeted the opponets pleasure points. Rukia also showed him a seal that would wake the limb used in the ritual it was part of into an automatic pleasureinducer. Whoover he touched with any woman he touched with any of his four limbs would begin to feel very minute tingles of pleasure in them, and would start to make them want to be around the person who touched them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn essence, he made all four limbs that he could use to touch someone on a regular basis into lethal weapons against women. And, since the touch worked better if he hit pleasure points of the touch was more intamite, simply sparring with Tatsuki with these new powers would bring her into the fold of his growing harem. And the best part of the touch was that the woman would think of it as a natural reaction to the person who touched them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two began to spar. Tatsuki went in for a punch to his chest, causing him to block and counter, throughing her off balance, letting him palm thrust her chest, sending her backwards. She rebounded though, and tried to kick him in the the hip, Allowing him to grab her foot and flip her over him. She landed on her hands and attempted to sweep kick him, making him jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on for over an hour, neither party stopping or doing enough damage to actually take out the other. Although, Ichigo's touch was starting to wear down on Tatsuki's decency. She started to let him hit her or grab her more, just so she could feel the spark once again. She had even gone on after he had started to make her wet. She was starting to though decency out the window as she started to lose herself to the lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is... this how I really feel?' She caught herself think more than once. The touch was making her think she enjoyed it when Ichigo touched her. She felt the pleasure and tingling sensation build, each time he blocked or counter attacked. Each time he palm thrusted her in the chest, her heart skipped a beat. Eavery time he would grab her hand was a jolt to her systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo saw how she was acting, and smirked inside. He knew she was almost ready. Just a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive Minutes after he noticed that, Tatsuki let her guard down completely, allowing Ichigo to hit her in the chest one last time.'I guess it is.' She thought, blush adoring her face as well as tiredness from the spar. She fell back on the ground from the force of his blow. He didn't hit to hard, but she fell over like a rag doll, panting and gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo went over to her and picked her up, causing more pleasure to shoot through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I win.\" He said, making her go wide eyed. She forgot the bet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. What do you want.\" She said, her thoughts going wild at the pleasure she was feeling. He didn't let her go after he picked her up. Instead he held he close with both arms, sending wave after wave of constant pleasure at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned close to her, breathing on her ear as he whispered. \"I want you to be mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki froz. Did he just ask what she thought he asked? He wanted her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo decided he would take her here, not wanting to dessuade her by the fact that both his sisters were under his power as well. Moving his hands down her back, and let them rest on her firm backside. He gave a squeeze, making her moan at his touch. He admired how her rump was the pristine taughtness it could be. He could hardly way to ravish it and feel it around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to slowly rub circles around her ass, making her moan even more. His touch was driving her wild! Slowly pulling her away from him, he say how cute she looked, even with her tomboyish nature. He continued his movements, noticing how much pleasure she showed on her face. He loved the fact that he could do that to any woman. Make her melt in his hands, like ice cubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his head down be her neck, breathing on it, driving her even more wild. Lowering his lips to her skin, he began to gently kiss it. He kissed around her neck, making his way down to the front of her karate gi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to know what he wanted, as she bulled on her belt, letting the peice of cloth fall to the ground, the upper half of her outfit soon following. She mewled in pleasure as he began to kiss again. She felt herself back up against a wall. She never noticed her legs were moving. Or did Ichigo carry her to this spot? She didn't know, nor did she care. She focused on the pleasure she was recieving more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo trailed his kisses around each of her breasts, taunting her, making her cry out for his touch. She Knew he wanted her to beg him, but she didn't want to seem so pathetic. She might be his now, but she still wanted it to be known that she was still herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her breasts, as she didn't seem to want to fully obey him yet, he began to go lower, his fingers pulling down on her pants, leaving her panties for last. She stepped out of them, kicking them off to the side when they had fallen around her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo began to kiss her waist, before he moved down one leg, kissing her inner thighs, but leaving her womanhodd untouched. He made his way down one leg, reaching the knee. He placed one hand behind it, rubbing another pleasure point, gently prodding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki didn't know how much more she could take. She felt her loins as the set ablaze, making her soak her panties as Ichigo kissed down her leg. She was about to completely crack, not caring if she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo kissed his way back up the other leg. He then pulled her soaked panties down, showing him her womanhood in all its glory. He breathed on it, waking Tatsuki moan once more, loader then all others. He knew she was about to crack. Using kis tounge, he slowly made his way around her flower, always teasing her, but never touching. He knew this would break her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, Tatsuki grabbed his head for all she was worth, and pressed him up against her snatch as she came from the ammount of pleasure running through her. She couldn't wait any longer! Gasping for breath as she slowly came down from her orgasm, she looked down at him, eyes glazed in both lust and love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo.\" She said, word little more then a breath upon her lips. \"Ichigo. I need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What do you need?\" He asked, smirking up at her. She had broke, and he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a darker shade of red, she spoke again \"I-I need you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" He said, standing up. His hand moved to his pants, unzipping them so he could remove them. Tatsuki sucked in a breath as she saw the tent he had in his boxers. Slowly, as he watched her reaction, he pulled the down, allowing his manhood to be free from the confines of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki watched in awe as he removed the one peice of cloth seperating them from making the last move. She stared at his manhood as it bounced free, hard at what he had been doing to her. Slowly getting on her knees, she lookred at it, as if she was a child looking at a strange animal. She reached out a hand to touch it, before she grasped it in her hand. She slowly started to move it up and down, hearing Ichigo gasp slightly as her surprisingly soft hand stroked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lasted for two minutes, before Tatsuki took the plunge. Taking the tip of him in her mouth, she found she liked the taste of him. She slowly started to bod her head, unused to doing such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, although she was not used to it, she succeded in making him let loose his load directly in her mouth. She found she liked the taste of it too. Not too salty, and it was warm. She swallowed all she could, but the was too much for her to handle. He shot rope after rope into her hot mouth, until she had to pull off, making a rope of it hit her eye and get in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo finished his load, he looked down at Tatsuki, and was greeted with the sight of her covvered in his seed as she tried to wipe it from her hair, eating what she managed to salvage. Feeling like it was time for the main course, he pulled her up gently, bending her over against the wall. She insinctually spread her legs, waiting for him to fill her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo moved into position behind her, her lower lips glistening with need. He put his hands firmly on her rump, causing her to moan yet again. He slowly eased his way forward, his rod about to penatrate her, to claim her as his forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back, he thust himself forward, burying himself in her. He noticed how their was no Hymen, so there was no blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki gasped in both pain and pleasure. She felt him as he filled her, making her feel whole. She had broken her hymen during one of her training sessions, so it didn't hurt as much as it would have. But, she was still a virgin, meaning she was still very tight. For him to plunge into her so fast, it still hurt her. But the pain was more then offset by the pleasure she started to feel. She started to move her hips as she continued to moan, letting Ichigo know she was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the hint, Ichigo began to pull out, begfore thrusting in again. He picked up the pace and uped the power each time, getting a steady rythem going. He moved his hands along her side, causing her more and more pleasure with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about four minutes, Tatsuki came, sending him over. He pumped her full of his seed as he tight cunt caught him in a vice like grip. He was able to move a little, prolonging her orgasm, and making sure he stuffed her full of his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki wondered at the feeling as she was filled with Ichigos seed. She felt warm and full. She didnt really know how to explain it, but thats the best she could do. She idly wondered if she would get pregnant from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she could not ponder this for long, as Ichigo pulled out, before he placed his tip at the entrance of her asshole.  Eyes widened, she braced herself for pain and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Several hours later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo made his way to Tasukis place, Tatsuki sleeping on his back. The two of them had made love to one another for a long time as they marked the very dojo where they met with the sweaty smell of sex. The had done multiple positions all over the unsued dojo, claiming it as theirs. When Ichigo left the building, Tatsuki was clinging to his back and the Eronomicon was under his arm. He slowly climbed the steps up to her appartment, setting her down just long enough to fetch the spare key she hid. Picking her back up in a bridal carry after he opened the door, he made his way to the bedroom, gently laying her down. She tried to cling to him, making him chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her wishes, he got in bed along side her, smiling as she curled up against him, content smile upon her face. Watching her sleep soundlyy, made Ichigo relise just howw tired he was. Closing his eyes, he let himslef drift off to the land of sleep, wondering what the next morning would bring.</span></div></div>",

She was able to stare at the scene for just a moment longer, before it fully clicked in her mind. Doing so, her mind sent out a signal to shut down so it could come to terms with that. Orihime felt her legs give out as her world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo pulled out of Tatsuki and ran to catch Orihime before she hit the ground. He caught her, noting how light she was. That, and how full her breast were, and just how soft they were. He pulled her against him, as Tatsuki got up and limped over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked so sweet. So innocent, sleeping like a baby in Ichigo's arms. She seemed to be content, snuggling against him, despite what she saw just moments before. Tatsuki noticed how Orihime started to mutter in her unconsious state, something about her strawberry leaving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Tatsuki a little sad. Orihime was still her best friend, and she knew of her crush on Ichigo. Hell, the only one who didn't was Ichigo himself. So, getting a wonderful idea to bring the princess into the fold, she turned to her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo, why don't you bring her into our little group? She has had feelings for you for a long time, you know.\" She said, making him look at her, disbelief in his eyes, before he smiled a dark, perverted smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think I shall. Good think Tatsuki.\" He said, making the girl blush and smile, happy that she pleased him. \"Now, how should I do that?\" He asked aloud before he looked at the Eronomicon. He smirked, wondering what he could find in it that would help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Several hours later, after school~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime woke from a very vivid dream, where she, Tatsuki and Ichigo were having startling amounts of sex. Both her and Tatsuki were bowing to Ichigo, offering themselves, begging to please him. She didn't notice her state of dress, or lack there of, until Tatsuki walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe startling thing was, Tatsuki was wearing nothing but a collar (Ichigo loves those doesn't he?). Orihime noticed that she was the same after looking down at herself. Although, she did feel a hair clip that wasn't there before. She looked at Tatsuki, who kneeled before a make shift throne. She saw a figure sitting in it, but couldn't tell who it was. At least, she couldn't until a light went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shocked to see Ichigo sitting on it, naked as both she and Tatsuki, minus the collar. She blushed at this, but her eyes went wide when she saw his dick standing tall. Her eyes further widened when she saw Tatsuki start to kiss it and stroke it. She felt something. Betrayed? Aroused? Jelousy? She didn't know what, maybe it was a little bit of all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw as Tatsuki started to bob her head on ichigo's member. She watched in awe as pleasure appeared on his face, clearly loving it all. She saw how much he loved it all. The fact that Tatsuki was blowing him, the fact that she was watching, and the fact that he knew she was starting to get turned on, even if slightly. He saw the awe on her face as she watched it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki pulled up and let Ichigo's dick slip from her mouth, turning to Orihime as she continued to stroke him. \"You want him, don't you?\" She asked, pulling Orihime's attention to her. \"You want him, but you didn't know how to get him. Now, you have two choices. Join me in seving our Ichigo-sama, or leave.\" Tatsuki said, going back to blowing Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime took that with a great deal of shock. Serve Ichigo as her master? Well, her dreams did show her how it would be if she did. If tatsuki was willing to do it, then why shouldn't she? But, she wanted to be more with him, not just a toy. But, if thats what it took to be with the man she loved, then she would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo watched as Orihime made a decision. He knew she would join him, the hair clip had seen to that. It was a special hair clip that, when worn, would make the woman dream perverted dreams, twisting her deepest pleasures into dreams of pleasuring him. It would make her think they were all her own, and he knew that she would enjoy them. Tatsuki had said how Orihime had loved him before all of this. She was just a shy, naive girl who didn't know how to go after her dreams. But know, the dream would be to become his, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she spoke she joined them. But did she ask to be in a higher position, more like a mistress then a slave?</span></div></div>",

She was both looking forward to this and dreading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hours later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tatsuki and Orihime were snuggling up to Ichigo on Tatsuki's bed. Ichigo casually flipped through the Eronomicon, looking for something to give Orihime confidence. There had to be Something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing its masters need, the Eronomicon flipped itself to a page where it gave him a ritual to take one womans confidence and gave it to another. He read the description, and smirked. It was perfect and perverted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~One hour later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki woke up to the sensation of being eaten out.

Who knew Orihime could eat a girl out so well? But, something felt off as well. She felt more... shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she may have liked the feeling, she also blushed at it all. They had done this just a few hours ago, so why did she feel the need to blush?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to either girl, Ichigo had drawn a seal on Tatsuki's crotch, just above her pussy. This seal made it so that the one it was applied to would start to lose confidence through their love juice. It also transfered it to the one who was eating the girl out. So, Tatsuki was losing confidence, while Orihime was gaining it. This would allow Orihime to be a good mistress, while leaving Tatsuki as little more then a meek slave who would do anything for her masters love and attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on for half an hour, giving Orihime more and more confidence.

Ichigo had came in Orihime many times as well, making her cum more as Orihime moaned with her release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of it, Orihime will have the confidence of Tatsuki, and the will to use it, while Tatsuki was left as a slave, meeker then ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Orihime Punish Tatsuki for getting Ichigo before her?</span></div></div>",

Tatsuki was surprised, and scared at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use that mouth of yours to massage my foot, traitor!\" Orihime said in a very commanding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki fearfully complied, licking her new mistress's foot. She licked behind around the heel, licked between each toe, and even put the toes in her mouth to suck on them. Orihime was laughing at how pathetic Tatsuki was being. She was always so strong and confident, but now, she was so pathetically timid, Michiru would look as confident as a bison compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, Tatsuki! You're so pathetic. Always acting so strong, but now, thanks to your master, I'm the strong one, and you're so weak and timid, you beat out Michiru in a shyness contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki didn't say anything, fearing she might say something out of line. Eventually, Orihime pulled her foot away from Tatsuki's face before replacing it with the other one, demanding she give it the same treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really gonna have fun with you, Tatsuki, and the other slaves. Ichigo's got a few others, but after he explained it, I was fine. However, right now, I just wanna get back at you. You knew how I felt about him, and yet you did it with him anyway. Slave or not, you should've known how I'd feel. I'm gonna enjoy humiliating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was turning Tatsuki on so much. Her best friend, who only a short while ago was still the same naive girl everyone knew, was now abusing her harshly, and she was too shy to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was turned on too. The sight of the sadistic Orihime was so incredibly hot, it was almost unbelievable. He got up, and removed the collar from around Orihime's neck. Since she was his co-ruler now, a slave collar would send out the wrong signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Orihime stopped and turned to her master and co-ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite enjoyable. I've never felt such a rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can thank that seal there above Tatsuki's crotch,\" Ichigo said. The girls didn't see any seal until a brief flash appeared. They looked at Ichigo, wondering what that was. \"That seal there allowed you to take Tatsuki's confidence as you ate her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was very nice. Say, could I take her for a walk all around town? I want to make her feel humiliated and have people look down on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he let her do that?</span></div></div>",

By the looks of it, all parties were about to explode. True enough, Yuzu and Karin released on the hollows fingers as they moaned into one anothers mouth. Rukia exploded right onto the hollows mask, whick looked even more life like with the lips on the mask looking more real, making the hollow try to get as much as she could. Rukia made the hollow explode as well, as she moaned into the hollows pussy. The hollow moaned as she exploded into Rukia face, covering the girl in her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow took her fingers out of his sisters and began to lick them clean as the girls passed out. Aparently they had been doing this for a long time, because Ichigo knew they would last longer then one time. That, and the room smelt of sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking the rest off of her fingers and moving Rukia's body off of her, the Hollow got up and walked over to him. She wrapped her arms around him, before she pulled him in for a big kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo then realized that the lips on the mask were real, and he could taste Rukia's eccense on them. He made out with the hollow, before he realised what he was doing. Pushing her away from him and holding her at arms length, he stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who are you? I know your that same hollow that gave me the Eronomicon. Explain yourself!\" He said to it, making it shiver in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, doesn't my Ichi-chan remember his own mother?\" It asked, making him stare at it, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... mother?\" he asked, unsure of what he heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow looked at him, before it nodded. Ichigo scowled at it before he spoke. \"Prove it.\" He ordered, making the hollow shiver again. But, she noticed the scowl on his face. If she couldn't prove it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling him downstairs, she moved into the dining room, where Ichigo's dad had hung up a large poster of his mother, stating the words 'Masaki forever.' Underneath it. Now that he got a good look, the hollows mask did look a little like his mom. Maybe that was why he got a vauge sense of familiarity when he fought it the last time. He didn't really care at the moment because of the whole situation, but it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the hollow, he noticed it seemed to be staring at him, looking like it was hoping for him to believe it. \"Not enough.\" He said, still not trusting it at all. The hollow seemed sad, although it also seemed to understand this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, what if I told you only something your mother would know?\" She asked. Ichigo thought about it, before nodding. The hollow leaned up against him, mouth close to his ear. \"I caught you masterbating to a picture of Tatsuki once , then afterwards, I began to stroke you off in the mornings so that you wouldn't have to deal with it when you went to school.\" Causing him to go wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom?\" He asked, not beliveing it. His mother was here! It was her! He blushed, remembering that time, but he was happy that it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ichigo. It's me. Your mom is here again, and she is going to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" He asked, making her smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After grand Fisher ate me, I fought tooth and nail to get out. Unfortunatly, I still became a hollow. However, I wandered through Hueco mundo, the world of hollows, devouring all who stood in my way. They never met a mothers wrath before, and they kept me from my children.\" She stated, making him sweat drop at her as she waved her fist in the air. \"I kept myself by saying that I would see all of you again, come hell or high water! Soon, I rose to a vasto lorde class, feasting on whatever came upon my path.\" She said, making Ichigo look at her. She noticed this and started to reassure him. \"Now now, don't look at me like that. I ate only other Hollows, devouring thir power and making it my own. Now, after that, that little book you have that I gave you, absorbed me into it, binding me to it for you. It also gave me the ability to suck up morals, but that is for another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, for you. It has marked you Ichigo, and it knew I was close to you. So, it brought me back just for you, to give the book, and soon, myself, to you.\" She said, pulling Ichigo close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo made no resistance this time, and soon met his mother in a kiss. It soon got heated as she tried to grind up against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, can you do your mom one favor?\" She asked, making him look at her before he nodded.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, it came off, and Masaki's face was there, not a mask, not a trick. It was his mother's face. There were tiny bat wings on top of her head. She also got white clothes that showed off her curves, and left her nipples and crotch exposed. She also had a sword on her waist, with a guard that looked like the balls on a cock, and the hilt and blade were shaped like cocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Ichigo said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, this feels wonderful,\" she said. \"Let me try out my new resurreccion.

That wonderful little book did some amazing things for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the session got more heated, Ichigo slammed her up against the wall as she started to grind against him, harder then before. \"Oh yes! Does my Ichigo love this? Does he love having his slutty mom here again, ready to beg for his cock?\" She asked as he began to bite her neck and grab her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo said nothing, just let go of her long enough so that he could drop his pants. Masaki looked down, seeing her sons throbbing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him, sly smirk across her face. \"Does little Ichigo like when his mom talk dirty to him? When she says she is his?\" She asked as she grabbed his dick and started to stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo said nothing still, he just grabbed the top of her head, pushing her down on her knee's. Getting the message, Masaki easily took her sons rather large dick into her mouth and easily deepthroated him, swallowing around him. She loved that he was so controlling now. It made her wet as she started to finger herself, thinking about all the fun they could and would have now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo loved the feeling of his mothers mouth. Although, she wasn't his mother anymore. She was an arrancar, and a very sexy and powerful one at that. But, he still loved it. It was so warm and wet around his cock. And the feeling as she worked her throat muscles around it was draining quickly on his control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Ichigo had shot his load down his mothers throat, making her pull back to get some in her mouth. Once her mouth was full, she pulled him out of her mouth, letting herself become covered in his seed. Ichigo loved the sight of it. It was so hot and sexy as her eyes glazed over as she let herself get coated white. He noticed a small puddle underneath her, watching as she moved her fingers in and out of herself without even noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out of her little daze, Masaki quickly swallowed all the cum in her mouth, before she gathered all the rest on her face and hair. Making she she got every last drop, she licked her lips and patted her stomach. \"Who knew my baby boy would have such a delicious tatse.\" She said as she slowly stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down again, Masaki was pleased to see that Ichigo was still ready to go. \"Oh, does little Ichi-chan want to fuck his mommy?\" She asked, placing a finger on his dick while she pressed her large chest against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo spun her around and bent her over, making her brace herself against the wall. He quickly moved his dick into position, before thrusting in her, making her scream in pleasure. Her pussy was already soaking wet from her fingers, so Ichigo slid right in, filling her up completely. He felt the heat coming from her body center around his dick, turning her pussy into an oven of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki looked back at him. \"That's right Ichigo! Fuck your slutty mother! Show her why you are the king!\"She said, spuring him into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two hours, Ichigo and his mother fucked as hard as they could. Ichigo had gained a lot of stamina from all he had done for the past week and two days, so he could handle it. His mother was also a sex demon, literally, so she held up with no problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir fun came to an end when...</span></div></div>",

Yoruichi hissed in slight pain, before she felt something draining. It wasn't her life force, nor was it her reiatsu. So, what was it? She didn't fight it, not knowing what it could be. Although, she did start to notice how handsome the boy infront of her was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No! Got to focus! Now, where is that hollow?' She thought as she tried to looke around but couldn't move her neck. 'What the-' She said, before the pressure in her neck let up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki quickly moved out of Yoruichi's sight as said beauty turned around, looking for what could have bit her. Her eyes once again fell on the man infront of her, who looked ready to fight her. She noticed how defined he was, as well as his state of undress. She blushed and smiled at that. Her eyes were drawn to his croth, as she began to oogle his package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Focus Yoruichi!' She said to herself. 'But, he is a sexy male...' She felt her cheeks heat up at that, before she felt a slight pinch on her neck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki had moved behind her once Yoruichi focused on Ichigo, draining more and more morals. If you think the fact that she is biting her neck is like a vampire, your wrong. She is actually just giving Yoruichi one hell of a hickey and a few love bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoruichi felt the drain again, still not understanding what it was. Everything felt right still. There seemed to be nothing wrong! However, as the draining continued, she seemed to stop caring about it, and decided to focus on the hot stud in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think I could take his package, no problem. I bet he never even had a woman before.' She said, basicly eye raping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo noticed his mom sucking on the woman's thoat, seemingly unnoticed. He then remembered what she said ealier. His eyes widened in surprise, before he got a small smirk in his mind. 'Mom must be draining her dry of morals. She wont even be able to think of killing mom once she's done.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuessing his mothers plan, he moved towards Yoruichi. He showed no sign of being embarressed by the fact that she saw his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoruichi watched as he walked towards her, unashamed of his lack of pants. In fact, she noted how he seemed to take pride in it. She did like that, decency being thrown out the window. She felt as her top came undone, seemingly of its own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki smiled at her son as he approached the woman who said she would kill her. She noticed how this 'Yoruichi' dressed, smiling as she used a nail, sharpend as she sent small energy flows to it, to cut the womans top, leaving her bare for her son to get. She also knew that this woman was done, noting how little food she was drawing from her.</span></div></div>",

I did see a little flash on my hands as I gropped her back, but I didn't pay any attention to it. I wanted her to feel like she has made me feel for al these years. Once I was done, she was as meek as poor little Tatsuki here, so I gave  her a collar and brought her back.\" She said, making Ichigo look at her. She smiled at him and pressed up against him. \"Did I do good Ichigo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smirked at her as he pulled her close to him. \"But of course, my hime.\" He said before he crashed his lips against hers. She moaned into his mouth as the touch began to affect her again. She brought her leg up to his hip as she began to grind on him. Ichigo pulled her away from him. \"Now, I believe you said that you wanted to break in the <i>guest</i> we have?\" He said, pointing to the now Panting Yoruichi as Masaki began to fondle her breasts, tweaking her nipples as she drained the last bit of morals and decency out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime detatched herself from her lover, smirking very darkly. \"Yes, I do recall saying that. Don't worry dear, she will be taken care of. You!\" She said, pointing to Chizuru who squeked and tried to make herself smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes m-m-mistress?\" She asked, wondering what her queen wanted her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime smirked, loving how her voice was said with such awe and reverance, such adoration and fear. \"You, my dear slave, are to know who your true master is. Ichigo Kurosaki is your king! Your god! Am I understood?\" She asked, voice sweet enough to make the devil choke. Chizuru nodded at the voice of her queen. \"That means that you are to listen to him with no hesitation, just as you would me. If you don't, the consequences will be <b>very</b> severe. Understand?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChizuru didn't know what to do. She would litsen to her queen with no hesitation. However, Ichigo was not her queen. He was a man! It was against her nature to love a man anywhere close to as much as her queen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot liking how Chizuru wasn't answering her, Orihime pulled hard on her leash. \"Am. I. Understood?\" She asked, putting emphisis on each word with another tug of the leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress!\" Chizuru answered as fast as she could, not wanting to anger her queen and getting punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime smiled at her as if she did not just make veiled threats to the girl. \"Good. Now, be a good girl and you might just get a treat.\" She said, moving over to Yoruichi and the hollow, dragging the dark skinned woman to another room, Masaki following eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked at his newest addition to his harem and smirked. The girl was always upfront about everything, but now she was just like Tatsuki. A girl who would do anything for her masters.</span></div></div>",

However, when they saw Ichigo with the two meek bitches, thoughts left their heads at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was making Chizuru clean his cock, which had been covered in both his and Masaki's fluids after the amount of sex they had before Yoruichi had interuppted them. She licked at his dick, getting every last bit she could of their cum off of her god's rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer queen had told her that Ichigo was her god, so she did what any good devotee would do. She followed her god's will. If he wanted her pussy, she would sitt on his dick herself. If he wanted her mouth, she would quickly open wide for him. If he wanted her to do lewd, sexy things with the other slaves, she would do it. She would do anything for him, all it took was an order from her queen to begin the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki was watching the scene, her pussy dripping from the sight of it all. However, she waited like  proper dog until her master gave the word, ready for her to have his bone. She sat, legs spread to show her master her desire, hoping that he would take pity upon her. She dared not to do anything other then breath until her master or mistress gave the word, fearing more punishment then she had already recieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when her master's eyes settled upon her, she quickly looked away, making herself smaller so that he wouldn't ask anything of her. She would love the oppourtunity to prove herself worthy of being his slave, but she feared she would displease him or the mistress during the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to worry though, as Ichigo was still more then happy with giving his slaves the benifit of the doubt, letting them make a few mistakes as they got used to preforming more sexual acts with him and the other slaves. However, once those chances were up, he would gladly send them to his Hime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeckoning her forward, he watched as his once fiery friend slowly crawled towards him. He watched, a pleased gleam in his eye. Orihime really had stripped her of all that confidence. She had stripped Tatsuki of not only her brash attitude, but also of her bravery that would have allowed her to defy her king and queen, even if she hadn't wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tatsuki had made her way up to him, sitting beside Chizuru, who was cleaning the last bit of his cock. He had ordered her to do it slowly so he could enjoy the scene, and she obeyed like a good girl. He would tell Orihime she deserved that treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the two do as they watched?</span></div></div>",

Rukia warned him of Kenpachi and Yamamoto, heads of the eleventh and first division respectivly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Kenpachi was a monster who had few equals on the battle field. He even handicapped himself to make the fight more interesting. Rukia also mentioned how he had a very fine lieutenant. Rukia said she was about her height, with pink hair. She also said that this girl also had a slightly bigger chest then herself. This seemed to make Rukia frustrated. She also said that she was very bubbly, almost child-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Ichigo flexed his power, drawing all the shinigami to him. The women with him got ready, watching for any attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't have to wait long, as the sound of something large running in their direction reached their ears. The girls and Ichigo had been fighting off the small fry Shinigami who thought he had no experience in fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Their this way Ken-chan!\" They heard before the wall to their right exploded into dust as someone barged through. As the dust cleared, it began to show the outline of a giant of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There they are Ken-chan!\" A girls voice shouted from behind the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that Yachiru.\" The giant said, bloodthirsty grin on his face as he looked at the group. They each had a mound of knocked out or dead shinigami around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's was the largest, showing how much training he went through during those three weeks with all of them. Kenpachi seemed to zero in on him, seeing him as the most prominent fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yachiru, take care of the others. Make sure they can't interfere with my fight.\" He said, prompting the voice out from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was like Rukia described. Pink, shoulder length hair with a very child-like air around her. She had breasts that were slightly larger then Rukia's it seemed. Ichigo knew that he would get her, but focused on the fight he would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it Ken-chan!\" She said before she gave a mock salute and bounced over to the girls, not even thinking about what her fight would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo got in a fighting stance, not bothering to mince words with the giant Kenpachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenpachi grinned as he raised his sword, before he lunged at the soon-to-be harem god.</span></div></div>",

Apparently Ichigo was inherently strong. All Ichigo had to do was dodge and cut a little bit at a time. He had gotten hurt when he tried to hit the man the first time. His attack had gotten reflected at him because of the spirit power Kenpachi was leaking constently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo didn't make the same mistake twice. He increased the output of his power, and began to zoom around the giant, making small gashes, tearing him apart little by little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenpachi seemed to like the prospect of losing though, as he made several comments about how the strongest would win, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at his girls to see how they dealt with the pink haired lieutenant, he noticed how she was breathing heavily and her clothes were in tatters. Apparently the girls had roughed her up nicely, making sure not to leave to many cuts along her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo flash stepped behind her and knocked her out before picking her up and tossing her to Nel. The younger verdette caught the pink haired girl easily, hefting her over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo needed to thinnk what to do next. Rukia's execution wouldn't be for another few days. Yoruichi said that the Soul Society loved their scheduales, and would not change them if the end of the Gotei 13 were upon them. The only thing they would change for would be the spirit king.

So, since you are so well connected, I think you should be able to call it to you, no matter where it is in relevance to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded at her before he thought about the tome. He focused on it, calling it to him. Suddenly, he felt a weight in his pocket.

This woman had a long braid going down her front, going in between her breasts, which Orihime was currently fondling to her hearts content. Around Orihime were women in various states of dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tall, silver haired girl with large breast's. Her Shinigami uniform had her breast's exposed and what looked like chest bindings sticking up from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl, this one with dark blonde hair, was laying close to the one with silver hair. She had the entire front of her uniform in tatters, showing Ichigo her medium-sized breasts and her lean stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman, this one with long, flowing orange hair, was laying by herself. Her entire uniform was destroyed, giving Ichigo and any one else who walked by, a free show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl was strange to say the least. She had red hair and cat ears, so that was strange mark number one. Next, she had pink fur around her breasts and crotch areas, making it a provocative bra-shirt and hot pants combo. She looked completely out of it, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth. She looked the most unmolested though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked around as he walked up to his queen. There were slash marks in the walls and xcracks in the floor. Also, there was a large crater, signifing that there was a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime looked up at him as he approached, whistling at the damage. \"You had fun here didn't you?\" He asked, smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime smiled at him. \"Yep. I had a lot of fun breaking all these girls\" She said. \"But, this one,\" She said, gesturing to the girl she was currently moesting. \"Was a tough bitch to take down. It took my entire team to hold her down long enough to start stealing her confidence. Speaking of which.\" She said before she turned to the arrancar. \"For doing such a good job, you can take these girls and play with them for a while.\" She said, making the arrancar that were apart of her team smile and bow before they began to go over to the women to start getting their pleasure from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Ichigo, she started to explain a little. \"I first ran into that girl with the orange hair. She tried to fight, but the girls soon stopped her after she tried to stab me. Speaking of which, remind me to punish her later. Anyway, she was an annoyance, as they were able to take her down easy. It took a while for me to drain her confidence, but it was easy. I also took the liberty to release her zanpakuto's personafication, which was that red haired girl you saw with the cat ears. She had more confidence then her weilder, so that took a little more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped to roughly grope the woman under her, making her moan. \"Then, the blonde haired girl found me, and tried to run. Loly and Mellony stopped her though. She didn't nearly have as much confidence as the orange haired lady. Then, the silver haired one and this bitch came out. Most of the fighting was from them. This bitch!\" She said as she gave a sharp grope as her nails slightly punctuered the skin of the womans breats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bitch! She nearly killed Mellony. Once they had knocked out the silver haired one, they had to focus all their energy on holding this one down. But, her confidence is so delisious.\" She said as delight showed on her face. \"She has so much of it, I can't believe. I have been sitting here, stealing confidence from her for fourty-five minutes!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smirked at her, before looking down at the new slave. \"Tell me who the others are.\" He ordered. The new slave shivered, but not in meekness. No, she shivered in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one to order me around, you must have big balls kid. Fine, since I can't fight anymore, I think I will endulge you. The silver haired one is Isane Kotetsu, lieutenant of the fourth division. The blonde one is Kiyone Kotetsu, Lieutenant of the 13th division, and sister to Isane. The orange haired one is Rangiku Matsumoto, Lieutenant of the tenth division. The red-haired cat girl is Haineko, I think, juding from what your girl friend said about her. And I, my handsome man, am Retsu Unohana, captain of the fouth division.\" She said as she moaned again from Orihime's hands attacking her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and give me your confidence already!\" Orihime said, obviously getting angry at the fact this woman hadn't full y broke yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to have to work for it. But, even if you don't break me yet, I have a feeling that this strong young man will. I like strong men, you know that? Not muscle bound ones like that oaf Kenpachi, but one that has strong convictions. One that knows what he wants, and how he will get it.\" She said before she began to moan as Orihime redoubled her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, looked at the woman as the endless confidence, or so it seemed, was drawn into Orihime. Turning to his mother, who was standing behind him, he motioned her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the message, Masaki moved up to the downed woman, and bent down to start drainign her moral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, while the confidence was not gone fully, the drain on both her confidence and her morals had Unohana sitting there, writhing in pleasure, eyes closed in delight. it would seem that she would join Ichigo willingly, eagerly even, if she could get a good pounding.</span></div></div>",

She watched as the girls fingers twitched towards her waistline before snapping back to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki had feasted quite well. It didn't take long to drain the morals of someone who was so neat and ordered. After all, she didn't have to let the morals be pulled from other places. It was all in one neat pile, just waiting to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Masaki's latest meal was a fulfilling one as well as delicious one. Normally, a persons morals are loose, making them taste somewhat bland. However, this girls morals were a true delicacy. Her morals tasted like the sweetest fruit, plucked straight from the garden of eden. They were so pure and strong, that Masaki thought she was going to die from the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, her meal had broken free. She felt a concept that could be considered full. That was something she had not felt in a long time. She felt as if she had been feasting for days as she sucked on that girls neck, feasting upon her morals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling as she saw the girls determination to not play with herself slowly ebb from her, Masaki got a good grip on her sword. Well, it was really a giant dildo, but she could send energy to make it sharpen or make it seem sharp. She walked towards the distracted girl, who was actually trying to strangle one hand for grabbing her left tit. She was panting hard, trying to keep some semblence of restraint going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that Masaki would break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, moving around to the side of the girl as her body defied her mind, she nodded to Tia. Tia moved to the other side of the girl, while Milla Rose moved behind. Sun-sung moved over by Masaki while Appache got underneath the girls legs. Masaki moved back to the front as Nanao's hand loosened on the sword in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the sword dropped, the arrancar moved. The women surrounding Nanao wrapped their arms around the girls limbs. Tia grabbed Nanao's left ar while Sun-sung grabbed the right arm. Appache grabbed the girls legs in vice grips while Milla Rose wrapped her arms around Nanao's chest, placing her hands on each tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no escape this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki chuckled as Nanao gasped from Milla Rose's hands touching her breasts. She slwoly brought up her hand, touching Nanao's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanao flinched away from it. \"Oh, does the poor girl need release? Is she afraid of the feelings she could get as someone touches her?\" Masaki taunted as she moved down Nanao's neck, fingers hovering above the start of the uniform she wore. \"Well, I think we should give her that release. But first, we need to do away with that pesky cloth that hides your beautiful body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending energy to her nail, Masaki slowy and sensualy drew her nail down the length of Nanao's uniform, lightly touching her skin. Nanao moaned as the cool air of the Seireitei touched her hot skin through the cut in her uniform. She could see that Nanao was breaking. Soon, the girl would want nothing more then release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanao moaned at the situation. She felt so powerless. But, for somereason, she loved it. Maybe it was the amount of responsibility she had with such a laid back captain? Maybe it caused her to secretly desire to be powerless, and to let those who had power make the decisions. Maybe she wanted to be used? She didn't know, but neither did she care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki cut the last thread,prompting her to ove the girls clothes off of her and to the sides, slipping off what she could. Shie looked at the girls panties, drenched in her arousal. She cut those too, placing them in a small sack she carried on her person for just such occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the womanhood of the morally drained girl as she continued to let her become more and more aroused and needy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my. Does the little girl want this?\" She asked as she held up her didlo sword, now a more manageable size. \"Does the little slut want this in her?\" She loved the sense of power she had over the girl. The rush as the girl would beg to become her sons slave, just for that taste of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanao mumbled something, which was unheard by Masaki. Masaki smirked. \"Well, if you don't want it, then I guess I will take it for myself.\" With that, Masaki slowly brought the dildo down to her wet cunt and started to rub it along her slit. It wasn't nearly as good as her masters dick, but she would put on a show for the new slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki knew she was having an effect on the other arrancar right now. The scent of arousal was different from the other. Masaki knew they were thinking about her son and master. They hadn't been fucked in a few days as they planned this. Her son was smart, so he knew they needed to plan out the operation. Unfortuatly, this left them to fend for themselves for a while. None of them had tasted his dick in so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki watched with lidded eyes as  Nanao slowly crumbled as her moans reached her ears. \"Please! Give it to me!\" She screamed, letting Masaki know that she would do anything to get that release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You don't seem to want it very much.\" Masaki trailed off, wanting to see how she would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Give me release! I'll do anything!\" The girl cried out, nearly ready actually cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Masaki asked, chesire grin spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything! Name it, and I'll do it! Just let me cum!\" She cried, sanity starting to unhinge from the feelings she was feeling. Deciding to give her one last push, Masaki let loose a concentrated was of lust and need at the trembling girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanao's eyes widened as she felt her need skyrocket to new heights. Her mind, unable to handle this, decided to do anything to alleviate the feeling in her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is one thing you could do. I <i>might</i> give you release for that.\" Masaki said, teasing the girl more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Tell me what! I'll do it! Anything to get release!\" Nanao screamed, clearly going insane from the need to be fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my sweet little shinigami, you only have to do one thing. Promise to be my masters forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanao, willing to do litteraly anything by now, could only nod as fast as she could, nearly giving herself whiplash. \"I'll do it! I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki smiled at the girl before she moved the dildo up to her pussy. \"Good girl.\" She said as she plunged it into Nanao's depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanao's mind shut down at this. The feeling was to good for her to bear. While she was unconsious though, Masaki whispered into her ear that Ichigo would be her new master as she started to finger the girl as Milla Rose fondled her tits and the other arrancar whispered how it would feel a million times better to serve Ichigo.</span></div></div>",

Retsu was on the ground, a lost look on her face. Her eyes were glazed over, and rolled towards the top of her head. Her tongue was hanging out, and barely breathed. Ichigo finished off Rangiku when he noticed his mother and her friends. He pulled out, and walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your meal?\" Ichigo asked his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her morals were simply delicious!\" she squealed, shaking from the memory. \"Her morals were so high and organized, I might be full for a good three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo whistled at that. \"This one girl had that many morals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Now, if you don't mind my asking, what happened to Miss Unbreakable?\" Masaki asked, gesturing to Retsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her will might be unbreakable, but her mind couldn't take the assualt from me, Orihime, and the slaves who haven't been drained by Orihime, and has become nothing more than a receptacle for my spunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo gasped loudly, and everyone turned to the sound.

It was more of the concept of being full then actually being full.\" She said, making Ichigo nod. \"Now, what do you think I should do with our little stalker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo waved her off. \"Do what you want with her. I'll work on breaking in the new girl.\" He said as he moved over to Nanao, who was starting to wake up, a look of lust in her tired eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki turned to where she heard the gasping sound, motioning to her fellow arrancar to surround it from behind so their prey could not escape. She saw the arrancar vanish in a sonido, leaving behind the sound of static as they did as they were ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the sound of a blade leaving the sheath, letting her know that the girl was trapped between a rock and a hard place. She chuckled slightly as she silently made her way up to the front of the rock, sending energy to her nails and fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo didn't know what was happening. She had seen five unknown persons attacking her fellow lieutenant Nanao in a very disturbing way. She knew that they must be with the people who attacked Captain Kenpachi and killed Aizen with his own Zanpakuto. She only intended to follow them to see where they were holding up so she could report back to the more battle oriented captains so they could all attack at once to take them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, when she saw their leader, and how he took down Unohana-taichou, Momo couldn't help but gasp. Their leader had torn down the most powerful woman in the entire soul society and destroyed her mind!\" She knew she had to run, but she found herself paralyzed in fear. She feared what would happen if she got caught, but she knew there was no escape when she turned and saw the women she saw ealier who had attacked Nanao. But she wouldn't let herself be taken without a fight! Especialy if they were the ones who killed Aizen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she couldn't fight back as she felt a powerful presence behind her. She heard as the rock she had her back to crack as something powerful forced its way straight through. Momo could do nothing as she felt a hand grasp the back of her shirt as the rock crumbled behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki kept a hold of the girls clothes as she moved closer, knocking the girls weapon away from her as easily as if she was swatting a fly. She moved her mouth close to the girls ear as she began wrap her other arm around the girl very tightly so as to make sure she didn't escape. \"Well well well. Look what followed us home. A little lost girl who stuck her nose where it didn't belong. but don't worry, I'm sure I can find someplace for it.\" She whispered sensually into the girls ear, breathing heavily on the girls neck. He mouth was watering, but she decided to try something different with this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other arrancars kept their distance, weapons drawn incase this one escaped the higher positioned womans grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo struggled as she felt the woman grab at her chest slightly, not letting her arms get loose in the process. \"You won't get me alive!\" She yelled before she opened her mouth wide and stuck her tounge out, threatening to bite her tounge off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan was stopped however, when Masaki shoved a finger in her mouth to stop the girl from killing herself. She didn't even feel the teeth dig into her skin, her spiritual power was more then high enough to stop the girls teeth with no harm to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah~. We don't want someone as cute as you to kill themselves, now do we? No, I think you would be a welcome addition to the family. Just need to make some <i>adjustment</i>. But I am sure that you will come to love it here with us.\" Masaki chided the girl, as if she wasn't just trying to kill herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki channled energy to her tounge, leangthining it so she could lick the girls neck. She used her tounge to leave marks where it would drive the girl insane with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki retracted her tounge so she could speak again. \"Now, why don't you tell mother all about why you followed us home? You must have had a reason. I know you saw what we did to the other girl. If you were a smart girl, you would have called for back up to follow us. But I know you didn't. I didn't feel any spiritual power heading our way, which I am sure we would have to fight many Shinigami with too much power to hide all at once. So tell me, Why did you follow us?\" Masaki asked, using a fake caring voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo shivered as the woman licked her neck. It felt so good, but she had to stay strong! With the womans finger in her mouth, it was futile to try and bite her tounge, and she knew she wouldn't be able to anyway. She tried to speak, causing Masaki to remove her finger, knowing the girl wouldn't do that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know why I followed you? I wanted to kill the one who killed Aizen-sama! He didn't do anything to you!\" She screamed at them, causing them to wonder who this 'Aizen' was. well, everyone who wasn't one of Masaki's arrancar friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTier spoke first. \"Are you talking about the man who wore glasses and had no Bankai?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did kill him! This proves it!\" Momo said, slightly obssesing over the 'deceased' man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTier shook her head. \"I do not know what you have been told, but Aizen is not dead, unless he killed himself.' He had to many ambitions to fulfill, no matter the cost. I know him, but I do not like him. He tried to force me to work for him. If it wasn't for my friend here who is holding you, I would have to work for him to be able to live. The man is a snake, who will perish because of his greed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo stared at the <i><b>slut</b></i> who would disrespect her Aizen-sama! \"You don't know who you are talking about! Aizen-sama was a kind man. He was nice to everyone he met, and was loved by all! You know nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppachi appeared next to the girl, driving her hand across the grils face. Momo cried out at the painful blow as he head snapped to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you talk about Helibel-sama like that!\" She said as she raised her hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appachi!\" The voice made the girl freeze in mid swing. She looked back at the arrancar who had saved her life so many centuries ago. \"You will move away this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppachi bowed deeply before she vanished, only to be in her previous spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki saw that Momo was trying to nurse the small bruise that was forming on her face without the use of her arms. \"Yes. I have heard of this Aizen. But none of our group has ran into him all the while since we have been here. We have made no moves into any barracks of any kind. We have even left the more populated areas be. We have killed no one while we have been here. In fact, the only reason we are here is to save a friend from an unjust fate. You accuse us of something we did not do, and denounce us when we try to tell you the truth. So, I think you shall have to be punished.\" She said, making binds appear on the girl, not allowing her to move. She let go of the girl, letting her fall to the floor as her clothes fell to peices around her, leaving her bare for the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki looked at Tier before she smiled. \"Enjoy, little shark. Remember, no hurting her to badly now. Wouldn't want master or mistress to be angry, now would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTier shook her head, shivering at what would happen. She looked at her fraccion, letting them know with her stare alone what would be the consequences of not following that order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fraccion shivered as their former mistress stared at them. They knew that stare. They also knew their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo break any girls spirit for their master.</span></div></div>",

It was a very interesting seal, with interesting effects. The seal would change all the girls memory of this Aizen character, to memories of him in his place. She would remember Aizen as a person who she didn't like in the slightest, feeling something off about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching foreward, He took delight in Momo's struggles as the arrancar played with her body. Milla Rose and Sun-sung were currently teasing the girls tits with their tongue's, licking all around her large for her size tits, paying special attention to her nipples. Appachi was currently roughly fingering the girls ass in revenge for how she treated Helibel earlier. Speaking of which, the blond shark was currently snacking on the girls pussy, which showed how aroused she was despite the girls protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo took his time placing his hand and her forehead. He saw that, once he had done so, her eyes went blank as her memories were altered to replace Aizen with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo couldn't help but sit and watch as her Aizen-sama was erased from her mind, being replaced by Ichigo. 'Aizen was the one who gave me a chance once I left the shinigami acadamy.' she told herself. Her memories told her otherwise. 'Aizen was the one who treated me with respect.' She told herself. Her memories told her otherwise. 'I helped Aizen when He got sick all those times, and he thinked me for every thing.' Her memories were telling her the oppisite things. 'Ichigo was the one who helped me achive my shikai.' She told herself, unknowingly turnign Aizen into Ichigo. Her memories said yes. 'Ichigo was the one I want to be with!' She told herself. Her Memories said yes. 'Ichigo was the one I saw dead.' She told herself, wondering why he was alive now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Momo looked up to Ichigo again. This time though, it was filled with love and addoration. \"Ichigo-sama. Is is... really you?\" She asked, tears forming in her eyes. Afte Ichigo used the seal on her, he had the girls move away from her so as to not make the girl question what was happening which could have done something unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smiled at the girl as he nodded. She launched herself at him, tears of joy in her eyes as she hugged him. \"I thought i lost you Ichigo-sama! I saw your corpse pinned to a wall!\" She cried as she buried her face in his unclothed chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo brought his hands up to stroke the girls hair. \"No. I never died. It was all Aizen, remember? I found out about his plans and he tried to kill me. Thankfully, I had Mayuri make a gigai that looked like me and a mod soul that acted like me. Don't you remember?\" He lied to the girl, knowing the seal he used on her would fill in the gaps and make her believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo nodded, rubbing her face against her Ichigo-samas chest. \"Yes. I remember! I always knew that Aizen was up to no good!\" She said, planning on doing something to the man that tried to kill her Ichigo-sama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but do you remember what I said after that? about my little club I had here?\" he said, gesturing to all the women around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo's eyes glazed over as her mind added in the memories. \"Uh, yeah. I remembered everything you told me about it!\" She said, making Ichigo smirk inside. He figured the seal would have Momo act like she knew about this, and would tell her about all the women in his harem so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can tell by the fact that you came here, and that your naked, you accepted my offer to join, knowing what it entailed, just as I told you in complete confidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo's eyes glazed over again, adding and altering the memories. Once her eyes focused again, she looked up at him. 'Of course! Anything for my Ichigo-sama!\" She said with the love and adoration that she held for Aizen before.</span></div></div>",

She knew she made the right decision in joining his harem He was so kind, to ask how <b>she</b> wanted it. Although, she wouldn't have minded if had just taken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well... I, um...Uh...\" She said, stuttering at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smiled at her reassuringly. It might help to say something to make the seal implant the knowledge neccasary. \"Don't you remember all those magazines I gave you? The ones that showed sex positions? After I let you know about this little club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo's eyes glazed over again, as the seal drew upon the knowledge in the Eronomicon of various sex positions that she should try with her new master. Snapping out of her trance, Momo starred up at Ichigo again. \"Oh, right. Um, sorry. I forgot until just now. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo just patted her head. \"No need to worry. It's fine. I can't expect you to remember everything about this. Now, tell master Ichigo what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo blushed harder, happy that her master wasn't angry at her. \"Well... I, uh... I would like to try it... doggy style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smiled at her. She seemed to have good taste in sex positions after she gained the knowledge of them. \"Alright.\" He said, moving just slightly away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo got down on her hands and knees, her ass pointed in the air towards Ichigo, giving him a full view of how wet and ready she was. Her pussy was leaking with desire, desire that was for the orange haired man standing above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo took in the veiw. Her slightly porcelain like skin, slightly sweaty as her body made her hot with burning lust. Ichigo took no time, and bent over the girl. He positioned his dick at her dripping entrance, ready to plung in at a moments notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wrapped his arms around the girl, gently grabbing her breasts. They were firm, yet soft. Perfect for rough gropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking not a moment longer, Ichigo plunged his length into the girl, drawing a cry of pain as he tore therough her maidenhood. He stopped, letting her get used to the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit, Momo rocked her hips to show that she was ready to start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ichigo began to thrust in and out of the girl, plunging just a little more of his rod in each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo moaned at the feeling. Her Ichigo-sama was fucking her! It was better then she ever could have dreamed. She loved the way his calloused hands mauled her chest, as he moved in and out of her. She loved the feeling of being full. She felt complete, knowing that she was with her Ichigo-sama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo, being tight and inexperienced, soon brought the both of them to climax. Ichigo debated on wheter or not he should cum inside of her. But, he didn't get to fully make the choice. His loins would not be denied for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with a beastial roar, Ichigo increased the speed of his thrusts, making Momo cum time and time again, tightening around Ichigo's member incredibly tight and pleasurably. With one final roar, Ichigo let loose his seed into the girls previously virgin cunt, painting her insides white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo smiled as she felt Ichigo cum inside her. She felt as though she could die then and there and have been the happiest girl in the world. She felt exaushtion wash over her, as her world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ An Hour later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo woke up to find her Ichigo-sama holding her to his chest. She snuggled in to him, enjoying the warmth. She looked out to see the other girls in various states of being fucked, or having been fucked into unconsiounceness like herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one that looked out of place was Retsu Unohana. She looked up at her master, who smiled down at her. \"That was so good, Ichigo-sama. I never want to leave you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smiled at her. \"And you never will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo looked at Unohana again, slight sadness in her eyes. \"It is a shame though. To lose one such as Unohana-taichou to the pleasure. She would have made a good harem-sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked down at her. \"What made her so special? Other then being the captain of the fourth division?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo looked up at him. \"You don't remember? I guess I could remind you.\" She said, a small smile on her face. \"She was the strongest woman in all of Seireitei. She was also, the best healer in the ranks of the shinigami. She was an insperation to women everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo thought it over. While he believed in Orihime's power to heal wounds, as shown when they trained before they came here, he couldn't have her do all of it. Maybe he should have left her mind intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed. He wondered if he would find something in the Eronomicon to either fix it, or at the least make a copy of the woman in mind, body and soul.</span></div></div>",

He returned the hug before pushing her back, and putting on her new uniform. It consisted of a cow-print bikini, cow bell, and a hairband with cow horns.

He unsealed a mannequin to use for the ritual. He would take a copy of Uhohana's memories, which were still in her mind, but unaccesible to her. But not to him. He would use the copy of her soul and Memories of after she had agreed to serve him, but before he fucked her into the mindless cumdump that she was before becoming a cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have to tweak somethings about her though. Like, being able to handle the pleasure for instance. It was all in the Eronomicon, so why shouldn't he use it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing the seal on the mannequin, Ichigo looked back at his new cow to see that Masaki and Haineko were drinking her milk at the moment. Orihime and Yoruuichi had been the first to drink it seemed though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving over to Unohana the cow, Ichigo ordered her to stay still, which she did happily. Ichigo took the better part of twenty minutes drawing the seal, erasing smudges or lines that weren't straight enough for his liking. He wanted nothing to go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was satisfied, he began the ritual, making Unohana pour her reietsu into the lifeless mannequin. Unohana didn't understand what was happening, but it pleased her master. And that pleased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ichigo was altering the sensations and resistances to pleasure of the new Unohana as she was forming. He upped her sensitivity, while multiplying her pleasure threshold and the amount she could handle before breaking again. He really didn't want that. He also added a unsurpassed feeling of loyalty for him into the new girl. While she would be submissive to him, he knew Orihime would never be able to make her meek like the others. He decided to do something special with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new Unohana finished forming, perfectly like the original in every way except for her new state of mind.

All the normal girls A.K.A. the ones who weren't modified in some way like Orihime or the new Unohana, or those that didn't have great amounts of stamina, such as Nemu and his mother, were sprawled around the room, in varying states of pleasure induced sleep. For Unohana's 'initiation' Ichigo had let the girls have at her in a giant orgy, while he fucked all her holes in various positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had filled her up, he had gone on to do the same for the other women in the room. He had interuppted his mother in dominating the other Arrancar. They knew who was boss female among their little group of former hollows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Orihime, who was currently sitting next to him, head on his shoulder. Masaki was on his otherside, mimicing her position. Unohana 2.0 was behind him, with his head laying on her chest. Momo was sitting inbetween his legs, leaning back against him. Nemu, being one of the few women awake, was laying down at their feet. She knew her position perfectly, and gladly accepted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki leaned into her son more, turning her head to face him. \"Oh Ichigo. That was wonderful. All that lust. All the carnal pleasure. It was horribly perverted. I loved it. And I have no doubts the others did as well.\" She said, snaking her tongue out to lick some sweat from Ichigo. \"But we still have the matter with Rukia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded. \"I haven't forgotten. We will save her, and find out was this Aizen person is planning. I have a feeling that whatever it is, it isn't good for any of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime snuggled close to him, sighing contently. \"Whatever he is planning, I think we can deal with it. After all, none of us have been slacking during training. I mean, you were able to take down the supposed power house Kenpachi right? And I Don't think that you will lose against the first squad commander either. And, I highly doubt that Aizen is as powerful as him by himself.\" She said, making Unohana nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right. Aizen is a weakling compared to the captain commander. While he was sickly, I doubt that he was as he appeared. That, and I have always felt something off about him, but I paid no mind. We all have things that we hide or keep to ourselves.\" She said, the scar that she had on her neck showing, her hair undone and flowing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded. \"Yeah. I'm not worried though. If what Tier has told us, then he is after something inside Rukia. What it is, I don't know. But I don't care. He thinks he can take what's mine. And for that, he needs to die. He will not be able to go through with his plans on my watch.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of losing one of his girls to anyone made his blood boil. It wasn't natural. They were his alone, and any who tried to harm or take them from him would die. Painfully he might add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki pulled her tongue back to speak again. \"We know he won't, but that isn't what we are worried about, if anything at all. We need to prove our innocence in the murder of Aizen. Kidnapping and brainwashing not withstanding, I think we haven't done anything to them. Besides, if it was because of a law that Rukia is set for execution then there should be some changes. And I think I know a way.\" She said, making Ichigo look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? I don't think they will take kindly to us killing their political leaders after all.\" He said, making Masaki give a soft chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. Nothing like that. But, I do know thaat your father was a part of a royal clan from here. And if I know any ruling body that is under the rule of royalty, then they will bow to you, if only to save their own necks. It would be fun to watch them squirm, desperate for your approval wouldn't it? I think that Kukaku girl is of the same blood, but distantly. She did say that she was from a noble clan after all. And she doesn't seem like eiother Rukia or Yoruichi in terms of upbringing. There was another clan, from what I know, but they are a weaker one of the royals. Definatly not something she would be apart of if her attitude upon meeting us was any indication.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded. He knew his father was a shinigami, but not that he was a noble. This would make things all the more sweeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Though this information would have been nice to know earlier.\" He said, eyes narrowing playfully at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaki shivered. She knew that she would be 'punished' later, and she looked forward to it. \"I didn't think that it was important at the time. But, we now have some kind of plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded. \"Yeah. Now, we all need some sleep. We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the girls clng to Ichigo, more so then before, and let themselves drift to sleep. Ichigo felt them breath for a while, before he to slipped off to the land of slumber.</span></div></div>",

True to form, the second Chizuru noticed what Orihime was not wearing, she launched herself at the busty princess, trying to fondle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is my Hime doing? Why is she outside on the streets? She should come to my place!\" She said, as she tried to latch on to Orihimes ample chest. Orihime knocked her back and off of her boobs. Those were for Ichigo only, unless she let a slave touch them. But she knew this girl and how she acted. How could she not? The female infront of her fondled her and groped her everytime she saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the old, shy Orihime. This Orihime would take back in spades what this girl would do to her. So, moving towards the dazed girl, telling Tatsuki to stay while she delt with this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChizuru for her part, didn't understand what was happening. She saw her hime walking along the empty streets, naked as she could ever wish for. And whats more, she saw that spoilsport Tatsuki being led around like a dog on a leash, also naked. Not knowing what was happening, but loving every second of it, she tried to attack Orihime's gargantuan chest. She didn't expect her to backhand her! What had happened to her precious hime?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wasn't expecting when Orihime picked her up and began fondling her chest, groping and squeezing back at her. She felt weird about it, like she was... shy. Shy that her target was fighting back with her own medicine. Why did she feel that way? She should be overjoyed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime felt her confidence growing with each move of her hands, wether it be a twitch of the wrist or a squeeze of her fingers. She thought she saw a flash appear on her hand for just a moment, but shrugged it off. She figured it was a trick of the light. She thought that the confidence boost was from getting back at her tormenter for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tatsuki stayed where she was, following the orders of her mistress to the letter. She watched as her mistress turned the tables on the girl she used to defend her mistress from. The sight made her aroused, and she wanted to join, but she wouldn't risk the wrath of an irrate mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Orihime was draining every last drop of confidence out of Chizuru, making her as meek as Tatsuki. Once she was done fondling the girl, she saw as Chizuru dropped, panting after having came several times. Pulling out a collar from seemingly nowhere, she put it around Chizuru's neck and attached a leash that came from the pocket dimension that the collar did. Taking both leashes in hand, she ordered Tatsuki to heel, and began walking to Ichigo's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered, she found Ichigo...</span></div></div>",

They're very good.\" replied the hollow moaning at Yuzu's skill with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow saw Ichigo about to get his badge and held up her hand. \"Wait. The reason they are yours is because of the book you got from me. I would be willing  to except any punishment you give me on one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? What's that?\" asked Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow grabbed her face and pulled it off like a mask. The room was soon filled with purple smoke that soon swept away to reveal a gorgeous woman. She had short raven black hair that went down to the back of her neck. Her mask fragments were int he form of a pair of Curled horns one would see on a ram. Her attire consisted of a white short miniskirt with black stockings that went down to cover her feet which were in white high heels. The only clothing covering her upper body was a white sling bikini that barely covered her nipples, which were obviously erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now revealed arrancar walked up to Ichigo and wrapped her arms around his neck. \"I want to join your harem. I want to feel your hot seed pumped into me every night. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo could only do one thing when a hot piece of arrancar ass like this asked him to take her. He gripped her firm, but large ass and crashed his lips down onto hers as they both let their hormones do the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime felt left out, but decided to have some fun with the others while Ichigo broke in his new woman. She pulled Tatsuki over as she began to make out with Rukia with Yuzu and Karin kissing and fingering Tatsuki's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo pulled away from the female arrancar and watched as she got on her knees in front of his cock, which was straining against his pants. She pulled the zipper down and brought his member out, which shocked her at the size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're definitely the biggest I've ever seen.\" replied the arrancar before gripping it with both her hands and pumping it while beginning to deep throat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo held her head there as his dick felt amazing from her skill. He could already feel himself close to his limit before the arrancar took her mouth off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked at her with confusion and annoyance, but stopped when he saw her spread her legs eagle style and revealed underneath her skirt that she wasn't wearing any underwear. \"I want you to cum right in here.\" begged the arrancar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gave an evil grin and and began to slowly rub his large member over her pussy lips without actually going in. This began to drive her crazy and was about to cry out, but was silenced from Ichigo driving his member into her, causing her to silently gasp at the pleasure she was feeling. She felt his cock rub inside her pussy as he pulled it out all the way and then slammed right back into her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued this up for several minutes as he could tell it was driving her crazy. He leaned down and began to suck on one her breasts while still thrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended up biting down on her nipple, causing her to hasp at the new pleasure, before screaming out with uncontrolled ecstasy as she felt Ichigo begin to pump his seed deep inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wiped his forehead as her insides were real tight. He watched as she grabbed onto his shoulders and gave him a kiss where they felt each others tongue rub against the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled way and gave Ichigo a grin. \"Now I'm yours, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now Ace as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis two surrogate brothers, gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Nakama were scattered to the winds, and he didn't know if they were alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had to believe they were.

Very few things could get him like this, wanting to destroy something out of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy turned his head as the sound of claws scrapping the stone was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" He asked, seeing it was one of the lions that he had 'befriended,' A.K.A beat on while training both his body and his Haki of the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion whimpered, dropping an object from his mouth. The lion sensed that it was something powerful, beyond its comprehension. And, for some reason, it felt compelled to bring it to the strange and powerful human. Much like the Haki that the human produced, the object gave off its own aura, syncing up with Luffy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? A book?\" He asked, picking up an ancient tome. \"Man, Nami or Robin would like something like this.\" He said. \"Maybe I should go hunting. Getting kind of hungry here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion went wide eyed, starting to shake in fear before running off. He didn't want to be the next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy watched as the overgrown lion ran away. \"Huh, wonder what's got him? I was going to ask if he wanted to go hunting with me.\" He said before shrugging. \"Oh well, more meat for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later, after the hunt~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy patted his stomach, watching as the flames died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... what should I do now?\" He asked the flames. \"I don't want to sleep just yet... I guess I can look at the book that the lion brought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy got up and grabbed the book form the cave, before sitting back down at the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he find?</span></div></div>",

On it was the image of a crown, and a description that Luffy did not want to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A crown?\" He asked. \"Boring.\" He said, about to toss the tome to the side. Maybe he would just go to sleep after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his finger brushed over the page, more specifically the image of the crown, making it start to shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was blinded as the light grew intense, shooting high into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Can't see, Can't see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Over in the palace, with Hancock~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snake Empress, also known as the Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock was lounging in her bed. Her chosen love, Monkey D. Luffy, was hurting, and she could do so little for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea what drew her to the man. Maybe it was the fact that he cared about her without even knowing her when they first met, or perhaps it was that he risked so much to keep one of her own pirates safe, even when she was the one that put them in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was the fact that he was the one man who did not fall sway to her charms as the most beautiful woman in the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter though. Once the Kuja pirate leader had latched her heart to the man, there was no going back. He would be the only one for her, ever. No man would replace him, no matter how hard they tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed once more, the beating of sorrow in her chest still aching as it had when she had brought Luffy back to her Island after the battle at Maineford and the loss of his brother. Luffy was distraught, and she could do little to quell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Luffy, my love. I wish I could help you more then I am already.' She thought, turning her head to the window that overlooked the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for her eyes to widen a she saw the large white beam of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, after her heart started beating once more, having stopped out of fear, Boa Hancock was running through the palace, naked as the day she was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran, a few guards of the palace followed their queen, wondering why she was rushing in such a hurry, and where, not knowing until they were able to see the light from the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them called for reinforcements as they rushed after their queen, wondering if they were being attacked by some unknown force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Back with Luffy, a few minutes later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was rubbing his eyes, trying to see again. The light had died down, though it didn't help that it was so intense that it still left a burnt image on the back of his eye lids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, stupid book. Last time I read again.\" He muttered as he blinked a few times. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the ground, next to the dropped book, was the crown he had seen in the book. Sitting on the crown was a ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crown was amazing, with no flaws in the crafting. It resembled a snake, poised to strike while sitting coiled. The crown was made of gold, though with the various gemstones placed around it, with two brilliant diamonds for eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" He asked, rubbing one eye as he poked at the crown. \"Is The book magic? It must be!\" He said, suddenly thinking that it might not be so bad to read the strange book again, as long as it didn't blind him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy, my love! Are you alright?\" Boa asked, suddenly jumping out of the jungle, still naked. Though, that really didn't faze Luffy much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Hancock-chan! I'm fine, thanks.\" He said with a grin, melting the pirate empress' heart all over again. \"If You're asking about that light, that was this thing right here.\" He said, nudging the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock blinked at the book. How could a book do that? Why would a book do that? And why so close to Luffy? She knew the light came form the clearing they were in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hancock-chan.\" Luffy said, picking up the crown. \"Look what I found though. It's pretty cool isn't it?\" He asked, holding it out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock looked at it, and it was indeed 'cool' as Luffy put it. It also helped that it was made in the image of a snake, one of the most loved animals on the island. And the fact that Luffy had described it as cool, which almost instantly made up Hancocks mind about it being amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my darling. It is 'cool.'\" She said, already feeling her heart beat faster in Luffy's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy looked at it, before looking at Hancock. \"Do you want it? I mean, I already got my hat, and it fits you so...\" Luffy trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoa's heart did a flip, thinking Luffy was, in his own special way, proposing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Luffy. Thank you for this.\" She said, her face turning an amazing shade of crimson as she held out her hands for the gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy handed the crown to her, the ring dropping into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Hancock said, looking at the ring in one hand. She, for some unknown reason, wanted to give Luffy the ring. And, she felt bad about not getting him something, despite not knowing he would give her this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. Take this, my love. Think of me when you where it.\" She said, handing back the ring with a little lie, knowing that he likely wouldn't take anything from her otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy let the ring fall back into his hand before he picked it up. \"Thanks Boa-chan!\" He said, putting it on. Now he had two things to keep safe. The hat on his head, and the ring on his finger. \"I'll protect it, no matter what!\" He declared, smiling at the Pirate Empress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoa blushed harder, her entire body heating up as she put the crown on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if Luffy had read the description of the crown he would have known what it was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crown would turn Boa into his puppet, following any order he gave. Not only that, but it would make anyone she ruled over loyal to him like she was. A nation of puppets, loyal to the end, who would take any order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow far did the power of the crow reach with Hancock's various titles and positions?</span></div></div>",

This also applied to any towns under pirate control, and those that had formerly been pirates, including one Nefertari Vivi, Princess of Alabasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her title of the snake empress, the entirety of Amazon lily was now under his command, the women following his every whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as a bonus, her position as a Shichibukai had enough merit and Authority to gain control over most of the marines. The Shichibukai had enough authority, and a ranking above, most marines, being directly watched over by the admirals and the head of the marines. So, that meant that almost the entire marine force was now under Luffy's control, along with Marine controlled towns.

Well, Keitaro had foolishly decided to Naru for help, popping open the hole in his celing that lead to her room. Un fortunatly, Naru had been changing her shirt.

I should have known that something bad would happen! It always does around here!\" He said to himself, pulling the last board up, before tossing it into the pile next to him.

No. An ALL GIRLS DORM! What was going through her head? I know she doesn't have much longer to live, so she decided to retire, going to visit the hotsprings all around the world, but come on!\" He said to himself for the one thousand and seventeenth time. \"Well, better go get more flooring out of the work shed, I hope nothing else happens.\" He said, hoping that the end to this day would not invole large amounts of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left however, he noticed something in the floorboards that he couldn't see before at the previous angle.

Maybe Kitsune put it there a while ago, like the last time Naru knocked me through the floor.\" Keitaro said to him self. Decieding that he could use a break, he sat down and opened the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way to a womans heart is a fickle thing. It is even more challenging if there is more than one woman in your life. How ever, there are steps to ensure that it will be less of a challange, and more than rewarding. Step one is to ensure that they won't attack you for any little thing.\" Keitaro read. \"Ain't that the truth.\" He chuckled out, thinking of all the chaos that happened around here that seemed to end up with him hurt or at least a long way from the Hinata Inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the time Shinobu had nearly tipped over the ladder he was standing on. He nearly fell over, but he put his hand on her head to steady himself. The poor girl had felt so bad that she couldn't stop apologizing. When he tried to tell her it was alright, she gave him a big hug. Unfortunatly for him, Motoko had walked around the corner and saw her hugging him. This, of course, lead to the swordswoman to believe he was trying to corrupt her, and to attack him with those KI-infused attacks, sending him far away from the inn. Thankfully, he had been outside at the time, so he didn't need to fix up any holes in the wall or ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving away from those thoughts, he continued to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, normally this is extremely difficult, expescially if you are somewhat of a klutz.\" 'Yeah thats me' Thought Keitaro. \"BUT, in the back of this book, on the inside of the back cover, we offer the ingredients to a special spray that lets you get away with anything! And we do mean anything. Note however, that this is not permenant, and should only be used until step 5 is completed. It is very souluable, meaning that it goes away almost immeadietly in water.. It also only lasts for up to a maximum of 4 and a half days, five if it is a mildly warm day, not raining, and there is very little humidity in the air. Please also note, that it does NOT wash away with sweat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro shook his head, but looked on the inside of the back cover anyway. He was surprised however, to find a little packet with the directions, \"Please put in a squirt bottle with up to, but not exceeding 5 ounces of water. Mix well and spray on self twice.\" That was not what her was expecting. He was half expecting a note that said \"Good try you perv!\" Or maybe for it to literally blow up in his face. Stuff like that happened alot. He had to make sure that Shinobu locked up the kitchen supplies. Last time she didn't, Kaolla Su, another one of the girls living in the dorm, had booby trapped the higher pans the Keitaro had to get down for Shinobu on occasion to trigger a motion sensing DNA scanner to cause the pantry to explode, nailing him in the face with, not only a rather large fire ball, but also many metal pans. Thankfuly though, Shinobu wasn't hurt. She had ducked behind the counter the second she heard beeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, what the heck, if it's a prank, might as well try it. It's probably a calogne that Kitsune had Su turn into a powder to put in a bottle of water.\" He said, not really having much to lose.</span></div></div>",

He could smell Shinobu's cooking coming from the kitchen, and knew that it would not be long before everyone was seated at the table, eating another of Shinobu's wonderful culinary creations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, seeing that he still had so much left to work on, before he decided that he needed a shower, and would put it on afterwards.

'Now or never. Besides, what's the harm in it?' He thought before grabbing the little squirt bottle normally used for cleaning the mirror, and emptied it, filling it with fresh &amp; warm water. He carefully dumped the contents of the packet into the bottle before putting the lid back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook it up real well, Noticing it flash pink before he stopped shaking it, figuring that was supposed to happen, before he sprayed it twice on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nothing bad happened.

Please come clothed.\" She said as she slowly backed around the corner, eyes averted the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Please hurry senpai.\" Shinobu said as she made her way back down the other end of the hall, not casting a glance back the entire time, although, Keitaro knew she was blushing the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro, for his part, stood there, still trying to cover himself, shocked to his very core. He wasn't dead for one thing. And another thing was that He didn't even sense hostillity from Naru at all. She seemed more timid than anything else. And the fact that neither one of them screamed in shock was another thing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wha-what just happened.' He thought as he started to come out of the shock. Quickly making a bee-line for his room, he saw the tome . 'C-could what it have said be true?' He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?</span></div></div>",

So, he decided to skip dinner that night, even if it would hurt Shinobu's feelings. He would make it up to her someway. Maybe an upgrade for the kitchen. They needed one any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the book, Keitaro moved past step one, and on to step two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step two is about learning why they hate the thought of your existance, if they do indeed hate you. If the woman, or women, does not hate you with nearly all of their being, this step can be skipped. Now, with the mixture of the spray activated and with at least a two day wear time left, you are to learn why they hate you. for this though, you have to catch them in a compromising, and normally pain, position. Act like you are emberessed with the whole situation like they should be. After all, if they aren't angry, they they would be embarassed.\" Keitaro read from the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro nodded. 'That happens alot around here. In fact, I believe if I remember correctly, the first time I was here after Granny left, without me knowing, one such act had occured, causing me to meet nearly everyone in the dorm.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, and decided that he would do so tomorrow After all, if Naru didn't kill him, then there was no way this was a prank.</span></div></div>",

As she entered the room, the moonlight shone on her, showing it to be Motoko, with her long dark hair framing her face. She looked angry for a moment, before smelling the same thing Naru did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason she got angry, was because Su, the mad genius of the Hinata inn was latched onto the, in her mind, supremely perverted land lord. She knew that Su was a sleep hugger, as well as a sleep walker. However, she had told the naive 16-year old that Keitaro was one to stay away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to get the sleeping Molmolian girl off the land lord, but Su had a good grip. In fact, all she had managed to do, was to wake up Keitaro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, huh? What's going on?\" Keitaro asked, yawning and moving to rub his eyes. However, he soon realized he couldn't move his arms. Keitaro looked arond, before looking directly to his left, where he saw the sleeping face of Su, dreaming happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, if Su is here, then that means...' He thought, before he saw the form of Motoko standing above him. Forgetting what had transpired earlier that evning, he started to plead with the kendo practitioner, although it was quiet as he didn't wnat to wake anyone else. \"Please Motoko, don't hurt me! I didn't know she snuck in here again! I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko stood still for a moment, before she reached out to grab Su's arm once again. \"It is alright Urashima. I had got up to grab a glass of water, and when I came back, Su was no where to be found. Judging by her actions in the past, I figred she would come here.\" She said, causing Keitaro to remember what had happened earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro stood up, with a little help from Motoko, hoping Su would loosen her grip a bit to slide down to the bed. However, this had the unknown effect of making Su grab onto Motoko, getting both of them stuck in her vice grip face to face. Both Motoko and Keitaro blushed from the close contact of their faces. This also caused them to fall back onto Keitaro's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding with a small oomph from both vitcims, Motoko sighed. \"We will be here for a while Urashima.\" She said as she laid there, unable to move her arms as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, there was a long silence. After that, Keitaro decided he would start step two. \"Hey, Motoko?\" He asked, getting the girls attention. \"Can I ask you a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko looked at him, blush still on her face. She silently nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I want to ask is...\"</span></div></div>",

She figured that he deserved to know though, since he would likely be on the receiving end of more punishment that seemed unnecessarily harsh to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it started with my upbringing. I was taught to be a strong independent person, regardless of gender. I was told, that to rely on others was a sign of weakness, and I couldn't have that. I was to inherit the family dojo, and to take over as head of the family.\" She said, before she frowned. \"Well, that's not entirely true. My sister, Tsuruko, was to be next in line. However, she gave up the sword for love. She gave up her way of life, for a man! She thought she couldn't live with out him, so she was weak! And I hate him for making my sister weak. I refuse to be weak in any form, so I harden my heart to any men!\" She said. \"That, and the fact that all men are perverts. They think of nothing but violating women, for nothing but their own pleasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro didn't know what to say. So, he asked another question. \"Alright, so why do you hate me specifically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko was once again surprised. She felt the anger flow out of her. \"Why do I hate you? You ask why I hate you, but you do not look at your position.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this isn't my fault!\" Keitaro cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this position!\" She said, blushing even harder then before. \"I mean, look where you live. Look where you work! A man shouldn't live or work at a woman's dorm. Its just not right. Haruka should be the one who runs it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro just shook his head. \"Aunt Haruka has her hands full with the tea shop. She doesn't have time to run the dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko just blinked again. Why had none of the others thought out such a thing? In fact, why hadn't she? She cursed herself for not noticing sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Keitaro wasn't done. \"Besides, what makes you think I'm a horrible person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about all those 'accident's' that happen around here all the time? There is no way that one man can be that unlucky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro sighed once again. \"Motoko, if you were to ask any of my family, they would tell you I have been accident prone my entire life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko would have narrowed her eyes, but felt no need to do so. \"Alright, fine. Lets say you are very unlucky. But you still lust after women like any other man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro shook his head as much as he could. \"Your getting lust confused with natural human attraction. Just because I think about women does not mean I will actively seek them out in an attempt for my own pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko closed her eyes. \"That is enough for one night Urashima. No more questions. I still have my practice in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro sighed. Hopefully he did the second step right. \"Good night Motoko.\" He said, before he fell back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko just blushed lightly, soon falling back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, Su was hugging the both of them tighter then ever.</span></div></div>",

Su was probably working on something in her jungle lab/bedroom. It still surprised him about how she was able to make various plants and trees grow in her room. She even had a full grown banana tree in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro looked to the book again, and told himself he would work with Naru some other day. However, he never noticed that the book was influencing him ever so slowly, making him act more like a man, giving him a back bone so to speak. He would never have asked Motoko those questions last night, if the book didn't give an extra jolt of energy when it sensed the position he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the book, he turned it to step three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step three: Making them know that you are your own person, not someone who fits a mold.\" Keitaro read aloud. \"Huh, sounds like a good idea to me. Maybe I can get them to stop freaking out over every little thing I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To let them know you are your own person, you must have a sense of pride in what you do. You must show that you are glad to be who you are. Make them know of your faults. Let them hear of your past. Shatter what they once thought of you, and give them a better image then ever before.\" He read. \"But, it works even better if they divulged in some of their past and faults in step two. Talk to them when they are in a calm environment, and are relaxed. You will find them more willing to hear the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro sat down on the bed, and thought about what he just read. \"So, I should talk to Motoko after she gets done training, and when she takes her break.\" He looked over at his clock. \"7:24 huh? Well, she'll be taking her first break in about 6 minutes. So that'll be a good time to talk to her.\"</span></div></div>",

As he made his way up to the roof, he heard the other tenants sleeping away. (They were all on the way to the stairs, and some snored a little loud.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way up the stairs, he could hear the rush of a sword being swung. Slowly making his way up, for not wanting to startle her and make her hit him out of reflex, he saw her. She was standing there, sword over head, making vertical slashes in the air. Keitaro could see that she was starting to sweat, even from his position on the steps. 'Wow, she sure is amazing.' The thought drifted across the surface of his mind, not fully his own but still a part of what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her as she stopped her swinging, and breathed deeply. Deciding that now would be a good time, Keitaro walked up the steps as quietly as he could and leaned up against the rail to look into the sun rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko turned around, looking for the towel she brought up to wipe the sweat from her brow and palms. She, however, was shocked to see Keitaro. \"Is there something you need Urashima?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro was silent for a minute before he was ready to speak. \"Well, since what we talked about last night was rather personal for you, I figured it would only be fair to tell you a bit about myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not nessecary Urashima.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Motoko, I think it is.\" He said in a slightly forceful tone, surprising the kendo girl. \"I think that it would be better for everyone if you all started to get to know me. The real me, not as what you all see me as.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko stood there for a moment. Did any of the girls really know him? Shinobu idolized him, Su saw qualities similer to her big brother, Kitsune only saw a bank and comedy club, and both her and Naru saw him as another male, to be detested as something vile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, they reallly did not know who Keitaro Urashima was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Urashima. We will talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the next hour or so, Keitaro and Motoko sat there, talking about Keitaro's past, faults, dreams, and hobbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, the two had been sitting so close toghether, they had their arms wrapped around each others sshoulders. By the time Keitaro was done, Motoko had a lot to think over, maybe their manager wasn't so bad after all. Smelling a wonderful smell wafting up from the kitchen area, and their stomachs growling at thm, the two decided that it was time for breakfest.</span></div></div>",

However, the next step said in giant bold red letters that he needed to have any other women that usually hated his existence to think differently. Sighing to himself, Keitaro wondered how he would do that. Kitsune was passed out in her room, Naru was out to town helping Shinobu with groceries, and Su didn't hate him in the slightest. In fact, he didn't think it was possibly for the girl to hate anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Keitaro was leafing through the book, he noticed some strange symbols in it. Already aware that this book wasn't normal, but not really caring (He would care, but he DID spend a whole night next to it, and had spent most of his waking day near it today, so it kinda sapped his morals, but not by much.) that it seemed to be something on a totally different level. Who was he going to kid? Weird stuff happened around the Hinata inn for a long, long time. Why, the annex had to be closed, because of a curse that whoever said their love for each other there, whether drunk or being tricked, as long as they said it of their own free will, those two would be together forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the time that one hundred year old doll came to life because Keitaro looked like his grandfather as a kid. It just wanted to be played with one last time. And it was so nice too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he gets up and sets the book down.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that day, around 3:30, Keitaro had finished most of the fixing up he had to do. Breathing heavily of the fresh air, he decided that he would head back to his room and rest, possibly find something to help with Naru. He knew that even her hatred for him was stronger then most things. Considering she had enough fire power in one punch to send him into the lower parts of the stratosphere, he was a little wary. But the book hadn't lead him astray yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving back to his room, he quickly picked up the book and began flipping through it. Finding the pages that contained the strange symbols again, he noticed something called 'the gift of forgiveness.' Wondering what it was, he quickly began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gift of Forgiveness is a truly special thing. It grants the user the ability to say 'I'm sorry' through almost any medium, for nearly anything, even stuff that happened in the past that would never be forgiven in the eyes of the receiver.\" He read, before having to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a strange sound. It sounded like...tearing? He looked around for where the noise could be coming from. His pants? No. His bed sheets? No, that wasn't it either. Looking up, he saw Naru's Lidou-kun doll was stuck on some slightly splintered boards. Knowing how much that doll meant to the girl, he tried to get a step ladder to grab it. While he succeeded in getting the step ladder, he had got a hold of the doll when<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething exploded below, causing him to fall of the step ladder, ripping the doll as he pulled it with him. As he landed, he saw the arm of the little cartoon squirrel fly at his face. Getting up, doll arm in hand, he looked around the room, trying to find the other pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head had landed on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other arm and one foot were knocked slightly under the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last foot had landed in the glass of water he had set up on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torso and tail were still in his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man this thing went everywhere. But now I got to sew it back together AND find out what just happened.' He thought, before he decided to shrug it off for now. He had worked real had today. He needed a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the book back up, he began to read again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the Gift of Forgiveness is a powerful ritual. As such, the effects are powerful. However, the medium used as the gift has to be something that the receiver holds close to their heart. Simply place the medium on the runic circle shown in the book, and the ritual will be immediate. Also note, that if the gift is broken, the ritual will repair it, as long as it is not beyond repair. Once the ritual is done, simply give the gift back to the receiver and ask 'Can you forgive me?' They should only be able to blush, nod their head and say 'All is forgiven.' Use this if the person you are trying to talk to is a person to normally be wary of. Also note that this effect is increased if the giver and receiver are stuck in a embarrassing situation. Due to this, it is best to wear the spray from step one. Also note that this actually passes step two for the receiver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro just stared at the page for a while, before he quickly gathered up the pieces of the Lidou-kun and placed them on the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was half expecting there to be a bright flash of light. Sadly he was disappointed. All it did was make the circle glow red, before it let off a puff of smoke. When the smoke cleared, the doll was back in perfect shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at that, Keitaro picked up the doll, and went off in search of a compromised Naru.</span></div></div>",

Normally he wouldn't think that, but the tome of infinite pervertedness was starting to drain more of his morals even quicker. One thing the Eronomicon did was corrupt the marked harem god, ever so slightly at first, but faster as time went by, and even faster, in a burst, if the user followed the directions to a T in getting in a normally embarrassing position or used something in it, like the gift of forgiveness ritual. That one drained up a lot of morality. Now, if only Keitaro wasn't such a good fellow in the beginning, he would have taken a larger drop in morality into another zone of actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his searching for Naru, he noticed a dropped article of clothing. Walking up to it, he saw that it was a bra. Specifically Naru's. The one that she wore when she punched him into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking it up, he smiled. He knew where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Laundry room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro stood outside the laundry room, bra and doll in hand. He heard Naru mutter about losing a bra through the door. He smirked as he put his hand on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the door open, Naru looked to see who it was. Seeing that it was Keitaro, she started to get angry again. And just like the last time she wanted to get angry at him, she smelled something so good, it caused her to forget any anger. Considering she was only in bra and panties at the moment, she was very embarrassed. Seeing the bra in Keitaro's hand, she was even more embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yeah? Is th-there s-s-something you need K-K-Keitaro?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro lifted up the hand with her bra, holding it in front of her. \"I believe this is yours.\" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed harder at that. Going to snatch the bra away, she noticed what was in the other hand. \"My Lidou-kun doll! But, why do you have him Keitaro?\" She asked, genuine curiosity was etched onto her face as she looked at him, still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, remember when you hit me hard the other day?\" He asked, making her think for a moment before she nodded. \"Well, I think that you caused some of the wood to brake, giving it just enough room to fall down into my room. However, with everything that was going on today, what with Su making things explode, I think it got caught on the way down on those broken boards. When I noticed, it was just starting to tear. I had tried to grab it, but as soon as I got a hold of it, something else exploded. This knocked the step ladder out from under me, and I fell, bringing little Lidou-kun with me. He... kinda fell to pieces after that. But,\" he said after Naru clutched the doll to her chest. \"I sewed him back together, good as new. So, I have to ask.\" He said, making the girl look into his eye's. \"Can you forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru felt very strange upon hearing those words. She felt as if Keitaro didn't need to even ask for forgiveness. After all, it wasn't her fault her Lidou-kun doll was torn apart, now was it? She also felt as if some events that she didn't feel like ever forgiving the ronin for, seemed petty. With those thought in mind, she blushed even harder, remembering all the time he had groped her, saw her like he was doing now, or did something that she found perverted. She felt as if those didn't matter anymore. Looking back to her dorm manager, she nodded, a smile on her face. \"All is forgiven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the tension left the room. It was calm. Very calm.</span></div></div>",

Do you think we could talk?\" He asked, causing the girl to look at him with a blush, doll still clutched to her chest. She soon nodded in assent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for the next hour or so, while Naru's clothes went through the washer, Keitaro told her about himself. His dreams, his fault, his hopes, his past. He told a lot more then she knew about him, that's for sure. All the while, Naru clutched the Lidou-kun to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing the Eronomicon did, was combine two or more rituals together, in hopes of making it easier for the marked god. What it combined with the Gift of Forgiveness was a little charm that made the holder more attracted to the giver of what ever it was, making the recipient of the gift, also feel more secure around and more willing to be opened minded about the giver. It also rolled up a nice little ritual that made the object more likely to be held, by making the receiver want to carry it around with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, all in all, Naru would be a lot better around Keitaro, AND she would become his faster then normal. It was a nice way to begin his harem of the Hinata inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was said and done. Naru got her clothes from the drier, and made her way up to her room. After she left, Keitaro also made his way up to his room.</span></div></div>",

He thought that she just liked to make a quick buck for gambling or sake, or to get a cheap laugh from his misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when he got to the page that was step four, he noticed something odd. All the red text was gone. Skipping ahead in the book, he noticed that there was red text on any other pages that he wasn't up to in terms of steps. Going back to step four, he shrugged and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that the women that hate your entire existence are now 'tamed' and know about you, and you know some of them, it's time for bonding. You must bond with each girl, by doing things with them that they like.\" He read. \"What, by drinking or gambling with Kitsune? Like that? Well, alright...\" He said, unsure of how that would turn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must spend enough time with each one that they will eventually will start to do things you ask them. Little things, like 'Hey, (Insert girls name here), will you go tell (Insert persons name here) that I need to see them.' or 'Hey (Insert girls name), can you go get me (insert food or drink that is easily obtainable)? I'm (insert either doing something important or are a little busy taking a well deserved brake from doing something physical, such as after a large workout or doing something that requires lots of physical exertion.)' Doing so will make everything easier, and bring their true feelings up to the surface. But first, place your hand on the seal on the next page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on the next page, Keitaro noticed that there was indeed a seal. It cover the entire page, being rectangular, instead of round like the other seals he had seen. Curious, he put his right hand on the seal. Suddenly he felt a slight jolt of pain run up his arm. Ripping his hand away from the book, Keitaro shook his arm in pain, trying to get it to stop feeling like it had gotten caught in another of one of Su's robot arm wrestling matches. Wondering what the book did to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on the page next to the seal, he read \"This seal is one that makes the one who is touched by the hand that touches the seal, want to spend time with the person who touched them. It cam be simply a hand shake or pat on the shoulder, or it can be more intimate, such as a hug. Either way, the person who is touched, will be more willing to spend time with the person on whom the seal is placed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the book didn't tell Keitaro, with him still having a good grasp of his morals, (Dang him and his superb good nature and sense of morals!), was that the seal also had a slightly pleasurable feeling to those touched by that hand. The longer the touch, or more intimate the touch, the more pleasure will be generated. It wouldn't be anything to spectacular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sudden increase of arousal or anything like that. Just that it would make the person touched want more of the person to touch them, or be in situations that could lead to being even grazed with the hand. Very slowly. In fact, so slowly that it would be faster to watch a snail climb a house wall, but still, the effect would be there.</span></div></div>",

He also told her he would upgrade the kitchen slowly when they had the money to do so safely. That had gotten him major points with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Su, he was both a test subject and and observer, critiquing her experiments when they weren't aimed at him. He also was a sounding board for her. He may not have known what she was talking about at the time, but he figured she wanted someone to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Kitsune, the inns party girl, he did indeed get drunk and gamble, just not at the same time. Some how, he also got into a groping match with the woman when he was drunk once. He used mostly his right hand, so she was a lot warmer to him after that. He also inflated the inns bank account during the gambling, much to Kitsune's and Shinobu's joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sparred with Motoko for the couple of days he spent with her. Well, he was mostly a training dummy, but he could move and dodge, and on occasion parry her with his right hand, better then anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Naru, he spent most of the time studying. He noticed she had her Lidou-kun doll with her when he saw her around the inn. He still had to get into Tokyo-U, the most prestigious college in all of Japan if he wanted to do something with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, Keitaro also had to help his aunt Haruka in the tea shop. She had needed his help with dealing with the increase in business. He had inadvertently 'touched' his aunt with his right hand many a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had also gotten a phone call from Granny, who also seemed to have taken his adopted sister, Kanako, on the trip as a bodyguard. She had a little bit of a brother-complex, ever since they were younger. She always wanted to be with him whenever possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of that week and a half, he had gotten them all to the point were he could ask things of them, like the book had said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the week that Keitaro had gotten to bond with everyone in the inn, the Eronomicon was not an idle thing. It had been sapping Keitaro of his morals left and right, draining them as he got to know the girls. But his morals were still so damned high! If a book could get infuriated, the eronomicon would be beyond furious. It wouldn't tell the master what the fifth step would do, it would only tell him that it would make everyones life a lot better. After all, in the nature of how it had worked, to hide what it truly was, it had given the master the ability to make every ones life better by easing the tension, calming everyone down, and by making everyone better in understanding each other. The master would find no problem with what it would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it had to trick him to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, after Keitaro had finished his part of the chores, having got the girls to take their fair share (Except Shinobu. She did a lot around the house as it was. She actually got a lighter load.) He was flipping through the Eronomicon. He thought he was ready to do step five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned to the page, he was greeted with a page that had considerably less writing on it than previous ones. All it said was \"Step five: A better life for you. First, copy the seal on the next page many times. Then, cover the ceiling in the seals. Then, bring every girl you have been interacting with to the room with the seals. Touch the book again after that. What happens will be better for everyone involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro looked at the next page, and saw yet another seal, but this one was far more complex than any he had seen in the book. Except for the one that had it's name and description crossed out. That one was so complex, that to follow any one line gave a horrible headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro shrugged. The book hadn't lied to him before, so why would it now? Deciding to take the book with him to a print shop tomorrow, he went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning, he got up and made his way into town, book in hand. In fact, it was the first time the book had left his room. Making his way to a local print shop, he made about two dozen copies of the seal. On his way home, he thought about how much happier the Hinata was. And it was all thanks to the large book in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way home, he proceeded to cover the ceiling of his room in the seals, before he set down the book on the desk. Popping up to ask Naru to bring everyone, including his aunt, to his room, he was going to give everyone some good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was true, considering that he had gotten a large sum of cash for helping some associates in the manga business with some of their late drawings, helping out many mangaka with keeping their jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone gathered, Keitaro put his hand on the book.</span></div></div>",

This also caused Keitaro to suddenly stop caring about whether or not he accidentally groped someone, or walked in on them. While the tasks the Eronomicon had set for him had lead him to embarrassing situations, he still had to mentally prepare himself for each one that he walked into deliberately. During the accidental ones, he still freaked out majorly, even though the girls did nothing in retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time though, he felt as if it didn't matter to him. And the girls felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't care if he walked in on them, or groped them accidentally. While they wouldn't deliberately show anything, they all felt as if Keitaro could do little wrong. Why, they felt as if their feelings for Keitaro multiplied, making some of the less intimate feel like they could love him more then they ever thought possible. They realized the only reason they hit him, was not out of anger, but out of embarrassment. The ones who felt more friendly with Keitaro, such as Shinobu and Su, felt as if their love for him had grown in leaps and bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Haruka, the only relative of his in the room, didn't know what to feel. She felt like the girls who were less intimate with Keitaro, but he had only caught her in an embarrassing situation once. There was also the fact that they were family, but that seemed to make a quick get away from the rest of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the light fades, and the paper with the seals disintegrated, leaving nothing behind to show they were there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days after the ritual, Keitaro noticed the Tokyo-U entrance exams were fast approching. He had little time for the Eronomicon for a while, though he kept it by him most of the time. A few more what would be emerrassing situations happened, but really no one cared about that fact. It seemed natural to all included. Even Haruka came around the inn more often. The girls had even agreed unanimously to allow Keitaro to come into the hot springs with them. After all, what point was there to exclude him any more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach event that occured as such, however, began to bind the girls to Keitaro more and more. It was a slow process, but not as slow as before. Keitaro did find another seal in the book however, that said that it was a permanent application of the anger diffusing spray. He quickly used that seal, even though it did take the better part of a day that could be spent studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, after this, the girls of the Hinata inn, and even the surrounding township, wanted to spend more time with the ever growing in power harem god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eronomicon added another part to the ritual once again, making the seal include a lust aura spell that it had picked up from a two thousand year old arch-wizard that didn't look a day over sixteen, and had the hormones to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also caused him to lose more of his study time, as the girls started to spend more time with him. He and Shinobu spent time together in the kitchen, making various things for the other to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner depending on when Shinobu could grab him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko made him spar with her. She said that he might as well learn how to fight if the need should ever arise. This vastly improved his self esteem and his combat skills. Even though he thought he would never need to know how to fight anyone with a sword. (Hint hint)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Su, he learned about her home country, Molmol. It was a small island nation the was out in the middle of the Pacific. He learned the costums and its culture. Although, once when the time passed into night, it turned into the night of the red moon. Su that night, had transformed into an older, more curvy version of herself. She also tried to jump Keitaro's bones, but was quickly stopped by Su's sister, who had come to take her back. It turns out she had been a runaway princess, who wanted to enjoy her life before she was stuck with politics and getting married. However, Su's sister, Amalla, was also subjegated to Keitaros lust aura, so she began to live there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Kitsune, he spent his time gambling on horse races and playing virtual poker for money over the internet. It turns out he had huge amounts of luck, that the Eronomicon was also multipling by many times, increasing his luck to a cosmic scale. He had quickly inflated the inns bank account once again. She also started to hang off of him more, and was more insistent he begin groping her. This also lead to many heated sessions were they almost did the deed. But Kitsune would always be the one to pull back surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time spent with Naru was studing. Or at least, it was supposed to be. Like Kitsune, they had gotten in many a heated sessions, but never as far as Kitsune. She did however, begin to think that he was a very smart person, and took stuff he said to be smarter then it was some of the time. He would always tell her that he wasn't sure though, and that she check to make sure for her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helpped Haruka in her tea shop more often when he got the chance. She was also a lot different around him. Before, she would be aloof, while still caring for him. But now, she began to actually be happy when she was around him. One time, when he was getting there to help, he heard her chewing some guy out who was only there to hit on her. He had finally had enough of his stupid pick up lines, and bad mouthing the only male helper in the store in an attepmt to get into her pants. She had actually kicked him out of her store, and told him if he evr came back, she would have some 'connections' deal with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, it was time for the exams...</span></div></div>",

After the failed attempt, the meeting had gone on, telling them all that he had come into some money and was able to make some much needed improvments to the inn and tea shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Keitaro did notice some things different on the first day, not moments after he finished the meeting. Kitsune was not so subtly, and yet still subtly, ask if he would come to her room for some 'manual labor'. She also latched onto his arm in the process, but that was no different then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others showed no sign for the next day or so, with the first being Shinobu of all people! She had asked that he help her with some simple chores that she did around the house. However, at one point a peice of laundry had gotten stuck in a point that only she could reach because of her small stature. It had been a gust of wind that blew it away and got it stuck. However, she had played the timid girl act, causing Keitaro to help the girl in the task. She needed a ladder to get to the small alcove that it had been blown to. (Sounds pretty conveniant, huh?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the ladder for her, and promising to hold it for her, she began the climb. After she had gotten up and into the alcove, (It was a strong gust of wind apparently!) they ran into a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keitaro-sempai...\" She managed to squeak out, despite what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck.\" She said, hoping that the manager was going to come up to see if a little tug would unstick her. Her plan worked perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Don't worry Shinobu! I'll see if I cant pull you out!\" He said as he began to climb the laddder. However, when he got to the top, a surprise was waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that surprise was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pantiless Shinobu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeitaro stopped in his tracks.

The ones that seemed to be in anime all over the place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she was wearing one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was pantiless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat means Keitaro saw everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEVERYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood immeaditetly went from his entire body down to his.. ehem. His 'little Keitaro.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he promptly passed out, falling down the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sempai?\" Shinobu once again squeked. \"Sempai? Keitaro? Anyone? Oh, not good.\" She said, now that she was actually stuck from trying to make a show of trying to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keitaro had that vision burned into his brain forever, events to place inside the waking world.

Her mission was simple enough in theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestroy the shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something went wrong. This shadow was powerful. It alone had caused many deaths in that one hour. One hour had allowed it to kill over 30 people, mostly scientists that had created it, but there were also innocents killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo were killed upon a bridge, bathed in the glowing green light of the moon in this dark hour. The monstosity of a being was waiting for her to attack, hoping to claim another. But Aigis saw her chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe son of the two killed upon the bridge. He was crying. He saw his parents turn into coffins before his eyes, then a horrifying creature had appeared, roaring much to frightening for almost any child to be able to bear. It had killed his parents, stealing the life from the coffins around it, leaving the boy untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know for a fact that they were dead, but when The shadow was attacked by a girl, it had been slammed into the front of the car, destroying the wind shield, and part of the front in and of itself. He knew then that they were dead. The boys father had told him if the car was struck in such a way, those in front would die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, here was a boy, around the age of seven. He was driving along with his family home. Then, he was thrown into this twisted world, parents dead, and a battle raging outside his hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked his head up to see if he could run. Thats when his eyes meet with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis knew the boy was her only hope of beating the shadow. She could only hope to seal him in the boy. If she were fully human, she would be saddened by this. But she wasn't human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a Anti Shadow Weapon, or ASW for short. For her, the mission would come before everything. So, she began the process. She summoned her persona, a facet of her soul, and had it grapple with the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster and the girl were still battleing, when he heard the faint sound of breaking glass. Then, he saw a big... thing, appear out of nowhere, attacking the moster. He took this as a chance to run. Opening the car door, he made a run for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least he would have, had Aigis not appeared in front of him and picking him up. He tried to struggle. But was being held to tightly. \"I am sorry.\" Were the only words he heard, before the now scary girls eyes started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her persona had grappled with the demon, Aigis had noticed the boy try to run. The mission had declared that he was necessary for the situation. The dark hour had not turned him into a coffin, so he would be a sutible host for the shadow. She quickly jumped over to him, leaving her persona to hold the shadow for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly begining the process that was that was unknown to her, she started to seal the shadow in the boy. It would have the side affect of sealing away most of his emotions and the memories of this night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnkown to the ASW though, was the addition of another thing being seald in the boy. A tome of surprising thickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would soon become a facet of his soul, just like the shadow.</span></div></div>",

The place where his parents had died. He didn't remember much about that time, but who would? It would be one hell of a repressed memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after he got off the train, he was dead tired. It was nearing midnight so of course he would be tired. However, when it hit midnight, everything got weird. People turned into coffins, the water became blood, the sky went green and everything electronical died. That included his presious mp3 player. How was he supposed to listen to 'Burn my dread' now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, he had made his way though the seemingly dead town, but felt completely at ease. He made it to the dorm, only to find that it had lights on inside. Walking in, he took note of the lobby. It looked nice enough, with a decent sitting area, a dining room type area so the dorm mates could hold meetings he supposed. Why, even the front desk looked nice. Though the weird kid behind it did not make anything easier to accept that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter signing a contract that stated that he would take responobilities for his actions, the boy stated something that made his head hurt. \"Time delivers us to the same end.\" He said as he made the contract dissapear, before doing so himself. He reappeared in the sitting area. \"You cant cover your ears or close your eyes.\" He said, as the darkness engulffed the room, leaving the boys arm as it too, slowly vanished, becoming part of the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird phenominon was still occuring when this girl with brown hair had stepped around the corner. He could see the flash of green moonlight off the gun that was strapped to her thigh. They stared at eachother, before the girl seemed to go for the gun. Another girl seemed to stop her at just the right time. The older girl, one Mitsuru, intriduced her self and the gun weilding one, Yukari, and said that he would soon be transffered to another dorm in a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the rest of the night went well. Although, considering he went to bed very shortly afterwards probebly had something to do with that. However, when Yukari was asked about the contract, she seemed to be ignorant of its existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was the first day for school, and as such he was told by Yukari that Mitsuru had trusted the gun totting girl to look after him for the first day or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was a blur of unimportent stuff. Principal was a horrible speaker, his teacher was somewhat weird, and some one named Junpei Iori had somehow became one of his first friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after that was rather simple as well. However, he did have a very vivid dream about a man with a long nose named Igor, some girl who looked ready to be a flight attendent named Elizabeth, in a room called the Velvet room that looked suspiciously like an elevator. The man had said something about signing a contract, given him a key to the Velvet room, and sent him back the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school that day, everything had gone normally how one would expect. He and Junpei had walked away from the school and had hung out for the little bit of the day left. Afterwards, he had gone back to the dorm and had gone to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the shit storm hit the fan. Yukari had woken him up, and had told him they needed to leave. She wouldn't explain, but she looked panicked. He also noticed it was that strange time of night again. Not wanting any lives to be in danger, he had followed her as she ran down stairs. However, the back door was being beaten down, so they had to run upstairs to the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thats were we catch up with the preseant. Now, there was this enormaus thing that had a bunch of hands weilding knives, with one that held a mask that seemed to be what it saw through. Yukari pulled out the gun she had nearly shot him with just two nights ago. Minato thought she was going to shoot the black blob thing. But no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHE POINTED THE THING AT HERSELF!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hesitated in pulling the trigger, which caused the thing to back hand her, sending her flying while the gun skittered to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also noticed he got a good view of her under garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, he noticed the gun. Slowly, despite the situation, he knelt down and picked it up. When he stood back up however, he was greeted by the strange kid that made him sign the contract. The kid made a gun sign with his hand, and pointed it to the side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" The boy said. Minato raised the gun to his head, as he started to hyperventilate. Soon though, that stopped, and he uttered one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Per...so...na.\" He said as he pulled the trigger. Instead of blood and brains coming out the side of his head, the sound of breaking glass was heard and a shower of glowing blue glass shot out the side of his head. An aura surrounded him as a figure rose behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure was some kind of robot if one were to see it and haserd a guess. Its silver body was odd, having thick shoulders, elboxs, knees and feet. It had a somewhat human head, though its face was devoid of any charecteristics. The beings mouth and eyes glowed a burning orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thou art I, and I am thou. From the sea of thine soul i am called. I am Orpheus, master of strings.\" It said as it floated behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething went wrong though. Pain erupted in Minato's head, and it showed on Orpheus as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething burst out of Orpheus, destroying the body from the inside as arms burst from the head of the persona. The sound of shattering glass made itself heard as the body of Orpheus was fully destroyed, showing the being in all its glory. It was vaugly huminoid, with clothes as black as a dark, cloudy night with a new moon It had pure white gloves and boots, with a pure white hat like thing that looked like a skull over itface, the jaw of it extemly pointed and open, showing that it had no face to speak of. There were thirteen coffins connected to its neck and eachother by the way of various chains, making it a cape of death. It also carried a strange sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pain made his vision blurry, The monter that he had summoned completely destroyed the thing in front of him. However, before it vanished, the being once again screamed in pain, causing Minato to nearly black out. The deathly being infront of him screamed as it shattered into a shower of... pink glass? That was new. He expected it to be blue again. But then again, he was fighting some horrible thing with another horrible thing, so why the hell not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what the thing left, was a book. And not just any book. It left the Eronomicon. The book he had bonded with, even unknowingly, was outside his soul. And now it could begin its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the presence of a women near by, aka Yukari, it cast a modified Marin Karin. It was one of the spells a persona could use, and would be most accepted as of right now. The master couldn't protect it, or truely call it to the mortal plain of existance quiet yet, so it did the next best thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the Marin Karin it did was modified to always hit, and only work on the female gender. It also healed the female of any wounds or exaustion. And, it was permenant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarin Karin was a spell thatcharmed foes into doing nothing. However, this Marin Karin made it so that the one who was hit with it would feel a great desire for the master. It also had several other effects, but those will be explained at a later date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts work done, the Eronomicon let itself fade back to the marked ones soul. Orpheus replaced the glowing image of the book, before he too dissapeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll trhe creatures defeated, Minato let himself fall foward. He never hit the ground however, because Yukari caught him. No one else noticed the blush on her face though.</span></div></div>",

Still, even though he was sure that the insides would be as incomprehensible as the cover, Minato opened up the book to see if there was anything that would take his mind off things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marin Karin.</b>  That was the first line of text, with accompanying Japanese translation.  It explained that when employed on a compatible female, that female would find herself in peak health and become passionate towards the user.  Wait, did that mean...Minato couldn't remember ever using anything like that on Yukari, but that was the only explanation for her sudden sensual behavior towards him.  Minato then read on, noticing that the effects would change over time as his bond with the subject grew stronger and deeper; it was frustratingly vague on the details of the further effects, but the gist was that they would all be sexually related, designed to bring mutual pleasure to both parties and even ensure their safety, strengthening them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato rubbed his head; it was strange, but to be honest it didn't seem all that bad, and there was a small, or not-so-small really, part of him that liked seeing Yukari shaking her thing for him.  So much of his life had been a gray-blue haze since the death of his parents, what was wrong with some pink and white making it into his life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he fell back asleep, unable to question the logic of being able to sleep in a dream, or wherever it was that he was.  The book vanished back into him.</span></div></div>",

He looked around for the book he had encountered the night before. However, he noticed no sign of it. He wondered if he had dreamt the previous day entirely. The girl he only met teasing him with her body? A book that said that he had somehow charmed her to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigments of a creative mind after all. There was no other way to explain it. He would have to be raving mad to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mentally sighed though. He didn't think it would be that bad though, if that were to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, he enjoyed the sensations he was feeling, even if it was his mind tricking him. The sight of Yukari's ass in her tight panties as she bent over tantalized his mind. The memory felt so real though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shaken from these thoughts when he heard the door to his room open, allowing one Mitsuru Kirijo to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. I assume you slept well?\" She asked, a pleseant tone one would hear from someone who is paid to ask those words with kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato silently nodded his head as he turned to face the red haired woman. However, due to his previous train of thought, he took notice of her shaply body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent no longer then a second looking her over, as any teenaged male would. He saw how her shirt was tight across her chest, seemingly enlarging her full breasts. It ran down the sides of her upper body, not exactly clinging, but very close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a skirt, which hid most of her legs from his veiw, the other part of her legs being held withn almost knee length boots with high heels. But he noticed how her waist was slim and her hips were a good size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his eyes to her face, so as to not get caught staring. He liked how her long hair flowed mostly behind her, with the left side of her face slightly hidden by her hair. It added that aura of mystery to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minato? Are you listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice cut Minato from his musings about her. \"Sorry. I'm still a little tired. I just woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru nodded. \"Understandable. I was saying that the dotors might let you leave later today. They found nothing wrong with you, other then a severe case of exaustion.\" She said before she turned around and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato breathed out. 'Good. I want out as soon as possible.' He thought.</span></div></div>",

He breasts weren't on Mitsuru's level, but they were still a delight to his eye.  \"Looks like you're ready to ditch the hospital and get back to the dorm, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so.\"  Minato then strove to make sure that his eyes remained on Yukari's...which itself proved a bit dangerous due to the alluring look she gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't I go ahead and show you the shortest route back to the dorms?  Or maybe you'd like a tour, see what our little city has to offer to a fine man like yourself.\"  As she said this, she walked up very close to Minato, and almost made like she was about to rub her hip against his; at least, it seemed like she almost did, Minato figured that he was probably imagining that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari?\"  Minato said as he motioned her out of his room; he figured that if they walked while they talked, progress would be made in at least one regard.  \"Um, I'm curious, we've only just met, yet you seem very...taken with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, observant and smart.\"  She said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I'm just, I'm wondering if it's anything in particular you...\"  Minato waved his hand in a circle, trying to urge the words out of Yukari.</span></div></div>",

Why does our school have anything to do anything in that freaky hour?\" Junpei ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. If you would shut up and watch Stupei, you might learn something.\" Yukari said, standing close to Minato. Mitsuru had arrived just a minute before Midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the clock struck midnight, and everything turned green, Junpei got the answer to his question. Their school rumbled before it exploded into activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt twisted, spun, arched, expanded, contrasted and groaned as it reached upwards, twisting itself into a tower that didn't seem like it would be able to support itself. There were random holes in the building, with giant portions of the tower not truely fitting together. There were parts of the tower that jutted out at random and un even intervals, with strange chains hanging from the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it was a etrancing sight. It looked unearthly, defieying the very laws of nature. It was strangly beautiful, but horrifying at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" Mitsuru said, breaking the silence. \"Is Tartarus. A nest of shadows if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei looked up at the tower. \"What the hell? What happened to our school!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns into this every night at midnight. It has for a while, and it will for every night past tonight until we learn how to stop it.\" Akihiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato couldn't help but feel drawn to the tower. It seemed to be calling him. It begged him to find the secrets it held. Silently walkng forward, with Yukari next to him with the other three not far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Fourty five minutes later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato slashed the mask of a shadow, making it dissperce into black particles. He felt better then he had before. Earlier, he had a conversation with Elizabeth about the things he might find, such as answers and riches, inside the terrifying tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizibeth had said that there was a facet of his soul that was almost ready to give itself a physical form, which made Minato confused. he hopped it wasn't the giant monster with the coffin cape. He didn't want to fight that thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the presant, Minato felt like he could run a lap, which made no sense. He had spent the last half hour fighting a horde of the damned things, only having very small minute or so breaks in between the larger fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had also discovered twon new persona, both female ones. Apsaras, a provocitivly dressed dancing girl who controlled ice, and Pixie, a persona that could fit in his hand that healed wounds. He had the distinct impression both were flirting with him, judging by how they each brushed their bodies against his when he summoned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei was running a little low on energy, but Yukari seemed ready to go as he was, only lightly panting. Happening upon the next shadow, who ran away once he caught sight of Minato, the three had summarilly beaten the ever loveing crap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Minato felt a tingling sensation. It wasn't physical. No, it seemed to be coming from within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped his head as it started to slightly hurt, before a light appeared in front of him. The light, which slowly started to form something, started to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light show had finished, Minato found himself holding a large worn tome. The very same he had seen on the night he went to the hospital, and after Yukari had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eronomicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato blinked owlishly at the book, wondering if he was imagining things. Deciding that it wouldn't hurt, he opened the front cover which had writing in it in perfect japanese. \"This is the physical form of the Eronomicon, marked one. There is still a part of it, connected to your soul. If you have need of it, just call out to it. It is bound to heed your words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato nodded, now sure that the past apperences of the book wasn't a dream. Placing the book under his arm, he set off to find one of the access gates to get out of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~First floor~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato stepped form the access gate, with Yukari following close behind him and Junpei lagging just behind. He still had the book, with his imitation katana in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission complete.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru nodded. \"Good work. I think we should leave now though. The dark hour is nearly ending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three nodded, as Minato felt an ancient voice in his head. 'Yes. She would be a good one to join you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a shadow appeared behind Mitsuru, ready to attack. Minato, thinking quickly, used his evoker. He pressed the barrel of the gun against his head like he had done many times that noght and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the normal blue shards of glass, Minato found pink shards flying from his head from the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfront of him, a spectral tome appeared, looking like the one he carried under his arm. The pages opened, sending a wave of fire at the shadow, and a wave of something hidden under that at Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth waves hit their targert, the fire hitting the shadow, making it burn to ash. The unknown energy however, hit Mitsuru, making her collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the clock on the tower started to chime as the tower started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move!\" Akihiko said as he grabbed the dead on his feet Junpei, while Minato and Yukari ran towards the downed Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Yukari, Minato and Mitsuru get out in time?</span></div></div>",

A nice cut of ham, three slices of bacon, two eggs, hashbrowns and toast. The ham smelt delicious, along with the bacon. Said bacon was cooked to perfection, not burnt or greasy. The eggs were seemingly fried. The hashbrowns were golden and crispy. The toast was toasted a little under what he would have liked, but not by much. It all seemed delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even get to say a quick 'thank you' before he felt hands rubbing his shoulders. The fingers were trailing across the spots that he felt stiffness from because of all the battling he had done the previous night. They hit the spots perfectly, with just the right amount of pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not long after that started, he felt two very squishy globes of flesh press up against his back. He kinda liked it. Squashing those thoughts, he tried to eat the nice breakfast Mitsuru had made for him. However, 'tried' was the key word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never know how distracting it was to have a woman press her full chest against your back until it had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also didn't help matters when She started to breath on his neck. Her hot breath felt rather good against his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after trying to eat and failing, he decided that he might as well give up for now, and leave early to grab something from the strip mall on his way to school.</span></div></div>",

He dusted off his pants, looking to see if anything had possibly ripped or fallen from his pockets during the fall. Seeing nothing, he turned to Miss Toriyumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" He asked. She nodded, before she stumbled to the side without even moving.

Minato slipped past her so that Mitsuru could tell her to not be so forward, and made it into class...with Miss Toriyumi, who gave him that look that said that she hadn't forgotten their arrangement for after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, come the end of the school day, he waited for everyone else to leave, and when they were alone, Miss Toriyumi stood up.  \"Follow me, Mister Arisato.\"  Minato did as told, determined to ignore the way she seemed to put more movement into her hips than was strictly necessary.  They entered the teacher's office and she directed him to a seat.  \"I just need you to organize this stack of papers.  It's just tedious, not nearly as fun as exploring an online world or as worthwhile as helping a young man cope with years of loneliness...\"  The wink she added at the end drove Minato to begin his work right away.</span></div></div>",

It seemed that, despite her complaints of how she was overworked and the rumors that she was lazy when it came to her work, she had actually put a dent in making the pile smaller then what Minato would imagine it to be. By no means what it small though. No, he had to stand up to reach the top papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Minato managed to fully orginize them by name, class, the grade earned and all that stuff. It seemed that it wouldn't be as big if they didn't have to copy each paper a few times. Why did they do that? Did they really take orginization so seriously here that they made tripicates at the least of every paper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minato got up to leave, Miss Toriyumi walked back in. She looked at the spot on her desk that was formerly covered in papers, only to see it quite clean and paper free. \"Wow.

Well, I'll take that as a compliment and head on home now.

Miss Toriyumi had never moved away from the door after she shut it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her, confusion on his face. \"Um, you do know that we are in the office, not out of it, right?\" He asked, getting a nod from the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato felt his heart sink. He had a feeling he knew what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Toriyumi sauntered over to him, swaying her hips more pronounced then earlier. Ofcourse.

Minato shuddered at the memory of what happened with the masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he checked the book, and sure enough, there was a way to seal Toriyumi's libido...with certain restrictions; he could seal away her libido, but only temporarily, and the seal would have to be periodically lifted, during which time Toriyumi's libido would be so amplified that it would be impossible to restrain, and would in fact be dangerous to her health if he were not on hand to...<i>administer treatment</i>, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was better than the present situation, right?

Now, everyone has had this dream before. You know, the one where your somewhere importent and naked. Some variations were that you were in you underwear at this place, such as school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he knew those dreams. He was never actually in control of them. They just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he could move on his own. His arms, his legs, his neck, everything.

But it was for naught, for that last string of self control had snapped, torn in two at the feeling that he was recieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato felt himself cum, absently watching the two girls fight over it with their mouths and hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, It would be okay. Okay to follow those base instincts. But he would have to be careful. He didn't want to alarm anyone. Wether it be Elizabeth or the people at school. He needed to keep up the act.

He grabbed a handfull of each breast, squeezing them firmly. Milk leaked from Mitsuru faster as a result as she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato gropped and kneaded her breasts as he looked her in the eyes as she moaned continuously as his hands mauled her over-grown chest.

It was geting good as well.\" Mitsuru said, her voice a mock pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato looked at her. He Knew she wouldn't mind him ordering her around in sexual aspects. She seemed to almost demand it by the way she and Yukari acted. \"I want these tits around my cock. I want you to use your tits to pleasure me. You've wanted to do that since day one, haven't you?\" He said, tone almost demanding her to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru smirked. \"Very well. Just lay back, and let me do all the work.\" She said, moving out from beneath the blankets to show her entire body in its glory. Her skin was smoother then yesterday, though nowhere near Yukari's skin. Her waist, once already perfect on her form, was now more like the hips and waist of a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato layed back on the bed as instructed, watching as Mitsuru got on her knees in front of him, her massive jugs still leaking milk as they were wrapped around his rock-hard rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato groaned. It felt heavenly, the warmth from her extra-large pillows around his rod. he felt as she quished them harder together, squirting milk his way as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato thrust up, his dick, larger then it had been a few nights ago, not even escaping the wonderful valley of flesh between her gargantuan mammeries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru looked pleased. Minato had finally given in to the urges that she and Yukari had tried so hard to bring out. As she lifted her large breasts around her mans man-meat, she couldn't help but feel content. Pleasing him felt as if it had been her life long dream finally fulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither one realized how long they had been going at it, but soon Minato felt the tingle in his balls that signaled that he was nearing his end. He wouldn't hold back with his release. It had been a torture for him for the last few days, dealling with all the sexual innuendo, and the gropping from Yukari and the rest of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru looked at Minato's face, watching as he got closer and closer to givving her a face full of his essence that she craved. Yukari would be jealous, Mitsuru being the first one he took. But she would enjoy every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato groaned as he felt his balls tighten as his seed flew up from between her breasts, hitting her chin and splashing back down on her magnificent chest. It felt amazing, to finally have release. Maybe he shoul see if the Eronomicon was able to give him something to give to Toriyumi. After all, would it be so bad for him to take what she herself was offering? Maybe make her act normal during the day, during school. But after...</span></div></div>",

Everywhere he went he was met with smiling faces and constant reminders that as Avatar he could avail himself to their generosity as much as he liked, and the girls...most of them were kids, really, but hearing them call him 'Aangy' was still sweet, and there were occasions when he could swear that he saw one of the Kyoshi Warriors on the fringe of his crowd of fangirls; obviously the older woman didn't want to be spotted, and he had no intention of making her uncomfortable by drawing attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was having a good time on Kyoshi as well, though you had to look to see it; after making a total buffoon of himself in front of Suki, the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka humbled himself before her and started learning what she had to teach, and from what Aang could tell he was making really good progress; even though Sokka wasn't a bender he did have a lot of talent to him, and Aang was confident that there would be many occasions down the line where Sokka's skills would come in handy.  Plus, even if that weren't the case, the guy could tell great jokes with excellent timing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the truly bright spot of their stay was Katara herself; the fourteen year old Waterbending girl that he'd fallen in love with at first sight was a beauty to be sure, her smooth dark skin and large blue eyes, and her slender well toned figure was a vision he could drink in for days.  Still, there was no such thing as too beautiful to the young Airbender, and with each day that he made sure Katara was on the diet the Eronomicon provided him with, she blew previous expectations right out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts, once small and petite, quickly filled out beyond handfuls, firm and round and very jiggly.  Katara had to wear her robes much more loosely to accommodate her increasing bust, which meant that Aang got an ever increasing view of her cleavage with every day.  In addition, her hips and buttocks also grew, her hips just barely wider than her shoulders while her butt jutted out such that the cleft of her glutal cleavage could be made out if she'd bent over even a little bit.  Most importantly though, Katara was becoming more and more affectionate and amorous with Aang, freely hugging him to her breasts with no provocation what so ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow, it flipped a switch in Gin's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is due to how the permanent body genderchange spell can work. the more the target does not want to be in their new body, the more sensitive their largest asset becomes towards pleasure. If their largest asset groped or touched enough times, then the target of the genderchange spell becomes addicted enough that they no longer care about going back to their old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know... I've wondered why the sexy boy here hasn't shoved one of you down and has his way with you.... But I know why now... He's not a breast man, he's an ass man...\" Gin cooed, as she both rubbed the side of Kurumu's face and also was giving Tsukune a bit of a lapdance. Tsukune closed his eyes and blushed a little before moaning. \"Or maybe his harem wasn't big enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Kurumu yelled, making her nails grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tsukune's bitch, thank you very much.

The succubus tried to step away when she felt the sexual assault begin, but it was too late. Gin hands prevents Kurumu from both getting away and from falling down when the Succubus began to get weak-knee'd from getting expertly fondled and molested.Gin didn't stop when Kurumu moaned. No, Gin kept going on and on, making Kurumu cum over and over, until Kurumu's panties were completely wet and so was the front of her skirt. The only reason the other girls didn't do anything was because they were stunned at how erotic things got. As for Tsukune, he was wondering if he really did have a thing for a girl's butt, due to how hard he got from Gin's semi-lapdance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gin stopped groping and molesting the succubus, she let Kurumu fall down.

All of your knowledge about anything but sex will vanish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa gasped, eyes wide. She was about to raise a hand to slap him when she began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, her already sizable D cup breasts expanded out to F's, stretching her tank top into a tube. It exposed her vast cleavage and tight midriff. Her ass began to swell as well, pushing up her skirt. When it was over, the already sexy Tifa was even curvier. The biggest change, however, was more than skin deep. Inside her mind, her impressive 102 point IQ (above average) began to plummet down to an extremely stupid 70. Her abilities to fight, cast magic and even read or do math all disappeared as the Eronomicon sucked out her knowledge. Everything she'd trained for in her years as a martial artist vanished, and even her old bartending tricks were now gone from her head. She was nothing now but a stupid, sex craved bimbo with a rocking body and an empty head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she sat where she was, fondling her new breasts. Finally, she looked up at Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you, like, do to me?\" She asked with a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you a bimbo.\" He admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what'd you do that for?\" She asked. There was hurt in her now vapid eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew I was going to lose you.\" He said, gripping the Eronomicon to make more changes. He spoke directly in her ear to transform her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind though. You like being a bimbo.\" He said, his words immediately becoming true, \"You'll give me ownership of the 7th Heaven since you're too stupid to run it, but you'll work in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa played with some of her hair as her slow mind processed what he'd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what'll I do? I can't make drinks and stuff no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud grimaced. He hadn't thought about that when he'd taken away so many of her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you can work for me as a stripper. I'll need to find a new bartender.\" he suggested, \"You can take your clothes off and look sexy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa nodded, smiling. \"Like, totally! I'm real good at that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\" He said, teasing her nipple playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I like, do other stuff? I was real good at fightin' and all\" She said, looking a little worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you're not good for much but looking pretty and fucking anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll take care of me and stuff, right?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Cloud said, playing with her breasts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can you like, fuck me now?

She was more beautiful than ever now, but she was also too stupid to help him with much of anything. Simply touching and reading the Eronomicon had corrupted Cloud's morals enough to do this to the woman he loved, but having done it made it even worse. He hungered for more, and to make more women like her, but he couldn't do it all himself. And Tifa was certainly in no state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted from his thoughts when a door slammed a voice yelled from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Tifa? You here?\" It called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" Cloud asked her, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Yuffie, I think.\" Tifa said, concentrating as best she could, \"She comes in and tries to, like make me give her drinks n' stuff. But I don't let her cuz I'm a good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Cloud said, patting her head. Very interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, Yuffie's skills at stealth and materia could make her a useful recruit. He could enslave her and send her out to find and capture girls for him with items from the book. She even had a sort of twisted imagination that he suspected could produce some interesting results. At the same time, Yuffie had pissed him off repeatedly since he'd met her. She was always swiping materia and generally being obnoxious. It would be satisfying to make her a bimbo stripper or bartender like he'd done with Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally made his decision, and created an item in the book. It was a piece of yellow command materia that, once equipped and activated, would change her irreversibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa giggled as the picture came to life at Cloud's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sooo pretty.\" She said, \"Could you make me one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later.\" He said with a smile, \"Come on. Let's introduce her to the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lead Tifa down with him and found Yuffie helping herself to a bottle of Saki. When she turned and saw Cloud, she freaked out, trying to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, hi, Cloud. I was just..uh...\" She stammered. Then, her eyes went wide as she saw Tifa, \"Holy crap! What happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cloud like, made said some weird stuff in my ear, and I got real dumb.\" She said, \"But I'm like, way hotter now so it's totally okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie's mouth was wide open in shock. For a moment, she just stared at the altered girl, who fidgeted with her hair, ditzily. Cloud prepared to activate another spell, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's...\" She said, trying to collect her thoughts, \"Totally friggin' awesome! How'd you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this.\" Cloud said, tossing her the materia, \"Just use the command on her and you can make her into anything you want. You can use it on her, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wicked!\" Yuffie said with a broad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she activated the materia, it didn't let her use any new command. Instead, it quickly transformed her into...</span></div></div>",

Her legs became long and sexy while her butt plumped out into a perfect heart shape. Her breasts swelled out to D cups. Though her face had matured, her short hair stayed its short, boyish style. Cloud was a little disappointed about that, but figured he could change it later when she was done with their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yuffie's body changes, so did her clothes. Her khaki hotpants grew upward to merge with her top. Her midriff was covered, but the rest of her outfit had transformed into an olive green leotard that hugged her enhanced figure. Tight, transparent, sturdy covered her arms and legs, with pads at her feet to muffle the noise she made. There was a belt around her thin waist that contained wooden shurikens equipped with green spell materia and blue weapon effect ones. When thrown, they would cause an effect on the target very similar to the one Yuffie was experiencing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more than her body was her mind. Her brain filled with images of her Cloud, her new master, and serving him. She gained a very powerful fetish for seeing women transformed like her and Tifa had been. She would obey any command that Cloud gave her, and couldn't pleasure herself or orgasm until it was completely. Apart from her attraction to Cloud, which was strong, she was a lesbian now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new Yuffie sauntered up to him, swinging her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tricked me.\" She said in a husky voice, \"And you used the materia to do it. Pretty clever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud smiled. He placed a hand on her ass and she leaned into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna make this place a little more interesting.\" He told her, \"But I need girls. You got any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie thought about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got Tiffa. Jessie's around somewhere.\" She said, \"We could always get that Turk bitch Elena, or nerdy little Shera, maybe. You haven't gotten Aeris yet, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But I'll take care of her. I know just what I plan to do with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Yuffie said with a giggle, \"That's a little disappointing, but I'll leave you to it. Who do you want me to go after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena, for now. I think they're in Wutai right now.\" Cloud said, \"I'll give you the stuff you need to get a ship there. If you come across any girls you think I need along the way, feel free to recruit them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a kiss, and then Yuffie ran off. For a moment, he thought about chasing after her, but he had another girl he needed to recruit.</span></div></div>",

Percy felt as the pure power of a titan exploded from his former friends body, signiling the end of Kronos for many, many years if not eternally. While Kronos may have not been able to be killed, like a mortal, his power was so thouroughly dissperessed that he might never become aware of his existance again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. It was finally over. The war was over, hopefully for good. The titans had been routed and imprisoned again, and one of the most powerful monsters, able to withstand the full onslaught of all the gods on a united front, had been once again sealed away, lulled back into a slumber that would last for entire eons if undisturbed. It had taken the help of the cyclopes who served as the smiths of the gods, led by Percy's half-brother Tyson, who was still a child by cyplops standerd, though an extremely gifted one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked down at the body of Luke fell to the ground, lifeless. Luke had sacrificed himself to make the war end. While he may have done horrible things, Luke still deserved Elysium, at least in Percys opinion. If it weren't for the gods and their old and outdated traditions, then it would most likely never have happened. Luke may have wanted to tear down olympus and destroy the gods, it was only because he felt abandoned. Most demi-gods felt that way after all. But Luke was a special case, what with having an insane mother who could not tell illusion from reality after her failed attempt to become the new Oracle to keep the spirit alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked up to the sky. He saw the constellations, but one he was witness to the creation of personally. He found the formation of Zoe, the huntress of Artemis. She had given her life to defend her goddess from her own father, Atlus, the titan who was tasked with holding the sky from the earth with his monsterous strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one of the first people Percy had seen dead from the war. One of the first Casualties in a conflict that never should have been. She didn't deserve the fate that she had been given. Neither her past, nor her ultimate demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Percy did see something off, looking up into the sky. He noticed that there seemed to be something heading straight for olympus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specificly, right for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't know it, but that object heading right for him would alter his fate, in ways he never would have guessed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it got closer and closer, Percy saw that it was a large book. He dodged out of the way, letting the object hit the spot he had just been standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight next to Lukes body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book hit the ground, creating another power influx.</span></div></div>",

He felt like he was floating, when all of a sudden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boom*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy felt like he was flying, but something felt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was a seat belt. He knew that explosions did not provide seat belts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, he heard the sound of his mother screaming. Wasn't he on Olympus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, he heard Grover baying loudly. He hadn't done that for a long time as far as Percy knew, and he wasn't on Olympus either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy opened his eyes, which were currently trying to make his brain think it was in a blender. Or on drugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was either spinning or blurry. It looked like he was in a car. The hairs on his neck and arms also felt strange. They stood on end, and there was only one thing that did that to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy blinked his eye's trying to clear them. He looked around him when he could see a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he was wearing a seat belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Grover was baying loudly, though it stopped after a second when the...whatever... hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes he was in a car he supposed. But why did it look familier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Percy noticed something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wha? I get the feeling that ive done this before. A long time ago.' he thought in his addled mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"---cy! P----y! Pe--y!\" Someone yelled. He was having a hard time hearing. \"Pe-cy! Percy! Get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked infront of him, from where the voice was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to come face to face with his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked younger, but older. How was that possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He asked groggily. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy, I need you to get out of the car and run up to that hill. Get help from the big house that you see. And take Grover with you!\" Sally screamed at him, panicing at what may happen to her baby boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. His mind just made sure that he obeyed his mom. He did it almost naturally. \"Alright. Yeah. Get help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy undid the seat belt before he kicked at the window. Surprisingly, it flew off nearly ten feet from the car before it his the ground, despite being so low to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally would have made a fuss, if whatever was hunting them wasn't doing so. Right now, she needed Percy to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy undid Grovers belt, grabbing his arms so he didn't fall on his head. He slowly pulled both of them from the car, Sally scooting out behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy, I need you to run up that hill. You'll be safe there. Go!\" She said, pushing him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy wanted to move, but it felt like something was keeping him there. A memory of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was still charged with static, but his hairs were falling down now. It seemed that whatever it was in the air was fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Percy? Run!\" His mother yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy stayed stock still. Where had he seen this before? And why was there a little bit of extra weight in his pocket?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked between Percy and the shadowy figure that was approaching them. It stood at twelve feet tall, about three-hundred pounds of pure, beefy muscle. Horns stood atop its head, while a bulls snout jutted from its face, with a large ring in the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast had hair going down it's entire body, a cow's tail swishing back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also wore a pair of pure white fruit of the looms underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Minotaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wanted to speak, but the sight of it made all noise catch in her throat. That beast was after her son!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing them, the bull-man lowered his head, snorting twice before it ran at them at high speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, stepped in fear as she was, pushed both boys with the strength that only a mother had when her children were in danger, sending them sprawling far enough away that the Minotaur couldn't turn to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it grabbed her instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stopped running when it caught her, looking at her with almost no intellect in the beasts eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that it was not male, or young, the Minotaur started to squeeze the life out of the human. It's was not what he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack--Ugh! Ah Percy!\" She managed to scream out, making Percy's brain kick into high gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his first year at camp half-blood when his mother was abducted by Hades. The Minotaur, the car, his mother, grover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how? What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat strange power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it sent him back in time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he didn't care. Right now, he had his mother to save.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed Grover down, turning to face the hybrid moster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes went wide however, when he say his mother start to shine golden. \"NO!\" he yelled, before his mother disappeared in that shower of golden light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at where his mother was just moments before, when he glared at the Minotaur with as much hate as he could muster. \"You! I'll kill you!\" He yelled, making the beast turn towards him. Percy quickly ran away from Grover, running towards the right, closer to the camp boundries. There were more trees there for him to use against this monstrosity once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the Minotaur charged. Percy stood still for a moment, before leaping to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Minotaur buried it's horns right into a tree, getting them stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith out thinking, Percy jumped on the beasts back, pulling it's head back in a fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this pulled out the bulls horns from the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnflinching, Percy grabbed both horns, pulling heard on both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth horns broke off, making the bullman cry out in horrible pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy wasted no time though. He jumped back on the monster, using the horns to stab at the thing to keep himself on as it flung about in pain. Percy kept climbing higher and higher, using the horns like ice picks to climb up to the beasts head, were he drove both horns into the beasts skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Minotaur let out one last cry before it exploded into gold dust, signaling that it had been sent back to Hades once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy fell from the air, landing in the golden remains, both horns in his hands. From the adreniline rush, though fading, he did catch sight of a blond haired girl and a man with a horses body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was in his damn pocket!</span></div></div>",

Yeah... that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up slowly, knowing from experience that if you sat up to fast that you're liable to lose your lunch quickly after waking up from a black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, seeing that the room looked strangely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh... what did I hit my head on? I thought I saw that grease-ball Gabe's car again, with my mom and Grover and the Minotaur. But... that was five years ago. What in Tartarus?' He thought, before he felt something in his back pocket still. 'What is that?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy moved his hands into his back pocket, pulling out something kinda hard and rectangular. Looking at it, Percy saw that it was one of those pocket note books that people put stuff like notices in. He had seen paul with them before. He had one for birthdays, one important dates other then birthdays, one for school events or meetings, and possibly more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this one had fancy writing on it, not that he could make it out just yet. His head hurt, and his dyslexia was acting up majorly now. He put it back in his pocket, one of the side ones, laying down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes for a moment, waiting for the pain to pass. Once it had, he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to meet stormy grey ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stared up at them as they widened in surprise, before they pulled away, revealing the person who they belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had to do a double take, seeing the person they belonged to. He could never forget the long blond hair, or the face that, though younger, was etched into his heart and soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth Chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, she looked just the same as when he started camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing this could be some kind of trick, Percy sat up, fighting down the wave of nausea as he stood up, looking with hard eyes at the look-alike of his hopefully soon-to-be girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look-alike Annabeth regarded him with those sharp eyes of hers, though a look of awe was hidden barely in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Percy asked, hands going for the pocket he kept riptide on, but not finding it. Giving it up for lost, as strange as that seemed with the magic pen/sword that could never get lost, he got into one of the only fighting stances he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatly, he was no good with any of them. he had tried to train in them, but he never got the hang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond-haired look-alike adopted a hard gaze, looking at him with the intent to unlock all his secrets. \"Your rude you know. Why don't you give me your name first?\" Even her voice sounded like Annabeths, though younger once again. And a little uppity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy kept an eye on the girl, watching for any sudden moves. \"Percy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annabeth.\" She said, cutting it quick. \"But, since your up, I guess I should take you to Chiron. Though you were out for less time then he guessed.\" She said, before she turned away, walking through the door. She obviously expected him to follow her, which he did. Things made little sense right now, so why not. Wasn't like he's be in any more danger then he already was, if he was in any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed the look-alike through the halls of what seemed like the big house at camp. It was strange. He recalled having done this before, though it was slightly different from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked onto the patio that wrapped around the big house, seeing a man in a wheelchair playing a game against a man with a hawian t-shirt and what looked like a bad hangover with blood shot eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron and Dionysus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiron, Mr.D. He's awake.\" The look-alike said, moving back a bit to the railing to look over the realistic camp copy. Seriously, what was messing with his mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well, it seems that you're getting a little lax in your practices Chiron. You said he wouldn't wake up until tomorrow.\" Dionysus said, playing his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sure that he would not awaken for at least another day.\" Chiron said, before he looked at the cards. \"Oh, you've won. Well, what better timing though.\" He said, turning in his fake wheelchair to look at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could only look unimpressed at this. Whatever was messing with his head would have to try better then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Percy. It must be a surprise to see me here, I'm sure. I never did like this thing.\" He said, pointing to the wheel chair. \"Limits my mobility. Wait, you think I'm handicapped still. Oh, where are my manners. Allow me to re-intriduce myself. I am Chiron, Percy Jackson. I'm sure you remember that from my lectures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just like last time, Chiron had gotten out of his wheelchair in a dramatic way, showing off the horse body that he kept hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon not hearing anything like shock or awe that he was expecting, he looked down at Percies unimpressed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah. I know your chiron, and your Dionysus.\" Percy said, pointing at the god of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And how do you know that? I must say that you seem to be full of surprises.\" Dionysus said, looking directly through Percy. Though he did sense a strange aura that seemed to come from the boys pocket. It felt like his own cup. It made almost anything drinkable, with no ill effects other then making the drinker a little tipsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, A godly item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it felt foreign. None of the gods had items that felt like this. What was the boy playing at?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Whatever monsters playing with my head right now needs to step up the act. Going into my memories, really? I think I read something about that in that guide to monsters.\" Percy said, musing to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, memories?Percy, what are you talking about?\" Chiron asked, a confused look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth looked back at Percy, wondering what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Last I remember, I was at Olympus. The war had ended, with Kronos<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">  </span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Kronos? War! Percy, what are you talking about?\" Chiron trotted nervously in place. The former king of the titans name was enough to make him nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm talking about the war. Shouldn't whatever is looking through my memories know that? If it thinks it can mess with me by going back in time in my head, then it's dead wrong.\" Percy said, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy, I assure you that this isn't a memory. What's this about a war?\" Chiron said, trotting nervously. Did the boy get hit on the head to hard or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The war with the titans! Okay, lok. If you are a monster that's going through my memories, then would you at least try to make it seem less obvious? Really, at least put some effort into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy, there is no monster that goes through your memories in greek myths. Drain you of them, yes. But, unless you're in Tartarus, then you won't be seeing any memories of yours without looking at them yourself.\" Chiron said, making Percy look up at the centaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? How do I know you ain't messing with me more?\" Percy said, Making Chiron sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annabeth, would you mind taking Percy around camp?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy was being pulled around by the look-alike of Annabeth, who was telling him about the camp. Showing him the forge where all the metal things used in camp were made. A few kids of Hephestus had stopped working long enough to make a quick wave or nod of greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed him the stables where the horse's were kept, which all took a liking to Percy once more. She took him to the archery range, where a few kids of Apollo's were firing their arrows, hitting near the bulls-eye alot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasicly, she showed him everything she did the first time. Percy held the box under one arm, his hand in the pocket with that strange pocket book. He looked around, bored about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth lead him out into the woods, going to show him the frthest that the barrier that was Thaila's tree could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the strange pocket book grew hot, and burned Percy's hand. Unknown to the demigods, the book had burned a seal into his hand, which would begin a ritual most amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy let out a yelp, feeling the book burn him. He pulled his hand out of his pocket, shaking it. There wasn't a stream or anything around, so he couldn't just step into some water to stop the burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth turned around, seeing him shake his hand. Wondering what had happened to the new guy at camp, she moved over to him, looking at his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the second her hand touched his, her eyes went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Olympus, shortly after the death of Luke and Kronos, but before Percy disappeared~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth shuddered as the wave of power flowwed over her. She knew what that entailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to cry, but found she had no tears to shed at the moment. She raced through the streets of the gods home, hoping to make it back to the throne room in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as soon as she opened the doors, she saw Percy get struck by something. This object had a lot of power it seemed, as it tore open a swirling vortex. Annabeth watched, helpless as Percy was at the epicenter of it, no doubt being swallowed by whatever the thing was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of her that was constantly curious was facinated by the swirling mass of pure energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of her that loved Percy cried out in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked on, as not even a minute later the vortex faded, leaving nothing where Percy should have stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth wanted to cry. The guy she was going to confess to had, after his greatest task, been caught up in some kind of portal, with who nknew what happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could be torn to shreds by it! O-or possibly changed so much that he wasn't Percy anymore. Or he could be somewhere far away, in another dimension perhaps, well beyond the gods reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Annabeth could not cry for long. She felt a tugging on her soul, such as when she took that blow for Percy that she knew would have killed him, despite having the same power Achillies did. She resisted the tug, fearful of what it was. She couldn't die yet! She had to help Percy! Even if the gods couldn't do it, she would fight through all the titans and Typhon if she had to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fear not child. You are merely being called back.' It said, sounding only in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes,' Another voice said, completely different from the first. 'You should follow the tug. It is bound to happen at some poin or another.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth looked around, wondering who could be speaking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grey eyes widened, seeing three old woman. They were sitting near the fire in the center of the room. One was using a spool to spin a seemingly endless amount of yarn. The second was measuring it out, using nothing but a trained eye to keep track of how long it was. The string was all types of colors, aqnd each segment of color seemed to change in length until the second lady measured it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the third lady, who had a large, intimidating pair of bronze scissors, cut each segmant, perfectly Annabeth might add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three old women stopped their tasks, looking up at Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes child. Follow the tug. It will lead you to many new things.' A thrid voice said. 'And you like new things, don't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth could only nod. What else could you do with the people who literally controled when you died? Even the gods were subject to their will. The fates also woved the tapestry of destiny, which all beings adheared to, god or mortal. While they did not directly control what happened, they did bend things to their favor a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then follow the tug. Follow it, and greet Perceus Jackson once more.' The second voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do not worry child. We shall accompeny you.' The first voice said, making Annabeth go even more into shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she could not resist the tug any longer. What the fates spoke of was something that promised to be amazing and new to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a child of Athena never let anything new slip from their grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeht felt her soul leave her body, watching as it slumped to the ground. The fates had disappeared from her view, thugh she felt as if they were right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, thinking of the man she was going to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself being pulled back. It felt strange. She was staying where she was, but she felt as things passed her by. Maybe not places, but times. Maybe that vortex that swallowed Percy had taken him through time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fates said that the tug would take her to Percy, and she wasn't going to distrust them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, Annabeth did feel a little wierd. She felt as her love for Percy grew a thousand fold, turning into something that was absolute for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe want for him to be happy also grew, though many, many more times then the love had. She wanted him to be happy, no matter what now. Wether it was with her, or that stuck-up bitch Artemis. Even if he wanted to be with her mother, she would be happy. Or with all of them at once, with many, many more girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth felt things slow down around her. Her feet started to feel things again. She opened her eyes, only to find Percy looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth felt her body heat up, as she felt her hand on his. Though, as she looked at him, something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth stared at him, not really caring that he was younger. He was there, and that's what mattered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy.\" She said, making him look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" He asked, not believing this was the real Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is you.\" Annabeth said, a few tears streaming down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly tackled Percy into a hug, wrapping her arms around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy! I'm so glad your alive! After that explosion on Olympus, and the vortex, and...\" She stopped, crying into his shirt. \"I thought I lost you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked down at the younger Annabeth, seeing how distraught she was. His inner gentleman made him wrap his arms around her, hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know?\" He asked, not really believing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth nodded. \"After you gave Luke the dagger, there was that huge explosion of his power. I ran up through Olympus to get back to the throne room. I saw you get hit by something, and a strange vortex opened up. After it disappered, you were gone. I thought you were dead or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy scoffed at that. \"What's worse then being dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth didn't even lift a finger to punch him. The relief was to great. \"But then, I felt a tug. I thought I was dieing again. But then the fates appeared, saying that I should follow the tug. It would lead me to you. And the were right.\" Annabeth said, tears still falling from her eye's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Indeed young one. We did say that, did we not sisters?' A voice invaded both their minds. It wasthe first one Annabeth heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. And we did not lie.' The second voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No we did not. And I think the young ones would like to see us themselves.' The third voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth demigods looked around, wondering where the voices were coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Percy laid eye's on the beings that held those voices, he nearly had a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the fates were not three old hags, like they were when they first appeared to Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, they were three beautiful women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was about Percy's height when he was still sixteen. She had flowing red hair, with deep, golden eyes. She had tan skin, covered by a librarian's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one was about Percy's mother's height. She had pitch black hair, done up into a ponytail. She had deep, red eyes that stared right into Percy's. She had ivory skin, which was covered by a seamstress' uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thrid sister was easily the tallest, standing at about six foot three inches. She had silver hair. Not grey, silver. It shone, bouncing the light that landed on it off in such a way that made her even more beautiful. She had pure black eyes, though they seemed kind. She wore a doctors coat, though she somehow made it alluring without making it skimpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We are the fates, Persues Jackson.' The first sister said in his mind. 'I am Clotho, and these are my sisters, Lachesis and Atropos. We have come to you Perseus, with a request.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy only looked at them, not making a move. he feared the fates, like any sane person would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho seemed to smile at this. 'Fear not. This task shall bring you no harm. We only wish for one thing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and what is that?\" Percy asked, wondering what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho smiled once more. 'We only wish that you would lay with us, and allow us to stay with you. Forever.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Percy's mind went on shut down. He was lucky he was already on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on?</span></div></div>",

Those were some really weird dreams he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back in time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing Annabeth's soul back in time as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Fates, the actual Fates, wanting to get with him, and be with him forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow hard did he hit his head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have not hit your head, Perseus. That has happened, every thing you thought of to yourself.' A familiar voice said, though he could not see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. You have gone through time. You have brought the girl's soul back with you, though it was a little later then expected.' Another voice said, still unseen as the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And we do wish to lay with you. We have grown lonely over the countless millenia.' A third voice said, unseen as the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, so very lonely. But you will change that. You will change that for all those who suffer cruel injustice.' The first voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The gods have done many things wrong.' The third voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, many things wrong. But you shall right those ancient wrongs, Perseus. In golden Ichor, if need be.' The second voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood up, looking around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just the normal kind of not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, there was an eerie stillness about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he only noticed it when he saw Annabeth, stuck in a position that had her looking down at the spot he just stood up from. She would have looked at him immediately if he stood up as he did, probably going to smack him for almost hitting her when he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, there were leaves in the air. Not falling, like leaves should. Just kinda sitting there, floating. Suspended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In time, Perseus.' The third voice said behind him, making him turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to come face to chest with a woman in a doctors uniform. He looked up, seeing that it was the silver haired woman. Atropos if he remembered correctly, and wasn't going insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos gave a slight giggle, her chest bouncing so slightly. 'Not insane, Perseus. Though even we admit that it is surprising and unexpected. Wouldn't you agree sisters?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes sister. Quite strange indeed. Though... we have a feeling...'  Another woman, this one dressed as a librarian, appeared next to Atropos. This one was Lachesis if he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That it may have something to do with that pocket book of yours.' Another one said, appearing opposite Lachesis. She was wearing a seamstresses outfit. Clotho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's hand went to his pocket at the mention the strange book. \"What, this?\" He asked, pulling it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three nodded. 'Yes. We have seen it before, many times.' Clotho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It has come to this world many times. It seemed that it was searching for something. But it never found it.' Lachesis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Until now.' Atropos told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three pointed at him. 'It has finally found you, Perseus Jackson. It has found who it has chosen.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at them, curiousity and mental exaustion on his face. \"Chosen me for what? I mean, seriously. If this is actually happening, then I have to beat Kronos all over again. I have to go through this stupid war again. Is it so hard to ask for a freaking breather in life?\" He asked, looking down at the little book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three woman frowned, sadness on their timeless faces. He would have had much, much more to do, wether or not the book had come to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disappeared, only to reappear behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho pulled him flush against her, her arms over his shoulders and her hands resting on his chest. Lachesis appeared on his right, hugging his side. Atropos mirrored her on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fear not Perseus. That is what the book is for.' Clotho said, moving her hands in circles on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. It will make things easier for you, if you read it and take what it says to heart.' Atropos said, hugging him a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. No matter how strange it may be, or how you might not understand right away. It is there to help you, and you alone.' Lachesis told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But, through you, it shall help many others. Just not in the way you might think.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Help others? And what was that bit earlier about righting ancient wrongs?\" Percy asked, a little uncomfortable about the situation. He just didn't want to say anything that might make them mad. After all, they controled when he died. \"And that whole...being with me thing. What's up with that? I mean, i'm nothing special.\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Says the child of prophecy and a child of one of the big three.' Clotho said, a small smirk on her lips. 'But you are wrong. You are special, though you do not acknowledge it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. That book proves it, though it is not what makes you special.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though those questions are for a later time. Just know that we are on your side.' Lachesis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Besides, think about those you can save. Maybe you can change Silena's allegiance.' Clotho told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or save Zoe, perhaps?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bianca?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Free Calypso?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I get it.\" Percy said, sighing as the three let go of him and reappeared in their previous spot. \"I have to go through this again. But, I guess I can change some things. Shouldn't you be against that by the way?\" He asked, getting small smiles from the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Normally, we would. But this is a special case.' Atropso said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'After all, those things weigh heavy on your conscious.' Clotho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you are our future husband. We will always make allowences for you.' Lachesis told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shuffled nervously. \"Yeah, I still don't know how to act about that.\" He confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three nodded. 'That is fine, Perseus. It would be strange if you did. After all, one does not become \"engaged\" to the beings of our stature so easily. Though you will grow, over time, to understand and embrace it.' Atropos said, disappearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To become what you are truely meant to be.' Clotho said, before she vanished as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis walked up to him, carressing his face with a small smile on her own. 'Trust us, Perseus. We do not wish to bring pain to you. You are destined for many, many things. Some will see them as morally wrong, when the action is for the better. Some will claim you seek to usurp them, when they have stayed too long on their seats of power. The world is changing Perseus, and you shall be be the one to make it so.' She said, before she captured his lips with her own, though only for a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was shocked, though the feel of her lips made him forget it for a second. He had never been kissed before, and he still had the mentality of a sixteen year-old guy. Though the war had made him keep any hormones in check, here there was no such way to surpress it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis pulled away, a small blush upon her face. She had a small grin on her face though. 'Just remember, Perseus. We are on your side, and we can take a more active role. We can, and will, help you. Unfortunatly, our duties must be tended to. Though we will try to make time. But know this. You can not kill Luke. He will pay for his crimes, both future and present, but not now.' She said, sternly with the warning about Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, though he had a small frown on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis smiled softly. 'I understand what you must be feeling. But you might want to take your mind off of those thoughts. Once I leave, time will flow once more. I suggest you sit out here with the child of Athena and look over that book.\" She said, pointing to the book, which was still in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, looking down at his blond friend. What was she going to think of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fear not, Perseus. She will accept it. I think she will put aside any negative thoughts about this.' The last sister of fate said, a small wink before she vanished as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of birds and other woodland critters sounded out, as the rustling of the trees in the wind was heard once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy, how did you get up there? You were just laying down.\" Annabeth said, before she looked around. \"Where are the fates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked down at the book in his hand. \"I'll tell you about it Wise-girl. But fiorst, why don't we find somewhere comfy to relax and read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth, despite her new outlook on Percy, couldn't help but make a face. \"You? Read? Guess I'm rubbing off on you.\" She said, a fake snooty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them shared a laugh at that, before the two wandered for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a good spot, the two sat down, backs against a log. Percy cracked open the book, uncaring of how Annabeth leaned against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now, the first thing in this book is...</span></div></div>",

Though she too was curious about a harem god. \"A harem is when a guy has many women in a relationship. Mostly for the wealthy and powerful, though not unheard of major Hero's getting one.\" She said, going slightly into lecture mode.

A woman, average looking at worst, sat in the middle of a field. The field itself seemed to be glistening with dew, though it was still the middle of the night. The Eronomicon, curious as to what a woman would be doing out in the middle of nowhere, floated over the field. As it got closer, it heard that the woman was singing. And, stranger yet, The Eronomicon found itself crying. It then noticed the field around it was doing the same. The grass, the rocks, the bugs that buzzed around and the flowers. All of them were crying along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo enraptured by the music from this woman, the Eronomicon stayed where it was until the woman had finished her song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer song was a tale of unrequited love. Of how a goddess of music, Melum, was enraptured by a god of love. She had tried to earn his attention, his love. From gifts to her beautiful music, she tried to garner the tiniest bit of romantic interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one day, in front of his father, the goddess had asked why he ignored her no matter what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to even acknowledge her in his fathers presence, the god had not answered, but instead posed his own question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those three words, her entire world shattered. All she had done, all she had given had been worthless. He would never acknowledge her, much less love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had ran from the gods home, her voice wailing in both sorrow and anger. All who heard her felt her sorrow, her pain, and her anger. They felt the utter loneliness she felt, like they were unwanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they also felt the rage directed at the god. Even the other gods were effected. In a fit of rage not his own, the gods father had bludgeoned him for the goddess, tore at his limbs and gouged out his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the goddess had the last laugh in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, every night she would come to this field and sing her heart out. The anger had faded over time, but the sadness never healed. It was impossible for her to let the feeling of having her heart ripped out go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, she wanted to be of use to someone. If she was loved by them, then so be it. But she never wanted to fade into the ether, return to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the Eronomicon gained an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her song was finished, as the field around her cried in sorrow for her, The Eronomicon approached her. It told her of someone who would have a use for her, who would love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess, overjoyed at this prospect, asked what it would take to be with this man. She cared not if he would use her for her body, or her talent. Only that he would want her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eronomicon told her that it had not yet found the one, but he was out there. That it was searching for a man worthy of it, and through it, her. It told her to seal herself in a music box so that it could carry her through the multiverse, as she was not powerful enough to make the journey herself physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess promised she would, and using the music box the ancient tome had provided her, sealed herself away, awaiting the one who would call upon her and free her from the music box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowingly, the music box would copy her power of music, though it would only sing of the love and devotion that she had for the harem god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, her song was not meant to be understood by all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose that can hear only a hint of music emanating from the box will feel the love and devotion for the harem god, but it is a fickle thing, destined to fade over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose that can hear the music, but cannot understand the Lyrics, will also feel the love and devotion for him. Though it may fade overtime, it will always be in their mind, silently comparing all other men to him and finding them wanting in kindness and love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, for those that can hear the song in all its glory, shall be filled utterly with the love and devotion that the goddess of music feels. It will become reality to them, unwavering and absolute. It would never fade, and the harem god would only be the one for them for eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy set the book down, rubbing his head. Surprisingly his Dyslexia didn't kick in, but reading so much in one sitting hurt his head regardless. It hurt to pay attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth, used to the massive amounts of reading, looked a little saddened at the story. But then, it was only a story, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been raised, in a word, to believe that only the Greek gods existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, they did go to Egypt a lot in the old days. Back when vacations didn't actually exist and the gods had more responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid that have something to do with it? Did other sects of gods exist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Annabeth Chase did not like 'not knowing' at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she seemed to have been brought back in time to Percy's first year at camp. Not to mention that the fates wanted to... 'lay' with Percy. That thought alone made her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that everything she knew to be possible was being systematically torn asunder and trampled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kinda liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruths exposed that were kept hidden behind lies. Truths likely kept hidden by Zeus, king of paranoia. Annabeth always liked the truth, though she understood the need for secrecy in dire situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should use it.\" She said suddenly, making Percy look at her through his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You don't really think this is real do you?\" Percy asked as he continued to rub his aching head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't make much difference if it did would it?\" She asked. \"Besides, it seems like your the only one who can free her if it is real. Think about it Percy! She could help turn the tides of war against Kronos a lot earlier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what about that whole Harem god stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would the gods think if I, supposedly, am to be some kinda god? You think Zeus would let me live? You know as well as I do how the guy gets even someone even mentions someone that is almost as strong as him he snaps! Besides, my uncle isn't very fond of me anyway. Especially if we are back in time! Remember? He tried to kill me in anyway possible on the hunch that I somehow stole the master bolt before I even knew I was a demi-god!\" He said, watching the sky for any thunder clouds. Calling on the king of Olympus when you are, technically, wanted for a crime, even if you didn't commit it, is stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think Seaweed-brain! One of the first things about being a god is immortality! If you at least get that, then Zeus can't kill you! Nothing will! Besides, it would be better then that stupid blessing that you got like Achilles'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!? Okay, fine! Let's say that happens. What about the whole 'other women thing' huh? What would I do about that?\" He asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! But it's either that or go through this with nothing but our knowledge of the future! Didn't the Fates say anything about this?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy thought about it, recalling the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. I... I guess they did. Read what it says and take it to heart. No matter what it says, even if I don't understand it, that it is only trying to make my life easier.\" He said, looking down at the book, more specificly the page that had a picture of an old wooden box. It looked kinda like the one his mom had that she would keep jewelry in that played music when it opened and spun a little ballerina around to the music. Nothing even strange about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, that was normally the dangerous stuff in his world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed in defeat, knowing what she said was true. Besides, he was curious as well. If this goddess was real, and he was this chosen god or whatever, then he was the only one who could save her. The one she had waited who knew how long for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, how do we do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Doesn't the book say anything about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged his shoulders, before turning the page back to the cover page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read 'Place hand on image and call forth the name of the object you desire.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging once more, Percy did as told. Placing his hand upon the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music box of the Harem God!\" He said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, nothing happened. Then his hand started to burn as light poured from between his fingers, though it did not breach the tree tops. It did, however, blind both demi-gods for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, the light died down, and Percy felt his hand resting on a wooden box. It took a moment for the light in his eyes to die down so he could look, only to clarify that it indeed was the music box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy only stared at it, his eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of it.</span></div></div>",

He looked it over, seeing that it was in perfect condition, but a plain as the image suggested. Not a splinter, chip or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at Annabeth, who was rubbing her eyes to clear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's real.\" He said, almost not believing despite the evidence literally in the palm of his hand. \"It's really real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what? It is?\" Annabeth asked, blinking owlishly to get used to normal daylight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm holding it in my hand right now!\" He said, holding it up for her to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at it, Annabeth felt a little giddy. \"Percy, do you know what this means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" He said, nodding. \"I guess I'm going to become a god. Of harems. Whatever that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth rolled her eyes, but he was somewhat right. \"Well, yeah. But not just that! It means the fates were telling the truth! And there are other gods out there! And this book can help us win this war!\" She said, almost bouncing in excitement at the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed happily, knowing that some things will never change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now how do we free her without calling the wrath of the gods, literally? Actually, how do we free her?\" He asked, knowing Annabeth would come up with a plan of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth went from giddy to thinking mode in no time, planning out how to not get them killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if she were to appear in front of a lot of people we couldn't be killed without Zeus having to make something up on the spot. We both know that he sucks at doing that. People wouldn't start to question him since they are basically told that the gods can do as they wish, even if we don't like it, but for two kids to be violently killed would draw many glances to Zeus, and it could provoke a more bloody war that will leave him worse then Kronos. Your dad would make anything Zeus could do seem kind in comparison.\" Annabeth said. \"And without the master bolt, your dad would wipe the floor with him, natural laws be damned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. Besides, if his dad could cause major earthquakes, who's to say he wouldn't literally shake mount Olympus apart? \"Yeah, I'd like avoid that, especially the part where we die.\" He said, looking at the music box in his hands, wondering if the goddess, Melum, could hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the biggest gathering will be tonight to welcome you to camp. It would be best to free her then, otherwise we could be easily killed by anyone.\" Annabeth said, making Percy nod. \"But the problem comes in how to free her in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy just shook his head. \"Don't know. But there might be a clue in the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, wouldn't this be the Eronomicon mentioned in the story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I guess it would be. Let's see. It says 'To call the goddess from her music box, simply utter this Phrase.'\" He read, though he didn't say it. That would set her free before the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you remember it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so.\" He said, before looking down at the music box in his hand. \"Don't worry. You're almost free. Just wait a little longer.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, and helping Annabeth up as well, he started to make his way back to camp, music box and the box containing the minotaur hors tucked under his arm, the Eronomicon stuck in his back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped, looking at Annabeth. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fidgeted, looking down at her shoes. \"T-there's something I want to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy turned around, wondering what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Percy... I...I...\" She couldn't say it. For some reason, her tongue tied itself as she tried to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth moved close to him, seeing as words wouldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you do-hmmp!\" Percy tried to ask, only to have her lips crash against his. Her kiss was awkward. She didn't have the faintest idea as to how to kiss romantically, though that didn't stop her from trying to show how much she wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back, Annabeth breathed out \"Open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was dazed, being kissed by the girl of his dreams does that to a guy. \"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the box. I...I can't say it on my own.\" She said, blushing and looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded dumbly, setting down the box with his horns. He grabbed the lid of the box, opening it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd heard the most beautiful sound in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt put the Muse's to shame when they sang together in perfect harmony even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, he couldn't even understand hear half the words, seeing as they were garbled to him, and it sounded better than anything else he'd heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made him feel like he was floating on air. Like there was a woman singing to him, and him alone. In fact, he was certain there was, though she was in the music box. But she was aware of everything outside the music box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Annabeth, who looked like she was ready to cry tears of happiness as she looked at the music box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the box snapped shut, cutting off the sound. Percy watched as Annabeth let a few tears fall as she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I love you.\" She said almost suddenly before she crashed against him again, kissing him with all her feelings forced into that one action. It was still awkward, due to both their inexperience, but that would fix itself over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stayed there for a while, Kissing each other on the forest floor. Just enjoying the others presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't even have to say anything, knowing that Annabeth knew he loved her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would have stayed longer, but some nymphs came by, giggling up a storm at the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... You wouldn't tell anyone about this would you?\" Percy asked, blushing a bit at being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead nymph walked forward, sashaying her hips with a seductive smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might keep quiet, for a price.\" She said, batting her lashes at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm hm.\" The nymph hummed while nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" He asked, wondering how Annabeth was taking this so calmly. Nymphs were known to be seductive, though not all wanted to do anything with men. It was just in their nature to be cock-teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" She said, getting her face close to Percy's own. \"You could always come by my tree. Maybe shake the leaves a bit, if you know what I mean.\" She said with a wink, but looking at Annabeth out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also well known that Nymphs liked to stir up trouble between couples. Luring men by the nose, letting them break up with their loved one, only to dump them on the spot. They didn't mean any harm, but they considered it to be a prank of some kind, or a test of faithfulness. Depends on the Nymph you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well I-I-I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Annabeth cut him off mid-stuttering, looking directly at the Nymph. \"So long as you keep your end of the deal, all of you,\" She said, looking at the rest of the Nymphs. \"And not tell anybody about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nymph and her friends looked directly at Annabeth, eyes wide. Was she serious? She would really share her boyfriend with other girls just to keep her relationship secret? That had never happened before, in the history of Nymphs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You serious?\" The Nymph, who was still in Percy's face asked, looking at Annabeth out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deathly.\" She retorted almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nymph stood up, going back to her friends in a huddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat around for awhile while the Nymphs discussed the deal. Was it worth it? Could they keep the promise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some debate, the first Nymph went back to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine. We have a deal.\" She said, putting out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Annabeth shook her head. \"Nuh uh. You have to swear on the river Styx, all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymph bristled slightly at that, but nodded. \"I swear upon the river Styx that Neither me or my friends will tell anyone in anyway that you two are in a relationship, lest our tree's and bushes spontaneously combust.\" She said through gritted teeth. There went her gossip, but she needed a good lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky overhead shook, signaling that the deal was set. If any of them let anyone know about Percy and Annabeth, they would die. They couldn't even leave a note anywhere that said the fact on purpose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Annabeth said with a smirk at getting one up on nature's hussies. \"We have a deal. We'll set up a schedule or something. But now we got to head back to camp.\" Annabeth said as she stood up, holding her hand out to Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy, still gob smacked at what Annabeth just did, took her hand wordlessly as he grabbed both the music box and the minotaur horn box, letting her lead him back to camp.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy was sitting at the Hermes table. The camp had just finished dinner, and soon it would be time for the bon-fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning to camp, Percy had a little bit of a tough time with remembering that he was back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started off with him almost walking to cabin three, Poseidon's cabin, his cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a few of the campers asked him about, he just played it off as being interested in it, saying that he liked the design. They took that at face value, remembering what it had been like their first time at camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it came with meeting Luke at the Hermes cabin. Percy had tried to be civil, he really had. But, well, it was kind of had being civil with the person who had tried to kill him multiple times and end the world as he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept himself from decking the guy in his scarred face, but when Luke had questioned him about the look about him, Percy said that it was the fact that his mom was killed, or so it seemed, by something he only thought to be a myth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke tried to cheer him up, saying that he knew what is was like to lose his mother to the horrors of the Greek stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Percy knew that was true, it didn't make him feel any better. Luke was still evil, even if he didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that it seemed that Dionysus had Grover tailing him as soon as he got back to camp, though he did so badly since Percy could easily tell where the Satyr was most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, unlike last time, Clarisse hadn't bothered him. He guessed hearing how he brutally killed the thing with both it's horns made her not want to mess with him, though he doubted that was actually the case. This was a daughter of Ares we're talking about here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had passed relatively smoothly after that, though Percy and Annabeth had to be careful because of Grover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter meeting Luke, Percy and Annabeth had gone down to the arena to spar, Annabeth's reasoning that they should get their bodies back into tip-top shape for the coming quest to go get the master bolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had gathered a crowd of onlookers, much to their dismay, but it didn't seem to matter. The crowd just chocked it up to natural talent, or maybe he was another Ares kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to spar long into the day, the crowd eventually becoming most of the camp, minus Chiron and Mr. D. and other campers. Neither had an idea as to why, but they were kind of glad that they weren't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, nothing happened for the rest of the day worth mentioning. Percy rested after the spar until it was time for dinner. That's it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought from his thoughts as Luke patted him on the back. Looking around, Percy saw that he and Luke were the only ones left, the others going to the amphitheater for the large bonfire, and not the sacrificial one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Percy, you coming?\" Luke asked him, hand on his shoulder. \"I mean, It's not everyday we get a new camper, and Apollo cabin tells the best campfire stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grit his teeth, though he didn't show it. \"Yeah. Um, would you mind if I went back to the cabin to get something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shook his head. \"Nah, go ahead. Though I can't say for certain it's still there. You know, being the cabin for the god of thieves and all.\" He said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head, forcing a smile. \"Ah, I'm sure it's fine. I'll see you at the bon-fire.\" He said, waving off Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. See ya there then.\" Luke said walking off, waving back at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was sure that Luke was gone, Percy ran back to the cabin, digging through his meager amount of stuff. He found the music box, picking it up gently and raced out to the bon-fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You'll be free soon.\" He said to it as he ran through camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had arrived at the amphitheater, Apollo cabin was already in the middle of a comedic rendition of the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, though Dionysus looked dark as the story was told. No surprise there though. It only reminded him that he wasn't allowed to see his beloved during his time as camp director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading down the steps, he saw Luke waving to him, patting a seat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grimaced slightly, though he quickly put the smile once more as he moved to sit next to Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get what you're lookin' for?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it.\" Percy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Didn't expect that. Figured it would being sold at the camp store or something tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Percy said. \"Hey, do they take volunteers Luke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes. Depends on the story Apollo cabin's telling. Why, got a story or something newbie?\" Luke joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy fingered the box in his hand. \"Something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked down, seeing the music box. \"What's that? Something to do with your story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda. I would say that the music box is the story though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Whatever. Make it yourself? I wouldn't have you pegged as a kid of Hephaestus, but there's been weirder things then a kid of old fire beard being skinny. One time, we a camper who could grow things like a daughter of Demeter or Mr. D., but was actually a daughter of Aphrodite. Stayed perfectly clean every time she helped in the fields. Not even a speck of dirt on her shoes!\" He said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy let out a genuine laugh. That image was funny. Maybe she had some more godly ancestry then just her mother? Was that possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look! They're nearly done! Just the final scene with Theseus leaving his girl behind for old Mr. D. to take back to Olympus. Yeah, like that worked out for her.\" Luke said, a little contempt seeping into his voice. Not a lot, and you would have to be listening for it to hear it, but it was clear as day to Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the play was done, and Dionysus looked a somber fellow, the crowds were cheering and laughing as the entire cabin took a bow, though the guy in the Minotaur costume had troubles getting back up the fake head was so heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron walked onto the stage, clopping his hoof for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening everyone! Now I all know you've seen our new family member, but allow me to formally introduce Perseus Jackson!\" He said, getting a round of applause. No matter your attitude to them normally, It was always welcome to have a new camper. New kid for the Ares kids to beat up on, or the Aphrodite kids to mess with. But it meant that another one of them had survived to make it to camp. That number was always low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up Percy.\" Luke said, patting him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeased the crowed, standing up as they cheered for another win against the dangers of being born a demi-god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on down Percy.\" Chiron called out, making the camps cheer louder. They knew what was coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was confused however. He didn't remember any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as the centaur told him, Percy went down to the stage, standing next to the horseman with his music box in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell us Percy. Do you remember a time you've had something strange happen to you, almost unexplainable before, but now makes sense? All the campers have had at least something, some kind of monster attack them, or watch them when they were little. Anything like that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \"Yeah, but do you mind if I did something else?\" He asked, holding the music box up for the centaur to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I don't see why not. Very well. Though I don't see what could be so interesting about a music box.\" Chiron said, giving it a critical eye as well as Percy. The crazy talk he had spouted earlier that day had thoroughly disturbed him. Talk of war, and the titans rising once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood to face the cheering crowd, looking for Annabeth, who gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy breathed in, reached for the music box lid and...</span></div></div>",

He thought, feeling the sweat drip down his brow. It was, literally do or die time. He could be struck down by lightning as soon as he let her free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy tore open the music box, letting the song play for all to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, due to the amphitheater, which is made with carrying sound in mind to make sure the people at the top could hear, the song rang out loud and clear, echoing into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys were wondering what the heck it was, and why it did nothing, while the girls started crying, though at different levels of intensity. Most were just hearing a hint of the music, though that was more then enough to drive them to tears at the sound. The others, minus Annabeth, were hearing the music, but not the lyrics, and they cried harder then the girls from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth was the only girl unaffected, having heard the full brunt of the song. It was still beautiful to her, but it didn't have to do anything to her. She just smiled as the music filled her soul once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron, who was stamping his hooves in worry, looked at the music box, figuring it to be the source of the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perseus Jackson! Close that box!\" Chiron yelled, preparing to force it closed if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now or never' Percy thought, seeing Chiron about to charge him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melum! I release you from the music box!\" He yelled. \"Come forth! Your master has need of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, the box started to shake violently in Percy's hand. He stood there looking at it, not exactly expecting this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracks appeared in it, running all around it as the music got louder and louder, light emanating from both the open lid of the box and the numerous cracks, steadily growing brighter and brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that the other guys started to hear it as well, because Percy could hear the guys asking what that sound was, referring to the music box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Chiron and Mr. D. noticed The music, though neither was as transfixed as the demi-gods, they still found themselves curious as to who or what Percy was summoning. It wasn't as if they could stop it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy continued to look at the box, watching as the fractures grew wider and wider, the light brighter and brighter, the sound louder and clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, it floated out of his hands, still shaking, the light growing to almost unbearable levels. Everyone was forced to avert their eye's as the small box shook wildly, the song reaching it's crescendo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box exploded, whipping up a strong wind around the entire amphitheater that mirrored the song's tone, tearing at people's hair and clothes, blowing debris everywhere from the stage, which now had a large crater in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, abruptly, the song ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy coughed, rubbing his eyes to see anything, looking to see if anyone was injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be met with pure blue orbs staring into his eyes. No black pupil or white sclera, only pure blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stumbled back slightly, putting some distance between himself and what he could only assume to be Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked her over. Other then her eyes and slightly paler then normal yet shiny skin there was nothing overly notable about her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about 5' 6'' tall, with a thin body type. Her face was thin, from her nose to her chin. Her chest was nothing large, maybe a lower c-cup. Her stomach was flat, neither muscle nor fat. Her hips were small, with a pert rump. Her legs were slender, delicate, ending in petite feet. And her hair, which was shoulder length, was black, contrasting with her skin perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you Melum?\" Percy asked, wanting to make absolutely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled, nodding. \"And you are my master. The one who has called me from the music box.\" She said, her voice carrying above the still rushing wind perfectly, though she barely spoke above a whisper it sounded. Just the sound of it made Percy go weak at the knees. It was the voice he had definitely heard earlier in the woods when he used the music box, the voice singing to him. \"May I know the name of my master?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perseus Jackson. But my friends call me Percy.\" He said, not really sure how to address the literal goddess before him. She was being subservient, though most people he knew were aggressive most of the time, especially the goddess's he had met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perseus? Perseus.\" Melum said, testing out the name. \"Yes. A fine name for a good master. I am your humble servant Lord Perseus. Command me, and I shall do my best to follow through in whatever you may ask.\" She said with another small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerseus Jackson! What in Tartarus have you done?\" Chiron yelled above the dying winds, making his way through the field of debris with great difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of hostility in his voice, Melum placed herself between Percy and the centaur, ready to defend him from any harm this potential enemy may try to cause him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling into the crater at the epicenter of the blast, Chiron found himself staring down with a stone-faced Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam, I don't know who you are or how you got here but I ask that you step aside.\" Chiron said, though it wasn't a matter of asking. He was ordering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot do that. What are your intentions towards the master?\" She asked rigidly, her tone brooking no room for argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? What in the name of... Do you speak of Perseus Jackson? I wish to know what he has done to ruin the amphitheater and why!\" Chiron said, puzzled as to why this woman was regarding Perseus as her master. It was getting strange, even for him. Never had he seen anything like this in his immortal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He freed me, pure and simple. I was inside the music box, waiting for a long time for someone to release me. He was worthy enough to come into possession of it, and he chose to free me, though he did not have to.\" She stated, the melodic tone in her voice gone, ready to make the centaur feel pain if she needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made the puzzle harder for Chiron, not really understanding what was happening. Last time he saw Percy, at least three days ago, He had nothing special about him other then being a demi-god. And yet he now had this strange woman calling him master? What in the name of the gods had happened in such a short amount of time?</span></div></div>",

If he tried to attack, she would end him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Percy yelled at the two, trying to keep things civil. He needed to do something! Chiron wanted to know what was going on, but was ready to attack due to the strange and destructive arrival of Melum. Percy admitted that Chiron had the right to know what was happening, and that the camp wasn't under attack or anything. \"Melum! Sing!\" He told her suddenly, thinking that while it was a long shot, Chiron would at least calm down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what my master?\" She asked, her tone going from the one she used with Chiron to the soft melodic tone once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sing your song, about your past!\" He said, making her nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew in a deep breath, the very air ringing as she did, as if knowing what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron was about to order her to stop and stand down, but before he could do so, and before Melum could sing, a large pillar of fire erupted in the middle of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perseus Jackson!\" A booming, angry voice called out from the raging inferno, making Melum move back closer to Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched as the fire died down, revealing a large winged, burning man like thing with what looked like charred skin. He defiantly didn't remember anything like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perseus Jackson!\" The man-thing roared again. \"Return my helm to me! I know you have taken it! Just like my brother's Master bolt!\" He roared, looking directly at Percy as he flapped his fiery wings in a fury. \"But I will offer you a deal. Bring me back my helm, and I won't reduce your mother's soul to ash. However, whether she lives is yet to be seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you to order my master?\" Melum asked, the steely tone in her voice once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flaming demon turned his gaze to Melum, his face a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare question me, wench?\" He asked, looking directly into her eyes. \"I am Hades!\" He yelled, the fire around him flaring higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum let the flame lick at her skin, not caring. It mattered little to her right now. What mattered was that this... being... tried to order her master around. She could sense he was a god, but he looked a demon in his current guise. Was he truly a god in this realm, or merely an interloper in matters that he should not tamper with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That matters little to me. Now, leave. Or I will make you.\" She said to him, earning a growl for her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think to order me? I am the lord of the dead!\" Hades yelled, flinging his arms forward. At his behest, the flames that swirled around his feet and hands shot towards Melum and Percy, twisting into black hellfire, normally seen only in Tartarus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melum!\" Percy yelled, wishing he had a water source close by. Not that it would do any good, but he would have felt better knowing he can do something. Nothing he could create could have even stood close to his underground uncle. He had seen those flames before, during the battle at the base of the empire state building, just before Hades summoned his armies. It left a large trench in the middle of the street, which some of the skeletal warriors used as, well, trenches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum closed her eyes. The flames did not make her fear for herself, for she could not die. But her master was not so lucky as of now. The bond of immortality had not yet formed, though it had begun in taking root. Ever since he had first touched the Eronomicon, the process had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath. She heard her masters worry for her, but not for himself. It brought a small smile to her face, knowing that in the few moments he had known her that he already cared for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped open her eyes, looking directly at the barrage of flame. With no effort, she released the air in her lungs. It wasn't really singing, closer to yelling or screaming, but not quite that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded strangely beautiful, though it had a physical force behind it that dissuaded one from the sheer beauty of it. It could be compared to opera, but that was a stretch to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound, and the force it carried with it and embodied, raced along the ground, tearing chunks from the stone, stirring up a great wind and leaving a large trench in its wake, the ground and air around it shaking horrendously as the sound waves passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound connected with the hellfire, keeping it from moving forward towards them. Melum continued to sing, keeping up the sound barrier, as the flames melted the stone underneath it to lava in mere seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades, surprised that someone could withstand the flames of punishment, poured more power into it, hoping to incinerate the one who dared to order him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum returned the favor, letting her own power rise. The sound got louder, more intense. The trees around the amphitheater let loose great cracks, though thankfully there were no nymphs in these trees, just in case a play went wrong somehow and the area around it caught fire or exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the sound became painful for most of those hearing it. The sound itself promised pain for Hades, but in turn it caused those around the two divine beings to feel the pain she wanted to inflict on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy, Annabeth and Chiron included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy went to his knees at the sound. It felt like something was splitting open his skull, worse then any headache he had received in the past from any number of monsters, injuries or anything else. It didn't help with the rushing wind and shaking ground, though he could stand easily on that. His dad did cause earthquakes after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades grimaced. He had no love for the children of the Olympians, but he could not kill them. His family, how he detested that word, would all turn their attention on him. Zeus was still angry about him sending the monsters after his newest daughter, Thalia Grace, even though Zeus broke the oath. And his other brother, Poseidon would likely flood the underworld, or at least try to, if he killed Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes. He knew that Poseidon had a child, breaking the oath himself. Technically, he had the right to kill him, but it would not be without retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Hades roared, letting his flames die down slowly. Melum did the same. She would not provoke him into unnecessary battle, knowing that it would likely put her master in danger. \"If you wish to reclaim your mothers soul, Perseus, then you will come to the underworld. Return my helm to me, and your mother will be free.\" He said, his voice a, literal, deathly whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames rose high around Hades as he curled the wings around his body, his black gaze looking at both Percy and Melum. The flames grew bright, forcing the ones that weren't gods to look away. With a great explosion sound coming from the fiery tornado, the flames died down, leaving a melted patch of earth where hades stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light faded, Percy could look again. He saw Melum, crouching over him, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me master. I did not mean to harm you. But it was the only way to stop him.\" She said, her voice sad, but not shaky. \"I will take any punishment you would wish to give me.\" She said, her head bowed. \"Just, please, don't send me away.\" She said, her voice almost choking. She feared that, despite his kindness earlier in freeing her, he would be angry with her. Angry enough to send her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she wouldn't be able to handle that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one person she felt she could be useful to, sending her away, was her greatest fear. It had been since she had accepted the books deal. Without him, she felt that her immortal life would be meaningless. She would be worthless, and likely fade back to nothingness, or so she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" He asked, looking up at her. \"I never turn my back on people. Especially when they need me.\" He said, standing up. \"C'mon. Don't cry.\" He said, pulling the goddess into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum stiffened. He wouldn't... leave her? More tears sprung to her eyes, though these ones of happiness. She slowly wrapped her arms around him, hugging him back as the tears started to fall silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy just patted her back, rubbing it slowly. He looked up, hearing the clopping of hooves, to see Chiron stand over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk, Perseus.\" The old centaur said, his tone brokering no argument but without the hostility it held earlier when Melum was released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy Nodded. \"Yeah. We do. But you have to promise me something.\" Percy said, his own tone saying that he was dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" The horse man said, turning away towards the big house. Percy, after motioning Annabeth over, made his way to the big house. He knew what was likely to happen. He kept his face blank though. It was a matter of life and death right now, and one false move could end in both his and Annabeth's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it be from Zeus, or an angry camp director had yet to be seen. Dionysus was likely going to tear into him for this. Not to mention that the news he had could spell trouble if the god did hear it. What he was about to tell Chiron would be only for him. It would have to stay between them and Chiron, or the fates would have a hard time sorting out the mess that would happen with the knowledge of the future falling to the gods.</span></div></div>",

But two things need to happen. One, I need to know if Mr. D is here.\" Percy said, his own seriousness look boring into the centaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron shook his head. \"No, he was called to an emergency meeting of the gods. Something I think has to do with what you did at the amphitheater. He left just before Hades appeared.\" He said, running his head to dull the last vestiges of pain caused by Melum. \"You are lucky to have survived young lady.\" He said to Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one you call Hades could not have killed me. There is only one who could do so, and that is only by leaving me with no purpose, no use.\" She said, her voice once again melodic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Chiron said, gazing over the goddess. She seemed to have that... aura... that gods had, so it was likely she was in possession of immortality. \"Whatever the case may be, I must ask. Why is Ms. Chase here?\" He asked, turning to the blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that I can back up his claims Chiron.\" Annabeth said, her tone being the one she used when she would be listened to, even if others didn't want to hear. Percy had been on the receiving end of it a few times during the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron sighed. \"Very well. I won't ask until after whatever you have to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \"Yeah, that's probably best. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to swear on the River Styx that what I tell you does not leave this room, and stays between us. If you can't then you're going to only trust us on blind faith, if you'll trust us at all.\" Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron bristled. He hated swearing upon the River of death. But, he had never heard this tone during his time teaching Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I, Chiron, Swear upon the River Styx to not tell a single person, god, mortal or anything else about what is said in this room.\" He said, the sky rumbling in acceptance of the oath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, visibly relaxing. \"I, Perseus Jackson, swear on the River Styx that what I am about to say is the truth.\" He said, the sky rumbling again. \"There, that should prove what I'm about to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron nodded, wondering how Percy knew about ancient Greek customs that weren't normally touched upon in the mythos. \"Very well. I am interested in where this has to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Percy told Chiron a lot of the future. Several things, such as Luke turning traitor and the Eronomicon were left out, as well as his relationship with the fates and Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, that stuff was personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTale finished, Percy sat down in the chair, a glass of water appearing. He wasn't so good at long stories, and that was the longest he had told with having to make sure he didn't give anything away that he shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also explained Melum's music box as something he gained on the return trip through time, which he explained as Kronos' last ditch effort to harm him in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth was silent through the whole thing, surprisingly enough for her, interjecting when Percy forgot a crucial detail here and there. Her late appearance was explained as her getting caught a little while after Percy, so she ended up a little behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron got up and began trotting around, muttering things that are usual in a scenario like this, like 'Not good, Not good in the slightest' and 'By the gods, how did this happen?' all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see why I wanted it kept secret Chiron?\" Percy asked, making the centaur nod gravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. If something like this were to come to the knowledge of the gods, everything would fall apart. The gods would war amongst themselves, blaming one another for this as the titans marched upon Olympus. Oh this is very bad. A second titan war  will be catastrophic, no matter how much we know of the future. By telling me this, you could have already changed things, not to Mention the arrival of a new goddess.\" He said, looking at Melum. \"And, for you my dear, I think you should be wary of Zeus. His promiscuous ways will likely try to claim you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he shall never have me, unless my master wishes it.\" She said evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which I don't and will never.\" Percy said, a grimace on his face. No way he could do that to someone, whoring them out. The thought sickened him immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but I fear Zeus will not like that and try to press his luck. He never did take Rejection well.\" Chiron said. \"There was this one woman, during the old days, that wanted nothing to do with the guise Zeus had set himself up with. Even when he had shown her that he was undeniably the king of gods, she wanted nothing to do with him. In a fit of rage, Zeus ordered Aphrodite's son, Cupid, to strike her heart with a little Experiment Hephaestus whipped up for the love god. A Lead tipped arrow with a golden sliver in the heart of it. This would make her love only the most horrible man in the world, hating everyone else. it eventually drove the poor woman to madness, though I won't say what she did.\" he said, shivering. \"But, suffice to say, Zeus has an intense Jealous streak longer then the Straights of Hercules and the Fields of Asphodel combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matters not. If he tries to harm me or my master, he will feel my wrath. I am not bound by your rules, Centaur. Only by the Rules that govern all gods.\" Melum said, her blue eyes flashing slightly in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, take it as fair warning anyway.\" Chiron said, coughing into his hand. \"Anyways, I think it's time for you to see the Oracle to obtain your quest. A little Early, I know from what You've told me. But it doesn't seem like anything would benefit you from staying for the capture the flag tournament. And don't worry about Mr. Underwood. He will accompany you along on your quest still. Melum, despite her standing, considers herself your servant. Therefore, she would not count as one of the people on a quest. Heroes of old had Retainers and the like on quests they were supposed to undertake alone sometimes, and this would be no different.\" He said, ushering the marked one up the stairs to the Attic. \"I will be attending to the wounded, so I will not be here when you come down.\" He yelled up as the door closed. Taking another moment to calm himself, Chiron trotted out of the big house and over to the Apollo cabin to help the injured of Melum's arrival.</span></div></div>",

Though there was much, much more of the smoke this time, more than any other time he had seen the Oracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched, the smoke formed into three feminine forms, before actually solidifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello, Perseus.' The soft voice of Atropos rang in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We were expecting you.' Clotho said, smoothing out her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was a little startled by their appearance, but he put that aside. \"Um, hey.\" He started, lamely. \"I, uh, came for my quest. Is this one of the way's you'll contact me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis nodded at him, lips curved slightly in a smile showing her amusement with his reaction. 'Indeed. We'll take care of your quests, along with the child of Athena when needed. We'll tell the two of you if some things need to be taken care of on your journeys.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright then.\" Percy said. \"So, what's my quest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, the quest will be the same as last time, so the prophecy regarding it will be the same.' Clotho said. 'You will go west, and face the god who has turned.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned.' Lachesis said. 'You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you will fail to save what matters most in the end.' Atropos intoned.  'But you already know all that, and I hope you remember.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \"Yeah. I go to visit Hades and fight Ares. I find the Master bolt and Hades Helm, and bring it back. Luke,\" He paused, the memory of the day Luke attacked him rising up. \"Luke will betray me, and the rest of us. And I'll 'fail' to save my mom from Hades.\" He said, putting his head in his hand. \"But, somethings not right. Hades never showed up here demanding his helmet back before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're right, he did not.' Atropos said, putting her hand on her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Things will change Perseus. Have you ever heard of the butterfly effect?' Clotho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'll take that as a no.' Lachesis said. 'To put it simply, even the smallest change to the past can greatly alter the future. You woke up early, and you were more brutal with your slaying of the Minotaur. Those acts alone caused great changes in the future, though they may not be obvious at first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Along with our standing beside you, and the knowledge you posses, along with the book and what it holds, the future is in chaos.' Clotho said, pointing at Percy's pocket where the book resided. 'We have been working hard to settle things down, but with the things that book can do and where it has been, it is harder to do so.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though we don't blame you or the book.' Atropos said quickly, seeing a small amount of guilt on Percy's face. 'But let us forget about that now. We are almost finished re-weaving our tapestry of fate up to a certain point, and it need not concern you yet.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, we have a few things that you need to fix on the quest.' Clotho said. 'You remember Medusa, correct?' She asked, getting a nod from Percy. 'Right, well, we think that the poor girl has been punished long enough.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded in agreement. 'It is unfair that she be punished for so long for your father's deed. We think the time is right to lift her curse, and make it a gift.' Lachesis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A way to make up for all the suffering she had to go through, being turned into a monster none could look upon.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, though a little uncertainly. \"Um, how? I can't look at her, as you said. And even if I could, how could I break the curse?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm, yes. It is quite a tall order, as humans put it.' Clotho said, humming in thought. 'The first part is simple enough, the book should have something in it to combat such things. Ask the goddess who is not of our world. She has a much more intimate knowledge of what it contains, we would think. As for the second, we have little to work with.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, only Athena could do so, unless the book has something to do about that as well.' Lachesis said. 'Ask the goddess about that as well, Perseus. If not, we are sure we could work events your way.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. We could find a way for Athena to become repentant enough to feel guilt for what she has done, though that would take time.' Atropos mused. 'And then there is the fact that if our help is not needed, Athena may seek retribution against you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Which we will not allow.' Clotho and Lachesis both said adamantly. 'Perseus, we ask that you plan for such an occasion if our help is not required. For this, we know that the book will help you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright?\" Percy said, having to take all of that in. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sisters of fate looked at one another for a few moments, before nodding. 'Yes. We think that it is time the mother of monsters, Echidna, be brought to heel.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Indeed. Her abilities would make a boon for our side in the war, and it would slow down the monsters working for the gods who are sent after you.' Clotho said, nodding her head again. 'The book could help you in that regard as well.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know how, but alright then. I guess I'll ask Melum as soon as I can.\" Percy said. \"Anything else I should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, that is all. Though if anything new comes up in the weave of destiny we will let you know. Farewell, dear husband. Until next time.' Lachesis said, turning into green smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Indeed. And hopefully you will be more accepting of us as we wish you would be.' Clotho said before she, too, turned to smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos moved away from the swirling green smoke, moving closer to him. 'Yes, dear husband. We will wait for you though, until you feel comfortable sharing your bed with us.' She said, as like Lachesis before her, she pulled him into a kiss, though this one lasted a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she pulled away from Percy, giving a mischievous smile at the, once more, flustered look on his face. She placed her hand on his cheek as she slowly turned to smoke from her feet up. 'Until we have time again, sweet Perseus.' She whispered lovingly as the rest of her body turned to smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green smoke whirled into a single cloud once more, before entering the Oracle once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Percy a moment to come back to his senses. The feel of their lips on his was amazing still, and it brought his natural hormones out. He squashed them down, seeing as he had more important things to do, such as get ready for his quest, along with his secondary objective's.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy walked down the stairs from the still creepy attic, hoping that nothing would get out of hand anytime soon. It seemed that his future would take that in spades, and then some. He suppressed a sigh, bringing a hand to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does my life have to be so messed up?\u201d He asked no one in particular. \u201cWell, I can't say that the fates are doing it, and I can't say they got it out for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it seemed that some being that was more powerful then the fates did have it out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy took off down the halls hearing his name being called, especially considering it was Annabeth who was calling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnab-Oof!\u201d Percy tried to call, before he collided with someone and fell. On reflex, Percy put his hands out to the side, keeping from falling right on them. Below him was Annabeth, who was rubbing her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy blushed at how close they were, but stood up, helping Annabeth as he did so. \u201cWhat's wrong? Where's Melum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's the problem!\u201d Annabeth said frantically. \u201cSome campers followed us here. They were from the Apollo cabin and the Ares cabin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He asked, almost yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind right now. I'll explain on the way.\u201d Annabeth said, grabbing his hand and pulling him along. \u201cCome on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them raced down the hall of the big house, flying down the stairs as if they were blessed by Hermes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going on Annabeth?\u201d Percy asked as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you were up there for a long time. It's been a few hours since you went to speak with the oracle.\u201d She said, stopping as they opened the front door. \u201cSee? The sum's rising already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the sun poking above the mountain tops of their secluded camp. Percy could almost imagine a tired Apollo yawning as he drove the sun, in whatever form it may be, over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa.\u201d Percy said as he shielded his eyes from the sun. \u201cHow'd tha-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time!\u201d Annabeth said, grabbing his hand again. \u201cWe gotta find where they took her.\u201d She said, pulling him off the porch and into the camp grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know why they took Melum?\u201d Percy asked, almost falling over as Annabeth stopped to look around for any indication they might have been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, think.\u201d She said, narrowing her eyes at a few broken branches that were being fussed over by some nymphs. \u201cHer entrance wasn't exactly the nicest. I saw a lot of campers sustained wounds from everything that transpired at the amphitheater. My guess is that the Apollo cabin is after her because she gave so many people injuries that they've been working overtime to heal them. Ares, well, do I have to explain?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting for an answer, she ran off past the nymphs, pulling Percy along again. He nearly tripped over one of them as they lashed out with their legs, thinking he might have been the one to do this to their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were running through the camps woods now, dodging through the trees with ease. More and more signs that a large group of people had been through there showed up, though not as obvious as the nymphs and their trees. It seems they got more careless the further away they got from camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, do you guys think we're far enough away now?\u201d They heard, making the two of them crouch down and hide behind a fallen log. \u201c I mean, we've been leading her through these woods for about twenty minutes now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMicheal Yew, son of Apollo.\u201d Annabeth whispered, recognizing the voice. He went MIA during the final battle of the war, so it was a little bit of a jolt to hear his voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Too bad we can't knock her out. Would be so much easier to have dragged her out here.\u201d A gruffer voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAustin Reeds. Just by the sound of his voice, a child of Ares.\u201d Annabeth whispered again. \u201cThis isn't good. Both are the second in command of their cabins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if <b>some people</b> hadn't been known for using excessive force, we would have tried that.\u201d Micheal said. \u201cYou know, you almost hurt Annabeth pretty badly back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d Another gruff voice said. \u201cShe's just another child of Athena. What could she do, read us to death?\u201d He asked mockingly, laughing at his own stupid joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I don't recognize that voice.\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cMust have been a relatively new camper at this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Kevin.\u201d Austin said. \u201cI swear, you must be stupid or something.\u201d A loud smack sounded, followed by a yelp from Kevin. \u201cYeah, we should be far enough out by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked over at Annabeth, only now noticing that she had a bit of red in her blond hair, mostly the back of her head. Anger started to rise in him, even if it was against other campers. Just what in Tartarus were they thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to ask, when she looked at him with a look that told him that they would talk over it later. It still didn't lessen the anger he was feeling right now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy dared to peek over the log, seeing Melum gagged with a cloth, both tied over her mouth and by a ball of it in her mouth if he was seeing right, and her hands tied. Several kids of Ares, which he could tell were his because of their usual physical characteristics of being big and burly, were holding celestial bronze weapons to her as a kid from Apollo cabin pulled on the rope that bound her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum held her head high though, not looking worried in the slightest. She may not have been able to use her powers at this time, but she had nothing to fear from these mortals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy ducked back beneath the log, looking at Annabeth. \u201cWhat happened? Why didn't she fight back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth looked at him, her storm gray eyes showing that she felt responsible. \u201cWe were sleeping. You were taking so long, I started to get tired. Melum decided that she would be better fit to serve you if she was rested, so she decided to sleep too.\u201d She said. \u201cNext thing I know, I hear the sounds of a group entering the big house. It was starting to get light outside, so I couldn't tell who it was right away. I sat up to ask what they were doing, but Keith, I guess, hit me in the back of the head. It almost knocked me out, and I could hear them ambush Melum while she was still sleeping. There was a bit of a struggle, but Melum didn't fight back with her power. I had asked her after you went up to not use her voice on any campers, just for safety reasons. If she could stand toe to toe with Hades, then who knows what she could do to others if she wanted or if she felt she was in danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, though this did bring more anger to him. Sure, they might be friends in the future, but right now they had crossed a line. One that they would all know in the future, and that is that you never, <b>EVER</b>, fuck with his friends or family. He was about to go over the log to attack, but Annabeth put a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Not right now. We need to be able to disarm them somehow... or something. Going at them would be suicide right now. The Ares kids would kick the crap out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you have your baseball cap?\u201d Percy asked, getting a shake of the head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I left it in the cabin. I didn't think I'd need it.\u201d She explained. \u201cI should have thought of something like this.\u201d She berated herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Percy's turn to grab her shoulder. \u201cIt's not your fault. With everything that's happened o far, it's no surprise that you forgot it.\u201d Percy said, looking her directly in the eye. \u201cI guess I'll have to wing it right now though.\u201d He said, looking over the log again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was taking note of the situation again, when he heard the sound of someone else approaching. Thankfully, it was from a different direction then theirs.</span></div></div>",

I saw her fighting Lord Hades with only her voice.\u201d Austin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl grunted. \u201cFine. I guess looks can be deceiving after all.\u201d The sound of a blade leaving its sheath rang through the clearing \u201cNow, what should we do with you? I could easily just beat the ever-loving shit out of you. And Really, I should. Invading our camp like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Annabeth looked over the log, seeing a girl with long brown hair. She had her sword drawn, pointed right at Melum's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, we really don't like it when people try to invade us. I don't know the last time someone tried to invade, but I heard that it was the Ares cabin that lead the charge. And then you come along, and ruin that honor for us. Make us all look weak.\u201d The girl said, poking the tip of the sword to the girls cheek in an effort to get her to flinch. Getting no reaction out of the goddess, the girl growled out, putting more pressure on the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha? Clarisse!\u201d One of the Apollo boys said, his voice rising in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d She snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Clarisse?' Both Percy and Annabeth thought, giving each other a side long glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl looked nothing like Clarisse, or anything like a child of Ares for that matter. For one, she wasn't tall, over bearing or muscly for that matter. ALL children of Ares looked like warriors ready for battle. Though she did look athletic, something Percy noticed involuntarily. Though it was more sleek then most children of Ares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was still a light brown, though it was longer and, dare they say it, more feminine. Nothing close to one of Aphrodite's kids, but more, normal they guessed. Her eye's weren't piggish, and while her skin seemed to be dirty, it didn't look like it was made of wood or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the only thing that looked remotely like Ares on her would have to have been her mouth. It still had that normal sneer on it, well normal enough for a kid of the war god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, all in all, she looked like a regular girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that is, if she weren't holding someone at sword point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Apollo boy was pointing at Melum's cheek, where Clarisse's sword was cutting. A golden liquid was dripping slowly from the wound, staining Melum's skin golden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchor, the blood of all gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Clarisse asked, bewildered. She pulled her sword away. Even Ares kids knew not to mess with gods, but she didn't think that this little girl was actually a goddess. She had thought that Hades was going easy on her for some reason, like she was a spy of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now!' Percy thought, thinking to take advantage of their panic. He leaped over the downed log, running at them in a full on sprint. As they looked back at him, he flung himself forward, tackling Austin to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin, who was still recovering from the shock that they had abducted a GODDESS of all people, went down like a sack of potato's. He grunted as Percy dove into his stomach, knocking the wind out of him as he fell. His world went black as he felt something hit the side of his head really, really hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy fought the pain in his hand after slamming his fist into Austin's skull. As expected, he had a hard head like his dad. He quickly grabbed the sword in Austin's limp hand, Whipping the blade around so he struck Micheal with the flat of his blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resounding crack, the blade broke across his chest as he was flung back. His hands flew from the rope, bits of blood flying from his mouth as he tried to gasp for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Two down, five to go.' Percy thought, whirling around again to face Melum's kidnappers. He had flung the broken handle to the side, not wanting to actually kill anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, despite how angry he was right now. But that didn't mean that he would leave them in good shape, if the two he had already taken down were any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to his side, Percy heard the crack of breaking wood. He glanced only for a second, long enough to see that Annabeth had taken another of the Apollo camper's bow and broke it over his head, knocking him to the ground with a hard thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess she wasn't playing around either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, at least Clarisse had regained her wit's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d She barked at the two other Ares campers and one Apollo kid left. \u201cGet them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ares kids snapped to attention, their holds on their blades tightening as they charged at Percy. The one Apollo kid still standing tried to run back to use his bow to try and distract Percy with close, but not too close, fake out shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for him to get tripped by very displeased Annabeth. The last thing he saw was her sneaker before darkness overtook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that it wouldn't be enough to seriously hurt a Demigod, but it was enough to knock him out. She was not going to mess around with them. One thing that people would fear later on at the camp would be an angry Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's battle goddess side shown through then, and in no small amount either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the bow, taking a few arrows out of the boy's quiver. She knocked the Arrow, pulling back as far as her arms allowed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please, Lady Artemis.' She began her prayer to the huntress, because she was sure Apollo wasn't going to be in the mood to listen right now. 'Let my arrow strike true.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took aim, aiming at Kevin's leg. Someplace that wouldn't cripple him, but would take him out of the fight. She held her breath, trying to steady her aim.</span></div></div>",

A feeling of clarity washed over her, the bow weighing nothing in her hands even with the draw weight pulling on her, sadly, undeveloped muscles of her younger body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a breath, looking down the shaft of the arrow one last time. It wasn't even shaking the tiniest bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the arrow fly, seeing that it flew true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was about to make an attempt to slice Percy, when his leg gave out beneath him. It took a moment longer for the pain to register in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when it did, hoo boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin went down screaming, clutching at his leg. It didn't even cross his mind to try and pull it out, but he just sat there screaming like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like his dear old dad would. Must be in Ares gene's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth silently thanked the moon goddess, promising to sacrifice some food next chance she could. She dropped the bow, drawing her ever-present dagger as she rushed in to get Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy leapt back from the remaining camper besides Clarisse, who looked like she was ready to burst a vein, if the fact that her face was turning as purple with rage was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy dodged to the side as his opponent struck again, trying his hardest to cleave him in two. The Ares kid swiped his sword to the side, hoping to catch Percy before he could move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to feel something grabbing his wrist, before it was snapped, like a small twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy let the water he had pulled from the air fall to the ground, glad for the extra bit of strength. He wouldn't have been able to snap his wrist as his body was. He hoped that something would help that process of growing along quicker then, you know, actually growing. It would be a pain to get back to the prowess he had before coming back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would kill Kronos, immortality be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked up at Clarisse, seeing as how she was the last one left standing. She had her sword gripped in her hand, the tip stained gold with Melum's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it up Clarisse.\u201d Percy said, locking eyes with her. He would not back down, and he would show her that he was not a force to reckon with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it isn't the newbie.\u201d Clarisse said mockingly, glaring at him. \u201cSorry I wasn't able to give a good old Camp Half-Blood traditional welcome yesterday. How about I give you a good old fashioned beat-down instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse lunged at Percy, swinging her sword down to cut him. He swatted her blade away easily, using more water from the air to enhance his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword flung out of her grasp, flying into a dead tree, where it embedded itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, of all the days to leave my spear at the cabin.\u201d She muttered, taking a swing at Percy. \u201cYour not bad, though I can tell your not one of my half brothers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy dodged to the side, pushing her arm up as her punched her hard in the gut. \u201cNo, I'm not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse dropped her elbow, hoping to catch him upside the head. \u201cWell, still, not bad. You know, if you didn't look like such a pussy I might actually have found you interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy dodged inside her guard, getting right up in her face. \u201cAnd if you weren't such a bitch, you might actually get someone to like you.\u201d Percy said, putting his hands on her shoulder's, both encased in water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, water?\u201d Clarisse said, understanding dawning on her. \u201cOh hell. You're the kid of old sea beard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy said nothing, making water encase her arms, not letting her flail at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Annabeth? You almost done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost! Just gotta cut this last rope. They used stuff that normally only Hephaestus cabin can use. So either they stole some, tricked them into giving them some, or they had some inside help. Not sure which, since they're all likely.\u201d Annabeth said, cutting through the last rope that bound Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry please. I'm not sure what to do with Clarisse here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth refrained from making a retort, just the last few strands about ready to be cut. Man, this celestial bronze rope was annoying to cut through. Well, if it caught Zeus or Ares, it had to be strong. That, and it was invented by the smithing god himself, so there was no questioning it in how well it did it's job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dagger cut through the last thread, the rope that bound Melum's hands falling to the groung. Melum quickly undid her gag, spitting out the wadded up ball in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum, are you okay?\u201d Annabeth asked, looking for any marks on Melum besides the cut that was healing on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am fine. Though I would like to ask that if this happens again, that you remove my gag first.\u201d Melum said, though she did look at both Percy and Annabeth with gratitude, Percy more then Annabeth though. \u201cI will simply sing the bonds off if that happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth took a moment to smack herself in the forehead. The book did say that she was able to make the rocks, flowers and even the earth cry for her. \u201cRight, sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum shook her head. \u201cNo need to apologize. I am happy that I was able to follow the mistress' orders, and that both master and Mistress came to my aid. Though I am sorry for being a burden upon you for this.\u201d She said, looking down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, It's no problem.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut, uh, is there anything we can do about Clarisse? To make sure she won't go yapping about my dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could sing to her, force her to understand completely if you wish it, Master Perseus.\u201d Melum commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster? What the Fu-\u201d Clarisse started to say, before Percy made some more water from the air, dense enough to block her mouth but not enough to make her drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the only way?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not in the slightest.\u201d Melum said with a shake of her head. \u201cThe great tome that you carry has many things that would ensure that she would keep your secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Well, I suppose...\u201d</span></div></div>",

If I may ask, could I see the great tome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBack pocket, right side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth moved to grab it, slipping the little book from Percy's pants. She took it back to Melum and handed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum for her part, took the pocket book like she was being given a child. She took it with care, gently holding it and looking it over with a reverence that was almost unheard of for anyone to have for anything, and almost what she felt for Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened it, looking through it for what she knew would work best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it is. Master, if it would please you, draw out this item to use. I would be happy to explain what it does, if you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExplanation first please.\u201d Percy said, not knowing what he was subjecting Clarisse to. Though he did have a feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you command.\u201d Melum said. \u201cThis is the amulet of twisted Justification. If you put it on someone, they will follow any command or opinion you give them. But, it is not slavery. They give themselves reasons as to why they should listen to you, justifying it in a perfectly rational way. If you were to say, for example, that the one who wears this should give up their job, they will justify it as not being happy with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That was... oddly specific for an example.\u201d Percy said. \u201cIs there anything else in there that is a little more, I don't know, less binding?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Master Perseus. There isn't.\u201d Melum told him. \u201cThis is one of the less imposing artifacts in the great tome, as it still allows the person it is used on to retain their free-will. Unless, you say that they shouldn't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, but nodded. \u201cAlright, fine. Sorry Clarisse, but I gotta do this.\u201d He said, looking at the struggling form of Clarrise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like she was trying to say something, most likely to cuss him out, but her water gag kept her silent. Her arms were still pinned in place by the water, and Percy had done the same with her legs as well a bit ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of her, but willing the water to stay as it was, Percy moved over to Melum and Annabeth. He looked on the page, which showed a tattered picture of the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a normal necklace, at least around the lace part. The amulet itself, however, took the cake. It was shaped like a seven-pointed star, though there were two lines of whatever it was made of intertwined with one another. From the tell-tale lines about it, it was apparently supposed to be shiny or glow or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy, put his hand on the book, directly over the image. \u201cOkay, let's see if this works the same. Amulet of twisted Justification!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, blinding light shot out from the image. It blinded Everyone, save Melum and her godly eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the light died down, Percy found something resting in his hand. He gave it a squeeze, feeling seven sharp points stab slightly into his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he could see again, he turned his hand over to see the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike in the book, it was a seven-pointed star. And he was right, it was very shiny. It reflected the light of the sun in many color's, since it was acting like A prism made of crystal. And that was what it was exactly was made of. Pure crystal, clear as the water in an untouched lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lace that it hung from was silk, though when he tested the strength of it, he found that he just hurt his arms. So, magic string it seems. Works for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the still blinking Clarisse, who was thankfully still bound by the water. He held it up, looking at her through the empty middle of the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said Clarisse, sorry about this.\u201d He said, looping the silk around her neck, Letting the amulet fall to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. Nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, did it work?\u201d Percy asked, looking Clarisse in her rage fueled eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry it Master Perseus.\u201d Melum whispered in even more reverence. \u201cCommand her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked unsure, but he did as asked. \u201cUm, Clarisse, would you stop looking at me like that.\u201d He said, looking at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, her eye's stopped being so... Ares-ish. She didn't look like she would murder him for beating her in a fight anymore. She still looked like she would Murder him, but only because she was tied up at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop looking at me like that too. Just... be civil.\u201d Percy said, still hesitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, her look did go civil. Almost like she could sit down and have a nice conversation with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let her gag dissipate, after making sure she wouldn't choke on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Alright.\u201d She said, sputtering. Seems like he didn't get all the water. \u201cYou beat me in a fight, fair and square. What do you want from me?\u201d She asked, acting like a civil prisoner of war, knowing she was beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could start by making sure you keep our secret just that.\u201d Annabeth said, taking charge. \u201cYou won't tell anyone what happened here, and you'll, ah, 'convince' the people that helped you kidnap Melum to keep it to themselves. By force if Necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, book bitch.\u201d Clarisse said, still keeping her tone civil. \u201cHe beat me in a fight, not you. So only he's able to order me around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Percy said slightly angrily. \u201cShe only said what I would have said. So your going to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse looked at Percy, shrugging. \u201cSure, why not. I can do that Newbie.\u201d She said. \u201cI can see why too. You've got a goddess at your beck and call, and it seems that the head of the lamest cabin already has something for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, surprisingly not blushing. He could tell Clarisse was being honest. He shared a look with his new girlfriend, and it seems they were sharing thoughts on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely worked. Cause Clarisse wouldn't have agreed to this otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater, once we leave camp on our quest, I want you to go speak with Chiron. Tell him Percy said that you could know what was going on, that should allow him to keep his oath. Keep that a secret too.\u201d He said, making her nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, sounds like somethings up. And it seems you would need one of the best fighter's in camp. I can work with that.\u201d She said with a smug grin. \u201cAnything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stopped to think on it. \u201cYeah, two more things for now. Try and treat people better. Nothing too extreme, otherwise people may begin to be suspicious of you or something. But trust me, it will help more in the long run. And keep an eye on Luke for me if you can. Send me an Iris message if he starts to do anything suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I think I can do that. I mean, we are all family. But I'm still going to be a hard-ass to them, toughen them up. And I'll keep an eye on the camp pretty boy, at least the one that isn't one of Aphrodite's sons. Always thought he seemed fishy after his failed quest.\u201d She said, easily agreeing to his requests and justifying it to everyone, mostly herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, satisfied. \u201cHey, Melum? If I take this thing off of her, will all those things I asked her to do stay with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess nodded. \u201cYes Master Perseus. Since it made her justify it to herself, she thinks that she thought of it herself, despite us talking about it in front of her. If anyone checks to see if she was being controlled in any way, they would find nothing, magical or otherwise. The great tome had made sure of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, licking his lips in thought. Unbidden, a thought came to his head. It seems he could make Clarisse do anything he wanted her to do right now. Sure, she was a bitch for the first few years, but she became a great friend and ally later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was having a moral dilemma right now, and he didn't know what to do. His hormones were kicking up a notch, urging the thoughts that weren't completely his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should I really...?' He thought to himself. 'I mean... if it helps next year... I suppose...'</span></div></div>",

So, for trusting me without knowing me, and kicking such ass, I guess I'll join you willingly. Beats having it forced on me later and losing what makes me, me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what that entails, right Clarisse?\u201d Annabeth said Evenly, having taken some offense to the 'Book Bitch' comment earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah. Listening to everything I\u2019m told, no matter what it may be, whether I like it or Blah blah blah.\u201d Clarisse said. \u201cI don't care really. Like I said, better to do it as myself then lose myself later on. I don't want to be some mindless fuck toy, alright? If I got fuck someone, I want to at least be able to enjoy it. I know that's something I'm going to have to do at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Annabeth blinked owlishly (Pardon the pun) at that. Damn, that amulet was effective. Or was this Clarisse's strategic mind working with her self preservation instinct? Did it matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Percy said, reaching for the necklace. \u201cLike I sa-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, go Talk to Chiron, don't tell anyone about this, keep idiots here quiet. I got it, I got it.\u201d She said. \u201cI'm oath bound to follow your words now, and like I said I ain't got much of a choice. I can't try and kill you to get out of this either, as people in the old days did. Besides, if I did try something, I'm pretty sure that I would get a knife in the ribs and the goddess over there screaming at me. And if she could hold back Hades easily, then I don't want to mess with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWise choice.\u201d Melum commented, her voice steely with a dark glint in her eyes. \u201cIf you even think about harming the master, then your fate is already sealed. Trust me mortal, anything you think I can do, I can do so much worse. I will sing death knells that will shred your soul, burn your flesh and dissolve your bones. There will be nothing left of you to torture, and I will still not be done. I will-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum!\u201d Percy said, nearly panicking. \u201cStop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess fell silent immediately, all manner of menace flowing out of her, adopting the subservient look again. \u201cForgive me Master Perseus. I have over stepped my boundaries. But I will never allow anything to happen to you, please understand that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy... really, REALLY didn't know what to say to that, how to feel about it. But he tried his best to convey his... Gratitude?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thank you.\u201d He said, putting a hand on his chest, urging it to slow down. He had heard and seen some terrible things, but that took the cake. \u201cJust... don't say things like that around me again... alright?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish it, my master. I will not speak of it with you in ear shot if I do need to say it again.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarrise though, despite possibly having her very existence threatened, just gave a grin and a barking laugh. \u201cDamn! She's probably scarier then my old man!\u201d she said, shaking her head with a few more laughs. \u201cBut seriously, as I said earlier. I can't do anything about my situation now. Us kids of Ares have a code of honor, despite how we act for the most part. I said that I would be your 'retainer',\u201d she said with vocal quotes obvious. \u201c And I meant it. I'm stuck with that choice now, until one of us dies or you release me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, though he was still uncertain. 'Man, I guess the fates were right. Things definitely not like last time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Perseus.' A familiar voice voice suddenly sounded in his head. 'Be glad that everything you see isn't warping and distorting, changing colors and/or other unpleasant things.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Clotho?' Percy asked. 'Something up?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho sighed. 'Something we've noticed, a little too late. All the work we just did, well, undid itself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's quite strange, really. Whenever we try to implement you into the weave of fate, it unravels. As of now, we have no control over you.' She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, what?!' Percy said, panicking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry, nothing will happen to you.' Clotho assured him. 'But we might need to pull you to our weaving chambers so you can take a look yourself. You and the goddess, since she has knowledge of the book it seems. She might know what is happening.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, though he was starting to get a head ache. It seems things just kept happening and piling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy? Percy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy jumped, Annabeth waving her hand in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were spacing out Percy. Everything okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, though with a shrug. \u201cDon't know. We'll talk about it later, once we're out of camp. It has something to do with 'them'.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth looked confused for a moment, before understanding dawned on her. She nodded in understanding. Their... familiarity with the Fates was something that they had kept, not uttering a peep about them at all to Chiron. For all the centaur knew, Percy nor Annabeth had ever met the three powerful beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at Clarrise, still held in his water with the amulet around her neck. Percy grabbed the necklace, and took it off. He moved the water away from Clarisse, though he kept it at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her arms, glad that Percy had dried her clothes. \u201cThanks 'Boss.' I guess I'm going to have to get used to calling you that. Unless you want me calling you master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head, though the image of this new Clarisse calling him master did pop into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamned Hormones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now that this mess is dealt with, we should get back to camp. We've got to get ready for our quest, and get them some medical attention.\u201d Percy said, gesturing to the other campers, who were still unconscious. \u201cI'll let Chiron know that we'll leave later today, and Clarisse will talk to him after that. Annabeth, you take Melum and introduce her to Grover. You're the best one to make him understand without telling him too much. Also, let him know that Chiron wants to talk with him. Me and Chiron will be making plans for... upcoming events.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d Annabeth said, offering her hand to the still sitting goddess. \u201cCome on Melum, let's go introduce you to a friend of ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum took the hand offered, though she didn't really use it to pull herself up. \u201cThank you mistress, but do not allow me to burden you or the master any further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth just rolled her eyes, pulling the goddess up with gentle force. \u201cCome on, none of that.\u201d She said, gently pulling Melum back towards camp. \u201cAnd what's with you calling me Mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing that Percy or Clarisse heard as the two walked out of hearing range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy coughed, only know taking note of what Melum was calling his girlfriend. He caught Clarisse looking at him, also wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could only shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse looked at him strangely, but shrugged. \u201cSo,\u201d She started, changing the subject. \u201cAny reason your not taking me on this quest that you supposedly have?\u201d She asked, though Percy could sense the genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there is. First is the reason of keeping an eye on things like I said.\u201d Percy said, putting up one finger. \u201cSecond, is for you to train harder. You'll need it next year, trust me. Third, I wouldn't want to take one of the strongest fighters at camp away in case of something unexpected happening, worse then monsters. Fourth, and last that I can think of, is that if you join in on this quest, people are going to get suspicious. We really don't want that.\u201d Percy said, making Clarisse nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, the first and fourth I understand, and some of the third. But, what about next year would I have to train for? And what's worse then the monster's, which I should tell you can't get into camp.\u201d She asked, trying her hardest to not glare at Percy. It was still in her nature, Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe second thing Chiron will tell you about. As for what's worse then monsters, I really don't want to think about it. Crazy stuff happens around me, and that's for a demi-god.\u201d Percy said, trying to suppress a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse shrugged again. She was curious, but it seemed things would be explained to her soon enough. \u201cFine, I can wait for the info. Mind helping me gather these pussies someplace where they won't get sick? Not that it isn't anything Apollo cabin can't heal, but still. Takes a day to heal up completely, and that means one less day of training.\u201d She asked, gesturing to the unconscious campers. \u201cUnless, you're going to have me do it all by myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. \u201cNo, no. Don't worry about it, I'll help. Surprised they're still unconscious though.\u201d Percy said, grabbing the Ares kid he had knocked out and snapped the wrist of before his short, one-sided battle with Clarisse. He dragged the kid, by his shoulder, to a spot that wasn't damp enough to do much in a short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for the next seven or eight minutes, Percy and Clarisse moved people about, before heading back to camp. All the while, Percy was thinking on whether or not he should tell Chiron a little more on what was going on...</span></div></div>",

Argus was driving them to the city, all but his main eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover was constantly shooting Melum nervous glances, averting his eyes when he thought he might have been caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, that it didn't do him any good. Percy and Annabeth were used to Grover's tell signs, and could easily tell he was going into major panic mode, mentally, and yet dying to know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Annabeth had tried to explain to him. But she really couldn't do so without letting somethings slip that were better left unsaid, but she tried her best. So, in the end, she really hadn't said much at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy?\u201d Grover whispered, not for the first time. \u201cCan you please tell me what's going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, yet again. \u201cNo Grover, not yet. Trust me, I wish I could. But you aren't good at keeping secrets, and right now that's a necessary thing. Maybe once this quest is over I can tell you a little bit. Maybe things may happen that force me to tell you, I don't know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover groaned slightly, not liking that he was being kept out of the loop. \u201cBut you haven't even been claimed! You're on a quest without being claimed! That's never happened before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. The fifth time in two minutes. \u201cI'll tell you this, Grover. This goes over the heads of the gods. Way, way over their heads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree old ladies with yarn, Grover.\u201d Percy said, though he didn't like saying it. The fate's definitely weren't old, by appearances at least. He would also have to apologize for that when he got to talk with them next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover froze. Then, he started to shake. It was not lost on him what Percy was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Y-You m-mean...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said with a nod. \u201cThat's all I can say, and Annabeth can back me up on this. Right, Wise-girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth looked at Percy with a playful glare. \u201cSure thing, Se-\u201d She started to say, only to catch herself almost making a slip up. \u201cYeah, I can do that. Just trust us Grover. You're better off not knowing any way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover shook a little more, almost letting out a scared bleat. \u201cA-all r-right. I-i-if you s-say so.\u201d He said nervously as he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed once more. Man, he was doing that a lot today. \u201cLook, G-man. You're still my best friend. It's just... somethings are really complicated.  And top secret. If the wrong people heard about this, then very bad things will happen. Worse then whatever the gods are going to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover nodded, though he looked like he was about to have a heart attack. Worse then whatever the gods could, and apparently were going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Argus. Would you mind not telling anyone about what we're talking about back here?\u201d Percy asked the multi-eyed monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis response was a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Glad you understand the gravity of whats going on.\u201d Annabeth chimed in, smiling at Argus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only nodded, keeping his main eyes on the road. He didn't even open an eye to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a few more minutes, as the country-side changed slowly to the city sprawls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hundred eyed man stopped the van, it was near a place Percy hadn't been for a good few years. Someplace both he and his mother were happy to put behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe Ugliano's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I'm back in time, that means that asshole's back.\u201d Percy mumbled, looking at a missing child/wanted poster with his face on it. He didn't bother to pull it down, knowing that it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Percy, Isn't this where you used to live?\u201d Annabeth asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, if you could call it that.\u201d Percy said, gritting his teeth. He hadn't thought about Gabe for years, how his step-father, it made him nauseous to say that about the guy, lived in this part of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover was covering his nose. \u201cYeah, I can smell him from here. Smells like cigarette smoke and garlic. And beans, lots of beans. You know Percy, your mom was smart. Your step-dad smells so human that it would cover you for a long time, masking your demigod scent from any monsters. She loved you a lot to put up with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grimaced, but held his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSatyr, I would ask you not to speak of this. It seems to upset Master Perseus.\u201d Melum said, speaking for the first time since camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma'am.\u201d Grover said hurriedly. He could smell the power rolling off of the woman when they were at camp. Though he wasn't sure as to why this very powerful woman kept referring to Percy as Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Annabeth had told him was that she was an ancient being, probably older than the titans. And that why she was there was something that was also, coincidentally, top secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther then that, all Grover knew was that she could stand flame to voice against Hades. That was only because he had been in the very back of the amphitheater, where there was the least damage done to both campers and the architecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Some time later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you're saying that I'll be able to look at Medusa if I use this... Ritual?\u201d Percy asked, looking at Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, they were still waiting for the bus. The demigod's and satyr had played Hackey sack for a while, but the fun had worn off after a while, and Grover ate the apple mid-game. So, Percy had pulled Melum aside to ask her about anything that could help in the tasks the Fates had given him. Medusa specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess nodded. \u201cYes, Master Perseus. The Ritual will give you immunity from Hypnosis, literal Death stares, or any other ocular effect that isn't beneficial to you. It will also allow you to see 180 degrees around you, which would help in battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. It sounded really good. It would help a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that worried him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything I should know? Like, it's not going to damage my eyes irreparably after a year is it?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum shook her head furiously. \u201cOh no Master. I would not let you do this if it would do something like that. It is entirely beneficial. But I would like to say that if you wish to not attract unwanted attention, to do this inside a building, or under a thick canopy of trees. Something to block the light that emits from the great tome. Though, I should mention that you will be able to tell where people are by their aura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don't know the exact details, but you should be able to easily tell women apart from men. Women are supposedly to glow with a pink aura. Men don't show an aura, therefore it is easy to tell them apart.\u201d Melum said. \u201cForgive me for not knowing any more Master. I was in a lucid state during my time spent in the Great tome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cHey, none of that. It's not your fault, and I don't blame you. Thanks for letting me know what you could tell me. I'll think over it for a while, talk to Annabeth about it. She deserves to know if I do anything that alters my body... again.\u201d Percy said, mind drifting back to his dip in the river Styx and gaining the blessing of Achilles. Since he wasn't totally exhausted, he guessed that he didn't have the blessing anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it pleases the Master, then it shall be.\u201d Melum said, bowing her head as Percy shook his. He had tried to ask her to not call him 'Master' but she insisted on doing so. He had given up on trying to change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Percy, the bus is here!\u201d Grover called. \u201cCome on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy closed the book, slipping it into his back pocket. His hand drifted over Riptide in his side pocket, glad to have the weapon back in his possession. Truth be told, he felt a little defenseless without it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn it!\u201d Percy called, offering his hand to Melum. \u201cCome on, we need to go. The bus won't stay for long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took his hand graciously, letting him help her to her feet. She dusted off the front of her dress as Percy pulled her along, getting anything that may have fallen on her off. She wanted to look her best for her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got on the bus, they found a spot at the very back. There was a problem though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only room for three people to sit down...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grover was sitting when Percy and Melum got on, hairy arm propped to hold his head as he starred out the window. Annabeth was standing, looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing you hurried. The driver was going to leave any second if I hadn't promised to give him a tip.\u201d She said. \u201cOh well, doesn't matter now. Could you sit down so that we can go though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was about to sit down, but then he noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnabeth, there's only room for two more people.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d She asked, not seeing his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and Mel sit down. I'll find a seat a few rows up.\u201d Percy said, making Annabeth roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed his arm, pulling him back and making him stumble into a seat, opposite of Grover. Annabeth took the empty spot in between them, leaving Melum standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too Mel. Sit down.\u201d Annabeth said, holding Percy in place with her tone telling him not to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d She said graciously, omitting her title for Annabeth since they were in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum moved in front of Percy, smiling down at him. She turned around, and sat on his lap. Nothing provocative, but she did lean back against him with a sigh of content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy, for his part, tried to fight down a blush. Blood was rushing down to his, ahem, personal trident. The close contact of Melum, coupled with the fact that she smelt strangely like ambrosia made sure that he was in a losing battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rod prodded against Melum's rear, though she didn't make a fuss over it. She merely shifted her position, almost making Percy moan as she pseudo-hotdogged him through her dress and his jeans. Even if she wasn't curvy, it was still a pleasant feeling that his mind noted and filed that it liked quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Annabeth or the Fates when they kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth didn't bat an eye. She knew what was going on, being as perceptive as she was, but she honestly didn't care. If Percy wasn't going to complain, then she wasn't going to either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the wheel, the driver was about to carry on, when a few old ladies appeared to be heading towards his bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for a couple of teens he would have sped off if it wasn't for the promise of a tip. But for three old ladies and their rottweiler, who also looked old and slightly deformed, he would wait. Besides, it looked like it would rain any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three old ladies boarded, Percy and Annabeth gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Furies, and apparently a two-headed hell hound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap. Percy, what should we do?\u201d Annabeth asked. \u201cWe can't fight them on the bus, too many people, and a hell hound makes it harder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was about to say something, when Melum spoke. \u201cIf I may, I know of several seal that you could apply to your hand to detain them and help us in the future.\u201d She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll do anything right now. What is it Mel?\u201d Percy asked, hand moving to his pocket to grasp Rip Tide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimply put your hand on the Great Tome. Say imprint seal of Anthro-ization times four, and then touch them one at a time. Do the same with the other hand, but say slave seal.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel, I don't want sla-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave it Percy. It's in that book that the fates told you to use. We don't have time, and it would be a great advantage for the future to have the Furies themselves under control.\u201d Annabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBook? What book?\u201d Grover asked, keeping a scared eye on the three deadly old ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Percy said. \u201cWe'll talk about it later Grover. Just get ready.\u201d Percy said as he put his hand in his back pocket with a little movement. He did as Melum instructed with his hands. \u201cAnnabeth, can I borrow-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay ahead of you Percy. Melum, stand up real quick.\u201d She instructed, giving Percy her Yankee\u2019s ball cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later in Lincoln tunnel~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Furies stood up, turning back to look at them discretely. Their hell hound, which had been staring at them with both heads started to growl, both sets of fangs barred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Percy to not be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll they saw was one Demigod, one Satyr, and one women they couldn't tell what she was besides very powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would find their prey though, through any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started down the Isle, the hell hound following close behind, fire flickering behind their teeth. Their hand bags turned into fiery whips, which they lashed furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d The first Fury hissed out, pulling back the whip to strike at Annabeth. \u201cWhere is the thief?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's not here.\u201d Annabeth said, unflinchingly starring at the Fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster wailed, flinging her whip forwards. The other people on the bus panicked, seeing three old Ladies beating on two teens and a sickly looking 20 year old while their dog growled and barked. Despite the darkness, the sound of old women yelling was utterly terrifying as they beat the group with what looked like purses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Percy did something that he vaguely remembered doing in the past. Something incredibly stupid, but working in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed up to the front of the bus as they were nearing the tunnel, and grabbed the wheel. He turned sharply to the right, slamming the vehicle into the side of the tunnel. Sparks flew from the metal on metal contact as those inside the bus were flung about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, except for Annabeth, Grover and Melum. They were all ready for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whip that meant to hit Annabeth missed by a hair, scorching the seat between her's and Grover's head. Annabeth drew her knife in an instant, swiping it at the Fury's hand and making her drop the whip with a hiss of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hell hound would have pounced, if it weren't for Percy moving the bus left and slamming right again, sending it into a wall.</span></div></div>",

The driver played an excellent part as well, putting the pedal to the metal in his fear of ghosts taking over his bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were down a familiar rural road of Jersey, Percy pushed the wheel to the left, sending the into the woods on the side of the road. He pulled the emergency brake, causing the bus to spin out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, people and monsters were being flung around like rag dolls, mortals and Grover screaming in absolute fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stopped, smashing into a tree. A few more slams were heard, which Percy could only hope was the Furies and their pooch hitting the windows. Especially since they were hard slams that sounded like they would break bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Emergency light blinked on weakly, the doors flying open. The driver ran out of the totaled bus, screaming something about it being possessed. The mortal passengers were quick to follow, almost pulling Percy along with them until he managed to move into the driver seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Furies and their pet  stood there, trying to regain their balance. They had taken a few nasty hits to their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio in the back took this opportunity to rush by, almost knocking the four baddies down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Percy yelled at them, taking the hat off. \u201cOver here you over-grown bats!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fury Percy recalled calling Ms. Dodds at Yancy academy snarled. She snatched up her whip, turning and pointing. \u201cKill!\u201d She shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir dog growled, growing larger as it ran at Percy, both sets of fangs barred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to smash through the windshield as Percy jumped out of the way at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy ran from the bus, the Furies hot on his heels. He could feel the heat of the flaming weapons almost licking his back. The sounds of Snarling soon joined the chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to hear the sounds of Hilary Duff being played on reed pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVines erupted behind Percy, tangling the Feet of the Furies and completely ensnaring their pooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Percy!\u201d Annabeth yelled. \u201cUse the seals!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stopped, looking back to see that the four chasing him were being wrapped in vines. The vines had already muzzled the Hell hound. The Furies were trying to claw at the plants, but Grover was playing too fast, too loud, and too horribly for the vines to break. It was almost like the earth itself was trying to do the best job it could to make him stop playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Melum joined in. She sang, making more and more plants erupt from the ground, taking the whips from the Demonic Grannies. The very air reverberated around her, making sure Grover couldn't be heard. Even the plant life around Melum was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she sang, Percy couldn't tell. It was in a language that was completely alien to him. It was almost like she gave emotions sound. She sang in a voice that was as clear as crystal, musical perfection once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Earth loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked slowly up to the entangled monsters. The Furies glared at him, but the Hell hound was incredibly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive us back what you stole.\u201d They all hissed in unison. \u201cGive up, and you will not face the eternal torment of those who offend the gods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy raised his hands, looking at the seals. He looked at the Furies, who were still struggling. \u201cHow about no.\u201d He said. He wasn't going to let anything, or anybody for that matter, kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZeus will destroy you.\u201d They hissed. \u201cLord Hades will have your soul! He will let us personally take care of your torment, and you will know why we are feared!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy said nothing. He slowly moved his hands towards the one that he remembered disguised herself as Ms. Dodds.</span></div></div>",

But now he had some people on the inside, and very powerful people for Allies now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlecto, Megaera and Tisiphone, the three Furies. They were now under his control. Three of the most fearsome monsters were now under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not so fearsome now, in appearance at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three, upon being touched with the seal of Anthro-ization, had rapidly changed form. Thankfully it was blocked out by a large light show, or Percy might have thrown-up at what he may have saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least they didn't look old anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, not only that, but he now had a very powerful two-headed hell-hound as well. Apparently, it was a straight descendent from Orthus, the Two-headed brother of Cerberus. Apparently that was the one dog that he found at that one ranch a year or so back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but the dog was now... humanoid? It seemed to resemble a woman, though it had dark fur all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo extra heads though, but it did have a tail, ears and claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a split personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne wanted to kill him, the other called him 'Alpha' a lot and seemed to enjoy his company, among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she spoke in jungle speak. Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had given orders to the Furies, telling them to stop blaming him and start looking for Hades Helm, though he worded it as 'whatever it is your trying to find.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Furies had no choice but to obey, though they did grumble about it and said what they thought of him besides. Cursing him with empty words that didn't, couldn't, have any real bite to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe admitted, during it all he did get a little angry. One of them had commented that his mother would make an excellent toy for Hades, which they would be sure to make him watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, she was a pile of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fitting punishment is what she said it would be, to see his mother used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had gotten hers for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two had said that he might as well send them back to Hades the fast way, so they could start their search quicker, having nothing to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more piles of dust joined the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hell hound had swapped between telling him to send her back too, and begging to stay with her Alpha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she had stayed with them. Though it was under strict orders to not harm anyone, not to try and escape, not to try and make things difficult for them and to try not to get them killed. One side of her happily agreed, the other was very reluctant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum had stopped singing a while ago, but not before Annabeth had pulled Grover from his panic attack flute playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, you alright?\u201d Annabeth asked, moving to put a hand on his shaking shoulder. Very rarely did Percy get angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Furies had pissed him off that bad, threatening his mother as they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a moment before Percy spoke, and it was barely above a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're going. Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, walking away from the mass of vines, which had torn under the growth of the Hell-hound's new body. The Docile personality followed, well, like a love-struck puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved past Annabeth, Grover and Melum, taking his pack from her as he went. He capped Riptide, slipping it into his pocket as he walked towards the forest. It was getting dark out, and Percy wanted to get to someplace quiet, someplace to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the tree line, Percy stopped to look back. Everyone else was following him, though only Grover was at him like he was slightly horrified at what he had done. Annabeth and Melum had concerned faces, and it was hard to tell which of the two was more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnabeth, is the next stop where I think it is?\u201d He asked. \u201cYou know, where she is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm pretty sure.\u201d Annabeth said, knowing exactly what Percy was talking about. He had briefed her on what the Fates were asking him to do before they met up with everyone to head out on the quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cOkay. Once we get there, and do what we need to do, we can rest. We can figure out a plan of what to do then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-percy?\u201d Grover stammered, taking his bag From Melum. He was glad that she had thought to grab their packs, since they had forgotten them. \u201cW-what w-w-was that? W-wha-what d-d-d-d-did you j-just do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we get to where we're going Grover, I'll tell you.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut to do that, I want you to promise me that you won't tell a single soul about it. No one, human or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah Percy. I promise.\u201d Grover said, looking at Percy with wide eyes. \u201cI swear it on the River Styx. I won't tell anybody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky rumbled as rain started pouring down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, just great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the canopy was thick beneath the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked into the building, the smell of food washing over him more strongly then it had outside, across the freeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are your parents young man?\u201d An old, middle-eastern voice said. \u201cIt is much to late to be out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked to his left, seeing the veiled form of Medusa, glowing with a pink outline. Floating above her were several words, bullet point style. The first read 'Show you are a child of Poseidon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I'm not going to beat around the bush.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI know who you really are. Could we just not do the whole kind old lady who's really a monster act?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa scoffed. \u201cSuch an impetuous young man. Very well. I would love to fight you, but I can tell who your father is. You smell of the sea-breeze, and you have your father's eyes. What is it that you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I want, Medusa, is to help free you from your curse.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's hair hissed. \u201cFoolish child. This curse cannot be lifted by anyone other then the Gray-eyed one.\u201d She said angrily, before taking a deep breath, patting her hair. When she spoke again, it was with a little bit of charm added to it. \u201cWhy don't you stay here Percy. Become a statue. It would be less painful then the quest you have been sent on. I would polish you everyday, make sure you sparkled and that you would never turn to dust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not going to work Medusa. You can't charm me, and you can't turn me to stone. Besides, helping you is a quest from the Fates themselves. It's going to happen one-way or another.\u201d Percy said, looking right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. If you say that I cannot turn you into a statue, why don't we test that?\u201d She hissed out, hand reaching for her veil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped it off, looking right at Percy. Full on, face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Medusa asked. \u201cH-how can this be? No, you must be a trick. A trick to give me hope, only to crush it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head, getting closer. \u201cNo tricks Medusa. The Fates think you've suffered enough for my dad's mistake. Asking you to meet him in Athena's temple like that.\u201d He said, stopping just in front of her, holding up his hand. \u201cScratch me. Prove to yourself that I'm not a trick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa looked at Percy's hand, her snakes hissing in confusion. She brought up a wrinkled hand, quickly swiping it across the back of Percy's hand, drawing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightish red blood, with the occasional goldish drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blood was turning to Ichor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you're real.\u201d Medusa said. She sat down on a stone bench behind her, looking at Percy the whole time, reciting those two words over again for about two minutes before going silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was looking at her, curiosity taking hold. \u201cUh, you okay?\u201d He asked, taking note of the words over Medusa's head becoming 'Free from curse, by whatever means possible.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-is my torment over?\u201d Medusa asked, her voice tired. \u201cWill I finally be free? To walk amongst people again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said. \u201cYou will...\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was pure gold, with ancient runes that not even Melum could read. Percy though he could read a small bit of it, but he figured it was just his dyslexic mind playing tricks on him. \u201cWear this. I have it on good authority that it'll make your curse something that you can control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa looked at the bracelet, staring at it with a disbelieving look. \u201cDo you think me a fool Percy? A simple trinket cannot undo what has been done to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, considering the fact that I'm the first and only person that you could look at without them turning to stone, I'd say it's a pretty good chance.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sighed heavily, but took the bracelet anyway. \u201cVery well. It never hurts to try, as I've seen over the many centuries I've been cursed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa slipped the bracelet over her hand. For a moment, nothing happened, and Medusa was going to make that known if she didn't feel a great pain in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa doubled over, her hair hissing in pain. She felt as if she was burning, the bracelet being the strongest source of the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you t-tricked me.\u201d Medusa said, clawing at the trinket, desperate to break away from it. \u201cI-I sh-should h-have k-known. Just l-like any o-other-\u201d She would have continued, if the pain hadn't intensified. The feeling from the bracelet started to spread throughout her body, ever so slowly, so agonizingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy starred, shocked at what was happening. Not only the fact that Medusa was hurting, and that he was responsible for it, but at what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin around the bracelet smoothed out, softening. It was so sudden, yet it spread slowly. The effect crept up her arm, spreading across her body as she writhed, her hair biting the air and hissing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it spread, the effect shaped Medusa. Her chest puffed up a bit, though it was hard to see under all her clothes. Her body slimmed, becoming curvier as her hips grew ever so slightly. Her ass grew as well, though not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the effect of the bracelet spread towards her head, Medusa let out a loud, pained scream. Her face smoothed out, looking more like it belonged on a twenty year old then a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Bracelet's power reached her hair, the snakes gave one last hiss of pain as they fell limp. As Percy watched, their scales softened, turning black, dissolving into individual strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's pained cries slowly ended, becoming sobs, which in turn died down to whimpers as Medusa laid on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy slowly moved towards Medusa, having backed up when she started trying to grab him. \u201cMedusa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, young woman Percy would add, looked up at him. Her face was streaked with tears, something which Medusa herself thought had dried up long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Percy?\u201d She asked, sniffing back tears. \u201cWhy would you do this to me? Why give me hope, only to cause me pain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa, I-\u201d Percy started to say, only to have her move away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Stay back!\u201d Medusa cried. \u201cYou're just like the Grey-Eyed One!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy moved towards her, reaching out to grab her shoulder. \u201cMedusa, I th-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay Back!\u201d She yelled, trying to swipe at Percy with her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to have him catch her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go! Let go Damn you!\u201d She yelled, trying to break free of his grip. \u201cHaven't you caused me enough pain you pig-headed monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, what?\u201d Percy asked. That was different. He could understand her not trusting him, but this was something else entirely. Her entire demeanor changed from cursing him to being afraid of his mere presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to be just like your Father? A horrible monster of a god?\u201d Medusa asked accusingly, her struggles not ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa, I have no idea what you're talking about.\u201d Percy said. \u201cJust look at yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Medusa said, going completely still. \u201cWhat's going to change? I'll still be the hideous monster, and I'll still be punished for something that I couldn't stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust... look.\u201d Percy said gently. Something was definitely off here. \u201cI'm sorry that happened. I didn't think it would be painful. Just trust me on this. I wasn't lying about being able to look at you, was I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa said nothing, but she did slowly raise her head. She had her eyes closed, facing Percy's hand as it held her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, slowly, Medusa opened her eyes, taking only a glance at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shot open in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand that Percy was grabbing wasn't wrinkled or clawed. It was a human hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne she hadn't seen in a long, long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I-I don't understand.\u201d She said. She looked at her other hand frantically, feeling her face with it. Only then did she realize that she didn't hear hissing. She grabbed at her hair, expecting to find snakes writhing in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly silky black threads of hair were grasped between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled up again, this time of happiness. \u201cI'm free.\u201d She said softly. \u201cFinally free, after so long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those few words, and the realization that her nightmare was over, the emotional dam burst. She laughed as tears rolled down her face. She shook with silent sobs, blocked out by the sheer joy of her new freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even had her old body back! It was like she hadn't aged a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that other curse, one that Athena hadn't put on her. One that was as bad as being turned into a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms around Percy, catching him off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d She whispered, over and over again. She buried her face into Percy's chest, her tears not soaking his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy awkwardly returned the hug, patting her back. \u201cIt's going to be fine.\u201d He said, not sure how to console her. How do you help someone who was a literal monster for so long, now human again? Above Medusa floated the words 'Take her. She's yours', but Percy ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Percy, there was the sound of the door sliding open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure this is the right place? It smells like a monster here, and these statues are creeping me out. That one even looks like my Uncle Ferdinand.\u201d He heard Grover comment. \u201cOh Percy. There you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of two pairs of shoes. Claws and hooves hitting the floor sounded behind Percy, moving close. Grover was about ask what Percy was doing, when he started to sniff the air, gaining a panicked look. \u201cPercy, Get away from her! She's a monster!\u201d He said, grabbing a tin can to throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Grover, she's not. Not anymore.\u201d Percy said evenly, feeling Medusa flinch at being called a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Grover asked, keeping his can at the ready. Man, he wished he could fight with a blade or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's something we're going to talk about. Annabeth, could you get everyone some food?\u201d He asked his girlfriend, getting a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Alpha doing with lady? She smell like snake.\u201d The hell-hound stated, submissive personality taking the lead at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll talk about that. Just wait for some food, Okay?\u201d Percy said, but phrased it as if asking a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Alpha, I obey.\u201d She said, sitting down on the floor like a dog. Percy was glad that Annabeth had some clothes that fit, even if they were a little tight. He was currently debating on whether or not it was better or worse that the hell-hound humanoid wore clothes that showed off her curves rather then just being naked and being harder to notice.</span></div></div>",

They had just finished dinner, introducing Melum and the Hell-hound, which they had yet to name since she wanted Percy to name her, to the wonders of fast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover was starring at Percy, looking between him and Annabeth every so often. His eyes were wide with disbelief since the story started. He wanted to disbelieve it, think Percy was pulling a joke on him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things stopped him though. One being the fact that Percy had laid the book he was talking about, the Eronomicon, out on the table, flipped to the page that described the Bracelet that was on the woman's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one was that Percy was a bad liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see why we didn't want to tell you?\u201d Annabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover looked between them again. \u201cSo, you're telling me that you two,\u201d He says, pointing to Percy and Annabeth. \u201cCome from the future. There's going to be another war with the titans, and Luke's going to become the living shell of Kronos. She,\u201d He said, pointing to Melum. \u201cIs a goddess from another universe, who was kept in this book.\u201d He said, pointing to the Eronomicon. \u201cWhich, if what you telling me is true, will turn Percy into a god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d Percy said, shrugging. \u201cStill not entirely sure on that last part though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Grover said as he put his head in his hands. \u201cYou're telling me that the fates aren't old ladies, but are actually beautiful women who want to be with Percy. All THREE of them. And they also want you to clean up the gods messes from a long time ago, leading a change in the order of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it so far Grover.\u201d Annabeth said, yawning. She was glad Percy was letting him in on this, but it was taking a while. She wanted some sleep dang it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you okay with that?\u201d Grover asked incredulously. \u201cFrom what you told me, you two were about to hit it off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well things happen Grover.\u201d Annabeth remarked. \u201cI really don't want to have to fight against the Fates, literally, for Percy. Besides, from what Percy told me, they seemed insistent on Percy helping women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine. I guess I can understand that.\u201d Grover said tiredly. This was putting a crazy, unwanted spin on his life. \u201cBut right now, we're currently in the lair of Medusa, former monster due to both your godly parents, who is now un-cursed thanks to Percy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, though something still bugs me about that.\u201d Percy said. \u201cShe called my dad a pig-headed monster of a god. Before she put the bracelet on, she was all love-stuck on my dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover sighed. Normally, he would freak out, but this was just too much. The implications were too much, and he just couldn't feel much about it. What could he do about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, on the bright side I find the Great Lord Pan.\u201d Grover said with a hollow chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd kinda become his successor, becoming the new god of the wild.\u201d Percy said, trying to help his long-time friend. \u201cYou gonna be okay G-man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know Percy. The proof's right in front of me, but I don't know what to feel.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy reached to pat his friend on the back. \u201cSorry for dumping this all on you, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was either that, lie to me or do something else to me with that book.\u201d Grover said, shuddering at the thought. He really didn't want to know what it could do to him. \u201cI shouldn't have bothered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright Grover. You were just curious, and rightly so.\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cWe're outside the camp borders now, and we can and will get attacked by monsters. Even more so since Percy's a child of the Big Three. If Percy was doing something that could have gotten us all killed, you could have tried to talk him out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, I hated lying to you Grover. Even if it was just for this little bit.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover shook his head. \u201cNo, it's fine. You had all this dumped on you, and you were tossed through time. I think it was harder on you then this is on me. And I see why you don't want the gods to know bout this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow about what?\u201d Came Medusa's voice from the doorway behind the counter, followed closely by Medusa herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing you need to worry about Medusa.\u201d Percy said, turning and smiling gently at her. \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa blushed slightly at his smile. It had been so long since she had been able to actually talk with people, much less anyone smiling at her. \u201cO-oh, I'm fine. Better then I have been in centuries, thanks to you.\u201d She said, moving to sit down between Percy and Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a black dress, though it seemed to be fashioned slightly after something that a priestess wore back in ancient Greece. Her feet were bare, and she wore several other bangles on both wrists now. She had forgone the veil, having no need to hide her face anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Medusa, would you mind if I ask you something?\u201d Percy asked, getting shake of her head as an answer. \u201cWhy did you go from asking me to stay with you because of my father, then flip out when I got near you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Medusa went from smiling at him warmly to looking down, shaking slightly with a haunted look in her amethyst colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Medusa, you alright?\u201d Percy asked, reaching out to touch her shoulder only to have her flinch away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to bring Medusa out of her trance though, since her eyes came back into focus. \u201cO-oh. I-I'm sorry. I-it's just that...\u201d She trailed off, taking a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cDo you know the true story behind why I was turned into a monster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn't it because you and my dad did some stuff in Athena's temple?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Medusa said. \u201cWell, in a way, yes. But it wasn't what I wanted.\u201d She said, gaining that haunted look in her eye again. \u201cNo, that isn't what I wanted at all. I think I should tell you what really happened, all of you. I should start by saying that I was a priestess of your mothers Annabeth. Me and my two sisters. We did our duties diligently, as any priestess should. We had all taken vows of chastity, just like your mother. But then, one day, your godly parents got into a horrible fight. Athena won, leaving your father the sore loser. So, in the ways that the gods did back then, he decided to get revenge. He was looking around for priestess' of your mother, finding one to despoil and claim as his own, likely to sire another child as well. Unfortunately for me, he took fancy with me, and began to pursue me with the hopes of taking me from your mother's services.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered a bit, as if she could see it happening again before her eyes. \u201cWhen he grew tired of trying to sweet talk me, he decided to press harder and harder. He would harass one of us whenever me or my sisters would leave the temple. Soon, we were fearful to leave. We prayed to Our Lady, but she did not hear us. It finally happened when a visitor to our temple lead him in during the night.\u201d Tears welled up in her eyes once again, but she didn't even notice them. \u201cOnce he was in, he made his way to our bed chambers and... and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't say it. It was too painful to bring it up. Tears started to fall again, landing on the table as she shook. She could see it happening again, felt as violated as she did that night so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demigods, goddess and Satyr, watched as Medusa broke down crying once again. It didn't take much to put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy wrapped one arm around her, though it was a little awkward due to the height difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-and w-when he f-finished... Athena f-found h-him s-standing over m-me... S-she c-c-cursed m-me a-and my si-sister's t-thinking w-we had l-let him in...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy felt himself getting sick. Was his father really capable of something like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, considering their old ways, not to mention all the half-human monsters that came about because of the gods, it seemed like a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-and then... h-he c-cursed u-us too... w-went around a-and spread t-the story t-that I-I loved him a-and b-betrayed m-my L-Lady...\u201d Medusa was just bawling now. She couldn't talk anymore as the horror of that event rushed over her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy met Annabeth's eyes, both hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, Percy was going to talk with his dad about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving Melum help him get Medusa standing, The two of them helped Medusa back to her room, Melum sitting with her for Percy as she continued to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy went back out, sitting down. He felt drained, and he wanted to sleep. He voiced that opinion to everyone, and they all agreed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was going to be a long trip to Denver. Three days by train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty costly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Percy, Annabeth and Grover, which was almost 200 dollars. Add in Melum, The Hell-hound woman and, surprisingly, Medusa, and it was another 200 dollars. Then pay for sleeper cars, and it all came to around 700 dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it seemed Medusa had saved up money from her time as a monster, easily having more then enough to pay for them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy wanted to object, but she wasn't having any of it. She was going with him, specifically him, and she was going to do her best to help him out. Besides, she wanted his help to learn how to control her abilities, when she was told that that was something else the bracelet did for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover also had said that Medusa still smelt like a monster, so it would provide a bit of extra protection against future monster attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover and Medusa had been told that their next target was the gateway Arch, which is why they were going to St. Louis. And what they were trying to do there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover had nearly choked on the tin can he was eating when he was told that their next target was the Mother of Monster's, Echidna. Even Medusa was wary about something like that. Not to mention the Chimera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was decided. They made plans, deciding that Melum would stick with him at the top, since she was really the only other person in their group that could stand a chance against Echidna. The Hell-hound had wanted to stay, both personalities having their reasons to do so. The submissive one because she wanted to stay with her Alpha, and the aggressive one because she wanted to fight a strong opponent, like the Chimera, but Percy put his foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there they were, all of them spending the days on the train in their car. During the times when the Hell-hound's submissive personality was active, Annabeth tried to teach her more about the English language, and bits of Greek and Latin here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going... okay? It was difficult, to say the least. At Random moments, she would switch personalities, making it difficult to get through lessons. Strangely, she seemed to take to Latin better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleeping arrangements were a bit strange. Grover had his own bed, and the hell-hound slept on the floor of her own accord. Percy was willing to sleep in one of the chairs, but none of the women, besides the hell-hound, were having it. Annabeth offered to share her bed with Percy, getting sputters from Grover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Percy didn't seemed opposed to the idea, nor embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum herself offered to do the same, even taking his spot on the chair if he didn't want to share a bed with anyone. Percy assured her that she didn't have to do something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa was slightly hesitant about it, but she too offered to share a bed with Percy. Percy smiled gently at her, saying that if she was uncomfortable with the thought, then she didn't have to offer. For some reason, Medusa felt her heart beat faster at this, pink dusting her cheeks. Especially when she looked into his eyes, which were a deep sea green that seemed to glow in any light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the End, Percy ended up sleeping besides Melum, due to remembering that they had to meet the Fates. Annabeth seemed strangely unruffled by this. She merely shrugged, giving him a kiss on the cheek and slipping into her bed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy yawned, bored of watching the scenery pass. The sun had set a while ago, so it was even harder to see anything. But it still surprised Percy how much the mist could hide, since he had seen centaurs, satyrs, nymphs and what he thought was the Neamian Lion. He briefly wondered if it would be beneficial if he could take its pelt ealier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to his shared bunk, below Medusa's, Percy carefully crept over. Grover was long asleep, and the hell-hound was sleeping near his bed. Percy briefly wondered about Mrs. O'leary, the tank-sized hell-hound Daedalus had given him to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped beneath the blanket, aware that Melum was watching him the whole time, her blue eyes shining in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you feeling well Master Perseus?\u201d Melum asked, not for the first time. She had been concerned since the night before, as his demeanor had changed as Medusa told her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Mel. I'm fine.\u201dPercy said, yawning again. \u201cCome on, we need to get some sleep. The Fates want to talk with us, something that the book's doing to their work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Master.\u201d Melum said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy closed his eyes, the sound and motion of the train making it hard to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until a haunting sound filled the train car. And not in the bad way either. It was soothing, making it easier to sleep. Percy could feel himself slipping away, drifting to sleep easier. He knew it was Melum singing, since she was the only one capable of sounding like that. His last conscious thought was of doing something for her, even if she protested to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's eyes flew open. He was laying someplace he wasn't familiar with, and this wasn't one of his prophetic dreams that loved to trouble him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ahh, welcome dear Perseus. Welcome, traveling goddess.' Three voice said simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Percy noted that he did feel warmth next to him. \u201cYou must be the Fates that Master Perseus was talking about.\u201d Melum's voice said, the warmth moving to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho and Atropos chuckled, While Lachesis merely smiled. 'Correct, Traveler. We are the ones who weave the tapestry of fate, a delicate process.' Her smiled disappeared, replaced with a frown. 'Which is why we called you two here tonight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said something about it unraveling?\u201d Percy asked, standing up and looking around the chamber. It was a large stone cavern, lit with what looked like stars from beneath them and... was that Olympus down there? Percy could see a large loom in another chamber behind the Fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, that is true.' Clotho said. 'Whenever we try to incorporate you into the weave, it falls apart. We were hoping that the Traveler could explain why that is.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy got a good look at them now, trying not to think about the fact that he was standing above Olympus. All three were dressed in white, form fitting dresses, though they retained their appearance's of youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, unfortunately, do not know. The Great Tome has not seen fit to give me that knowledge.\u201d Melum said. \u201cHowever, I know that inside the Great Tome you might find the answers you seek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Inside?' Atropos asked, raising a delicate eyebrow. Percy was wondering the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Melum said, staring unflinchingly at the three beings. \u201cInside. The Great Tome has an entire universe inside of it, as well as being sentient. I'm sure that it would be happy to answer your questions, as well as meet the one it has marked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates looked at one another, once again seeming to have a conversation silently. 'Very well. How would we go about entering the book?' They all asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, could you take out the Great Tome?\u201d She asked, getting a nod as Percy pulled it from his back pocket. \u201cAll you need to do is put your hand on it, all of us, and command it to grant you entry Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, putting his hand on the book. Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos each placed their hand on Percy's, with Melum merely holding an edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I command you to grant us entry?\u201d Percy said, unsure of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light erupted from beneath their hands, though thanks to everyone having godly eyes, none needed to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it did cause Percy one major headache, as everything turned black again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the hands of the fates and Melum disappear, causing him to worry. Had he done something wrong somehow? Or was he the only one allowed inside the book?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum? Atropos?\u201d He called out. \u201cClotho? Lachesis? Is anybody there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho answers?</span></div></div>",

I am the spirit of Eronomicon. Do not fear for your women, they are fine</b>.\u201d It said. \u201c<b>I must apologize for the darkness, but it will pass in a second. Your mind was not fully capable of handling the dimensional shift, therefore the darkness</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it spoke(?), Percy saw light enter his vision again, mere specks at first, but they grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Percy could see again, he saw that the Fates were looking around for the source of the voice. Melum was looking at him with a small smile, holding her hand out. It was only then that Percy noticed he was laying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her hand, Percy got off the ground and looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, more like a stone tower room the size of Yankee Stadium. It even had large windows dotted around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were tables, bookshelves, even paintings and a large basin filled with strange chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no one besides him and the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa...\u201d Percy gasped, looking around. \u201cUm, we came to ask a few questions? Would you mind answering them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Of course. Anything for the Marked one.</b>\u201d It said, not unlike Melum in tone and respect. \u201c<b>What is it you wish to know</b>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the Fates want to know why every time they try to add me to pattern of fate it falls apart.\u201d Percy said, \u201cDo you know anything about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Of course I do</b>.\u201d It said, though there was no disrespect in it's voice. \u201c<b>It is because, through my influence and nature, you are no longer a singular universal being</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Percy said, confused. He really didn't understand what he was being told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>To put it simply, you are beyond this universe. You exist beyond any singular universe, and therefore are not bound by its destiny</b>.\u201d It said. \u201c<b>By not being bound to its fate, you can no longer be controlled by any universe's rules, besides the rules that govern all universe's simultaneously</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But that causes problems for us.' Atropos said. 'We need certain event to happen, but without Perseus they cannot come to pass.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a moment, the fates seeming to hold their breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>It is... not impossible to come to a deal, regarding your circumstances and positions as weavers of fate</b>.\u201d It said, as if contemplating something. \u201c<b>You could work with the Marked one to weave him into the destiny of this universe, if he so chooses</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates looked at him, before looking at each other once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>But know this</b>.\u201d It said, sounding slightly aggressive, once again not unlike Melum when Percy was threatened. \u201c<b>If you try to weave him to your wiles, making him a puppet, there shall be... undesirable consequences</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates looked unperturbed by the threat. 'We would never think of doing so. We only want what is best for Perseus, but he is integral to the survival of our world as a whole.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Hmm... Very well. I sense the truth behind your words. We have an accord</b>.\u201d It said. <b>'Whether or not the weave is stable is left to the Marked one to decide. I am merely a tool for his glory. I exist to serve, and serve is what I shall do</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, you picked a good chosen.' Clotho said with another small laugh. 'Perseus is, with no question, the greatest hero our world has seen. He will easily surpass the gods, since we believe it is time for a change in leadership.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, speaking of that, I've got another question.\u201d Percy said. Suddenly, he could feel the full attention of the Eronomicon focused on him, as if eager to answer his questions. \u201cWhat exactly is a harem god, and what does it have to do with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Hmm... a question that is not easily answered</b>.\u201d It said, and Percy could almost see a figure rubbing its chin in thought. \u201c<b>Would you like a full explanation now, or a summery for the moment</b>?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I want to know what's happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Very well, Marked one</b>.\u201d It said. Suddenly some very comfy chairs appeared, one for each of them. \u201c<b>Please, sit. It will be a while. I will have the Keepers make some refreshments. And Marked one, would you please allow me to have them take care of your sword while we wait</b>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Percy and company had sat down, Percy hesitantly placing his sword on a table which promptly made it vanish, the Eronomicon began it's explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>The Harem god, which is you Marked one, is the one who I have chosen to own everything that I contain, including myself. He is a god unlike any other, who will become the most powerful being in existence. The Harem god is the one to inherit my creators will, since he is no longer able to do so himself</b>.\u201d The Eronomicon began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>As the Harem God, you will have the knowledge and power of infinite worlds, infinite universe's at your disposal. Even now, as you sleep, I am working to rid you of your mortal limits, allowing you to access heights never before seen. You will be stronger, faster, more resilient. I have almost finished ridding you of your natural-born ailments, and I am implementing knowledge of languages long forgotten by mortals and gods as we speak. Everything I contain is used to serve you, Marked one. There are things inside this tome that could end the world with but a whisper, all at your command, Melum being one of them that you have called upon. But that is not the main purpose of the Harem God. No, no. The Purpose of the Harem God is to know the love of Many women, to know all things perverted and bring down the harsh 'justice' of those in power, by any means possible</b>.\u201d It said, tone gaining a fervor that was almost crazed, frightening Percy a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>You have already started down your path to taking the mantle of the Harem god, setting things in motion that cannot be stopped now. You have already taken on the eyes, and gained a sizable following of women already, powerful ones at that. I am sure you have felt power flowing into you, feeling your natural power grow by leaps and bounds</b>.\u201d It said, tone becoming more controlled. \u201c<b>Women are your source of power, Marked one. Like any god, you need followers, and Women are yours. They will provide you with power, pledging themselves to you and your cause</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice paused, taking a deep breath. \u201c<b>Ah, forgive me. I nearly lost myself in my explanation. But know that everything in here is at your command, Marked one. Everything that I contain is for you, and you only, to use at your discretion. You have tasted the power at your fingertips, and it must feel pleasant</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy tried to calm himself. It was scary, having a disembodied voice go completely nuts over the fact that he was, well, him. And he had a lot of experience with disembodied voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had to admit, the book wasn't wrong. It was pleasant, somewhere in his mind, to have such power at his finger tips. It wasn't the kind of pleasant that every titan and rouge demigod assured him he would feel if he joined them in destroying Olympus, and beyond what Aphrodite's presence felt like. Those types of pleasant felt... wrong, dirty and not real. Fabricated to make him think that it would be good to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not this. No, it felt genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-is there anything else I should know?\u201d He asked, wondering whether or not he wanted to know. \u201cAny Drawbacks or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Beings of order and virginity would oppose you, if that is what you mean</b>.\u201d It said. \u201c<b>Otherwise, I can think of only one thing that you might want to know</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? What's that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Well, you may find that you will change over time. Not your physical appearance, but you might find yourself doing things that you might not otherwise do. Things that you have been taught in society are undesirable</b>.\u201d It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike stealing and stuff like that?\u201d Percy asked, though he felt as if he was only touching the tip of the ice-burg here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>That is certainly one thing, but I was hinting at things in a more sexual nature</b>.\u201d It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Percy said, standing up from his chair in a flash. \u201cI don't want to become a rapist! Or a pedophile or anything like that!\u201d He said, feeling sick to his stomach. 'I don't want to be like my dad.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I never said that you had to, or would. It depends on how far you yourself are willing to go</b>.\u201d It said. \u201c<b>But, I could try to help you keep some bits of your morals, though it is against my nature to do much in that department. And when I say that, I mean that I am literally incapable of doing much for that, but I can try. I will see if I can copy certain morals and permanently integrate them into you, so that you will not become a 'rapist.</b>'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy calmed down slightly, nodding. Man, things were just beating down on him. One thing after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay... I... think I can work with that.\u201d Percy said, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, several glasses of water popped up by everyone, and Percy was quick to drink it. He needed to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Marked one, I couldn't help but hear all your conversations about your quest</b>.\u201d The Eronomicon said, dragging Percy from his thoughts. \u201c<b>If it would please you, I can offer advise on what items would help you in the near future</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, but then he thought on it. Would it really be that bad if he prepared more using the book?</span></div></div>",

How long was I asleep?\u201d He asked, moving to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy!\u201d Annabeth said, grabbing him in a tight hug. \u201cAre you okay? What happened with the Fates? What took so long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Annabeth. Slow down.\u201d Percy said groggily, though he did return the hug earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth felt something wash over her, as she shuddered as her arousal spiked suddenly. It took everything she had to not moan out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry. Forgot to turn those seals off.\u201d He said, letting go of her as his arms and legs glowed, even from underneath his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Annabeth a moment to feel confident walking again, as her legs turned to mush when Percy hugged her. It took even longer for her to be able to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, what happened?\u201d She asked, glad that Grover was getting some food with Medusa, and the hell-hound was sleeping soundly still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood up, stretching his arms into the air. He felt like he had slept for days, though that couldn't be possible, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a long story Annabeth, I'll tell you later. How long was I out for? It feels like I slept for weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry two days, or close to it. We're almost to St. Louis now. Come on, you must be hungry.\u201d She said, pulling him and Melum, who had just stood up, out the door and towards the dining car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later, near the arch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure this is going to work?\u201d Grover asked. He could smell an extremely powerful monster around, one that wasn't Medusa or a Hell-hound. And this was before they went underground, so there should have been no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Grover, I'm 100 percent sure. Relax.\u201d Percy said, having one hand in his pocket, grasping the new Riptide and something else, which is what he planned to use on Echidna and chimera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs They neared the Elevator, Percy had Melum Medusa and the Hell-hound go up first, along with a family and their little boy. Behind them was a large lady carrying a barking and growling Chihuahua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchinda and the Chimera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy made no movements that would make her suspect him knowing who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Elevator came down again, Percy, Grover and Annabeth got loaded into it with Echidna, the Chimera yapping all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo parents?\u201d Echidna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready up there. Wasn't enough room in the last elevator.\u201d Percy answers, making the disguised Chimera bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush Sonny, not now.\u201d She said, stroking her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh?\u201d Grover said, stuttering slightly. \u201cIs that his name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d She said, smiling a horrible smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got out at the top, Percy actually took the time to enjoy the scenery. After all, it wasn't often that he got to stay in high places with a view like this. Zeus would have blasted him with his master bolt if he tried. The only time he did get to be up in the air was on a Pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem like very long when The park ranger was calling for everyone to move near the elevator to leave, as the monument was closing for the night. Medusa, the Hell-hound and another family got on the elevator down. On the Next Elevator, Annabeth and Grover, along with the family with their kid got on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Percy, Melum, Echidna, the Chimera and the Park Ranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor park ranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Echidna.\u201d Percy said, walking up next to her as she looked out the window. \u201cHow's the little Chimera doing?\u201d He asked in a baby voice, making the monster bark angrily as he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, someone seems confident in themselves. But I'm surprised you knew who I was.\u201d Echidna said, her voice trying to be menacing. And it would have been as well, if Percy wasn't used to much scarier things yelling at him and cursing his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, I know a lot of things that I shouldn't.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut why don't we skip all the witty banter. I've got a lot of energy to burn, and I need to fight something. I wonder if you or your son could give me a challenge though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchidna growled at him, like her son. \u201cArrogant little brat. Very well.\u201d She said, letting the Chimera jump from her arms and onto the ground, where it began to transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy only yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum started her part, having rehearsed it back on the train. She ran over to the park Ranger, who obviously noticed something was wrong with the lady and her dog. \u201cSir, I'm going to need you to leave. I've been helping that boy track down the people who kidnapped his mother. This lady is a part of that group. Alert the authorities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not the guard believed her didn't matter. His mortal instincts were telling him to scram, and he did so. He pushed out the emergency exit, calling into his radio for back-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chimera tried to lunge at Percy, but water formed in front of it, blocking its path. \u201cAh ah ah.\u201d Percy chided. \u201cWe don't want the fight to end so soon, do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping the water around the lions mouth, Percy just vanished, appearing next to Echidna, grabbing her arm. \u201cEnjoy. You'll be much more pleasing to the eye.\u201d He said, as she was engulfed in light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy jumped several feet in the air, something that should have been impossible, and landed perfectly on the Chimera's back. The diamondback snake tail tried to bit him, but Percy moved just inches out of the way every time, disappearing and reappearing in different spots on its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light died around Echidna, Percy grabbed the snake, causing light to erupt from the Chimera. He vanished and appeared next to Echidna again, slipping something around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new and improved Echidna blinked her eyes, rubbing them to get them to stop being blurry. After doing so, her eyes landed on Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of hatred, she looked at him with love. Pure, undiluted, unfathomable love. Something that only Melum and Annabeth had in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quite the looker now as well, almost something beyond mortal comprehension. She had slimmed considerably, even growing a few inches. Her hair, which hung to her waist, was black. Her assets grew considerably, though her clothes were still falling around her. Her skin was tinged green, and covered in scales on her arms and legs. She had a long, thick snake like tail, almost dragon like, which was probably stronger then it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy whistled, teleporting back over to the Front of the Chimera as he slipped a ring onto his hand, putting another onto the now human figure of the Chimera.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the light died around the Chimera, Percy took in the new woman's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had fur, much like the hell-hound, though it was more golden like a lion. She had a large golden mane, surrounding her head, and a long tail sprouting from her backside, looking like a snake's skin tipped with a rattler. Her fur was enough to cover certain parts of her, and she also had a large tuft of fur covering her breasts, which were quite large. Atop her head stood large, curling horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smirked, thinking of an emotion. Immediately the Chimera smiled, showing off her human teeth with extra pointy fangs, poking just from under her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother emotion, and her face frowned, gaining a sad look that looked absolutely adorable on her face somehow and a sad bleat like a goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another and she growled, shaking her tail, sounding like a whole band of Maraca players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, they worked.\u201d Percy said. \u201cGlad those worked right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum walked up beside him, smile adorning her face. \u201cCongratulations Master. It seems that you are taking to your new power nicely. You didn't even have to use your sword.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned, patting the pocket with Riptide. \u201cYeah, well, that's for something else. C'mon. Let's go before the police show up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy put his hands on Melum, disappearing wit her. He reappeared without her, putting one hand on the Chimera's shoulder, who walked over to him like a loyal puppy, and the other on Echidna's. In an instant, all three of them vanished, the process easier with the power that surged through Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the mother of monsters and one of her most powerful children at his command did give him a sufficient power boost after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reappeared at the base of the arch, where Melum was waiting, watching as police helicopters and other vehicles rushed the seen, with a news van not far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, lets get out of here. Melum, do you know where everyone else is at?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they should be at the train station waiting for us as per your orders.\u201d She said. \u201cI saw Mistress Annabeth and the Satyr get into one of those 'taxis' just before you arrived. Judging by the time it took to get here, they should be there in five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled at her, making Melum flush. \u201cGood job Mel.\u201d Percy said, moving closer to her. \u201cMaybe I should... reward you later.\u201d He whispered, wrapping his arms around her as he activated the seals on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum gasped, moaning. It was a delightful sound, hearing the goddess mewl under his careful touch, the growing wetness between her legs becoming more evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they didn't have the time to take it further then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEchidna, place your hand on my shoulder.\u201d Percy said, the Chimera already doing so. He deactivated the seals. When she had done so, Percy vanished, pulling them along with him to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later, in their suite on the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone, say hello to Echidna and the Chimera.\u201d Percy said, pointing to each as they sat on the chairs in the room. \u201cThey'll be joining us for the remainder of this quest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover nearly choked. \u201cBy the gods.\u201d He whispered. \u201cI-I didn't think you would... could do something like that. I'm going to need nose plugs or something.\u201d He muttered, laying down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned at Annabeth and Medusa. \u201cWhy don't I take you two to the dinner? My treat.\u201d He said, though he did level an eye at Medusa. \u201cAnd I mean it. You won't pay for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa nodded, blushing. She was so unused to the way things were done now, never having the chance to really live in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Percy said, grabbing both their hands. \u201cMelum, keep an eye on things would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Master.\u201d Melum said with a smile, happy that she could help and that he trusted her enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, hold on, and close your eyes.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women wondered what Percy was talking about, but complied. They closed their eyes, holding tightly onto Percy's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, everything seemed to rush away from them. They couldn't hear or feel the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can look now.\u201d Percy said, letting go of their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women did so. When they saw where they were, they felt their breath taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were on a cliff, forest at their backs, looking out over the city as the sun set behind it. In the distance, they could see their train speeding forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, what happened?\u201d Annabeth asked, once she had gotten her voice back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy lifted his feet, pointing to his shoes. Annabeth could tell that they weren't his normal shoes, instead looking like some very expensive, but oh so comfortable running shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's a reason I was asleep for so long.\u201d Percy said, before going on to explain what happened when he met with the fates, going inside the Eronomicon and talking with the book itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went on to explain that it felt like he spent a few weeks in there, at least according to Melum. He had some things done to his body, as well as taking a few more artifacts for their journey. He told her about the shoes, known as The Boots of the Wandering God and how he took possession of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the things that had happened, Percy had a list to tell her and Medusa. He had the Seal of the addicting limb placed on all four of his limbs, and he had learned a fighting style called the Casanova's dance, making Medusa stifle a laugh. Apparently, he was a child of Aphrodite's, and he had the unfortunate luck of stumbling onto her lair one evening. She really didn't like him, hearing about his exploits from the grapevine. He was one person that Medusa gladly turned to stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had also received the Lover's Necklace, which was what was around Echidna's neck, and the Empathy Rings, which he wore one of and the Chimera wore the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also had the Tongue of the Silver Serpent ritual placed on him by the Keepers, insanely beautiful women inside the Eronomicon that acted like a hive mind in some ways, yet individually in others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy popped away for a moment, reappearing with a table, candles and some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Paris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the next hour or so, they all sat atop the cliff, eating their food and getting to know one another. Well, Medusa got to know them, and they learned about Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, she had loved the sea before what happened with Poseidon. Her favorite color was red, and she loved her family more then anything else. Which only served to depress her when she remembered what had happened to her sister's, both of them fading from existance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy consoled her, remembering something the Fates had told him before he left. Even if something fades, it could be brought back if someone believed in it hard enough. That was something he hadn't known, and was grateful they had told him. Now he only had to do some research on beings that had faded and remind people that they existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa had taken the news well, almost crying again. Man, was she emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night ended, for Medusa at least, when Percy gave her a rose, taking her back to the train. As she set it down, she accidentally pricked her thumb. She couldn't help but smile though, knowing that Percy wasn't like his father. Inside her heart, love started welling up incredibly fast. When she fell asleep, she dreamed of the green eyed demigod constantly, always happy moments. Always loving moments. Always him, with her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy appeared next to Annabeth after putting the table back in its rightful place, the owner of the restaurant never noticing it was missing. They sat on the edge of the cliff, watching as the lights in the city flickered on, the sun nearly gone down completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Annabeth, I'm kinda glad.\u201d Percy stated, holding her against him. \u201cDespite everything that's happened, I'm glad. I mean, sure, we'll never have a normal relationship now, but we never really would have in the first place. We're both Demigods, and our parents hate each other, not to mention all the crazy stuff we would have gotten into after the titan war. And trust me, it would have been horrible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d She asked, leaning her head on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccording to the Fates, there would have been another gigantomachy.\u201d Percy said, making Annabeth look at him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d She said, for once clueless about what Percy was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA war with the giants, the ones who were supposed to tear down Olympus because of the way Zeus ruled.\u201d Percy said. \u201cGaea would have tried awakening, which would have caused more conflict since she would have tried to destroy the world to make it anew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would have met the roman counterparts of both the gods and Camp Half-blood. Strange, isn't it?\u201d Percy said with a laugh. \u201cMr. D. would actually be friendly towards us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth giggled softly. \u201cNow there's a thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said, looking up as the stars started to shine in the sky. He almost caught himself looking for Zoe's constellation. \u201cBut I would have lost my memory in a gambit due to Hera's meddling. I would have forgotten about everyone I knew, everyone I cared about. We would have lost more people in that war then in this one, and we would have to fight some of the most powerful beings in existence. But at the same time, we would have made many friends and brought peace, or some semblance of it, between the true civilizations of Greece and Rome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm.\u201d Annabeth hummed in thought. \u201cDoesn't sound too bad. We could deal with it, I would like to think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy held Annabeth tighter. \u201cYes, we could have. But I almost lost you too many times Annabeth. We were separated for a long time, at least a long time for demigods. Not only that, but we were dragged to Tartarus. Not just the place, but the primordial being himself. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d Percy said, feeling tears gathering in his eyes at the thought of losing Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth thought on that, the news not entirely shocking. But still, it was disheartening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don't have to worry about that now. With the Fates working with me to weave a better future, and the power that I now have, I can stop all that. I can make sure that Gaea doesn't start another pointless war. But first I've got to deal with this one. Unfortunately, Kronos needs to rise. He needs to put up a serious threat to the gods. I can't save Luke, Annabeth, not even now. He needs to become the new vessel of Kronos. But I'll make sure he's redeemed in the after-life.\u201d Percy said, pulling her against him even tighter. \u201cAnd then there are my new responsibilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cResponsibilities?\u201d Annabeth asked, watching as the moon rose over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, responsibilities.\u201d Percy said. \u201cDue to my new position as the Harem god. Well, Marked one as the book called me. I'm not really there yet, but I'm already on my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth looked up at Percy, the unasked question of just what is a Harem god on her lips. But Percy beat her to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike all gods, I need to have followers. People who believe in me, and not just in the 'you can do it!' family or friend way. Lover's, slaves, concubines, wives, call it whatever you want. But Women are the ones who need to be my followers. They are the 'Harem' in Harem god. Millions of women, Annabeth, Millions. Not to mention that I'm not a true part of this universe anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, not part of this universe?\u201d She asked, not caring about the other part. She already made her peace with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since the Eronomicon is not actually part of any universe, it is beyond them all. Same with me now. That's why the Fates couldn't weave me into the pattern. I'm beyond their power to control.\u201d Percy said, looking up at the full moon. They still had a few weeks left until the deadline, due to his leaving very early. They had time to plan still, and Percy was thinking on it a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut doesn't that leave you defenseless against the gods?\u201d Annabeth asked, worried for her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. \u201cNo, not in the slightest. The Eronomicon has tons of stuff in it that would work against the gods. The book reworked Riptide, merging it with several other swords and coated it with a metal of its own creation. Riptide is unbreakable now, and sharper then ever, and it could easily take down a god. And that's not pride talking, but facts. I used it to slice through some of the hardest materials known to man like a hot knife through butter. Not to mention my new eyes that I got before we helped Medusa. I told you a bit about them, but I can see things that normal people, even demigods can't look at. Whether it be Medusa's gaze or a god's true form. Illusions don't work on me now either. And neither of these are the true purpose of the eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what's that Percy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be able to see what it takes for a woman to join me. So that I can make her mine.\u201d Percy said, looking at Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's it say about me then?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt says that you are already mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth's lips twitched upwards, forming a smile for a moment as she moved even closer to Percy. \u201cWell, your eyes see the truth then.\u201d She said, gently pressing her lips against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was eager to kiss back, turning to wrap her in another hug. In an instant, They were in the woods, Percy pressing her against a tree as they continued to kiss. His hands held her sides, the seals turned on at a low power, providing Annabeth with constant pleasure, but only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth could feel her own hormones acting up, despite still being in her pre-teen body. She wanted his touch, craved it. It was becoming an almost physical need to have him touch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Percy pulled back, she was panting, her face flush with arousal. \u201cPercy...\u201d She said throatily. \u201cPlease, don't stop...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's eyes twinkled in the dim light of the forest, but he shook his head. \u201cNo Annabeth, not tonight. Not when Artemis is watching so closely. Besides, we're still young. Though give it a few weeks, and we'll be back in our older bodies. The seal I used to bring you back in time to me is aging our bodies at a rapid rate, and will only stop when we're in the prime of our memories. In a few weeks, I will take you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth almost moaned at being denied, but she held it back. Just a few weeks, and she would be back to her older body. Then she could have Percy. She nodded weakly, accepting his terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, we should get back to the train. We have to make plans for dealing with Ares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world slipped away around her, blurring for a moment. Then she felt the rocking of the train, the sounds of the wheels turning on their tracks. The cabin was dark, but the blue of Melum's eyes cut through the darkness again. The twin blue orbs passed over them, and Annabeth thought she saw the flash of a smile for a moment from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Percy kiss her cheek tenderly, laying her down. It was only then that she realized Percy was carrying her bridal style. She felt so safe in his arms, she almost didn't want to let go of him, didn't want him to let go of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a look from Percy, two green eyes glowing softly, Melum began singing. A soft lullaby, just like the one two nights ago. Annabeth felt her eyelids grow heavy, the music entering her soul once more. She drifted in and out of sleep, falling deeper and deeper every time she blinked. Soon enough, she was sleeping soundly, a smile gracing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she would be with Percy. She looked forward to the day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy looked at Melum, sending an unspoken message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll be back soon. Get ready to leave, and make sure they're asleep.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a glance at her, and she understood. She nodded her head, starting her song once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy vanished once again, reappearing far away, but not as far as Paris. It was a hill, topped with a lone Pine tree that reached for the heavens. It over looked a camp, most of which was silent and dark, save the clang of hammers at a forge of late night campers of cabin 9 working hard on their latest project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamp half-blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was standing next to Thalia's tree. He had in his hand an old fashioned label maker. \u201cHey Thalia. I know you don't know me, but I know you can hear me. And, believe it or not, I know you Personally. Time-travel is tricky business after all.\u201d Percy said with a small laugh. \u201cBut I just want you to know, I'm sorry for what your dad did to you, what my dad and Hades made him do. A lot of things about the gods right now are messed up, and we get blamed for just existing. But don't worry. In a years time, you'll be free of this tree. It'll seem bad at first, and I can only guess it will be painful for you, what's going to happen, but just try and stick through it.\u201d Percy said, groaning when he realized he made a bad pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, when did he get so good with words? Guess it was the serpent tongue ritual at work, plus the Eronomicon working its own magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the item in his hand. Was he really going to do something like this? It seemed like it. But would it be a gross breach of the trust that him and his cousin would have in the future? Almost certainly, yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began making a label, he thought about what it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Label Maker of Ownership. To use it is to take complete ownership of something, ownership so strong that it rewrote reality. Every person who ever existed, and has yet to exist would accept my ownership of whatever I label. They would accept that I could do anything I wanted with it. Though it had to be something Tangible, something for the label to stick to. It would take three days to take ownership of someone else though.' He thought, printing the label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though this is a special case. Thalia is bound to the tree, so if I take control of the tree I take ownership of her.' He thought, looking at the label in the darkness. 'A useful tool when needed, but easily broken.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy peeled the tape off the back of the label, holding it inches from Thalia's tree. \u201cForgive me Thalia.\u201d He said, applying the label to the bark, watching as it burned itself into the wood and the label turned to smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther then that, nothing happened. No light show, no tears in the fabric of space or time, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the rest of the world, save Percy, nothing had happened at all. Things had been the way they always had been. None would know, save for him, what he had done that night, under the full moon. Percy put his hand on the bark, and he swore he almost felt a heart beat, with a familiar voice on the wind as it sung through the branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgive what Percy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even Thalia herself would know. To her, it would be as natural as anything else. It had always been that way, even if she was older then him by a decent bit. She was both a person and an object, but both halves of her being were his property. To do with as he pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy put the label maker back in his pocket, the Eronomicon storing it once again. He sat down under the tree for a bit, looking up at the sky. The branches parted slightly, moving out of his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are conscious in there after all huh?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cDon't worry, I'll get you out of there soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while Later, Percy stood up, saying his good-byes to Thalia, his Thalia now. In another instant, Percy was gone, almost as if he was never there. Anyone who could understand the language of nature would have heard her whispering good-bye to him, wanting to beg him not to leave without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to protect the camp was what he had told her to do, long ago. In a dream that happened before she was even born. Percy had told her to protect the camp, though she did not know his face or name at the time. He owned her, and she thanked him for it. She took his purpose to heart, and was now the tree that sustained the barrier that protected the camp. Until he said otherwise, she would continue to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would wait for him forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause that was what property did.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy appeared in the big house. Everything was dark, save for a light down the hall. Percy made his way down the hall, feet never making a sound despite the loose floor boards. In fact, Percy's feet would never make a sound again unless he willed it. Such were the perks of having shoes that belonged to a god of thieves, not unlike Hermes, but more specialized in traveling and thievery-like skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy peered into the window, seeing Chiron in his magical wheelchair at a desk, grading papers. Old habits died hard, though he supposed that Chiron never stopped teaching, only changing his methods of doing so over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy knocked on the door, making the immortal centaur look up from what was most likely ancient Greek tests. He wheeled over to the door, wondering who could be wanting to speak with him at that hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy? What in blazes are you doing here?\u201d Chiron asked upon realizing that it wasn't an Iris-message. \u201cYou should be halfway to the underworld by now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged. \u201cYeah, I should be. I can be back there in a second though.\u201d He said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron was about to raise questions about how he planned to do that, but decided against it. Percy was extraordinary, even for a demigod. Not to mention having a goddess from before the titans at his beck and call, having some deal with the Fates themselves among any number of other things that Chiron had a feeling were being kept from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, it would only raise more questions while giving him a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you here then Percy?\u201d Chiron asked, skipping straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a heads up on what's going on. Don't want to send an IM for obvious reasons.\u201d He said, the teacher seeing his point. No need to let the gods know what they don't need to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well, could you please make it brief? I have to finish correcting these papers, since your little... whatever you did to Clarisse and having me explain it took up an entire day.\u201d He said, causing Percy to smile guiltily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Medusa has been dealt with, and Echidna and the Chimera are now on our side.\u201d Percy said, knowing that they were on 'his' side specifically. \u201cWe're on a train heading to Denver right now, and we should be there tomorrow afternoon at latest.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron nodded, taking that in. They were making excellent progress, and Percy was doing well in his mission for the Fates. \u201cGood, good. I want to know how you did it, but at the same time I know it isn't for me to know. Anything else I should know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d Percy admitted, since there was nothing else Chiron needed to know. \u201cBut I also came by to check on things around camp. Have people started taking sides in this whole thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron sighed, rubbing his face. \u201cOh yes. I'll tell you Percy, It's starting to look like another Trojan war here. Athena has sided with Zeus, as usual in Olympian conflicts.  Aphrodite, Ares and Apollo are siding with your father, seeing reason to know that you are not the culprit. And, as I'm sure you know, the kids tend to reflect upon their parents rivalries. And, I'm sorry Percy, but Poseidon told me to let the campers know that you are his son. Most other Olympians are neutral as of now, but it won't be long before they are forced to pick a side. Dionysus hasn't been back since you called your goddess from her prison, so I've been forced to run the camp entirely by myself during these pressing times.\u201d He said, and Percy could see the strain taking its toll on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but the Fates have things worked out right now. Next I gotta meet Ares and do something stupid for him. Grab a shield or whatever.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI'll try to hurry though. Oh, and prepare for some new campers and several new faculty members.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron nodded. \u201cVery well. I won't ask, since I don't want to have anything else loaded in my saddlebags for the moment. Now you should head back to your train.\u201d Chiron said, making Percy nod. Then, as Chiron blinked, Percy was gone. He briefly wondered how Percy had done that, before dismissing it as he moved back to his desk. He had papers to grade after all, he had no time for stress induced hallucinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Back on the train<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy reappeared in their suite on the train, hearing everyone snoring softly. Melum looked at him questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is what you planned still on tonight?' She asked silently, making him nod. He held out his hand, letting Melum take hold of it. In yet another instant, they were in the wilderness somewhere. There were lots of tree's and rocks and other nature-y things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy reached into his pocket, a soft glow emitting from it as a flute materialized in his hand. It was a simple flute, made of brass. It was old, Percy knew, but it didn't look it. He had spent some of his time asleep practicing it, and he wanted to test it out in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at Melum, both of them nodding. Tonight they were working as one. Not as master and servant, but as two musicians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy brought the flute up, putting his fingers in their proper place as he recalled the tune he wanted to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed several nymphs were poking out of their trees, watching him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Percy began to play the flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymphs found themselves being drawn out of their trees inexplicably, the movements not their own. They found the music pleasing though, and it had been a while since they had danced to such a wonderful tune. They let their bodies move to the music, letting themselves enjoy the melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Melum began to sing, tone perfectly matching Percy's playing. She sang a song without words, as was her way for most occasions, but she never really needed them. She could give voice to  any number of emotions with just her voice alone, no words ever passing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her, everything began to feel an emotion. From rocks, to the trees, to the nymphs and the bugs. The birds that were awoken did not flee at the noise, and the wolves added their own chorus to the song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotion was different for everything. Each individual had their own reaction to Melum's pure voice. The rocks cried, the tree's roared, the birds and bugs all rang out in harmony. The Nymphs themselves, however, felt the stirrings of feelings in their chests. Feelings of love and devotion for someone they didn't even know. Some thought that the two who were making the music were the servants of this mystery man, while others thought that the man was the one they felt for. Others still thought that it was Melum herself that these feelings were for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as they continued to dance, they pieced it together that Percy was the man they were thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy paused his playing, regaining his breath. He took a sip of water, offering some to Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheers and cries of joy echoed throughout the forest as all nymphs within a two mile radius heard the song, all coming to dance, all echoing the same thought. They wanted Percy to play, they wanted Melum to sing, though they didn't know who their entertainers were that night. They just knew that it felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smirked as several Nymphs tried to pull him into a crowd, saying not a word to them. When he brought the flute to his lips once more, they all hushed, waiting for him to start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd start again he did. A different tune this time. One that caused their feelings to grow by leaps and bounds as they danced, becoming something genuine, enhanced only by Melum singing the song of the music box, praising the Harem god in his glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it continued, into the night. By the morning, Percy had ensured that these nymphs would follow him, truly believing in him and his cause. They would spread word of what he did that night, singing praises of him for the rest of their lives. They had all understood Melum's song, well and truly. She didn't even try to force them to understand, it was just something that Percy helped along with his flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Percy got back on the train, the sun was starting to rise. Everyone was still sleeping, and he wanted at least a few minutes rest. His lips were dry, his lungs sore. But it was worth it. He could feel more power flowing through him, making him less tired then he should have been. The Flute was in the Eronomicon once more, awaiting him should he need it again.</span></div></div>",

We're almost to Denver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, still groggy from his night out. He got up, grabbing his pack and heading to the dining car. He would rather face Kronos one on one at full power then go without a meal today. After all, he did have to deal with Ares, god of being an asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later that day~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Co were sitting in a diner around dinner time, all in different groups. They had spent the day shopping for essentials, such as clothes, meals for on the road and other such things. Well, one could say shop, another could say Grand Larceny. Percy had been using his new shoes abilities in any and all thief skills to help save them some money. Besides, everything they took was way overpriced anyway. The shop keepers never noticed the items missing, even before their very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would be inclined to say that it was the mist or divine intervention or something along those lines. But no, it was all Percy. He was just that good now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchidna and the Chimera had followed him around like lost puppies all day. The two had modeled clothes for him, something Percy found himself enjoying immensely while the Chimera was stumped about the concept of clothes in general. He was even tempted at one point to go into the changing room with them, but held off. He was sure not even the mist could hide him doing something like that, and he wasn't willing to pull out something too powerful and risk drawing attention to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat in the diner, Percy was watching the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Once again, we would like to bring attention to the apparent kidnapping of Sally Ugliano, age 32. Her son, Perseus Jackson, age 12, has been following some kind of trail, helped by a woman believed to be a private detective in his attempts. Surveillance footage from the Gateway Arch shows Perseus Jackson confronting an unknown woman as his traveling companion hurried to tell a park ranger to alert local authorities. Unfortunately, the camera's become damaged and they could not offer any assistance. Neither of them were found anywhere near the arch, and it is unknown what could have happened to them. This woman that Perseus confronted may be part of a kidnapping ring, as evidenced by the string of missing persons reports on the east coast. Any information on Perseus or this woman should be reported to the local authorities...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy hunched down, making sure that none of the diner goers saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Percy.\u201d Annabeth said statistically in a hushed voice. \u201cFollowing a kidnapping ring?\u201d She asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it was the only thing I could think of that might have made sense on such short notice.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut let's not focus on that at the moment. Food sounds good, and Ares should show up any minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice looking waitress walked up to them, pen and pad in hand. \u201cAnd what would you kids like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey placed their orders, and the waitress was about to leave when the building started to rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd show time.\u201d Percy said, sitting straight up as everyone stopped their conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large Harley motorcycle pulled up to the diner, red headlight shining into the diner and making it look like everything was covered in blood. The gas tank was painted with flames, which looked like they were actually flames as they danced, which Percy wouldn't doubt. On either side of the gas tank, there was a shotgun holster, currently filled with the weapons. The seat was made of leather, but Percy could tell it was definitely human skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd riding atop the nature loving pacifist's nightmare was Ares, looking all big and bad. He wore a red muscle shirt, black jeans and a black leather duster, hunting knife strapped to his thigh. He wore red wraparound shades, as usual, and he wore his same battle scarred face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPity that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he walked into the diner, a hot wind blew through the place. People rose in their seats, looking like they were about to leap at the people they had been talking to not moments ago. Ares waved his hand at them, dismissing them from his battle aura and making them sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over like he owned the place, sliding in the booth as the waitress blinked before turning and heading to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Grover was being squished against the wall, trying to be as far from the war god as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you're old Seaweed's kid, huh?\u201d He asked, looking at Percy with a wicked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it in one.\u201d Percy said, faking surprise. \u201cMy, you're smarter then common sense would dictate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Percy was immediately on Ares' bad side. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen you little brat.\u201d Ares Growled. \u201cI couldn't care if you were my half brother, you talk to me like that again and I'll send you right were you want to go in a casket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Ares, Percy saw Melum stand up, Medusa grabbing her arm and making her sit down as the goddess almost tried to kill Ares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres calmed down slightly, obviously trying his hardest to keep up his act to make Percy do this so he would have to give him the back-pack with the master bolt. \u201cSo where's your 'goddess' that caused so much trouble at that summer camp for cannon fodder? Decided to ditch you? Wouldn't be surprised.\u201d He said, barking out in laughter like he made the funniest insult ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat do you want Ares? I got a quest I'm working on right now, and I don't need anything else working against me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres growled again, his eyes flaring up behind his glasses. \u201cI know about your little quest. Besides, you've got loads of time till the summer solstice. You should feel honored that a god is directly giving you a quest. All you have to do is go to this little water park a mile west. Get something that I forgot there, bring it back and bam. You got yourself a ticket west. Tell you what, since I'm feeling so generous I'll tell you something about your mom as a bonus.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched as Ares disappeared, as if he had never been there. Grover moved to the side, glad he could breath again. Annabeth looked at Percy, wondering what they should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I'm eating first. Ares comes after that.\u201d Percy said with a shrug, watching as the waitress, easily in her early twenties, brought their food. Percy winked at her, making her blush as she hurried to escape his eyes.</span></div></div>",

Simple as that. No dealing with Mechanical spiders or anything, no risking our lives for Ares stupid shield. Grover, remind me to beat it with a hammer or something.\u201d Percy grumbled the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think that would be a good idea Percy.\u201d Grover said, looking around for Ares to jump out and do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarcasm G-man.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent as they continued their walk, though Grover was looking a tad uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's up Grover? You seem down.\u201d Annabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it's nothing...\u201d Grover said, biting back a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon Grover, tell us. It's nice to have your input on things.\u201d Percy said, looking back at his long time friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover looked down, stopping. \u201cDo you guys even need me on this quest? I mean, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth turned to look at him. \u201cWhat? Of course we need you on this quest!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover shook his head. \u201cNo, it doesn't seem like you do. You've got an incredibly powerful goddess, Medusa, a hell-hound, The Chimera and the Mother of all Monsters here!\u201d He yelled. \u201cWhat would you need me around for? Percy's got a whole bunch of stuff he can do, and Melum could do anything I can do, like, a million times better then I ever could!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover looked on the verge of tears. \u201cI\u2019m just useless dead weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, moving to Grover. He put his hand on his goat buddies shoulder. \u201cGrover, you're forgetting two important things here. One, you're as important to this as anyone else. Two, and more importantly, you're my best friend. If there was any man I had to see all this crazy stuff with, It'd be you. You like my brother.\u201d Percy said. \u201cNow get those downer thoughts out of your head. We got a quest to do, and I can't have you slacking on me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I add to this quest Percy?\u201d Grover asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. He was hoping to keep this bit of info to himself for a while. \u201cYou can help keep me grounded Grover. That book I have is going to turn me into a monster at some point, something that you might not be able to recognize. I won't look it, but I will. Maybe it's already happened and I\u2019m better at hiding it then I thought I would be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you just get rid of it or something? Burn it?\u201d Grover asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't Grover.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI'm no longer part of this universe. The book is the only thing keeping me here now, acting as an anchor. If I destroy it, I'll... I'll fade.\u201d He said, making everyone besides Melum look at him in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Percy! Why didn't you tell me?\u201d Annabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I didn't want you to worry.\u201d He said, head down. \u201cIf I destroy the book, I'll be thrown from the universe into the void beyond. The only true way to kill a god. My boots? The only things remaining from a god who wasn't strong enough to withstand the trip between universes. He's dead and gone, not even someone believing in him would bring him back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had seen the void, when he put on the shoes. He saw the very last moments of the gods life, saw the creeping nothingness attack. It was only thanks to him not actually feeling what the god felt that he had kept his mind. It was jarring though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's true. I wasn't strong enough to make the trip myself. The Great Tome carried me within it, allowing me to pass through the void between universes.\u201d Melum said, shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Sure, it's incredibly powerful, and making me into a god, but I'm doing something dangerous here. The very concept of 'Me' would cease to exist.\u201d Percy said, looking at the ground. \u201cDo you see why I can't destroy it now Grover?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Satyr nodded. \u201cY-yeah Percy. I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen help me Grover. Help me in a way that Annabeth, Medusa or any women that fall to me can't.\u201d Percy looked into Grover's eyes, his sea-green eyes looking haunted by the thought of the void. \u201cHelp me stay me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover nodded shakily. Losing his best friend like that? Something that was worse then fading? \u201cY-yeah Percy. I'll try.\u201d He said as he shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed in relief. \u201cThank you Grover. You have no Idea what that means to me. So never, ever say that you have nothing to contribute to the group. IF it weren't for you, I probably would have already gone crazy with power. I would have said 'fuck this quest' and done my own thing. I'll tell you now Grover, I will make sure that you get your own happy ending to this crazy thing called life.\u201d He said wholeheartedly. He meant it too. If Grover wasn\u2019t there, he would have likely snapped with all the sexual tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been four day since he started the quest too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow come on, we need to do something Ares is to much of a pussy to do himself.\u201d Percy said, picking his own spirits up. \u201cAnd Grover, I think I should introduce you to a certain Nymph sooner then you normally would have met her. It'll have to wait until we got back to camp though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover nodded... but he didn't know how to feel about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later, back at the diner<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy threw the shield at Ares, who caught it effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprised you survived.\u201d Ares said, tossing Percy a back pack. \u201cHere you go. Some extra supplies for your trip. And a ride west.\u201d He said, pointing at a large truck. \u201cOh, and before I forget, I want to say that-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom's not dead. I know.\u201d Percy interrupted. \u201cWhenever someone dies in anything dealing with you guys and monsters, it's always a bloody and horrible death. And it's pretty evident, since only gods can do the whole glowing sparkle thing that a god took her. Besides, Hades said as much when he charged into camp demanding that I bring back his helm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorpse breath did that?\u201d Ares asked with a whistle. \u201cHeard about that from the horse man when he had to come explain what had happened at that mud pit. Didn't believe it until now though. Man little cousin, you got everyone hating you.\u201d Ares said with a chuckle, getting on his Harley. \u201cSee you around, if you live that long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres tore off into the distance, leaving a trail of red smoke and a laugh echoing into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I can't wait to run him through.\u201d Percy said. \u201cOh well, we got what we need from him. Grover, me and you are going to hop in the truck. Annabeth, I'm going to take you and the others to Vegas Directly. Wait for us outside the lotus hotel and casino.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are we going there Percy?\u201d Annabeth asked warily. She didn't want to lose any time to that place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're going to pull two campers out of there a few years early.\u201d Percy said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do. Besides, a bargaining chip with Hades couldn't hurt. He seems more aggressive here then last time.\u201d Percy said. \u201cNow hold on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover watched as Percy vanished and reappeared three times, taking two to three girls with him each time. When He appeared for a fourth time, Percy looked at Grover. \u201cLet's move. Despite what it says on the truck, It's not very kind to animals.\u201d Percy said, hopping in the trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not before looking back into the diner, seeing their waitress holding onto a rose, blushing at him and waving good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later, down the freeway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truck pulled over to the side of the road. Like, way over. A zebra and an Albino lion burst out of the trailer, both running off into the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men slipped out of the cab of the trailer, something horrible and irrevocable done to them in revenge for what they had done to the animals. One dose of Bestial lust seal each, highest setting. Show them what it was like to be an animal, and what they would do would cause for them to be caged up like wild animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was justice, Harem god style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's go Grover. I think we did our good deed for the day.\u201d Percy said, putting a hand on Grover's shoulder. In the blink of an eye, they were in Vegas, outside the Lotus Eater's new pad.</span></div></div>",

Medusa, you're with me. Everyone else, just mill around and try not to get mugged or mistaken for a hooker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa seemed uneasy though. \u201cAre you sure this is the place Percy? Even monsters are weary of the Lotus Eaters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pulled her hand into his, calming her down. \u201cDon't worry. We'll be fine. Besides, this will be the best time to see if you got better at using your curse as an ability.\u201d He said, pulling her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorman smiled at them as they walked in, welcoming them and hoping they enjoyed their stay. Percy made his way to the front desk, Medusa in tow. He rang the bell, getting the attention of someone who looked like a manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, and welcome to the Lotus Hotel and Casino. Please enjoy your stay.\u201d He said, holding out two cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa was looking at them, trying to fight the urge to take one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks. We're here to pick up our friends.\u201d Percy said. \u201cThey're siblings. Bianca and Nico Di Angelo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at Percy, that smile never leaving his face. \u201cVery well, I shall have someone find your friends. But, while you wait, why don't you relax for a bit. I insist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa reached for a card, but Percy grabbed her hand. \u201cNo, I insist you find them now. Trust me, I'm not messing around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mans smile never left his face as he pushed the cards closer to them. \u201cBut I insis-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa, now!\u201d Percy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Medusa's eyes shone an eerie purple and her hair floated up with a life of its own. Percy could hear the faint hissing of snakes in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lotus eater's smile finally fell as he was turned to stone, cards and all. Percy took Riptide out, uncapping it and smashing his stone face with the hilt of the sword. Capping it, Percy shook Medusa, snapping her out of a trance. Once the man had turned to stone, her stone gaze had stopped itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Percy, what just happened?\u201d Medusa asked, rubbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything's Fine Medusa. You did good.\u201d Percy said, ringing the bell again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, and welcome to the-\u201d The man stopped himself, looking at the destroyed statue of his buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, you will bring Bianca and Nico Di Angelo here now, or you'll end up like him. Only in tinier pieces.\u201d Percy said glaring. He could almost feel time start to fluctuate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course sir.\u201d The new manager said, hurrying away. In mere minutes, he was back, followed by two kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere they are sir. I trust it is to take them to see their father?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a way.\u201d Percy said. \u201cHello you two. I'm your cousin Perseus, but everyone calls me Percy.\u201d He said, smiling at the two in a way he hoped inspired confidence and trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico, who was shorter then Percy remembered, smiled a toothy grin. \u201cHello, I'm Nico. Do you know about Mythomagic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, Bianca sighed silently, but smiled at him nonetheless. \u201cNice to meet you. I'm Bianca. Please excuse my brother, he's addicted to that game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy waved it off. \u201cNah, It's okay. Kids gotta have something to occupy his time. Now let's go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose the lady?\u201d Nico asked suddenly, pointing at Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNico, don't be rude.\u201d Bianca said, tapping him on the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, It's alright.\u201d Medusa said. \u201cI'm your Aunt Em. Nice to meet you two.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca gave her a skeptical look as they walked. \u201cYou don't look related to us at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarried into the family Dear. Now come along.\u201d She said, ushering them out the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, fresh air. And it's still night time!\u201d Percy said. He was happy to be out of that place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy!\u201d Annabeth called, running over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Annabeth.\u201d Percy said, hugging her. \u201cHow long were we gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust over an hour. But we need to get out of here soon. People have been mistaking the older women for hookers, which I'm blaming you for by the way, and the Chimera broke two peoples hands when they tried to touch her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy growled slightly, his eyes flashing brightly. \u201cGood. Though she might have been feeling my frustration with the hotel's service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pulled away as Medusa maneuvered the two newest people of the group over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca Blushed, seeing the other women of the group, as well as having a look of disbelief on her face. \u201cWha-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt'll be explained later. Hold on, and close your eyes.\u201d Percy said, placing a hand on both children of Hades' shoulder's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you-\u201d Bianca said, though she almost threw up as everything about her view of reality shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked around, she was in a big house, and not on the streets of Vegas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiron, are you here!\u201d Percy called out. Soon the clopping of hooves sounded throughout the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, is that you again?\u201d An old, but powerful voice sounded behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bianca turned around, it took everything she had to not scream in absolute terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA centaur was standing above her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool...\u201d Nico said, turning to look at the new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Chiron. Look, I'm going to be frank here.\u201d Percy stopped. \u201cMan, that isn't even funny when I've seen how things were going to go. Anyway, these are the new campers I was telling you about. With the group we got right now, I can't look after them. I need you to explain to them the basics, being demigods and all that. If you can't, have Clarisse do it, but tell her I said be nice to the Newbies. Our group is going to take a few days getting to Hollywood, so if you could get the other campers used to them before the cat gets out of the bag of who their father is that would be great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron could already feel a headache coming on. \u201cVery well Percy. I'll see what I can do.\u201d He said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Chiron. Well, I gotta get back to Vegas. Stop anymore idiots from trying to feel up the chimera.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron gave Percy a look, that nowadays would be called 'a total WTF look.' He really wanted to know know, but at the same time the thought horrified him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll explain later. Bye you two, be good now you hear?\u201d He said, acting like an uncle or something. \u201cOh, and Chiron, whatever you do, keep them away from Luke. I cannot stress that enough. In fact, please don't let anyone know that they're here, not even the king of paranoia.\u201d Percy said, nothing but seriousness in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron nodded, since it seemed Percy only talked like that when it was something that could end the entire world. \u201cVery well Percy. Anything else to report?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Percy said. \u201clater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron blinked and Percy was gone again, but the two other children were not. So that means that when he talked to Percy that night, it wasn't a hallucination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron looked at the shaking and pale girl who looked like she was going to pass out. \u201cI should get the smelling salts ready.\u201d He said with a sigh, just in the event that it did happen. \u201cCall Clarisse here too. Might make the transition easier.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something pull at his tunic hem. He looked down to see Nico looking at him in wonder. \u201cAre you really a centaur?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron put a hand to his head. It was going to be a long few days. The youngest he ever dealt with was ten. Annabeth was a special case, since she acted like she was at least thirteen when she was seven, not to mention her growing up on the streets for as long as she did. Even then, most freaked out at the fact that the Greek myths were true...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy appeared outside the casino once again, and was greeted with a scene that made his blood boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral men, obviously drunk on both alcohol and the mood of Vegas, were circling the women like vultures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon baaby.\u201d One of them said, trying to look classy as he nearly swayed on his feet. \u201cI can pay you really~ good to keep me company.\u201d He said, lecherous grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time, we said no!\u201d Medusa said, glaring at him. She was tempted to use her glare on him, she really was. \u201cWe're not prostitutes you drunken idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other ones laughed, reaching a hand out to grab Melum's dress which the goddess slapped away. \u201cIn these kinds of outfits? Nah, I think you're just playing hard to get.\u201d He said, fumbling for his wallet. \u201cDon't worry, we got the money for your services.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you worse then a fool?\u201d Melum asked, her eyes sparkling dangerously. \u201cLeave now. My patience wears thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be like that.\u201d Yet another said. He smelled the strongest, most likely being the drunkest of them. \u201cThis short one looks quiet nice though.\u201d He said, reaching for Annabeth. \u201cAlways did love blonds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly his hand was caught by the Chimera. There was a sharp cracking sound, then a crushing noise, and then the man began to scream. Any and all bones in his hand were not only shattered, but crushed to dust. His hand was bleeding profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo touch.\u201d The Chimera growled. \u201cGo now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously the other men were drunk beyond reasoning though. They ignored their screaming friend, though passerby's did not. Several people screamed, and at least one called an ambulance. The drunken men did not move away though, but one did sneer at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had more then half a mind to have the Chimera just kill them. Dark? Yes, but right now he didn't care. That one man was lucky he only had his hand crushed beyond repair. No one was going to touch Annabeth, or any of the women for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we tried the easy way.\u201d He said, words still slurred. \u201cNow listen to me you slut.\u201d He said, raising a hand to smack Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to have a sharp pain go through his chest, and then nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pulled Riptide out of the man. One by one, he saw all the bonds the man had forged dissipate as blood pooled beneath him. Co-workers, family, friends, acquaintances, even strangers he had passed by on a walk, anything linking him to anybody was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy couldn't feel bad for what he had done, and that was his own thought. Not the power of one sword, merged with Riptide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that power only made everyone else look down at the corpse. No one screamed, no one was shocked or scared or horrified. They felt nothing for the man they had seen murdered. Nothing at all. They couldn't care less that he had died before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the power of the Severer. To cut the bonds between people, leaving not one trace of any emotion between those whose ties it cut. And that was why no one cared at all. They couldn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey couldn't even say 'wow, he deserved that.' or 'man, that guy was an asshole.' They felt nothing. They didn't care that he was murdered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he lived, any wife or children he had wouldn't have cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd neither would he. He wouldn't have cared either, had he survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one it didn't effect, couldn't effect, was Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would probably feel bad later, feel the blood on his hand. Mortal blood, human blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wouldn't weigh against him if he stood before the judges of the dead. They wouldn't care either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy held his sword up to the other guy's throat. \u201cGo. Now.\u201d He growled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as though he finally got the message, drunk as he was. He backed away in fear of the weapon, but not in fear that it had just killed. No, as far as he cared he would have been the first victim to a deranged kid. He turned and ran, stumbling in his drunken attempt at fleeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy capped Riptide, taking a breath to try and calm himself. The sounds of sirens were getting closer, and the man whose hand was as good as gone was still screaming, begging for the pain to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's get out of here.\u201d Percy said, moving to the center of the group. \u201cEveryone grab hold of me.\u201d He said, wrapping Annabeth into a protective hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone did, eager to get away from the city. Too much hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, they were all in Hollywood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're finding a hotel.\u201d Percy said, tone brooking no arguments. He wanted some time to rest before heading down to the Underworld. It was only the first after all, so they still had twenty days until the solstice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded. They could all tell Percy was on edge. The Chimera made this more obvious since she seemed to reflect Percy mood a lot. She was agitated, which was easy to tell on her. She wasn't good at hiding emotions after all. Her fur ruffled up, and she let out a menacing growl as her tail started to shake, the occasional hiss passing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, they all looked around for a decent hotel, far enough from the underworld to relax in. To finally rest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~The next night<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Co. had found a Best Western hotel, decent priced and everything. Percy had payed for three rooms. Echidna, the Chimera and Pe\u00edsma (Footnote Greek for Pet, spelled in English), the hell-hound that Percy finally decided on a name for, would share a room. Melum and Medusa in another, with Percy, Annabeth and Grover in the final one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy gave strict orders to Pe\u00edsma to be on her best behavior. If he had complaints from hotel staff that she had destroyed the room or attacked them... well, Percy left that hanging in the air. He was still mad about Vegas, incredibly so. But he was also angry at himself, and he felt sick as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had killed someone. An actual person. A mortal. They weren't just going to reform, like monsters. And despite being drunk, they probably didn't deserve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he would never know. Not now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one would grieve for him. No one would care that he died. Hell, no one would celebrate his death even. He was forgotten now. Nothing connected him to life anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had, essentially, doomed the man to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt bile rise in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to reassure himself that they were going to try and take it too far, but he just couldn't. He couldn't honestly tell himself that they deserved it, even if one of them had tried to take Annabeth, tried to hit Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw their actions though, how they were acting towards the women, he felt a surge of anger. More angry then he ever had in his life, he acted without thinking first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made him no better then Ares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside him, laying on the bed, Annabeth turned on her side. She was watching as Percy shifted between anger and guilt, the occasional sickly grimace. She had a feeling as to what was bothering him, and he needed to talk about it.</span></div></div>",

I can't feel anything for what he tried to do, something I know you had a hand in, but I know what he was going to do. You did it to Protect Medusa, protect us. Even if we can do it ourselves, you wanted to protect us. What do you think he would have done to Medusa if she had been by herself? He would have put her through what happened to her with your father.\u201d Annabeth told him. \u201cThe other guys were going to do the same thing if they couldn't have gotten us to go along with them, they would have just forced us. The fact of the matter was that despite us being able to protect ourselves, you did it nonetheless. I don't think we could ever thank you enough for that.\u201d She said, kissing him. \u201cI can't say I know how it feels to kill someone, and I hope I never know either. But don't ever think that You're a monster for protecting people. That's not like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy turned to look at her. Her hair was down, and she was in laying under the blanket. She had a white tank-top on, Percy could tell. The moonlight shone on her through the window, the waning moon shining off her skin. It danced in her hair, twinkling in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could see as she aged ever so slightly, looking closer to thirteen or fourteen now. Her breasts had started to grow, since she had gotten a bra when they were in Denver. The seal that brought her back was working well at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy gently cupped her face, stroking her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you Annabeth.\u201d Percy whispered. \u201cHow could you put up with an idiot like me? Someone who has to do what I have to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth smiled at him. \u201cSimple.\u201d She said, placing her hand gently on his face. \u201cI love you. No matter what. Whether it's just me in your life, or a hundred thousand women. I don't want to lose you Percy. When I came back, when you brought me back in time, I saw everything that made our time together worth it. I saw every time that would have made it worth it, even if they were brief moments. I can't remember much, but I knew I was happy. The happiest I would have ever been with anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved closer to Percy, pressing her body against his. \u201cI love you Percy. I can't tell you that enough. I want to show you that love.\u201d She said, grabbing the hand on her face. She pulled it down to her chest, pulling her shirt up and placing it right on her breast. She flushed a little at this, but her heart was beating fast, hammering in her chest. She wanted him to know, wanted him to touch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was surprised at this, but only a little. Maybe it was just everything weighing on his mind right now, but he half expected something like this to happen soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly, he could feel her heart beat. He could feel it beating, knowing that it was beating for him. He could feel the small globe of  flesh in his hand, feel her body heating up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave an experimental squeeze, making her moan softly. He could feel her nipple harden, brushing against his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't wait anymore Percy.\u201d Annabeth said, still holding his hand to her chest. \u201cI don't care that I\u2019m in a slightly younger body. Take me Percy. Make me yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bed next to theirs, Grover bleated in his sleep, reminding them that they weren't the only ones in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not quite ruining the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked into her eyes, seeing no hesitation. He nodded, smiling at her. What would he have done without her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where to go? They couldn't stay in the room with Grover.  With Percy though, they could have gone anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnabeth, where's your favorite place?\u201d Percy asked quietly, so as to not wake their friend. \u201cYou know, outside the gods sight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth gave him a questioning look as she climbed on top of him, letting his hand fall down as she started to take off her shirt. She obviously wasn't going to wait, one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want our first time to be, you know, special.\u201d Percy said, watching as more and more of her was exposed. \u201cNot in some hotel in Hollywood where the walls are thin as cardboard.\u201d Percy said, feeling his erection growing. \u201cName it and we're there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth tossed her shirt onto the floor next to the bed. She leaned down, capturing his lips in another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't care where Percy, as long as I'm with you.\u201d She whispered after pulling back. Around her, the world melted away at her words. She saw flashes of places, frozen in time. More and more appeared, surrounding her like TV\u2019s, stuck on pause. She saw deserts and lakes, savannahs and plains paused. She saw the tundra alongside the Parthenon, which hovered over the sphinx and the pyramids at Giza. And... was that Olympus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world behind those screen's was a blur of colors, swirling around chaotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that stayed the same was Percy, laying underneath her, holding her to him. He was smiling mischievously, though it wasn't hard to notice the lust in his smile nor the love in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we'll be everywhere at once.\u201d Percy said, grabbing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around, her natural curiosity started to work itself up. \u201cPercy, how-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shushed her, placing a finger to her lips. \u201cDon't worry Annabeth. Just relax. Let's make this a night to remember forever.\u201d He said, eyes twinkling with amusement.  He leaned up, his hands moving to her rear. \u201cBecause we're going to have eternity to outdo this.\u201d He whispered, breath tickling her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands latched onto her naked backside, which Annabeth was sure was still clothed before. The thought was pushed from her mind though as he began to knead her rump, the pleasure already building up in her inexperienced body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had latched his lips around her neck, sucking on her smooth flesh. He pulled back, showing a hickey, marking her as his. He smirked, his throbbing erection at full mast, tapping against his lover's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet ready Annabeth.\u201d He said huskily. \u201cI honestly don't know when I'm going to stop. Just let me know if you want to stop.\u201d He said, thrusting upwards, entering Annabeth in one fell swoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she made the first scream of pleasure that was heard all around the world at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~The next morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth blinked, Apollo's chariot shining in her eyes. She tried to move her legs, trying to sit up. No use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth started to panic, wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy snored beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth stopped panicking. She looked down, noticing that her head wasn't on a pillow. No, it was laying on Percy's demigod chest, looking toned despite him looking slightly scrawny the other day. He was a little tanner as well, looking more like he belonged in L.A. As a surfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed that she wasn't wearing a shirt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it came rushing back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh gods, did it come back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Percy was going to have a hard time topping that for sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho else could fuck someone until their legs hurt, then continued to fuck them until the pain went away? That's right, Percy had<b> fucked </b>the pain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like he was the perfect blend of gentle and rough for her, and he filled her so completely. He had known what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords could not describe it, at least none she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was surprised she didn't smell like sex. She had read (Don't judge, she was a teenaged girl with a healthy libido) that she was supposed to smell horribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wait, that's right... the after shower that she needed help to stand during. Percy had been such a gentleman, taking care of her like that. So caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bed next to theirs, Grover grunted in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth rested her head on Percy's chest once more, enjoying the feel of his body. She hadn't gotten enough of it last night. She traced the new muscles on his body, smiling. They were defiantly going to do that again. You know, after she learned more. After all, she should return the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy.\u201d She said. \u201cTime to wake up Percy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHn, five more minutes.\u201d Percy mumbled, unconsciously wrapping his arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth laughed a bit, a soft case of the giggles. She wasn't surprised, seeing how he did most of the work. It was like he had been doing it for longer then the gods were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, I need you to wake up.\u201d She pressed. \u201cI can't move my lower half right now, and we need to get dressed before Grover wakes up.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She could feel it through the golden ring on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's that dear?\u201d Echidna asked, sounding like a loving mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlpha happy.\u201d She said again. \u201cAlpha rut with Mistress. Alpha happy, feel sad last light. No sad no more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlpha happy, us happy.\u201d Pe\u00edsma said with as much a smile as she could, before it morphed into a frown. \u201cAlpha take too long. Alpha need dominate more.\u201d Said Pe\u00edsma's other personality. She was starting to see why her other personality liked their Alpha so much, though he was being too slow for her tastes. He really needed to assert his dominance, or move out of the way for a real Alpha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush you.\u201d Echidna said. \u201cPerseus is just adjusting to everything. After all, it isn't easy to have your world view flipped around and torn apart.\u201d She too, like Annabeth and the Chimera, could tell that something was bothering him. She wanted to help him, but she knew what he felt for Annabeth. She didn't know how, but she knew. She also knew that he didn't feel the same for her, but she was fine with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, what was she going to tell Typhon, if he ever got out from under that mountain? He would be so heart broken. And then go on a rampage, forgetting about her entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least now I know why you were squirming around last night dear.\u201d She said, looking knowingly at the Chimera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~In yet another room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you seem content.\u201d Medusa said, looking at Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess currently wore a small smile, her eyes twinkling with great delight. \u201cWith good reason. Master Perseus and Mistress Annabeth have finally consummated their relationship.\u201d She said, hugging her legs to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa felt her face heat up at the mere mention of Percy, remembering the dreams she had been having since that night on the cliff. Not to mention she found her thoughts drifting more and more to him each day. Simple things at first, like just sitting together, but things grew more lewd with every hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the dream she had last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know though?\u201d Medusa asked, trying to push the image of Percy consummating a relationship with her to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThrough the Great Tome, I can sense that he considers her a mistress. She will be given a symbol soon, showing his affection for her. She will become his queen.\u201d She said with a happy sigh. \u201cTruly a glorious moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa didn't know why, but the thought made her... sad? Maybe that was the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum, could you mind explaining this 'Mistress' deal? I'm afraid I don't follow.\u201d Medusa asked, making Melum nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Mistress is the second in command of the Harem god. Think of her as a head priestess. She is essentially the only other person those that follow the Harem God must obey. She is to be the one he trusts most, and she in turn him. They share a bond unlike any other in the following.\u201d Melum said, making Medusa frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there can be only one mistress?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum shook her head. \u201cNo, that is up for the Harem God to decide. Though if he does take on more then one Mistress, he will have to settle a hierarchy for them to prevent disputes from arising. Think of it like a temple as you will. The head-priestess is his second in command, as I said, and there would be spots to fill, all doing duties for both the Harem god and his Harem. I know of a book, inside the Great Tome, to be given to another Mistress, but I do not know much about it other then it is to be given to the one the Harem god decree's his Prophet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa released breath she hadn't known she was holding. She still had another shot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the thought from her mind, task that it was, as she looked at Melum. \u201cSo, what's your story?\u201d She asked the demure goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not have much to tell.\u201d Melum said, voice growing sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we don't have much to do until Percy wakes up. Would you mind indulging a woman's curiosity?\u201d Medusa asked, trying not to press to hard. Man, her social skills needed work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melum seemed to consider it though, humming in thought. \u201cVery well, it should do no harm to tell you. It started off a long time ago, maybe several trillions of years ago. I do not know for sure, since time is distorted and flows differently between universes. All I know is that it has been a long, long time since I met the Great Tome. I was a young, foolish Goddess. At the time, I hadn't known heart break. I had two sisters and two brothers. My sisters were named Memoria (Foot Note: Latin for Memory) and Mora(Foot Note: Latin for Time), while my brothers were named Interius (Foot Note: Latin for Death) and Lumen (Foot Note: Latin for Life). None of us knew our Parents, or even if we had any. None of the other Gods would tell us, and the Mortals of our world knew nothing of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMemoria was the goddess of remembrance and memory. She was the most beautiful of us Goddess', earning her many lovers. Mora was not far behind her, though it mattered little to her. She was always more interested in keeping time running that she didn't have time for much else. In our universe, time was a fickle thing unlike here, where it seems stable enough. Mora was easy to anger, but also easy to appease. A simple favor, or a trinket would suit her fine. Memoria was more vengeful. She never forgot anything after all.\u201d Melum said with a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInterius was an imposing figure, though not entirely unkind. He had a steady lover, who I cannot think of at the moment. He would take mortals from their coil, send them onto the after-life. He loved children, hated seeing them die. Due to being the god of Death, he couldn't sire any children. He would protect the young ones whenever he could. Any he couldn't save though, he made absolutely sure that their souls were not lost along the way, protecting them every step of the way\u201d Melum said, smiling at the thought of her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLumen was cruel, though not entirely, and not without Merit. He hated people. All he saw in them was a waste, squandering his gift to them. Nevertheless, he was present whenever new life was birthed. He would always smile for a moment before scowling at the newborn. He could see their lives, and it seems he found them wanting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was the youngest of us five, Memoria the oldest. Mora was the second eldest, and my brothers were never sure. They never could stop fighting. They would often argue, coming to blows quite often.\u201d Melum said, pulling herself into a tighter ball. \u201cTheir fights would rage for days, leveling everywhere within 100 miles of them. They disputed over which one was doing their job less. Lumen wanted Interius to take all life away, something he could not do himself. Interius, on the other hand, wanted more people born into the world to keep it from dying. He wanted more souls to experience life, in some way this was his own way off making off-spring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly two things could stop them. One was the other gods separating them. The other,\u201d She paused, putting her hand on her throat. \u201c Me and my voice. I was the only person who was able to quell their rage. Despite Lumen hating life, he loved Mora and I as family should. And since I was the youngest, Interius saw me as a child. Both tried to make sure I was never brought to harm, even during their fighting. I do not know how many times their fighting started getting out of hand, how many times I had cried seeing as they tried to mercilessly kill the other.\u201d A few tears seeped from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy voice, able to do both wonderful and horrible things, was the only thing that kept my brothers from killing the other, which would have killed us all in turn. No life or death and humanity would have ceased being. Our universe would have died without them keeping the fragile balance.\u201d More tears, her voice choking up with emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhenever I would cry, they would stop battling. They would drop their weapons, trying to console me. I asked them time and time again to stop fighting, begging them. They would try, I know they did. After these times would be the most peaceful, lasting for several years. But it would always start again.\u201d Melum looked up, as if wondering if she could see her brothers fighting now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs time passed, I grew emotionally. I tried to find someone to love, someone to care for and be cared about from. I, however, made the mistake of trying to love a horrible god. He was a god of love, yes, but he was a god of self love. A god of pure narcissism. His father was the only one who could make him listen. I tried many things to woo him. Gifts, music, my voice, everything. I went to the place he and his family resided. I asked him why he ignored me, no matter what I tried. He ignored me until his father asked the same question. He only looked me over once, his handsome face turning into a sneer. 'Who are you' he asked.\u201d Melum whispered, making it hard for Medusa to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he wouldn't have noticed me. I was never very pretty, especially compared to my sisters. But still, I had put my heart into trying to win his affection's. For him to treat me as if I never existed... I felt too many emotions. Anger, sadness, betrayed. I ran, wailing my sorrows to the world. I didn't want to be around any longer. I wanted nothing to do with anyone. I found the most hidden spot in the world, far from any gods or mortals, only inanimate trees and rocks to keep me company. It was like that for eons, never changing. I waited for the day my brothers killed one another, letting me fade. I was empty for a long time, only sadness creeping deeper and deeper into my heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil the day, that wonderful day.\u201d She said, her mood brightening considerably. \u201cThe Great Tome found me. It knew that there was someone who would love me as I wished to be loved, needing me for something. It brought me along, keeping me contained within a music box. Master Perseus freed me from it, and I've stayed with him ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum smiled, looking at the wall to Percy's room. \u201cHe has been so kind though. More kind then I expected. I only wanted to be useful to someone other then my brothers, having grown tired of trying to help both of them settle their disputes. I would have happily been a mere slave, merely a toy for his enjoyment. I still would, with a smile on my face. A true smile, something that I hadn't worn for so long before meeting Master Perseus.\u201d Melum said, tears of happiness falling now. \u201cI would do anything for my master. Anything I could do for him I would do in a heart beat if he asked. That will never change. Never in my immortal life will that change. I can never thank him enough for giving me a purpose. A reason to live. A reason to not fade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa... didn't know what to say, what to think. Suddenly, Melum looked so... different. She looked... broken. Emotionally at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Medusa knew how she felt, on some level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Melum asked. \u201cI wish to know of this world. You seem to have been around for a long time. Could you explain to me the ways of the world, the gods and stories surrounding them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled at the goddess. \u201cIt would be no trouble. No trouble at all.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He had just finished massaging her toned legs. It was something else in the book that he had practiced, but hadn't figured he would need any time soon. How much time had passed inside the book again? And then there was the time spent with the Fates, trying to work out what they were going to do. \u201cNow lets get dressed, before Grover wakes up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That, and it's kind of distracting having you lay on me in the buff.' Percy thought with a mental grin. He almost couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth pouted, but nodded. She rolled off of him, already missing the feeling of his body. She reached down, grabbing her shirt from the floor. However, she couldn't find her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally (something this situation was anything but), this wouldn't have been a problem. She could have used her hat to turn invisible and get what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she didn't have her hat. It was with her other stuff, sitting in another room with Melum. The goddess had insisted that she keep their things, making sure that they were safe. Almost like she needed to do so, for a reason that Annabeth couldn't fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy.\u201d She whispered, noticing the sounds of a waking Satyr. \u201cI don't have any clothes besides my shirt.\u201d She said, blushing. The thought of being caught was certainly an embarrassing one, especially by their long-time friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Percy a precious second to think on that, before he nodded. He vanished, the blankets hanging in the air as if he was still there for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tense few seconds, as she awaited his return. Grover was almost conscious, though whether or not he was going to notice anything was unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared again, holding both her bag and the bag with the master bolt. \u201cHere you go.\u201d He said, giving her the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth stood up, keeping the blanket wrapped around her, and made a dash for the bathroom. Percy was 100 percent sure he caught a flash of her ass on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover sat up, moaning groggily. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d He asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at the clock on the nightstand. \u201cAbout eleven o'clock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover nodded, getting up. He walked over to Percy, and quickly punched him in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Percy said. Not that it hurt or anything, but it was unexpected. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you and Annabeth are going to have sex.\u201d Grover said, unashamed. Hey, it was in his genes after all. The stories weren't wrong about Satyrs, though they were trying to improve that image. \u201cBut stay out of my dreams when you do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally that would have sounded weird, but it wasn't lost on Percy. \u201cWhoops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he said everywhere at once, he didn't mean it in such an absolutely literal way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah 'whoops.'\u201d Grover said, rubbing his eyes. \u201cI gotta take a shower. I feel... dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy couldn't help but crack a smile, trying not to laugh as his friend turned around to walk to the bathroom. It wasn't right, but he'd be damned if it wasn't the least bit funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth walked out, fully clothed and holding the blanket in a ball. Grover gave her a light-hearted glare, causing her to wonder as he slammed the door in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe knows.\u201d Percy said, answering her unspoken question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth went wide eyed, blushing up a storm. \u201cWhat? How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember how I said we would be 'everywhere at once' last night?\u201d Percy said, smiling guiltily. \u201cWell, I kinda took it too literally without trying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Percy!\u201d Annabeth said, the implications not lost on her. If everyone saw them in their dreams... Oh Gods!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I'm sorry,\u201d Percy said, holding his hands up. \u201cIn my defense, I didn't mean to. I just wanted to be on the physical world, not entering peoples dreams. But you were too beautiful to concentrate on anything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth blushed again from the compliment. \u201cWow, that was cheesy.\u201d she said, but she smiled even still. \u201cBut still, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we are in Hollywood. But I meant it Annabeth.\u201d Percy said, smiling at her again. \u201cBut enough about that. We should enjoy ourselves for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the quest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got time, Annabeth.\u201d Percy reassured. \u201cNineteen days, I think. It'll only take two to finish, now that we're so close to the underworld. Besides, there's still a few things I have to do before we go down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Annabeth asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook a finger at her, smiling. \u201cAh, but that would be telling. Besides, I want check out a few other things, personal things, while we recuperate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth rolled her eyes. \u201cFine, fine. Be all dramatic and stuff. But, Percy, won't the gods be watching us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Percy said. \u201cThe Fates are keeping them from spying on us. At least, whenever we're doing something inside the weave of fate. And, thankfully, I planned to take a break here. So we'll be good for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Percy. You seemed to have planned things out. Very well I might add.\u201d She said. That explained why Ares couldn't feel Melum's presence or the power of the Eronomicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I learned from you. Besides, the Fates helped.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, and we want to \u201cspeak\u201d with you, dear husband.' Atropos' voice suddenly sounded, but she sounded... off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes. And soon.' Clotho's voice said, sounding distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hurry Perseus. We're waiting~.' Lachesis' voice sounded off, very singsong in tone. Almost... playful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Annabeth?\u201d Percy said, shaking his head. \u201cI gotta go for now. Don't know when I'll be back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've got to, uh, 'talk' with the ladies way upstairs.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Annabeth asked, before she realized. The ones above Olympus. \u201cOh, okay then. Have fun.\u201d She said knowingly. She heard the emphasis on 'talk' and she knew that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy kissed her. \u201cGo have fun today. And keep the Chimera in line, would you?\u201d He said, before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth looked where he had been. \u201cI wonder... Is this how the gods left their conquests?\u201d She asked silently. She shook her head. \u201cNo, at least Percy will come back. I know he will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~In the chamber of Fate, far above Olympus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked around the cave. He didn't see the Fates anywhere, not even at their loom. \u201cGirls?\u201d Percy called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Through here, Perseus.' Clotho's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Behind you, Husband.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes yes! Hurry!' Lachesis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy turned around, seeing a tunnel that he hadn't seen before. He walked into it, seeing everything perfectly in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please, Perseus.' Clotho said in his mind, almost moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do not tease us!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We need you Perseus!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Percy came through to the other side, he took note of the cavern. It was spacious, with banners of old weaving\u2019s hanging all over the place. Every Prophecy that the Fates had made, every great event in history pertaining to the Greek gods and their children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they weren't the main attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that was the bed in the center of the room. It was made of pure shadow, seemingly floating above the shining floor of constellations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more specifically, it was the three women on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were nude, their eyes focused solely on him. Their bodies glistened lightly with sweat, their chest rising and falling rapidly as they panted with need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please Perseus.' Clotho said, parting her legs to show Percy how wet she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We need you, dear husband.' Lachesis moaned, sliding her hands along her body. 'Please, satiate our lust.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Take us.' Atropos said, her pure black eyes shining with need, love and lust. She was on her hands and knees, facing him, her ass raised high. 'Lay with us. Ravish us!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy couldn't help but smile, giving him a roguish look in the dim light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved his life.</span></div></div>",

He had made love to the Fates! The Fates!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly virgin primordial's had lasted longer then he thought they would. Strange, given how he was a virgin himself not even a night before. He shouldn't have been able to estimate how long they could last in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust have been another thing about the book and what it was doing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he felt as if he himself had lasted longer then he had with Annabeth. He felt power rush through him as he took their maidenhood's, given freely to him. Was that another source of power for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts felt clearer then before, but also easily drifting towards the thought of carnal pleasure. It only worried him slightly. He would be in control of himself, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth of their bodies against his was soothing though. He wasn't really tired, save for a slight bit of breathlessness. He ran a hand along Atropos's arm, wiping sweat from her ivory skin. All three of them were extortionately beautiful, something that wasn't lost on him. He was blessed, having their love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos cuddled further into him, making cute sleep-talking noises as she settled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at them as they slept, Percy took note of their differences, at least physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all had Ivory colored skin, that was a given. It fit them quite well, Percy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos had long silver hair. She was the eldest of the three, Percy knew. She was curvier then her sisters, balancing out her chest and ass, both bountiful and generous. She was also the tallest of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho had fiery red hair, but not as long as Atropos's, reaching down to the middle of her back. She was the middle sister, in both height and age. Her chest was large, bigger then Atropos's, though her rear was left a little wanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis, however, made up for Clotho's lack of posterior, having the largest ass out of the three of them. She may have been the youngest, but Damn! She had dark hair, about as black as Atropos's eyes. She also had smaller breasts then either of her sisters, but that was fine by Percy. Variety was the spice of life after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy felt his eyes drifting shut. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to rest a bit, before heading back to everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his eyes closed, he thought he saw two glowing orbs looking down on all four of them. One pure white, the other darker then Lachesis's hair.</span></div></div>",

He sat up, seeing he was in the Eronomicon once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Greetings once more, Marked one</b>.\u201d The voice of the Eronomicon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d Percy greeted nonchalantly. \u201cIs there a reason I'm here?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Perhaps</b>.\u201d The book said. \u201c<b>I pulled you in here to offer congratulations on taking several powerful women completely as your own. And to offer some more knowledge on my workings</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks?\u201d Percy said, not sure on how to take a book congratulating him. \u201cAnd are you talking about that surge of power I got earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Indeed I am, Marked one</b>.\u201d It said, and Percy could imagine it nodding. \u201c<b>As I said before, women are your followers. Your power. What I did not say, however, was that if you took the virginity of a woman, you would gain more power. It is proportional to the woman's power. Your girlfriend, Mistress Annabeth, is very strong, have no doubt about that. But compared to the weaver's, her power is weak. That is why you felt it more readily then with the Mistress</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. He couldn't blame the book for that. \u201cSo, in your honest opinion opinion, how strong am I compared to the gods in this universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book was silent for a moment, and Percy saw several things around the lab move. Like it was tinkering while it thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I would have to say that, being as unbiased as I can, you will easily be able to kill some of the most powerful beings in this universe. The one you call Gaea would be able to fight you for a few minutes, but you would still win easily. Before you took the Weaver's, you would have lost to Gaea in a fair fight</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy whistled. \u201cReally? That's... well, that's something alright.\u201d Being able to go toe to toe with Gaea would be nice, even if there wasn't another gigantomachy. \u201cAnything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Well, I would like to tell you about a certain experiment of mine. Well, I wouldn't call it an experiment, since it has been finished for a long time</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? Do tell.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>You should know that for a long time, I tried to give the Keepers physical bodies outside of myself</b>.\u201d The Eronomicon said, referring to the lovely women that were made of its magic. \u201c<b>There has been only one successful attempt at it. She has been working as an agent for me, and through me, you. She is incredibly powerful, being highly adaptable to most anything, and learning very quickly. She knows that I have found you, Marked one, and she is on her way here</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy blinked. He wasn't expecting that of all things. \u201cSo, you're saying that if I have sex with her-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Unfortunately not. Since she is still a Keeper, she will not increase your power. However, as I said, she is very strong. She has the same abilities that the Keepers in here do, and is completely immortal, being made from my magic, among many other things. She would be a great boon to have at your side</b>.\u201d The book said, pride at its creation being so helpful to the marked one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she have a name or anything?\u201d Percy asked. Hey, he liked to know people by their names, sue him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Her name is Veronica, Marked one. She herself chose it, as a test of her sentience</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy laughed. \u201cI get it. V-ERO-nica. She chose a nice name, nonetheless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Yes, it is. But that Isn't all. Another of my experiments worked, recently coming into fruition. You see, I wanted a way to increase your power quickly, just in case something like this war happened. Something that could potentially put your life at risk before your Immortality was fully matured. So, I did something that was extremely hard to pull off. I created a copy of myself</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I thought you said that there would never be another... well, you.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>True, I did say that. Like I said, it was extremely difficult to do so. To do so, I had to sacrifice a bit of my power to do so, using what was supposed to be the real me, an... incomplete version of me. When I was created, my creators apprentice was in the middle of making what should have Been the real Eronomicon. However, when I fled the collapsing universe, I took the incomplete version and finished what had been started, after a fashion. I bound it to myself, copying whatever I could into it. Currently, I'm at sixty percent of my full power, which is why you do not gain power equal to that of the women you deflower, and why your power's grow slower then they should</b>.\u201d The Eronomicon admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was floored though. He wasn't gaining power as fast as he should? Holy crap! He was already gaining power so quickly though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Anyway, I had given this copy of myself a mission. That mission was to find a female version of you who matched your soul as closely as possible. The copy would pour our perverted energy into her, making her a Harem Goddess, though nowhere near as powerful as you Marked one. Even now, you are easily twice, if not three, times as powerful as your counterpart. I will say that your counterpart grew accustomed to using my power, gaining an exceedingly massive Harem of her own. Female counterparts of this world, from the Satyr you travel with to that damnable war god. And she is growing in power even still. But do not fear, for my copy will not allow her to be as powerful as you, Marked one</b>.\u201d The book said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was silent for a moment. \u201cSo... you're telling me that there is a female version of me, a lesbian version no less, that I have to fuck?\u201d He asked, quite deadpanningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Well, she would be a lesbian for everyone but you. Though, I don't think she would bow down easily to you. She would at least want a fight, though you would easily defeat her</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, though it was in a daze. \u201cOkay... I wasn't expecting that when I woke up this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I\u2019m sorry if it troubles you, Marked one</b>.\u201d The book said, one-hundred percent honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. It's okay.\u201d Percy said, waving it off, a hand on his chin in thought. \u201cI just may have to plan around that. Might make things easier, might make them harder. I don't know. I'll leave that alone for now though. Let the female me gain more power.\u201d Percy was silent, thinking. He weighed the option of calling his female counter-part now or later, ultimately deciding it wasn't worth it right now. \u201cAnyway, do you have any idea for that plan I told you about?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I shall have the Keeper's arrange for the being to be brought here so you can speak with her. She's very... troublesome. But she is useful, when she wants to cooperate. But thanks to my influence, she should be easily cowed by your mere presence. Though, be cautious if you have her around other women. She's very, very possessive</b>.\u201d The Eronomicon said, giving off a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>But, there is one more thing I would like to talk with you about, Marked one</b>.\u201d The Eronomicon said, turning slightly serious again. \u201c<b>Given your feelings towards Mistress Annabeth, I would suggest that you give her a gift. A crown, symbolizing her place among your Harem</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd let me guess, you have something for that?\u201d Percy asked with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Indeed. A crown, fit for your queen. It would grant her not only the official title of Mistress, but it would also allow her to command the other women easily. It could prove very helpful in the future, if you were to be called away for any reason, or were preoccupied</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy thought on it. It seemed to be a good idea. He did trust Annabeth enough, and he certainly loved her enough. In all actuality, he had been meaning to ask her since the quest to find Artemis if she would have been his girlfriend. He felt lost without her, even then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, that didn't matter anymore. She was his girlfriend/wife(?) now, and he wouldn't lose her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but she has a hat. It's sentimental, and practical as well.\u201d Percy said, mostly to himself. \u201cBut I take it that you can take care of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Of course, Marked one. Just place the hat on my physical form, and I shall get to work on modifying it</b>.\u201d The Eronomicon said, and Percy could picture a bow from it. \u201c<b>Now, please wait for a moment while I have the Keepers bring in what you have requested</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Later, outside the Eronomicon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's eyes blinked open. He was still in the chamber of the Fates. The ladies in question were still sleeping, still snuggled against him. He saw neither pupil nor iris of the eyes he had seen before, looking down on them. He knew they were eyes, since they were similar to Melum's pure blue orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy enjoyed the warmth of the Fates some more. It was really quite nice, contrary to what people might have thought the Fates were like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, nobody ever really got the chance to know them. And their job was pretty stressful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard, weaving fate. They had to work hard, plan around what people would do if they were acting on free will. If they tried to force something, it usually ended up with a pointless death and a waste of their time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, they said that the only one who could shoehorn things into fate without having it turn into a mess was their mother. The Primordial, Anake. Only she had enough power to completely bend almost any other being to the whims of fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, like most other primordial's, she had been sleeping for a long, long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stretched, careful to avoid waking the women up. He sighed, feeling a little parched. He tried to conjure water from the air, only to wind up empty handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, darn.' Percy thought. 'Must be really dry up here then. Ah well. I can manage without.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy glanced at his watch, reading 8:46 P.M. on the digital screen. 'Huh. Wonder if it's only been half a day or more then half a day out...down there.' He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid back down, putting his hands behind his head, going over his plan one more time. He worked out every detail he could, making sure that he wasn't overstepping boundaries that he shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again... he was what the Eronomicon dubbed a 'Mortal God.' Basically the advantages of both, counteracting the disadvantages for the most part. And since he was still, technically, mortal, he had a little bit of leeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another hour, going over his plan one more time. As he finished planning, he felt Atropos stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. Have a nice nap?\u201d Percy asked, grinning at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head to look at him, her eyes twinkling with both amusement and sleepiness. 'Of course, with such a wonderful pillow.' She said, wrapping her arms around him, mindful of her sisters as she nuzzled his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll take that compliment in stride.\u201d He said. \u201cBut how are you feeling? Anything feeling sore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos shook her head, her hair flaring out slightly, covering her face with a few silvery bangs. 'No, I feel fine. But I must ask. How were we? I hope we did not disappoint.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. \u201cNo, you three were amazing. Especially for virgins.\u201d He teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we have had all of time to learn how to please a man sexually. We had to watch everything, you know.' She teased right back, but that didn't stop a blush from spreading across her cheeks. 'But what were you thinking about? I saw that face you made.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's something we should talk about with Clotho and Lachesis. But I want to ask, what brought this,\u201d He motioned at their situation. \u201cOn? Not that I'm complaining, mind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Everywhere. At. Once.' She responded, almost deadpanning at him. 'Wherever we looked last night, we saw you and the child of Athena. No matter where we turned. So it's your fault we were like this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops?\u201d Percy said, not guiltily this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't be sorry.' She said, planting a kiss on his chest. 'We were waiting for this to happen. We wanted this to happen. Seeing you laying with the child of Athena wherever we looked just made us want you much more then before. We lost control of ourselves.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stroked her face, moving a few strands of hair away. \u201cThen if you're happy, then I'm happy. Like I said, no complaints from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laid there for a while longer, Atropos tracing his features much like Annabeth did. He was turning into a fine man, despite what he had to do. A fine lover as well.</span></div></div>",

It was 11: 58 in the mortal world, California time. \u201cI've got things to do, and I want to make sure that Hollywood isn't a smoking crater.\u201d He half-joked, knowing that it could happen, even if it wasn't something he and the Fates did. Melum could lose her cool at something, and who knows what she would do. If her aversion to being touched by anyone but him, as shown in Vegas, was as bad as he thought it might be, then he hoped the People of the city of stars kept their hands to themselves for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos hmm'd, drawing circles on his chest with her finger. 'Well, I suppose I should wake my sisters then. We have work to do as well. People aren't going to be born or die if we don't get back to work.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. He sat up slightly, gently pulling The silver haired beauty in for a kiss. Pulling away, he noticed that same spark still there from their first kiss, much like Annabeth still had the same spark of her kiss. \u201cLove you all. Come see me on earth if you have the time.\u201d He said, vanishing. Under all three of their heads were now pillows, making sure the sleeping Fates didn't get a rude awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos smiled. 'Perhaps we shall, Percy.' She said, using his preferred name for the first time. 'Perhaps we shall.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared in the room. Grover was sleeping again, though a light was on in the bathroom. Percy heard the shower running, hearing Annabeth humming a little tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked perversely, walking over to the door, silent as ever. He was still nude, never having dressed after his time with the Fates. He was glad that the boots seemed to meld with his feet when he wanted to be naked, so they didn't get in the way. And hey, he still kept their abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe silently opened the door, seeing her aura through the steam easily. The shower curtain was drawn closed, obscuring his view of Annabeth's wonderful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy slipped through the curtains, not making a sound. Annabeth didn't even know he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater rolled down her body, trickling over her breasts and between her legs. She was soaping up, washing the dirt and grime of whatever she had done during the day down the drain. Her hair hung down, something that wasn't normally seen. Her stormy eyes were closed, enjoying the warmth of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy wrapped his arms around her gently, making sure not to alert her just yet. She was oblivious to his presence even still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like some help with that?\u201d He asked, making Annabeth jump. He placed his hand over her mouth, making sure she didn't wake Grover. \u201cDon't worry Annabeth, It's just me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun around in his arms, glaring at him. \u201cPercy!\u201d She whispered. \u201cYou nearly gave me a heart attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d Percy said, smiling disarmingly at her. \u201cI couldn't help myself. I've been gone for a whole day, and I didn't see you once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes softened. \u201cOh, fine. Just please don't do that again unless I know you're there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, smiling at her. \u201cOkay, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Annabeth said, faking a huff of indignation. \u201cSince you're here though, why don't you help me wash up?\u201d She asked, tone turning flirtatious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grabbed the soap from her. \u201cWhat? Didn't get enough last night?\u201d He asked cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Annabeth said, shaking her head with a smile. \u201cI don't think I'll ever get enough of you. Nothing about you will ever get old for me. Not your personality, not your sarcastic attitude, not you, ever.\u201d She said, standing on her toes to kiss him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a dirty shower, both of them knew.</span></div></div>",

Her monster hearing had made it easy to hear as Percy and Annabeth made love in the shower. \u201cHow did the Satyr stay asleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe bought ear plugs earlier today.\u201d Melum said, completely serious. \u201cBut I know you are jealous of mistress Annabeth. You wish you were in her position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sighed. She couldn't really deny it without lying to herself. She really did wish she were in Annabeth's position. Especially after catching a glimpse of Percy in the buff that morning. He popped in, grabbed two bags and popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRub it in why don't you?\u201d Medusa grumbled, turning over in her bed. For some reason, she was feeling wet, just thinking about Percy. She couldn't help it, but the mere thought of him now made her horny for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere's an idea.\u201d Melum said, singsong voice as if she were taunting the snake woman. \u201cWhy don't you go over to his room, and just ask him. I'm sure Master Perseus would be happy to make love with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa blushed, rubbing her legs together. It wasn't a bad idea. But... would he be so accepting of her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing her fellow harem member's uncertainty, Melum sighed. She stood up, letting the blanket fall from her nude frame, her skin shining eerily in the moon light. She grabbed Medusa's arm, pulling the woman up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisregarding the woman's protests, Melum dragged her out into the hall, down one door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy laid Annabeth down on the bed, covering her up. She had fallen asleep after riding out her final orgasm, leaving Percy to clean her up again. But he did so dutifully, making sure she was as fresh as a rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to climb in beside her, when he heard knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing.\u201d He said as quietly as he could. He could see that there were two women outside his door, and he had a feeling of who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door, only to have Melum pull Medusa in, almost throwing her into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy wasn't expecting that, nearly falling backwards. Thankfully, he stuck his ground due to both his natural strength and the power of the boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster Perseus, please Reassure her that you will indeed accept her if she gives herself to you.\u201d Melum said, looking right at Medusa. \u201cOtherwise, she will be driven mad by doubt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at the blushing women in his arms. \u201cIs this true, Medusa?\u201d He asked. He didn't want to force her into anything, even if he had given her the rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa blushed harder, squirming. On one hand she wanted to say that yes she wanted him, wanted him to want her. On the other, however, she felt that she was unclean, too dirty for her to love another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoseidon really did a number on her, for it to still bother her after all these years. No one could blame her though. Not one person could. To go through that, and forced to live a lie. No one could do that without mental scarring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa?\u201d Percy asked, holding her tighter against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d She said, body heating up even more. Such close proximity to him, being held by him, was a rush in and of itself. The wetness between her legs grew more, soaking the black panties she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething Percy wasn't oblivious to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps we should take this somewhere else?\u201d Percy asked, Medusa hesitantly nodding.</span></div></div>",

It was overlooking a populated city, lights blinking from all over the town. Outside the newer looking town were old, weathered ruins. On top of a hill, rising higher then theirs, there stood a giant structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greatest Temple to Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Parthenon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was covered in scaffolding, still undergoing reconstruction, but it was still a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, are we-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. We're in Athens right now.\u201d Percy said, looking over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I choose here?\u201d Percy finished, looking back at her. \u201cLet's just say that I'm not fond of Athena either. She detests me for my parentage, hates me for being related to Poseidon. Honestly, I think she would have tried to kill me for dating Annabeth, let alone having a physical relationship with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her closer against him, looking deep into her unique eyes. \u201cAnd I feel it is only fitting that we make love in her greatest temple. Of your own choice, however. I will not force you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa started to shake, old fears coming back. \u201cB-but she'll-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe can do nothing.\u201d Percy growled, eyes flashing with power, voice growing deeper, stronger. \u201cDon't worry, Medusa. She can't hurt you. Not anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa shuddered against Percy, but not in fear. She felt so warm, being near him. He caressed her cheek, gently touching her smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said though, it's your choice. If you want, we can go somewhere else.\u201d He whispered gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa shook her head. \u201cN-no. I...I want to show Athena that... the gods can no longer do as they please.\u201d She said, surprising herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled at her, kissing her cheek. She was only slightly taller then him now, so it wasn't hard or awkward. Medusa could see Melum smile at her from behind Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything blurred away, only for the scenery to suddenly transform into that of the temple. It was a little jarring, having the sudden shift in surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, looking around, it brought her back. Back to days when she was still innocent, happily being a peon for Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were standing at the foot of Athena's statue, looking down on them with disapproving eyes. It was almost as if Athena was watching them herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though if that were true, I would already be fighting.' Percy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was distracted by a forceful kiss from Medusa, nearly knocking her over. \u201cLet's skip the foreplay Percy.\u201d Medusa said, breathing heavily, inhaling his scent as she pulled away. \u201cI want you. I need you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled at her. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d He said. \u201cMelum, would you keep watch for anyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess smiled, nodding. \u201cIt would be an honor to guard you Master.\u201d She said, slipping into the shadows of a pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy held Medusa, gently lowing her to the floor. \u201cThere, we should have a warning if Athena tries to sneak up on us.\u201d He said, slipping her nightie from her shoulders. He kissed her neck, making her moan out loud, nearly coming close to her climax from just that simple action. Her panties were utterly soaked, and she would need a new pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could Feel Percy's erection, and she suddenly wondered if it would fit...</span></div></div>",

ANOTHER WOMAN, IN MY TEMPLE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shielded Medusa's eyes, covering her body with his. Well, more so then he already was, in their position of choice at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'LL... I'LL...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll do what, Athena?\u201d Percy asked, looking directly at the true form of Athena, both of them suddenly appearing in the center of the temple. Outside the golden aura, she had a pink aura. Above her floated the words 'You must take her by force. Break her. She will never submit willingly.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? You, who have defiled my temple with your filth!\u201d She said, holding aloft her shield and spear. Medusa's face was imprinted on the front of it, making Percy growl. \u201cWait... I can sense the sea in you. You must be Perseus, the child of Poseidon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if I am?\u201d Percy challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love to know how you got here, but I shall not indulge my curiosity. I shall kill you where you stand. You and your harlot.\u201d She said, charging at him, spear ready to pierce his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy moved one step to the side, something Athena wasn't expecting. Percy ripped the spear from her hands, using pure strength. He twirled it around, trying to smack the goddess with the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought up her shield, Aegis, blocking the weapon. The spear snapped in twain, the handle clattering to the ground uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, Percy was going easy on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena kept up the calm facade up, tossing her shield to the side. \u201cHow is it that you are able to look upon the true form of a god, sea-spawn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got special eyes. Problem with that?\u201d Percy asked, looking at the golden form of the goddess. He had to admit, she was truly divine in beauty. It was no surprise that people thought looking at a gods true form killed them. Even with her armor on, Percy could see every curve as if she were bare before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena felt a shiver go up her spine. \u201cNo matter. I shall still smite you. It would solve many problems up on Olympus, and I will not have anymore people defiling my temple. I will make an example of you, sea-spawn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to attack again, she was flung to the side by an invisible force. Though not unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum had done... whatever she did was called. Yell? Scream? Sing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe direction it came from was a mess, the ground shattered underneath the force of Melum's attack. And it wasn't letting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena kept being flung, pain wracking her body. Something she was not used to, but could tolerate better then most gods. She flew over Athens, far into the wilderness. It seemed as if the sound was following her, delivering pain that wasn't focused on her hearing. It gave a physical pain to her entire body, much more potent then any sonic boom. She could sense something in the noise, something directed at her, but she could not focus on it for the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched as Athena was flung over the horizon, hearing Melum's attack. He could tell it was sung in anger, anger at Athena for trying to hurt him. The very sound had an angry vibe to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Job Mel!\u201d Percy called, making the goddess bow unseen. Percy appeared next to Medusa, grabbing her, then grabbing Melum and following Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appeared in a grove of olive trees, demolished by Athena's crash landing. Honestly, it looked like a small plane had crashed. He had to laugh though, the Irony of her landing spot too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tell-tale golden glow faded, allowing Medusa to look upon her long time tormenter. Well, one of them at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena coughed up golden Ichor, though she didn't look outwardly hurt. She glared at Percy hatefully, as if trying to erase him from existence. \u201cAh, I see. You have the goddess with you, the one unknown to us on Olympus.\u201d She said, looking at Melum. She saw that she was nude, instantly appointing it to Percy ordering her to remain as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes yes, shes not one of you. I'm glad you can see that.\u201d Percy said. Though she didn't sound it, she talked as if she were above everyone. \u201cCare to explain anything else obvious? I' m not stupid, and I am the one who freed her from her prison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he might have been calling the kettle black, in terms of speaking undertones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena spit at his feet. \u201cYou took me by surprise, sea-spawn. That shall not happen again.\u201d She said, rising from the crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum began singing again, and Athena braced herself. She figured that there must have been a weak point in the attack. There always was. She only had to find it, and she could incapacitate the woman and finish off the child of Poseidon. She would free the goddess from his grasp, though she was uncertain how he could have controlled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what she expected did not happen. Instead, the olive tree's grew at tremendous rates, cracking the ground as they grew larger then most oaks. Roots and branches crept along Athena's body, much like they had the Furies. Much stronger, this time. Much, much stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to move, tried to scream, but she couldn't. The roots were wrapped to tightly around her. Her sacred tree, turned against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this seemed to be one of the most definite applications of Irony ever. This had been set into motion because of her making this tree, and now it would be her undoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny how things went in full circle like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked up to Athena, who was still struggling. Her eyes tried to bore into his head, the stormy gray orbs literally crackling with lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, isn't this a pretty picture?\u201d Percy said, looking at her. She was being spread eagle by the branches, like a torture rack made by nature. Her armor was gone, replaced with an old fashioned toga. It was colored blue, and it hid much of her body under thick layers of cloth. \u201cThe strong willed Athena being held captive. First time this has happened, hasn't it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made muffled noises, almost like she was cursing him in ancient Greek. Too bad he didn't hear nor care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don't suppose it matters. I had a reason to do what I did, Athena. Though I don't think you would understand it very well. But first, tell me. Do you recognize this woman?\u201d Percy asked, putting Medusa in front of the goddess. \u201cJust a shake or nod of the head will do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena glared at Medusa, who shrank a little under her gaze. She looked her up and down, visibly disgusted by the fact that Medusa had a bit of his essence dripping from her nether regions. But she shook her head, forcefully trying to break some branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you should.\u201d Percy said, scowling slightly. \u201cC'mon, think harder. You're the Goddess of wisdom after all. You should have a good memory.\u201d Percy said, calling the Eronomicon to his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Athena was surprised by the appearance of the tome, then she didn't show it. She glared harder at Medusa, as if actually trying to remember. Once again though, she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on.\u201d Percy said, exasperated. \u201cThink back, a long time ago. When you were still in Greece. It was shortly after the founding and naming of this city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena looked again, taking some pauses to think back. It was a long time ago, and they had done so much then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink back. Think on what I just did in your temple. Think back to when my Father did the same thing.\u201d Percy said, basically giving the answer away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena's eyes widened in recognition. That's right, it was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa.\u201d Percy said. \u201cThis is Medusa. You know, one of your priestess', one of your followers? One you cursed, punishing for no reason.\u201d He basically growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe calmed himself, gesturing at Medusa. \u201cSay your peace, Medusa. Tell her what you've wanted to say for a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa fidgeted a little, standing before Athena's harsh stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I...\u201d Medusa said, stumbling over her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a shaky breath, trying to compose herself.</span></div></div>",

You cursed us for something we didn't commit. Something I was a victim of, more so then you and your temple.\u201d Heat was creeping into her voice, rising with every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had my Innocence stolen in your temple, all those years ago. Stolen, not given away.\u201d She said, emphasis on 'Stolen,' hissing the word out. \u201cMy sister's prayed to you, asking for help as Poseidon took me against my will. I couldn't fight him, though I tried. I tried everything I could to make him stop, but what could I, a mortal, do against a powerful god?\u201d She stepped closer, looking into Athena's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never came though. You ignored our prayers, our cries of help. I knew that you had other priestess', but surely you could have heard the urgency of our plea's. That none of us wanted what was happening. It wasn't until Poseidon had his way with me that you came. And when you did... YOU WEREN'T THE GODDESS WE PROMISED TO SERVE!\u201d Medusa yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou blamed us, and for what! Something that we couldn't control! You cursed us with those hideous forms! Never to live our lives, never to see our families again. To be constantly hunted by hero's! All because you wanted to shift the blame to someone you could do something about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa did something that surprised even Percy then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SMACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you happy?\u201d Medusa asked calmly, tears cascading down her cheeks. \u201cAre you?\u201d She smacked Athena again, backhanding her. \u201cMy sister's have faded! They couldn't take the burden any longer! Because!\u201d Smack. \u201cOf!\u201d Smack. \u201cYou!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest smack of all, ringing over the country-side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's hand was bent at an awkward angle. It wasn't exactly broken, but it still must have caused her a lot of pain. She didn't cry out though, just held her wrist, glaring at Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, you know what?\u201d She asked, deathly silent in her whisper. \u201cPoseidon cursed me as well. He cursed my sisters. We could never speak the truth about that night. He gave me a false love for him, spreading the rumor that is so common today. I never loved him Athena. He raped me, took what I held most sacredly. He spread the rumor that I betrayed you, that my sisters betrayed you. It wasn't until Percy freed me from your curse, and his, that I have been able to feel happy again. For years, I had no one to keep me company but my statues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to laugh, which was a little off-putting given the situation. \u201cIt seems that your actions have come to bite you in the end though, Athena. The fates have decided that the current rule is lacking. The gods break sacred promises and their unjust actions are being rectified. They ready for war. War they could avoid, if they could stop being so petty. Zeus is still powerful enough to rule, but he would rather have everyone fear him and the power of the Master bolt. Such a shame to see Olympus fall so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena renewed her struggle's, trying to break free. She couldn't even appear in one of her temples, she was so weak. Whatever the goddess had done to her, she was too weak to truly fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that doesn't concern you anymore, Athena.\u201d Percy said, making Melum help Medusa, the latter of which had burst into a fit of psychotic laughter, tears still flowing down her face. It was incredibly unsettling. Percy made a drawing motion above the Eronomicon. A small light shown from the book, before Percy grabbed something from the air. \u201cNot after tonight.\u201d He said, vanishing from her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess looked around as much as she could, knowing that he couldn't be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Percy said, his breath hot on her ear. \u201cI had sex with your daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then her world exploded into colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena tried to fight it, tried to close her eyes. Even still, she could see the lights. The calm, tranquil lights. The pretty lights. The... pretty... lights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as she watched, those lights became images. Images from her eyes, making her remember every things she had ever done. She saw everything with perfect clarity, it was like she was relieving her immortal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat included all the travesties she had personally caused. They began showing up faster and faster, she heard the screams louder and louder, the people she killed or tormented in her anger. The pride that she had subjugated other to, using them to release her anger. She saw the night with Medusa and Poseidon in perfect clarity, heard their begging to drive Poseidon away, their pleads to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the contest with Arachne, who was by far the better weaver then Athena. But Athena never wanted people to know that, so she facilitated the events that made Arachne kill herself. Her only pity, if it could have been called that, was to turn the woman into a spider, so she and her children could weave for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this and more flashed before her eyes. Not all bad, since she had seen some good things there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena could feel the strain on her mind. She... hadn't done all that stuff... had she? It all began to weigh down on her. Had... she really been such a horrible god?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena screamed, the lights ending.</span></div></div>",

Every single thing she ever did, she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she felt horrible for it. The weight of her mind would not go away. It already started gnawing at her. Corroding any sense of what she should do anymore. What was right? What was wrong? Had she been living a lie for so long, being one of the oppressors, that she had lost sight of what was true justice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Justice anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden, tears sprang to her eyes. Not from the pain. No, she deserved that. She deserved all the pain she had ever dealt a thousand-fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Medusa, still laughing. Had she broken the poor woman, one of those she promised to protect in exchange for worship? It seemed to her that she had. The roots around her mouth had moved, allowing her to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d She asked, her throat suddenly dry, her voice cracking as she held back sobs. No, she couldn't cry. She didn't deserve to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Percy asked, looking concerned for Medusa. He was seriously thinking of leaving Athena and taking her to a hospital to have her hand checked out. He wasn't any good with medicine, even now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I make up for what I've done?\u201d She asked. \u201cPlease, I beg of you. Tell me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's up for you to decide.\u201d Percy said, walking away from her. He placed his hand on Medusa's shoulder, kneeling down and pulling her into a hug. Her laughing cracked, breaking into sobs. \u201cMel, keep an eye on her. I'll be right back.\u201d Percy said, vanishing without even seeing if Melum would protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum did as told, making sure that Athena didn't try to escape. She could have left though, Since Athena didn't even budge an inch. Not even a twitch of a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took ten minutes for Percy to return, and when he was he wasn't happy. \u201cI've got Medusa resting in a hospital right now. They're going to try and fix her arm, and they gave her something for hysterics.\u201d He said, his eyes glowing with anger. \u201cWhat are you going to do, Athena? Are you going to run to Olympus if I let you loose? Tell Zeus that someone opposes his regime, and is gunning to take him down? Are you going to let the guilt weigh down on you for the rest of your life? And all three of us here know that forever is a long time.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was genuinely pissed. Before, with Vegas, he was angry. This time he was absolutely livid, and would probably have murdered someone if they so much as looked at him funny. He was pretty sure a few doctors and nurses would be having nightmares for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a while, Percy watching Athena, waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease. Let me serve you.\u201d Athena said quietly, looking down at the ground with hollow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why should I do that?\u201d Percy asked. He was tempted to leave the goddess there, feeling the guilt. And he Knew what he had done to her with the item from the Eronomicon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I beg of you! I know it won't be enough to make up for all I've done. Nothing will. But please, let me try!\u201d Athena said, begging him. \u201cI will do all you ask of me. I will try to atone for all I've done, even if I have to betray my father!\u201d Her voice grew wild, her normal composure meaningless now. \u201cI will do all you say for the rest of my eternal life! An eternity of servitude, that is all I deserve! For everything I caused, or did not stop when I could have!\u201d Tears were falling from her eyes now. \u201cPlease! Let me try to atone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was openly weeping now, begging, pleading to let her try and make up all for all she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grimaced. 'Damn it. I still can't stand seeing a woman cry.' He said, mentally cursing herself. He walked up to Athena, who looked at him with hopeful eyes. \u201cFine. If you want to serve me, then I'll hold you to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena nodded earnestly. \u201cAnything! I will Serve faithfully! I will never question anything you tell me to do!\u201d She said, taking on a fevered tone. \u201cI deserve nothing more! I will act as I always have, a puppet! A loyal dog! I will be your sword and your shield! I will do anything for you! Anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, absently wondering if he was turning more and more into something like his Father. \u201cVery well Athena. I accept your servitude. It shall be known that you are trying to atone for your actions.\u201d Percy said. \u201cMelum, if you would.\u201d He said, gesturing at the roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, merely gesturing at the plants. They seemed to respond, as if awaiting her orders. The roots unwound from around Athena, sinking deep into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't know how she did that, honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena fell to the ground, landing on her hands and knees. She was breathing hard, tears still falling from her face. \u201cThank you... for allowing me to atone...\u201d She said, her voice choked with sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grimaced. Maybe at Athena, maybe at himself. He didn't know. But he knew one thing, well and true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Proud Goddess Athena was Broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ The next day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy woke in Melum's bed. She had been so loyal, so faithful. She had deserved a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a bit of a hassle to get her to accept a reward from him though. She tried to deny it, saying that she existed to serve him. Even if it was true, Percy still wanted her to know he valued her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she asked was that he lay with her for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing sexual, unless he wanted it. Just for him to lay there, holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had laid there, holding her tightly against him. Her nude frame pulled against his own, and Percy couldn't find himself complaining much about her form, no matter how much she protested that she wasn't good enough, not beautiful enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had lain there until she had fallen asleep, her head resting on his chest. She had a content smile on her face, sleeping the best she ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena was, hopefully, back on Olympus, tell Zeus that she still couldn't find the master bolt. She had been given orders to act naturally, act loyal to Zeus, until the time was right. She was to keep tabs on Olympus for him though, if the gods started to act before the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy glanced at the clock, broken from his memories of the previous night. He would go see if Medusa was feeling any better today. He hoped she could still speak Greek, since it was a Greek hospital he had taken her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock read 9:13 A.M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed he needed less and less sleep as well, as his power increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. He didn't want to move from his spot. Melum was warm. Strangely so. Must have been a godly thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, alas, he had things to do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently moved from the bed, Melum moaning softly at his missing warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy moved to his room, trying out shadow-walking for the first time. It was...strange, to say the least. It was very cold, and obviously very dark. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching him, though he had no fear for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appeared in the bathroom, the light's off, swathing the place in darkness. He walked out, hearing both Grover and Annabeth still snoring. He gently kissed Annabeth, grabbing the Master bolt Backpack and vanishing. He had work to do.</span></div></div>",

Giving and taking lives, doling out fortune and misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, essential stuff that kept the universe running smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at them, waving. They waved back, not looking up from their tasks. It seemed they were working a little overtime, trying to catch up for the time they spent with Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could here them mumbling, talking to one another in hushed voices. Debating on whether or not this person should do this or that. Whether or not this person had lived long enough, or whether or not this person should be born earlier then normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked away, back into their bed chamber. It was far enough away that he couldn't hear them, and he hoped that they couldn't hear him. He didn't want to distract them from their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let's do this.\u201d He said, pulling the Eronomicon out of the Ether. He opened it up, waving his hand over an image, causing a small light to glow. He grabbed the object, revealing it to be... A pair of Glasses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made another motion, drawing out... a pair of headphones?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on the glasses, seeing two more people in the room then there actually were. Both were female, one asleep and one awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeping one had blond hair, which would have gone past her shoulders if it didn't all curl back up once it reached her neck. The last few inches of her hair were almost a burnt orange color. She had a beautiful face, well body actually. A small nose, and a small mouth. She had a long, blue scarf, which radiated electricity, sparking and arcing all over the place. She had a white cloth, bra-like wrap covering her chest that looped behind her neck, with a black tube top underneath that. Her midriff was fully exposed, exposing the pale, smooth skin. She also had what had to be the shortest mirco-skirt ever, since it barely reached mid thigh, and was kind of tight on her. She also had purple bands on both arms and legs, covered except for a small portion in black wraps of the same cloth as her other clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman, who came from the headphones, looked very peculiar. She looked like the typical stage DJ, only skimpier clothing. She wore the worlds smallest bra, while it could still be called that, though it didn't do much to cover her ample chest. She also wore very baggy jeans, only kept up by the sheer amount of booty she had. The thong she was wearing showed above the hemline of the jeans. She had a hairstyle not unlike Thalia's, but if she had dipped it in a rainbow of colors. Hot pink, bright luminescent green, and electric blue being the most prevalent. She had strange, hypnotic eyes that flashed randomly, like a rave party gone overkill on the lights. She even had glitter paint on her face, making stars and... other images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello~\u201d She said, gliding from the Headphones. \u201cI'm glad you didn't forget about me.\u201d She trailed her fingers across his face, only to have them pass right through him. She snapped her fingers. \u201cOh Darn. And here I was hoping we could get a little... Physical.\u201d She whispered, twirling around Percy, laughing sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah. Look, can we just do what we worked out? I'm not in a great mood.\u201d Percy said, pointing at the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes, looking like two disco balls. \u201cFine. I guess I can try to seduce you later. Just release me from these headphones and I'll get to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cEres, I release you from your bond.\u201d He said, holding the headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of something snapping, as if a rubber band broke. Almost instantly, Everything about Eres seemed to fade. Her eyes stopped glowing, and her clothes faded away completely. Her hair even disappeared. Her skin went completely white, stark against the blackness around them. The only thing that made Eres a female was the fact that she had two large mounds on her chest. Other then that, she looked pretty much like a barbie doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I hate it when I'm like this.\u201d She said, pouting. Well, she would have been, if she had a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust get to work, and I'll get you back into something. I'll even look into getting you a real body, along side whatever item you bind yourself to.\u201d Percy told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine. Just give me a second.\u201d She said, waving dismissively at him. She floated over to the backpack, kind of just phasing into it. \u201cAh, that's better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she appeared again, she looked like the skimpiest hiker ever. She had on short shorts that could qualify as panties, and nothing more then a bra. She had on hiking boots and gloves, as well as a cowboy hat. Her hair was brown, in a long ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, she looked like she was going up the mountain to sunbathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow!\u201d She said, looking around at something only she could see. \u201cThat war god messed things up in here pretty badly. It's going to take me a while to figure out how to fix this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it.\u201d Percy said, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't take that tone with me.\u201d Eres warned. \u201cI'll do it, but It's going to take me the better part of a day. Why don't you go do something while I work with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, shaking his head. \u201cSorry, didn't mean to bark at you. I'll go relax or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed. \u201cYeah, well, you better. I don't have to take you yelling at me for just letting you know what's going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy only nodded, leaving the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Back on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared in his room with Annabeth and Grover. He got dressed, after seeing that he hadn't even been gone for an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to see Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe vanished, appearing in the Greek hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, do you have the room with my aunt?\u201d He asked, walking up to the receptions desk, effortlessly speaking Greek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName?\u201d The lady asked, typing on computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer name is Emma, I brought her in last night with the broken wrist?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFloor 3, room 316.\u201d She said, not even looking at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Percy said, walking to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking around for a bit, Percy found the right room. He knocked on the door, getting a strangled \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door, seeing Medusa laying in her bed. She was covered in a hospital gown, looking blankly up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello 'aunty Em'.\u201d He said, using her old alias for her store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly brightened, smiling at him. \u201cOh Hello Percy. Good morning.\u201d She said, smiling. She waved with a cast on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Percy asked, sitting in the bedside chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch better, thank you. The doctors and nurses made sure that I was feeling well after giving me this cast. I felt much better when I woke up, I know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, smiling at her. \u201cI'll bet. Getting that much pent up emotion our of your system would be kind of draining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa chuckled weakly. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d She said, enjoying his presence. \u201cSo, how's our 'friend'?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she's fine.\u201d Percy said. \u201cShe won't be bothering anyone else. She saw the error of her ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled, almost evilly. \u201cGood, good. I'm glad she knows what she put others through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, enough about that. How long are you going to be here?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the doctors said that as soon as a family member came to pick me up I could leave.\u201d She said, smiling. \u201cI think you would count.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I would.\u201d Percy said. \u201cAnd I should pay upfront, since I doubt they would find the address of Olympus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy summoned the Eronomicon to him once more. He opened it up, flipping to a special page. It was a page filled with literal tons of priceless jewels. Diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and many, many more. The gems were normally for enchanting with a ritual or seal, or if he wanted to experiment to try and create a new item himself that he could keep in the Eronomicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wouldn't hurt, taking a few out to pay for a hospital bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be right back.\u201d Percy said. \u201cGotta get the money to pay the hospital bill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled. \u201cAlright then. Hurry back.\u201d She said, watching as he disappeared. She settled in, waiting for him to return.</span></div></div>",

He set her down on her bed, receiving a kiss for his efforts as he covered her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken a while, getting everything sorted out. Percy had the Jewel appraised, a large diamond that was worth at least \u00a335,000, more then enough to pay for the hospital bills. That took a while, as he was trying to be fair to the jeweler, who was trying to rip him off. He managed to get the dealer to give him the full price, glad for the serpents tongue ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, he had spent some money on some new clothes for Medusa, as well as a few souvenirs for Annabeth, Grover and Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was mostly hassle with the financial department in the hospital. At first they didn't believe him about wanting to pay upfront, and having the cash. When he showed them the duffel bag with the money, they changed their tune though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou rest now. I bet your still emotionally drained from last night.\u201d Percy said, noticing that Medusa still seemed exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will. Thank you Percy.\u201d She said, kissing him again. \u201cNow go enjoy the day. You haven't had much time to relax lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Medusa.\u201d Percy said. \u201cIf you need anything, just call my cell phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had picked one up, not caring that monsters would zone in on him. It allowed him to keep in contact with people if need be, letting him know if he was needed somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa nodded, yawning. \u201cI will. Now go on.\u201d She said, her eyes closing already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stayed there, waiting until she was fully asleep. He then looked at the note he had seen on the nightstand beside Melum's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dear Percy,' It began, omitting his title in case someone came in to clean. 'Everyone went to town. We decided to explore some more, maybe sight see a bit. We will be at the \u201cfilm Gallery\u201d at three, so you can meet us there if you want. Well, if you don't find us first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled. \u201cWell, I guess it wouldn't hurt to walk around for a bit. Might run into some celebrities while I'm out around town.\u201d Percy said. 'Well, that, and figure out where the entrance to the underworld is, exactly.'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy had a major headache. Everywhere he looked there were women, all with pink aura's and words floating above their heads. For some reason, Percy could remember each and every single one of them in perfect detail, every word above their heads matched perfectly. Thinking back on it, he had been able to do so since obtaining the eyes. He had just been subconsciously ignoring it, since they were in low traffic area's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, except Vegas, but that was a different story altogether. He had been too focused for one part, and too angry for the other. And they hadn't stayed long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy took some headache medicine, not having any Ambrosia on him. He downed it with some nice refreshing water, glad that it helped even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay Percy, focus. It's almost time for them to be here. Just wait for a little while longer. Try to enjoy the day. You need to relax.' He was telling himself, keeping his eyes closed. With the increased sight, Percy could see women if they were anywhere in front of him, even if the should have been to his far left or far right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Percy!\u201d He heard Grover yell, prompting Percy open his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Grover! Annabeth!\u201d He called, waving them over to his secluded corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing over here?\u201d Annabeth asked, plopping down into his lap and kissing him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy tapped the side of his head, around eye level. \u201cThese things. I only just noticed that they would burn every single woman I saw into my brain forever in perfect detail.\u201d He said, putting a hand to his head. \u201cIt's been giving me a headache since I started walking around town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, poor you.\u201d Grover said sarcastically. \u201cBeing able to remember any woman ever? Man Percy, if I didn't know just whats at stake for you, I would be pissed at you. I swear, if I didn't know that you were a child of Lord Poseidon, I would have thought that you were a child of Aphrodite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that I'm going to end up worse then her Grover. Only, with women instead of men.\u201d He said. \u201cBut I'll actually try and watch out for them. I'm not going to be like the current gods and leave them alone for the rest of their lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that's why I love you.\u201d Annabeth said, kissing him again. \u201cBy the way... did you do that... 'thing' we talked about?\u201d She asked, with a tone that was either apprehensive or resigned. Percy was still trying to see straight, the pain starting to lessen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I did. Last night.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Grover said, putting his hands up in an x. \u201cWhat did I say about not wanting to hear about that stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax.\u201d Percy said, Annabeth blushing on his lap. She still wasn't entirely comfortable with being open about hers and Percy's relationship. \u201cIt's not that. Just some family business that needed taking care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover eyed Percy suspiciously, as if thinking Percy was pulling the wool over his eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d He said, unsure of whether to believe him or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, I wasn't even in North America last night.\u201d Percy said, now thinking about the female nurses in the hospital. At least the hot ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy.\u201d Annabeth whispered, so low that not even Grover could hear. \u201cNot in public.\u201d She said, her blush getting darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Percy was about to ask, when he felt his personal trident poking Annabeth. \u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Percy said, barely a blush on his cheeks. He tried to make it go down, though it was being very stubborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum walked up beside them, seeing her masters plight from her Mistress' face. \u201cWould you like some help with that Master?\u201d She asked, whispering it into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at Annabeth, receiving a nod from her. She didn't want to hog him all to herself, even if the thought was appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth got up, adjusting her shorts. She sat on another chair as Percy grabbed Melum, vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover looked at Annabeth. \u201cHe's going to go have sex, isn't he.\u201d He stated, not asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth glared at him, turning even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don't blame me.\u201d Grover said, holding up his hands. \u201cBlame my genes. Satyrs are more open about sex then most people. Only ones who have us beat are Nymphs and children of Aphrodite in that department. It's hard-wired into our Brains to be that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth just huffed, Echidna laughing behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's true, child.\u201d She said, stifling her laughter. \u201cSatyr's are amongst the most sexually active monsters. Even the young ones were sexually active.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, we're trying to improve our image.\u201d Grover said, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchidna just laughed even more. The thought of Satyrs improving their image was truly a funny one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along girls, I think we should go look for the more monster friendly places in town.\u201d She said, once she could stand up straight again. She had a plan of her own to enact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away, The Chimera and Pe\u00edsma following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the Chimera was looking rather... distracted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~With Percy and Melum<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pulled his lips away from Melum's neck, having left love bites and hickey's on her pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master Perseus.\u201d She breathed. \u201cThis body is yours to use. I am your slave, your property. Use me to fulfill your lusts. Everything I am is for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy unclasped Melum's bra, Her dress already cast aside. One hand was already fondling her breasts, groping rather roughly at the small fleshy mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Master.\u201d She moaned, feeling the wetness between her legs growing already. She loved the feeling of being used, being handled roughly by her master. No one else could ever get her like this. \u201cMaster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've been such a good girl.\u201d Percy said, voice taking on a silvery tone. \u201cSuch a good servant. I still think you should be rewarded for the other night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum shook her head, making small noises as she flushed. \u201cNo master. Everything I do is for you. I should not be rewarded for fulfilling my purpose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I insist.\u201d Percy said, tweaking a stiff nipple with his thumb. \u201cI want you to know that I value what you do for me, even if you only wish to be a slave. I want you to know that I will not take you for granted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum felt her love and loyalty grow by leaps and bounds by hearing that. \u201cOh Master Perseus. You could never take me for granted. I will always be happy to do anything for you. No matter what, I will do it with a smile on my face.\u201d She said, stepping out of her panties. Percy had pulled them down while she spoke, allowing him access to her willing and wanting womanhood. \u201cI only have one wish, if you would grant it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pulled away from her nipple, looking up at her. \u201cAnd what is that, my dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways need me.\u201d She breathed, almost pushing his head back to her small breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled at her, though there was a large amount of lust behind it. \u201cOf course, Sweet Melum. I shall always need you. I shall always want you. Never think otherwise.\u201d He said, devouring her breast once more.</span></div></div>",

He had worn the goddess out, but wasn't completely spent himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn. My sex drive's getting bigger.\u201d Percy said. \u201cHow am I supposed to concentrate on everything that I need to if I start getting horny at every damn thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to control myself better. I can't mess things up. I'm not immortal yet. And I can't put anyone in danger.\u201d He said, berating himself. \u201cDamn it. I need to do something. Take my mind off of women. Maybe I should go fight something. Maybe I should just go relax someplace far away. Someplace with no women. Or at least as few women as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cDamn it. This is going to make it so much harder in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy disappeared, Leaving Melum and the still sleeping Medusa. When he reappeared, Percy was in the middle of the desert. Right in the middle of absolutely nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Egypt.\u201d Percy said, watching as the sun rose over the horizon. \u201cSomeplace I can stay free of distractions for a while. I can survive out here, no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy blinked. \u201cAh, damn it! I gotta go check on Eres and see if she finished with fixing the bag.\u201d He said, fuming as he disappeared once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of a sand Dune, a large excavation site was just starting to wake up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared in the Chamber of Fate. The Fates were still working, though they had slowed down. Must have caught up with their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked down the bedroom cave/hall, calling the glasses to wear. He heard the sounds of Eres talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut that there, twist that, add a bit more power to that... And done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked into the bedroom, watching as Eres did a little dance. The soul of the master bolt started to fidget a bit in her sleep, opening her eyes. She had royal purple eyes, with a darker purple for the pupil. It fit her somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Percy called. \u201cI take it you're done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Hi!\u201d Eres cried, turning to face him. \u201cI just finished up.\u201d She sauntered up to him, trying her best to act as if she were touching him. \u201cSo, when do I get my reward?\u201d She asked, batting her eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I put you back in the Book, tell it I said to find you a body.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres danced with delight, trying to hug him. \u201cOh goodie!\u201d She giggled. \u201cYou wanna help me take my body for a... test drive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now.\u201d Percy said. \u201cCall me in a week and we'll see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres scoffed. \u201cFine, party pooper.\u201d She said huffily. But she soon turned back to her sultry self, placing an immaterial finger under his chin. \u201cI'll see you in a week then, lover boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEres, I release you from your bonds.\u201d Percy said, the rubber band sound happening again. \u201cNow get back in those headphones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter then this form.\u201d She huffed, quickly binding herself to the headphones again. When she appeared, she took on the same form as last time, the worlds most scantily clad female DJ. \u201cDon't forget about me now.\u201d She said, blowing him a kiss as he called the Eronomicon and put the headphones back in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you awake there?\u201d Percy asked the still groggy soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha- you can hear me?\u201d She asked, looking like a deer in the headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee and hear you.\u201d Percy said, trying not to think of her in a perverted light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d She said, floating over to him. As in, she literally floated. She scarf trailed out behind her, the end of it fizzing out into pure electricity as she moved. \u201cWell, what about touch?\u201d She asked, suddenly flirtatious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to lunge at Percy, only to go right through him, sending a bolt of electricity right through him as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Percy said, his hair standing on end. \u201cDon't do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d She said, pouting. \u201cI see the old blowhard having sex all the time. I want to experience it too!\u201d She said, tone like a spoiled teenager. \u201cAnd that stupid Trident won't even tell me his name!\u201d She looked Percy up and down. \u201cBut you're not all that bad yourself.\u201d She said with a sly grin. She floated back over to him. \u201cWhat's your name, cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerseus, but everyone calls me Percy.\u201d He said, avoiding her touch easily. \u201cBut, uh, aren't you concerned about having been... stolen? Kidnapped?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cCome to think of it, what do you call a weapon that has a soul if it's taken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStolen.\u201d She said. \u201cAnd no, I'm not concerned. I'm a weapon, and I'm only concerned whose wielding me at the moment. By the way, I'm Phosphora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Percy said. \u201cAnd I can take it from the way you refer to Zeus that you're not fond of him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhosphora lazily floated on her back, hands behind her head and legs crossed. \u201cPsh, no. Doesn't acknowledge me for twenty thousand years, and doesn't even pay attention to my physical form until it's stolen. He didn't even polish me! A lightning bolt does not keep their shine for long!\u201d She ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can't help but agree with you there. Zeus is an asshole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not as much as his son. Ugh, the nerve of him. Tampering with my home. I should fry him like a fish! No one messes with my home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned. \u201cWell, do I have a proposition for you then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhosphora looked questioningly at Percy. \u201cOh? And what might that be cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you help me Fight Ares when the time comes? And, to sweeten the deal, I can make sure that Zeus doesn't own you anymore. And, as an extra bonus, I should be able to give you a physical body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhosphora grinned at him. \u201cOh yeah? Well, you are just too good to be true.\u201d She said, trying to pinch his cheek. \u201cI guess, as long as I get a real body. And as long as I get to fry that stupid war god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Percy said, holding out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhosphora grinned, taking it, sending a large ZAP though Percy's hand. He yelped in pain, shaking his hand. \u201cOh, did it hurt? Want Phosphora to make it all better?\u201d She asked, baby talking like a lovey-dovey girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't push it.\u201d Percy grumbled. Damn, even with how powerful he was the master bolt wasn't something to take lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhosphora only giggled.</span></div></div>",

Though I had a nice little chat with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you can talk to inanimate objects? Grover deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda. The Master bolt has a soul Grover. I talked to that. She's not very happy that Zeus didn't take care of her physical form.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover shook his head. \u201cOf course it does. And it's female too.\u201d He grumbled. \u201cI swear, if I wake up as a girl I will make your life miserable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry about it G. I wouldn't think about it.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover snorted. \u201cYeah. Well, I'm going to sleep. If you guys are going to have sex, try not to wake me up.\u201d He said, laying back on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth blushed once again, glaring at Grover. Though she didn't move away from Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy glanced at Annabeth. \u201cDoes he really think I'd turn him into a girl?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he's still adjusting to everything, and you have to admit that it is happening so fast.\u201d She said. \u201cSo don't take him too seriously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded slowly. \u201cYeah...\u201d He said, looking up at the ceiling. His head hurt, and not from earlier that day. Actually, his whole body hurt. It was kind of a burning sensation, just under the skin, one that had nothing to do with Phosphora shocking him so much. It had started right after he and Melum had sex. Maybe he should talk to the book about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Annabeth. Before I forget, can I borrow your hat?\u201d Percy asked, calling the Eronomicon to his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but what for?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gift for you, and I'll leave it at that.\u201d He said, placing a hand on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth nodded, getting up and rummaging through her bag. She pulled out the Yankees cap, tossing it to Percy. \u201cThere you go. I want it back in one piece, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cI'll be back soon Annabeth. I gotta talk to the book about something.\u201d He said, kissing her cheek. He vanished, heading off to Fates knew where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Chamber of Fate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared in the chamber once again, the Fates not working their loom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello, Perseus.' Clotho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Back so soon?' Lachesis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is something the matter Percy?' Atropos asked, moving beside him. She placed a hand to his forehead. 'You're burning up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Percy said, panting. It was even hotter now, he was starting to sweat. \u201cLook, I need you to come back into the book with me. I know it knows what's going on, and I have a feeling I might pass out any minute. I need you to work with it in case something happens to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates nodded. For something like this, they weren't going to mess around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy took a big gulp of air. When did it get so dry? He held up the book, letting the Fates place their hands on it. \u201cPull us in.\u201d He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world faded to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Percy came to, he wasn't burning much more then he already was. \u201cHey, Eronomicon! I think we have a problem here!\u201d He said, standing up. Around him, the Fates were already standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I would think so</b>.\u201d The tome said. \u201c<b>You have passed the limits of power your body can handle, which explains the burning sensation you are feeling. Though this isn't good in the slightest, since your immortality hasn't fully matured yet, it does give you a wonderful opportunity for one of my most powerful items</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill it help control the power?\u201d Percy asked. Right now, nothing mattered but making the burning sensation stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Indeed it would, Marked one</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it to me then.\u201d Percy said, almost falling to one side. The Fates kept him upright though. \u201cOh, I don't feel so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the group, a pair of gauntlets materialized on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Here, wear these. They should contain and control your power</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, stumbling over to the table with the help of the Fates. He could feel his legs giving out, and there was a horrible strain on his body. Like he was about to literally explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grabbed one of the Gauntlet's, slipping it onto his right hand. He felt a little better, that much was for certain. He grabbed the other, almost dropping it. Clotho helped him put it on, tightening the straps while Lachesis did the same to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Percy dropped to his knees. The power was building, the pain growing each second. It was being focused on his hands, which burned the worst. H could feel his bones starting to crack in his hands, starting to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he let loose a loud scream. He roared to the heavens in pain, unleashing untold amounts of power as he did so. Even the Fates had to brace themselves on tables.</span></div></div>",

Even the Chamber of Fate outside the Eronomicon shook with his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't know how long he screamed, it was all a blur to him. One very painful blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he could breath again, Percy took deep breaths. The burning sensation faded slowly, the burning in his hands healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy put his hands on the floor to push himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to have them go clear through as if it wasn't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Percy said falling on his ass, pulling his hands out of the ground. Where he placed his hands, there was two perfect holes in the shape of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Please be careful marked one</b>.\u201d The tome asked. \u201c<b>Those gauntlets you are wearing are some of the most powerful things I've come across. They are containing your power right now, amplifying it by an unprecedented amount. Your power is far beyond my capabilities of reading</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think I need a better explanation then that.\u201d Percy said, keeping his hands in the air and away from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>These gauntlets I have called the Alpha's armlets, Marked one. They not only possess astounding amounts of power by themselves, but also amplify the power of the one who wears them! They are the best example of pure power that I have ever seen. I found them not unlike the boots you wear, but they had no owner to have ever existed. They just were.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains the history, but what about them? There has to be more then that.\u201d Percy said, trying to stand up without using his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>You are correct, Marked one. Though my knowledge on them is limited, for several reasons, I know that they can steal or copy the abilities of any other glove or bangle like object. I have lost many other artifacts to these gauntlets due to this ability it carries, while others were merely rendered useless due to it copying their powers. And I can only really assume that they are incredibly powerful on their own, as the void was had pressed to even near them. It was a struggle, getting these, and for a good reason it would seem</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that's kinda scary. If these things can keep the void at bay, I wonder what else they can do.\u201d Percy said, looking at them. The gauntlets were dark blue, almost black. They looked like they were made in the same style as medieval plate gauntlets, but almost reaching his elbow. He could still move his wrist easily enough though. They had viscous, jagged spikes coming from their knuckles, facing up if he let his arms hang. The fingers ended in claws, as viscous as the knuckle spikes. There were spines coming out from the sides, looking like the fins of a fish. Imbedded into the back of the hand were two eye-like gemstones, looking like the eyes of a natural predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I am as intrigued at you are, Marked one</b>.\u201d The tome said. \u201c<b>Could you tell me if there are any changes to you? Are you feeling any different</b>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. \u201cNot really. Though I really want to fight something.\u201d Percy said. He then noticed that the Fates were looking very flushed. They were panting extremely heavily, so much so that if they were mortal Percy would have worried for their safety. \u201cGirls, are you okay?\u201d He asked, their eyes being very unfocused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat couldn't have been a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perseus~'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Need you Perseus...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could smell their arousal, watching as they reached for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh.\u201d Percy said, backing up. \u201cGirls, I don't want to hurt you. You need to stay away right now, until I figure out how to control these things.\u201d He said, backing up, keeping his hands as far from touching anything as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates weren't going to have it though. They advanced faster, proclaiming their need, stripping themselves of their dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, now listen-\u201d Percy started, feeling himself bump into a table. \u201cAh shit.\u201d Percy said. He was about to use the boots to get far away, but Clotho lunged at him, not unlike an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe latched onto his arm, tearing at his shirt in an effort to get him undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy instinctively raised his hand, grabbing her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for nothing to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo cries of pain, not shattering of bones. No tears, no anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho moaned at his touch, more so then with the seal of the addicting limb activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Interesting...</b>\u201d The Eronomicon trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What's so interesting?\u201d Percy said, trying to pull his hand away from Clotho, only for Lachesis to grab it and place it on her ass. Once again, nothing bad happened, only more moans of pure pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>It seems the gauntlets will not harm a woman. Otherwise, even the weavers would have been irreparably damaged. And it seems that the gauntlets are making them attracted to you, much like animal's during mating season. It is almost a physical need for them, I can see quite clearly. They have lost higher brain functions due to such a close proximity to you, and your touch only brings them pleasure. More pleasure then the seal of the Addicting limb would when combined with Casanova\u2019s dance</b>.\u201d The tome said, and Percy could almost see it looking over them with a careful eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as much as I would love to have sex right now,\u201d Percy said, trying to reclaim his hands and shirt while trying to keep hold of his pants. \u201cI need to learn how to control these things. Do you know anywhere I could go to figure this out. You know, without hurting anyone or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I do have a map of all universe's I have come across. Perhaps you would like to go to one of them? Somewhere you could train in the real world, so that you can learn to control these gauntlets? Your power alone can take you through the void now, but your boots and the gauntlets shall make it that much easier</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it. I'm going to leave them here,\u201d He said, nodding towards the fates. \u201cSo you can explain what's happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Of course Marked one. They shall instruct the rest of your followers of your absence.</b>\u201d The Eronomicon said, making a map appear in Percy's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Percy was gone. The fates looked around for him, their heads clearing as their eyes refocused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh.' Lachesis said, putting a hand to her head and rubbing her bare ass. 'What happened? Sisters?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I do not recall.' Atropos said, shaking her head as she tried to focus. 'I remember Percy coming in to our chambers, burning up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'After that, we came inside the book.' Clotho said, her arm feeling really tingly and nice for some reason. 'There was a scare... and some gauntlet's...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And after that is a blank?' The sister's asked each other at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I would think that you would not remember</b>.\u201d The Eronomicon said, taking Annabeth's hat to use as the Marked one instructed it. \u201c<b>Losing all higher brain function tends to cause short term memory loss</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What happened?' Clotho asked. 'What happened to Perseus?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, please tell us what has happened to our husband?' Lachesis asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I-Is he...dead?' Atropos asked, for once afraid of that word. Dead. Death. Something that they would never have thought to fear, for themselves or for anyone else. Clotho and Lachesis looked as worried as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Do not fear. The Marked one is safe, Weaver's</b>.\u201d The book said, making all three sigh in relief. \u201c<b>However, he will be gone for some time. The gauntlets he now wears caused some... unexpected side-effects. He is going somewhere to learn how to control them, so as to not put anyone in danger. He has instructed me to inform you so that you could tell your fellow Harem members</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates nodded. They were just Glad Perseus wasn't dead. 'Trust us, book. We shall let them know.'</span></div></div>",

He didn't even know where he was exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho dares near my river?\u201d A male voice called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great.\u201d Percy said sarcastically. \u201cJust what I need, a territorial river god.\u201d He said, feeling very aggressive. How dare he try to command him! \u201cCome on out you asshole! I ain't in the mood for this bullshit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe river raged harder, shuddering as something charged underneath the water's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a mighty moo, a bull the size of a two-story house charged out, horns lowered and aimed right for Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I was right on the bull part.\u201d He said, a smirk on his face. What was wrong with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out, holding his hand up as if to stop the horn from skewering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the river god neared, Percy pulled his hand back, thrusting it into a horn. The horn shattered on impact, turning into something very much less then dust, less then atoms. It was almost as if the horn didn't exist anymore. The air even rippled, creating a vacuum where his hand met physical matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Percy was standing on the raging river god who was being thrown back by the force of his blow. They were flying much farther then whatever forest Percy found himself in, flying at speeds that his boots were hard pressed to achieve, at least since he last checked their full power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of hard to keep tabs on something that increased in power as you did, especially when you're growing in power by leaps and bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his eyes were having a hard time telling where they were going, where they were and where they had already been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grabbed the bulls head, not even putting pressure on it, causing it to just kind of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCease existing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't even a spray of Ichor to signify that he had caused such major damage. It was just there one minute, gone the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy felt as incredible power flowed through him. It wasn't as much as when he deflowered the Fates or Melum, and no where close to when he put on the gauntlets, but it was still power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the river he had been at. He didn't know how he did, but he just did. He could see the entirety of it, every bend and turn, every waterfall, every pebble and fish in its full length. From where it started, a spring in the mountains, to the lake where the river ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see every Nymph along its shores, every nymph that was part of the river. He even felt his control over water increase, powerful as it had been already. He could see a family camping, using the river, his river, for white water rafting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't know when the god's dead body was going to stop. If it did, it was sure to cause damage. It was huge, heavy, and moving at speeds he didn't think were possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grabbed the corpse, crushing it like it was wet paper. Well, no, that wasn't it. Wet paper at least put up some resistance, and it kept a physical form if you crumpled it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull's body just stopped existing. Either that, or it was crushed so small that it couldn't be seen by any microscope and was beyond being reconstructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Percy started to randomly tumble. Nothing was there to stick his feet to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I think I'm going to be sick.\u201d Percy said, reaching out to grab something, anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd everything stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph!\u201d Percy said, his grip crushing whatever it was in his hand. He opened his eyes, suddenly glad he didn't have vertigo, or acrophobia or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hanging in the middle of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot connected to anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust... hanging there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy didn't know where he was. He was above another forest, though it was far from the river he now owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at his hand. \u201cWhat the crap?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like... the sky... was being folded by his hand. Or was it the air? Did it matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had wanted to grab anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he started getting an idea on what else the gauntlets could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stayed there, hanging there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, I wish I could stand on air.\u201d Percy said, hanging freely. \u201cWould be the only safe place for me right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, he felt as if he was standing on solid ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't tell me...\u201d Percy said, stomping his feet on empty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, damn.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI guess there's so much I don't know still.\u201d He said, looking at the map in his free hand. \u201cI'll be back Annabeth, Grover, Melum and everyone else. But I need more control.\u201d He said, unfurling the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what would be a good place for training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~With Grover and Annabeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth was watching the news when a sudden sonic boom blasted. She screamed, covering her ears as the glass on the window and the TV shattered, the building rumbling. Grover yelled, jolting awake, covering his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the world was that?!\u201d Grover yelled, having a hard time hearing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know!\u201d Annabeth yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress! Are you alright?\u201d Melum's voice called, being a little easier to hear then anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel?\u201d Annabeth called back. \u201cAre you and Medusa okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress! We're fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring Medusa to our room Mel! We need to stick together right now!\u201d Annabeth yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress!\u201d Mel called, falling silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, the door slammed open, Melum helping a disoriented Medusa walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She asked, rubbing her ear. It was getting easier to hear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know Medusa.\u201d Annabeth said, her and Grover doing the same thing. They could hear the wails of sirens outside now, already a panic in the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I believe we could answer that.' A voice said in their heads, one that Annabeth and Melum knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClotho!\u201d Annabeth said, turning around. \u201cWhat happened? Did Percy have something to do with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buxom Fate nodded. 'Yes, he did. But this is not the time or place to speak of such things. All of you will be taken to our Weaving chamber. There, we can discuss what has happened while me and my sister's try to undo what has happened.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth nodded, along with everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to say, for the record, that Percy is blessed by Nike.\u201d Grover said, looking over the fate, and referring to the goddess of luck and victory. Hell, he knew that this was a fate standing before him, and he wasn't cowering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho smiled at Grover. 'You would think so, but you would be wrong. He is a blessing unto us. But enough about that. We should get going.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen that familiar sensation of being teleported overtook them.</span></div></div>",

However, they couldn't add back one river god for some reason. They had worked in such a frenzy, trying to find and cut the weaving's of fate that had become frayed with the world wide destruction and chaos. They brought back those who had died due to this phenomena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they had to do all that while explaining what had transpired with Percy, the Eronomicon and the gauntlet's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women had been horrified, though Grover had been worried over his best friend as well. Not even Melum knew such a thing was possible, nor that the Great Tome had such a powerful item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was relieved to know that Percy had recovered, though they had been saddened to hear that Percy would be a way for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum kept the info of Time flowing differently in other universe's to herself for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fates sent them back to their repaired hotel, they being the only ones who would remember the devastation Percy caused in the entire world, Annabeth found her hat on her bed, note attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Annabeth, Medusa, And everyone else,\u201d It began, making Annabeth call everyone over. \u201cSorry about what happened. I didn't know that the gauntlet's would do that. I know that I caused some pretty bad stuff, causing a world wide sonic boom like that. But trust me, that was one of the better things that could have happened. I won't say the best, but definitely not the worst. I could have punched the universe apart, so be glad that the sonic boom was the thing that happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's got to be joking.\u201d Grover said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, at the time of writing this, I've been training for a good while. Maybe a few months now, but I'm not sure. I know it's only been few days for you though. Believe it or not, I stopped by once or twice, maybe more. Figured out a new feature of the boots, after some trial and error, and a few psychotic breakdowns due to even more time travel (Don't ask). I was able to help myself grow stronger faster and learn control, both physical and mental, even quicker. And, I know what you're thinking, but no, I couldn't give this knowledge to the me from before the world shattering problem. Causes too many problems, and I might just explode if I did that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it certainly seems he thought that through.\u201d Annabeth said, nodding. She was so proud of him for not destroying the time line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that wasn't something you think on any day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've been traveling for a while now. I've seen worlds that you might be able to believe, and some that would blow your mind out of the water. I want you to know that everything that you see on TV, everything you read, it happens. Out here, beyond any single universe, there are no boundaries. Everything happens, whether or not you think it's real. Melum should know, even if it's a small bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I do.\u201d Melum said, happy that her master was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust so you know, I've been staying away from any of our universe's and anything that might be connected to them. Can't risk retroactively making them not exist in some stupid fashion, like looking at the sun wrong. That would be kind of a bad thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover could only whimper in fear. He liked existing. And could entire universes end over something that trivial?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry. I shouldn't scare you. But it's a scary place out here, if you're not careful. There are really powerful beings out here. Not even half of them are gods either. There are humans, demons, monster's, aliens (Don't laugh) and all sorts of other things out here that could wipe the floor with Zeus, Kronos and even Gaea. It's not all bad though. There are some really relaxing universe's though. I won't go into details, since you wouldn't believe me anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn't be too sure about that.\u201d Medusa said, looking at Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, this is starting to get too long. I just wanted you to know that I'm fine. Annabeth, I had the Eronomicon do some fine tuning to your hat, allowing you to control when you go invisible. There's also a little extra something done to it for you, but don't worry. It won't be bad for anyone, trust me. Just don't let the power go to your head, please. Under the hat, I have some other things, even for Grover. G-man, I know you love nature and All, so I found/created/restored (Not sure which, time travel and all) something that will help amplify your nature magic, and help you learn to play better. It's a pan flute, so you should get the hang of it right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth picked up her hat, and indeed there was a pan flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet.\u201d Grover said, picking it up. \u201cThanks Percy, where ever you are right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa, I figured out a way to copy the bracelet you have, so you can give one to your sister each, when they come back. And trust me, they will. Just keep believing in them, and they will. There should be two pieces of Paper with Identical seals, so just apply those to the bracelet and it'll work itself out. Look in your nightstand back in your room, and they'll be there for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled, holding her arm. Her hand was still in a cast, since she couldn't take nectar or Ambrosia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum, I haven't gone to your original universe yet. I don't want to go there without you. I don't know what I'll find there, but I'm sure it'll be good to see your home, right? Anyway, I created something special for you. It's a voice regulator. I figured one reason you seemed to show such little emotion with such a beautiful voice was that you had to keep a tight reign on your emotions so you wouldn't do something you would regret. Well, you don't have to worry about that now. It'll be in your nightstand in your room. I want you to learn how to show emotion, and Know that you will always be needed and wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum smiled, feeling a few tears gather. He was right, in some fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell the Fates that I'm doing fine if you can talk to them. Well, scratch that, I know you will be able to do that Annabeth. I haven't found anything for them yet, but I'm trying. Love you girls, and a brotherly hug to you Grover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Signed,<br>\r\nPerseus Jackson,<br>\r\nThe Future Harem God</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. Oh, almost forgot. Don't be surprised if I come home with some new additions to the group. I had to save a few universe's on my journeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.P.S. It's been almost a year since I left. Still missing you guys. Be back soon. More additions to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.P.P.S. Hi guys. Be back on the day of going to the underworld. And yes, I keep adding to this, since it has been at least the fifth time I've popped back home to this universe. Helps me remember where home is. Still love you all. I haven't forgotten the time we spent together Annabeth, so don't worry. Nor you Medusa, or Melum, or The Fates. It helps keep me going, knowing that I've got you all waiting for me. And don't worry. I'll be relaxing in some slower timed universe's, so it won't be several years for me when I get back. Maybe another week or so at most. You all relax as much as you can, but train as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth put it down, tears on her eyes. \u201cHe's been gone so long.\u201d She said, sitting down. \u201cBut it doesn't seem like he's been gone a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum sat down next to her. \u201cThere, there Mistress. It will be alright. Master Perseus will be back soon..\u201d She said, patting Annabeth's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth sniffed. \u201cI know, but still. It's been such a short time for us, but almost a year for him. I feel like I got ripped off in terms of sharing his life with him.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled though. \u201cHey, at least we know he loves us. You, goat boy. You're going to learn how to play those pipes for the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay... I planned on it anyway.\u201d Grover said, looking over the pipes. \u201cThis is so finely crafted... Are those markings grown in? It's like these were made for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I swear, if I hear Hilary Duff, or whatever you kids listen to now, I will turn you to stone until Percy comes back.\u201d Medusa said, looking harshly at him. Not that he noticed, engrossed in looking at his new instrument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress, why don't you put on the hat?\u201d Melum asked, eager to see what her mistress had gotten from their master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, couldn't hurt...\u201d Annabeth said, folding the letter and putting it in her pocket. She slipped on her Yankees cap expecting to turn invisible. She held up her hand, since she wasn't able to see herself when she wore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, would you look at that.\u201d She said, not entirely surprised. \u201cLooks like he did make it better.\u201d She said, thinking to herself to turn invisible. Her hand faded, reappeared and vanished again as she thought of being either invisible or not. \u201cNow what did Percy say about being able to contact the Fates?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Lachesis' voice suddenly sounded behind everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth blinked. \u201cUh, are you talking to me?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, Mistress. Who else could I be addressing?' Lachesis asked, her fiery eyes looking at Annabeth with respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth was silent, taking that in. 'Okay Annabeth, so You've got one of the Fates calling you Mistress, and most likely the others as well. Percy said not to let the power go to your head...' \u201cOkay, yeah. Um, just wanted you to know that Percy sent us a note telling us he was fine. He'll be back on the day we go to the underworld. He also says he loves you and your sisters very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis nodded. 'That's good. Me and my sisters were getting worried about our dear husband. How has his training gone?' She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe says, it has been going well, since he's been gone for about a year.\u201d Annabeth said, looking down. \u201cAt least, that's what it's been for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis nodded again, a smile growing on her face. 'Good, good. We wouldn't want dear Perseus to do something he would regret. I cannot wait to see him again, and I know my sisters can't either. I'll bet he's grown into such a fine young man during his time away.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems like it.\u201d Annabeth said, nodding with a wistful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Will that be all Mistress?' Lachesis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh yeah, that's it.\u201d Annabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis bowed, fading back to the Cambers of Fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover blinked, noticing what had happened. \u201cAnnabeth, did you just order one of the FATES around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, yes.\u201d Annabeth said, thinking on that. \u201cMelum, do you know why I would be able to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress.\u201d Melum said with a smile. \u201cIt would be the Empresses Crown. Master Perseus must have imbued your hat with it's power. It declares you as first Mistress to all followers of Master Perseus. Even now, I can feel the authority given to you by the Crown. You can too, can't you Medusa.\u201d She said, looking at the dark skinned beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, if grudgingly. \u201cYeah, I guess I can. It's a need to follow your orders, and call you Mistress, that much I can tell. And it's not even forcing me to listen to you. For some reason, I WANT to listen to you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth nodded. \u201cOkay, that's weird. But I'm honored that Percy would give me this power, this authority. I promise to try not to abuse it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Melum's eyes twinkled. \u201cDon't make promises you cannot Keep, Mistress. Just a word of advice. Besides, it is your power to abuse. Unless Master Perseus says otherwise, you are free to command us.\u201d She said, tone being Mirthful. She was happy that there was an official mistress now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth nodded slowly. \u201cWell, okay... But Percy did say to not let the power go to my head.\u201d She said, a small laugh coming from her. \u201cHe knows me too well. That kelp head.\u201d She shook her head with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a while, no one knowing what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnabeth, what should we do now? We have a little more then two weeks until Percy comes back.\u201d Grover asked, looking at the blond haired strategist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Percy did say we should train, but relax as well. And that's what we'll do.\u201d She said. \u201cGrover, I want you to learn how to play those pipes. Learn songs that don't make the ground try and strangle you, please.\u201d She said, making him look away in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll work on perfecting my stare.\u201d Medusa chimed in. \u201cI can petrify people easily, but it's a little tough to return them to normal. But at least I can do that now.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I do Mistress?\u201d Melum asked, her voice still soft. Percy's gift would help that though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum, I want you to try and find Echidna.\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cI don't know where she went, but I want her found. Tell her that I want her to report back here every 24 hours, no ifs and/or buts about it. You're the only one here strong enough to deal with her and wherever she may be. I want you to go in ready for a fight. I don't know how monsters will act around her, nor how many there could be since we're so close to the underworld.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum nodded. \u201cAs you wish it, Mistress.\u201d She said, getting up to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now Mel.\u201d Annabeth said, stopping her. \u201cI want everyone to get a good nights sleep and some decent food first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little food the Fates could conjure up as they worked wasn't tasty, filling or nutritional. It was more along the lines of something to tide them over until real food was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth was about to continue, when she noticed something hanging on the bill of her hat. She pulled it down, seeing that it was another note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP.P.P.P.S. Almost forgot. Annabeth, I want you to research any and all myths from every culture. Primarily Egyptian. I'm pretty sure you know the roman 'myths' well enough, right?\u201d She read, putting down the note. \u201cWell, it seems I know what I'm going to be doing.\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cNow everyone get a good night's rest. We got a lot to do.\u201d She said, making everyone nod.</span></div></div>",

She was back in her old body, from before she had been brought back in time. Though she thought her chest was a little bigger, not that she was complaining mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchidna looked aghast, even offended. \u201cI only looked for the more unruly souls to let my children feast on. I don't know about you, but I know for a fact that Percy has changed. Very rapidly I might add. My dear, sweet daughter,\u201d She said, stroking the Chimera's mane. The humanoid monster had a dull look in her eyes, almost unnaturally so. \u201cHas had quite a few episode's, dealing with Percy's emotions controlling hers. That is more then enough to tell me that Percy has done some things that would make you sick to your stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, those are human souls. They won't get the fair judgment that they should now.\u201d Annabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying that those who do wrong deserve to burn in the fields of punishment?\u201d Echidna asked, looking at Annabeth with accusations of her own. \u201cMy way they wouldn't suffer for very long. And they couldn't try and escape, like that Sisyphus man did several times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth tried to resist shouting at the mother of monsters. Even in her position as Mistress of Percy's Harem, something she had gotten accustomed to for the past two weeks, the woman was insufferable! She took every chance she could to try and work around Annabeth's rules, looking for every loophole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Annabeth question if she was the mother of Lawyers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew they were monsters anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's this about sacrificing souls now?\u201d A semi-familiar voice sounded in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone spun around, weapons drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlpha.\u201d The Chimera said, voice sounding bland and emotionless. She merely turned, looking at where the voice had come from. Her blank eyes seemed to regain a little luster to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, imposing figure walked out of the shadows. He was almost seven feet tall, with wild black hair. He was wearing a black tank top, showing off his tanned skin and athletic physique. He wore blue swimming trunks, though a ballpoint pen was sticking out of one pocket, and a pocket book from another. He wore running shoes, really comfortable ones as well. He also wore fingerless gloves, small spikes attached to the knuckles and eyes stitched into the back, watching them all with an unnatural hunger. On one of his fingers was a ring, similar to the one the Chimera wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was his eyes. Annabeth could never mistake those eyes. They glowed in the dark, a deep sea-green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy?\u201d Annabeth asked, lowering her weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure laughed, with such great joy that it was startling. \u201cOf course it's me...\u201d He said, walking slowly towards her. The way he carried himself spoke much for him. He walked with a purpose, but also with a spring in his step, as if something amazing had happened to him. Standing in front of Annabeth, he raised his hand, touching her cheek softly, as if it were an illusion to him. \u201cMy queen.\u201d He said, leaning down to capture her in a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth didn't feel anger, as she had when unsavory types looked at her during her stay in Hollywood. In fact, she melted into the kiss, instinctively wrapping her arms around the taller figure's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover coughed, making both pull apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's the matter Grover?\u201d Percy asked, looking at his friend. \u201cDon't like public displays of affection?\u201d He laughed, a strong, hearty laugh. \u201cAh, come over here you fuzzy bastard. It's good to see ya.\u201d He said, opening his arms to give the Satyr a hug as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that's okay...\u201d Grover said, backing away. \u201cIf you don't mind, I don't want to be near the universe cracking hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged. \u201cFine, have it your way. It's not like I trained to make sure that I didn't crack the universe for almost a year, but whatever.\u201d He said. He turned to look at the rest of the group. \u201cMedusa, Melum. How are you two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust peachy, Percy.\u201d Medusa said, smiling at him as she got an eyeful. She was pleased with what she saw, very pleased. She couldn't help but lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter then ever Master.\u201d Melum said, smiling widely at Percy, her tone incredibly joyful. Around her neck, there was Percy's gift to her. It was a diamond necklace, with a perfectly cut sapphire in the middle. When she found it, there had been a note that read 'Still not as perfect as your eyes, but it was the closest I could get.' In the last two weeks, she had been getting used to the new heights her emotions could reach without making everyone else feel what she did. It was nice, not having to be nearly as careful with her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, smiling at them just as much as Annabeth. \u201cThat's good. Did you enjoy my gifts?\u201d He asked, getting happy nods from them. He held out his hand, as if gripping a staff or pole. \u201cHere's a little something for you Medusa.\u201d He said, a staff suddenly appearing in his hand. It was like any other, for the most part. Made of oak wood, about five feet in length. The only difference was that it had the head of a snake on top, carved out of wood. He gently tossed the staff at her. \u201cShould allow you some control over snakes. Figured you would like something like that. And, as a bonus, it can shoot venom. Should allow you some extra combat potential.\u201d He explained as she caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked it over, admiring the work. \u201cVery nice, you charmer you.\u201d She said, placing the end on the ground. She noticed a small note in the mouth. She took it out, reading the small piece of paper silently. 'It's also good for hypnotizing people, F.Y.I.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at Echidna, his face darkening. \u201cWhat's this I hear about sacrificing souls?\u201d He asked, eyes smoldering in already growing anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not what you think Percy.\u201d Echidna said, starting to sweat. He was mad at her, dangerously so. It didn't take her being connected to him to know that. \u201cThey were horrible people. Rapists, thieves and other criminals! I made sure of it before letting my children attack them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy continued to glare at her, but he said nothing. He merely narrowed his eyes slightly, making her squirm under his gaze, until he turned to the Chimera. He looked down at her eyes, seeing as they returned to some semblance of intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hands on her shoulders, looking directly into her eyes. \u201cI'm sorry for putting you through that.\u201d He said, pulling her into a hug. \u201cI never took the ring off. You must have had a very hard time, dealing with a years worth of emotions in a few days. Especially with all the shit I put myself through.\u201d He said, stroking her mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chimera wrapped her arms around her Alpha. She could tell he was sad, very very sad at what he did to her. \u201cIt okay Alpha. You did not mean too.\u201d She said. Her lessons weren't going so well in the language department, considering that she was mostly away from someone who could teach her. Well, someone that thought it would be important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it's really not.\u201d Percy said, looking down at her again. \u201cBut I'll try to make it up to you, somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the Chimera, Percy looked at Pe\u00edsma. \u201cAnd you?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d She said simply, cowed by his mere presence. Yes, he was now a true Alpha for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d He replied, simple as her. \u201cI gotta say, it's good to see you all again.\u201d Percy said, letting go of the Chimera. \u201cI tell ya, it has been an eventful year for me. What about you guys? Did you train well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth nodded. \u201cYeah, we all did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut did you remember to relax as well?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis tan didn't happen by itself.\u201d Annabeth said, motioning to her skin. It was true, she had put on a nice tan. The other girls as well, those that could tan anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cGood, good. Now, I'll be back in a few minutes. Going to go pick up my cousins from camp. I think it's time they met their father.\u201d He said, vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Camp half-blood <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared in the big house again. He looked around, taking in the features. \u201cMan, it has been a while since I've been here.\u201d He said, looking around. \u201cHey Seymour, how's it going?\u201d He asked the animated mounted leopards head. It growled at him, though Percy could understand it. \u201cSorry Dionysus hasn't been around. Would you like me to give him a message when I see him next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard made other noises, making Percy nod. \u201cOkay, I'll tell him if I see him.\u201d He said, patting the poor animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked out, walking through the halls of the Big House. \u201cChiron! Are you Here!\u201d Percy called. He didn't hear a reply, nor any trotting or wheelchair's rolling across the floor. He made his way to the Front doors, walking outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Camp was at the brink of war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, it almost looked like they were in the middle of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral cabins were on fire, while the Hephaestus cabin and Forge were working overtime. The sounds of wounded came from Apollo cabin, and several Ares campers were guarding the Apollo, Aphrodite and Poseidon cabins, as well as the Demeter cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, he could hear a battle raging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Percy was expecting more people to be against Poseidon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, that's enough.\u201d Percy said. He wasn't going to let a petty squabble like this tear the camp apart.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy exhaled, letting all tension flow from his body. He closed his eyes, raising his arms, palms pointing down to the ground. He focused, mentally pulling on something. The eyes on his gloves glowed sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, four tunnels of rock exploded out of the ground. They were large enough for fully grown people to easily jump into and climb out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Minions, to me!' Percy called mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes sire.' A smooth, feminine voice replied. 'Alright you sorry lot! Get out there!' It shouted, the sounds of large amounts of women clamoring in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stepped back from the tunnels as the ground started rumbling. It got worse and worse each passing second, the sounds of foot steps hitting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWehe! Yahoo! Yeah!\u201d And other sounds of excitement rang out, as women literally launched out of the tunnels, landing and immediately running towards Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flow just wouldn't stop, more and more women flying out of the tunnels and running, bowing eagerly before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster!\u201d They said as each of them bowed down. Looking at it, there seemed to be four groups of similar women, like four women cloned endlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first group were all blonds, all having brown eyes that were dull, lacking much in the way of intelligence. They all wore armor, though it was revealing at places where it wasn't vital they cover up. They all wielded some type of weapon, though it was mainly swords and maces, though a few also had axes and flails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second group were all red heads, with large ram-like horns and blazing yellow eyes. They wore bikini's, showing off their almost always flushed skin. Their hands danced with flames, and they seemed to be a bit more intelligent then the blondes. They had the classic devil tales, which flickered with flames as well, being the only group that had the extra appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third group were possibly the skimpiest ninja ever. They all had green eyes, with black hair. Their hands had long, sharp claws where their nails should have been. They seemed to blend in though, their forms becoming see-through every second. They had shifty eyes, and a gaze that seemed to always look for a weakness, showing that they were good at knowing when to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last group had women in robes, hiding most of their bodies. Their eyes were blue, but they didn't seem all there. But Percy knew they were by no means stupid. Their lips constantly moved, speaking incantations rapidly, their hands twitching every other second or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Percy had the start of a small army. Easily 150 of each group, at the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Listen up!\u201d Percy said, making them all stand at attention. Even the robed ones ceased their chanting to focus on him, their eyes turning sharp, easily the most intelligent of the four groups. \u201cI want four equal groups to go around and stop the fighting! Stop the fires if you can! I want no killing, but be as brutal as necessary!\u201d He commanded. He got whoops of joy, cheering him. \u201cIf you find a Half man, Half horse creature, tell him that Perseus would like to speak with him! Now go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a wave, the women split into groups at the robed one's commands, before rushing to follow the orders they had been given. As they ran, amidst the psychotic laughter and screams of joy, there was a singular cry that sounded the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the Overlord!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sat on the porch, watching as the horde of, somehow terrifying, women charged. The Ares campers fumbling for their weapons before the waves ran over them, speaking and yelling in a horrifying frenzy. They were knocked out, possibly a few broken bones, as they were stripped of anything the women thought they could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love the minions.\u201d He said, grinning viciously. \u201cWork well, and are quite the crowd control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Indeed, sire.' The smooth female voice said. 'Quite the nasty little bunch, those women. And I must say, they are much better then those imp forms they had previously.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah.\u201d Percy said, waving to the invisible voice. \u201cAnyway, have you figured out a place for a new 'dark tower' yet?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No sire, not yet. We don't know the areas around here that well. I could send a few Succubi around and scout if you desire.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy thought on that, watching as the red headed women absorbed the fire from the burning buildings. 'Do it, but on strict orders not to attack anyone. I swear, if another tries to drain someone during a mission...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'As you command sire.' The voice said. 'They should be heading out right... now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore women burst from the ground, these ones different from the minions. First of all, these ones could fly, as evidenced by their demonic wings. They had normal skin, being a light pink and black hair. If not for the wings, they could have passed as human. They wore a black corset, which only made their impressive bust seem larger, along with garter straps which held up thigh length stockings. They also sported a ribbon collar choker, each one a different color to differentiate between the otherwise clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubi bowed, taking off to search for a suitable area for their new abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good. I hope that they don't get shot down.' Percy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know as well as I do sire that that won't happen.' The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, but you forget Murphy's law.' Percy replied, teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, right. Forgive me sire.' The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Calm down. You won't end up like that rat Gnarl, or that sniveling jester.' Percy said, thinking back on the traitorous old minions. One did not betray Perseus Jackson so easily. Not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thrice damned 'heroes', as they liked to call themselves. Utter disgraces to the term, that's what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you sire.' The voice said, relieved. 'You truly are more forgiving then Lady Lilith.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah yeah. Don't let her hear you say that though.' Percy said. 'She would- Wait, gotta go. The centaur is here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood up, Chiron approaching with his bow drawn. \u201cPercy? Is that you.\u201d He asked warily, arrow knocked on the string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong time no see Chiron.\u201d Percy said, waving at him with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron looked at Percy suspiciously. \u201cAre you here to retrieve that item you left me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiron, don't even try to pull that on me.\u201d Percy said, looking the centaur dead in the eye. \u201cWhere are Nico and Bianca?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron sighed. \u201cOh, it is you Percy. Sorry, but you can't blame a person for being cautious. They're inside the big house, in the basement. It was the safest place for them right now, and there was nowhere else for them to go.\u201d Chiron said, nodding back into the house. \u201cBut Percy, what happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time to explain Chiron. And before you ask, yes I did have something to do with the army of women that are attacking the camp. Just to let you know, they're... friendly. Just make sure to keep them from having anything sweet, or magical. Makes them weird and dangerous. Oh, and the flying women in skimpy clothing too. Don't shoot them down.\u201d Percy said, walking back into the Big house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron just stood there, looking at where Percy had been. His headaches were becoming more and more frequent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked with a whistle, passing by the lounge/meeting room, waving at Seymour as he walked by. He walked into the kitchen, ignoring the squawks from the Harpies. He opened up the basement door, walking down the steps. His eyes glowed in the dark, piercing though it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the basement. He saw Bianca, her aura showing up bright in the dark. Above her read the words 'Give her a family and non-brotherly love.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now where's Nico?' He asked, making his way to Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to feel something bounce off his side, a blade by the feel of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy reached down, grabbing the arm of Nico. \u201cSettle down Cousin. It's me, Percy.\u201d He said. \u201cLook, I came to pick you up. We're really going to see your father this time, I swear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy?\u201d Bianca's voice rang out. Her form stood up, running to him and Nico. She wrapped her arms around him. \u201cPercy!\u201d She said, hugging him. \u201cThank god... Er... the gods that you're here!\u201d She said, before thwaping him alongside the head. \u201cYou're a jerk! Leaving us here for almost a month!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look, I'm sorry.\u201d He said, totally unaffected by her attack to his skull. It barely even reached, the girl having to stand on her toes to get a good solid hit. \u201cBut it was either that, or not have enough time to explain everything about being a Demigod. Or train you, or anything else for that matter. But look, we need to get going. I'm really going to take you to your father this time. I promise you that. Besides, there's kind of a war going on up top.\u201d He said. \u201cBoth of you, close your eyes. This is going to get weird.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited a minute for them to comply, when he kicked off from the ground.</span></div></div>",

No 'He's a satyr?' or anything?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the shock wore off after the first week.\u201d Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn.\u201d Percy said, snapping his fingers. \u201cBut you're not even going to ask why I've changed so much?\u201d He asked, making Bianca give him a flat look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the last two weeks, I've been thrown into a whole new world where anything I thought was real and fake has blurred.\u201d She said. \u201cI could probably rationalize anything anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint.\u201d Percy said. If only she knew what was beyond. well, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we go now?\u201d Grover asked. \u201cOlympus is on the verge of war you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you should see what I'm about to unleash on the camp to quell the fighting.\u201d Percy said. \u201cLet's go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into DOA recording studios, everyone else following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lobby was crowded as ever, the souls of the departed waiting for their chance to ride the ferry. Muzak (Actually spelled in the book, so don't correct) played on hidden speakers. Everything about the place seemed dead, which was fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked up to the raised Podium where the ferry man sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? What do you want?\u201d Charon asked, putting down the obituary section of the news paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we want passage across the river. I know you're the ferryman, Charon.\u201d Percy said, looking right into the tortoiseshell glasses of the dark figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, we've got a brave one here.\u201d He said, grinning. \u201cAnother hero, here to cause some sort of trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. I ain't got the time for you to be a selfish prick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharon sneered, making all the souls restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry your wo-Urk!\u201d He started saying, before Percy literally grabbed his throat. Something that had never been done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook.\u201d Percy said, utterly calm about the fact he was choking the ferryman across the river Styx. \u201cI'm trying to be nice here. I haven't had a very relaxing year. I've seen so much death that you couldn't begin to think of how many times your little boat would be full. I've seen entire worlds end, hell, I've CAUSED entire worlds to end. These hands, holding you by the throat right now, have killed gods more powerful then you could imagine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're... Lying!\u201d Charon choked out, trying to Pry Percy's hands away from his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I'm not. Look into My eyes, Ferryman. You'll see that I am not a good person. Not anymore. Kind, yes. Good? Not on your life. I've raised an evil empire, killing a god of evil in the process, and <b>took his place</b>. So don't try to start anything. Now, I'm only going through you to get to the underworld because it's the official channel, and some things need to be set in motion by going through that channel.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI'm going to let go of you in ten seconds. If you help us, I can make it worth your while. If you refuse... well, I'll just add another tally to my body count. And trust me, you won't come back from the grave if I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy held his grip, putting only the smallest amount of Pressure on Charon's throat. Though that had the effect of almost crushing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy let go, letting Charon take deep breaths of nice, stale, dead air. He fell back, behind the desk with a thump, wheezing for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stepped back, crossing his arms, watching the desk like a hawk. His eyes glowed eerily, and the shadow of a terrible helmet appeared over his face, covering it in pure darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharon slapped a hand on his desk, pulling himself up while the other rubbed his throat. \u201cFine...\u201d He wheezed out. \u201cGet on the damn boat...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved off his pedestal, wading through the dead souls to get to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, let's move. And for the love of everything, stay close to me.\u201d Percy growled, making the group nod, Grover and the two youngest members shaking at the display. His helmet was gone, but the souls of the dead had given him a wide berth for the moment, but only that one horrible moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone crowded behind Percy as he made his way, moving ghosts out of his way like he was going through a crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, shut up! Don't get mad at me! Sorry I'm alive then, asshole!\u201d Percy yelled, the ghosts yelling at him as they were moved forcefully. They had seemed to ignore what had happened, trying to forget it. They might have figured that it was some postmortem insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca and Nico had to cover their ears, being the only other ones who could hear their yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey filed into the Elevator, Charon swatting away the spirits as they tried to enter without paying. The souls of those who could pay looked expectantly at Charon, their boarding passes being held up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, everyone who isn't used to sudden transitions please close your eyes.\u201d Percy said as the Elevator descended, Charon putting his key card away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent, as the living huddled around Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharon looked over Nico and Bianca. He scowled at Percy. \u201cIf you said you were here to bring the boss's kids to him, I wouldn't have said a word.\u201d He grumbled, occasionally still rubbing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged, taking something out of his pocket. He motioned for Charon to hold out his hand, something the slowly skeletonizing figure was hesitant to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he did though, Percy pressed the item into his hand. Charon held it in a bony had, looking up at it as the scenery changed to a wooden barge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a large topaz in his hand, easily worth 20 grand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, despite his throat still being sore. \u201cWell, at least you're a godling of your word.\u201d He said, stowing it in the pocket of his Italian suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you. I may not be good, But I am kind.\u201d Percy said, keeping a hand on Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were floating on the river Styx.</span></div></div>",

It looked dark and oily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeet me at the judges. I won't be long.\u201d Percy said, jumping over the side, landing on the water's surface. He ran along the river, heading upstream, the boat quickly disappearing into the mist behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, bones and fish floated by, along with old, unfulfilled dreams that were cast aside or forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of running, normal speed, along the river, Percy came across a waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d Percy called. \u201cI know you're there, Styx!\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d A feminine voice called from above the waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to talk with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response for a minute. \u201cFine. I'll be down in a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy saw a figure swim down the waterfall, just under the water. Percy walked to shore, where the figure was obviously swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched at the figure emerged from the water, completely naked, untouched by the rivers pollution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dark skinned, with silver eyes and long, oily black hair. She was tall, almost standing at the same height as Percy. Her assets were overall small, save for her shapely legs. She looked at him with disinterest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She asked, an unhappy look plastered on her face. \u201cCan't you leave me alone? Everyone else does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. \u201cNope, can't do that.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx looked at him, eying him carefully. \u201cI know you. You're the brat of Poseidon's, that lousy ingrate. Both him and Zeus.\u201d She grumbled. \u201cNothing's sacred anymore, I swear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I know you don't like me. I'm the result of a broken Promise made by the gods that they weren't supposed to break. But don't get mad at me for being my father's son. I didn't choose to be his kid.\u201d Percy scowled. \u201cAnd for the record, I don't like Zeus or my father either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx just 'Hmph'ed' \u201cYeah, well, you don't know what it's like. They promised to only use my name when it was a sacred Promise. Now they use it for everything, and never keep them. So, not only are they breaking a sacred law they created, my name's being dragged through the mud and has lost all meaning. Ooh, so the sky rumbles, big deal. The little lightning brat could do that himself.\u201d She said, crossing her arms. \u201cMaybe I should have fought for Kronos. Sure, he was a murderous, paranoid, Delusional, idiot of a titan, but at least HE never made Promises he didn't intend to keep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKronos made Promises?\u201d Percy asked, raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx sighed. \u201cNo, not really. All he ever did was order the titans around and torture humans for sport. But that's not the point. You see my river?\u201d She asked, pointing to the oily water. \u201cI can handle the broken dreams. They float on down the river to the Lethe. But the broken and forgotten promises? No, that stuff sticks around as long as I do. Worse then any oil spill, since Promises are always broken or forgotten, more so then dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cWell, sorry, there's nothing I can do for that 'yet.'\u201d Percy said, thinking the last word to himself. \u201cWhat I can do is offer you my help in taking down Zeus and Poseidon. And without working for that little titan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx looked at him, one delicate eyebrow raised. \u201c'Little titan?' You must be arrogant or a fool. I may not have been fond of Kronos, but he was powerful. There was a reason it took Zeus, Poseidon and Hades working together at the same time to take him down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged again. It was understandable that people didn't think he could take down the ruler of the titans. \u201cWell, I gotta lot of things going for me.\u201d Percy remarked. \u201cI got Clotho, Atropos and Lachesis working with me. As in, directly working with me. I'm incredibly powerful on my own. These gloves I got can do things you wouldn't believe. Same with the shoes. I can't be killed with something like the Master bolt, or anything for that matter by virtue of immortality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, to top it all off, I have not only an army at my command that is almost infinite, if not all that resilient, but I also have several incredibly powerful goddess's working both with and for me.\u201d He said, looking right at Styx. \u201cSo, you tell me. Who's going to win in a fight between me and Kronos?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx just huffed. \u201cYou're bluffing. No one could wield that kind of power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled back, suddenly realizing Percy was in her face. She hadn't even seen him move, and she never blinked or looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, I'm not just anybody.\u201d Percy said, grabbing her arm gently. Styx felt pleasure well up in her, desire rising for who she liked to call the child of a broken promise. \u201cI can do things even the gods would do well to Fear. I could easily take Olympus down on my own, today. But I won't. Do you know why?\u201d He asked, Styx moaning at his touch as he gently stroked her face. \u201cBecause it would be too simple. Too easy. Too... boring.\u201d Percy hissed the word Boring out. How he was able to do that without any S's in the word would remain a mystery. \u201cNow, we can do this one of several way, but I'll break it down to two. The easy, pleasurable way, for both me and you. Or, I can use one of many... powers... at my disposal to make you want to join me. Personally, I would prefer the easy way myself. I don't like to try and force people. I don't like feeling like my father. But I will if I must.\u201d Percy said. There was one thing that kept him from being like his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen wanted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned down, putting his face to hers. He could see as she started to lose herself to his power, his loosening of the gauntlets chains a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, that was something Percy had trained, keeping control of the aura the Gauntlets emitted to women. He could control it now, effortlessly. Same with the strength, and his boots. And any other aura he had.</span></div></div>",

Even though she could feel the pleasure, the desire, she tried to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could commend her for that.

He wasn't going to get all uppity at something minor as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, tragic.\u201d Percy said, waving his hand over the Eronomicon. Out popped a large stone tablet, featureless except for the sheer smoothness of its face. It reflected the pitiful amount of light in the land of the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy activated the Silver Tongue of the Serpent, holding onto her shoulder as he slowly let more of the gauntlet's power loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTouch the stone.\u201d He whispered. To Styx, he sounded so charming, so convincing, that combined with the pleasure that was washing over her, she almost came on the spot. \u201cAll your troubles will wash away, my dear. You won't have to worry about your river, or the gods anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx found herself raising her hand, against her will. She desperately wanted to fight it, fight Percy. But  he sounded so sure of himself, so convincing that she wouldn't have to worry anymore. It would be nice, not worrying about her river anymore. Let her sister, Lethe, take care of everything that floated down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched the stone tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she felt her mind go blank of any emotion. She remembered events, but not the emotions she used during them. She didn't even remember what words like 'happy' or 'sad' meant anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched, his eyes devoid of joy. He never liked to take such control of a person, but it was something that he had grown accustomed to doing. It never felt very pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was a necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about how he wanted to remake Styx, in terms of personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I could go the emotionless route, but it takes too long. But it is a little more gratifying, building up someones emotions to just the right mold.' He thought. 'But it would suit my plans just fine if I rewrote her personality. Much less pleasant though. It makes it seemed forced, unnatural. Or, as a thought, I could go in the middle. Let her retain basic emotions, but have no concept of where to feel them. Takes less time, but it flows better in terms of emotional strength. Forcing something to fit only cracks, or worse, shatters the object. Shaving it down to fit and filling in the holes later, however, would work just fine.'</span></div></div>",

'Let me direct her personality in a not so subtle way, while not having to explain to her what the concepts mean all the time. It works well, even allowing me to give her personality quirks, guilty pleasures and the like, as well as control who she hates, who she tolerates, what she aspires for...' Percy shook his head. 'When did I get this cunning? I remember a time when I would run in head first. Not to say that I don't still do that, but... matters such as this were so far beyond me merely a year ago.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked for what seemed like ten minutes. He stripped away all her emotions, previous attachments, current attachments, desires and more. He left only the barest foundations for any emotion, any hopes or dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork completed, Percy removed her fingers from the tablet. Once she had no more contact with it, Styx blinked, a little bit of her intelligence coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy reigned in the power of the gauntlets, sealing off his serpentine tongue with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him. \u201cI know you.\u201d She said emotionlessly. \u201cThe child of a broken promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that's me.\u201d Percy said, concealing a smirk. \u201cWhat do you feel about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx put a hand to her head, like she thought she should know, but the knowledge just wasn't there. \u201cI don't know. What do I feel?\u201d She asked, still as emotionless as a robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about happy?\u201d Percy asked, knowing this would be the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile twitched upon her lips, tugging at the corners of her mouth. \u201cYes, I feel... happy.\u201d She said, looking at him with a small smile, as if unused to such an action. \u201cBut why do I feel happy?\u201d She asked, going back to an emotionless drone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you love me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled again, moving close to him. \u201cYes, that is right. Because I love you. And...being near those you love... makes you happy.\u201d She said, reaching out to grab his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what else you love doing and makes you happy?\u201d He asked, setting up a little tirade to set a more stable foundation for her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d She said, holding his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou love listening to me. It makes you happy when you do.\u201d He said, making her nod. \u201cYou love being used by me. It makes you feel good when I use you.\u201d He said, making her nod. He put a hand on her breast, giving it a gentle squeeze, making her moan. \u201cYou love believing me, no matter what. You are happy when you do.\u201d He said, making her nod. \u201cYou love being loyal to me, and only me. It makes you very happy.\u201d He said, making her nod. \u201cYou love truth and justice. It makes you happy when they are upheld.\u201d He said, making her nod. \u201cYou love me unconditionally. It makes you happy, knowing this.\u201d He said, making her move closer to him. \u201cYou lust for me. You like this feeling.\u201d He said, and she grabbed at his crotch. \u201cBut what do you hate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her hand out of his, placing it to her head again. \u201cI don't know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hate lies, unless they are necessary. They make you angry.\u201d He said, making her nod. \u201cYou hate those who break promises. They make you vengeful.\u201d He said, making her nod. \u201cYou hate intolerance. It makes you both sad and angry.\u201d He said, making her nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went on. For another ten minutes, Percy built up her new personality, her new self. She accepted it all, Percy telling her how to feel, what to feel, who to feel for, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe desired to topple Zeus and Poseidon, and she hated them for breaking promises. She loved being touched by him, no matter where they were. She had the guilty pleasure of having someone watch her as she had sex, and a guilty pleasure of watching someone have sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last one was because of the minions never minding their own business. It had rubbed off onto Percy, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had many other things that Percy had told her how to feel, what to like and dislike. But Percy had also left a lot blank, so that she could build a little bit of her personality herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Percy basically made her a willing slave, who loved him unconditionally. She was lustful, but knew when to keep in control of herself. She loved being used by him, being owned by him. She would do anything he told her, believe anything he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he said the sky was orange with magenta stripes, the sky was orange with magenta stripes. At least, to her it would seem that way. It might just swap the normal blue of the sky with the aforementioned color scheme in her mind so she would think that it was, and it might alter what she thought about other things that were blue as the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy wasn't a brain surgeon after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all precaution to Percy. Several things had gone wrong the first time he had done something with the tablet. He had corrected those mistakes, vowing to never make them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was horrible seeing a woman tear her soul apart as it fought inside her body. Two sides of the same coin, but in such fierce opposition to the other that they couldn't stand existing with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even worse when they fought over whether or not they hated him. Whether or not they tried to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had happened so fast, so unexpectedly. There was nothing he could do to save Jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, until he went back in time again to fix what he had broken beyond repair. To warn himself of his mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the scare was there. The scar was there. Neither could be forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was also why he was hesitant to just rewrite her personality, rather then build from the ground up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a mask that was made for your face. If it didn't fit, it didn't fit. Trying to force it would cause damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what the personality was to the soul, essentially. If he had just rewritten her personality, it would have only buried the old one underneath it. If strong enough emotional stimuli had brought it out... well, the consequences would not be pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon Styx. We need to go speak to your favorite of the big three, and my favorite uncle.\u201d Percy said, wrapping an arm around the titaness's shoulders. She was hugging him back, giggling as she tried to grind against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, they left the black, volcanic banks of the river Styx, going to meet the judges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ At the judges<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared in the center of the line awaiting judgment, Styx clinging to him still. The souls of the dead were yelling at Percy, telling him to get out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d Percy said, rubbing his head. \u201cOne bad thing about becoming a god of the Abyss is that you can hear souls clearly. And there are definitely more here then... well, there. Never did find out the name of that world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, does it hurt my love?\u201d Styx asked, ignoring the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. \u201cNah, just annoying. Though not as much as the god itself. I swear, he never shut up. Well, at least until I roasted him from the inside out, crushed his skull and absorbed his powers. At least the wraiths never talked.\u201d Percy said, thinking back on his undead underlings.</span></div></div>",

You are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think they're this way.\u201d Percy said, pushing through the line of the dead, basically carrying Styx. \u201cIt's not play time anymore.\u201d He said, making her huff playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I guess I can stop trying to fool around with you if I must.\u201d She said, acting all dramatic. Hand held to her forehead and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later.\u201d Percy said, hands going to grab her rear. \u201cBut not now. Business before pleasure, after all.\u201d He said, walking over the hill. He could easily see through the gloom of the underworld, see his group and Cerberus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, said giant, three-headed rottweiler was currently letting all souls pass unhindered as it lay off to the side, having two heads being scratched behind their ears at the same time. The third head would have been pouting, if it weren't busy growling at the Chimera, who in turn growled right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy's missed you.\u201d Echidna said. \u201cHave they been treating you well down here? Playing fetch with the souls of the tormented, like we agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus whined, making Echidna gasp, as if in horror. \u201cThe nerve of them! When I agreed to let you become the hound of Hades, I made sure you would be cared for.\u201d She said, growing angry. Kind of like a mother who found out the daycare she left her kid at had neglected them. \u201cWell, you won't have to worry about that anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared next to Echidna, setting the titaness he was carrying down. Cerberus growled at him, only to have Echidna shush it. \u201cBe nice, Cerberus.\u201d Echidna ordered, causing the rottweiler to whimper again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChimera, come here please.\u201d Percy ordered. The beast-woman nodded, ignoring her sibling as she moved to her Alpha. \u201cHold out your hand for a moment, the one with the ring.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked over the ring, after she had done so. He carefully inspected it, even pulling out a pair of glasses to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into one back pocket, a light glowing from it. Percy pulled out a roll of paper, with a strange, headache inducing image. It was an absolute mess to behold, but also... ritualistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy took out a pencil, erasing and redrawing the smallest lines, maybe mere centimeters off of what they were before. He added circles, triangles, a five pointed star and several new lines, always tweaking them to something only he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth, Grover and Medusa all really wanted to ask him what he was doing, but Melum shushed them. Whatever her master was working on, it was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot to account for the soul bond, adding the link for both rings.\u201d Percy muttered, twisting the Chimera's ring several times. \u201cNot to mention the one way empathy and mood control. Have to make sure that I get it the right way as well. Wouldn't be good if I got that reversed. Damn, I wish I could have tested this out in a controlled environment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, rubbing his head. \u201cWell, I think that's it.\u201d Percy said, straightening up. He rolled up the paper, putting it back into his pocket. It glowed twice, the paper disappearing for a second before reappearing. He pulled the paper out again, though it was visibly smaller this time. \u201cNow, to see if this works.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the paper on the Chimera's ring, light erupting from it. Everyone shielded their eyes, Cerberus only able to close its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light died, Percy was holding a ring instead of paper. It looked exactly like the one the Chimera wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnabeth, could you do something for me?\u201d He asked, looking at the blond haired beauty as she rubbed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what?\u201d She asked, blinking. She caught the golden ring as it sailed right towards her. She looked at it, as if questioning its very existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWear it. I want to see if I made it right.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth nodded, putting the ring on her finger. Instantly, she could feel what Percy felt. Apprehension, worry for her, hope, among other things. She... couldn't feel anything herself. She tried, she knows she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she found herself smiling. Then worried, then sad, then happy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked to her, slipping the ring off her finger. She was in control of herself again, she could feel it. She held her head, the feeling of controlling her own emotions rushing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d He whispered, holding her in a hug. \u201cBut I had to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth didn't say anything, trying to ease the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy let go of her, walking to the crouched form of Cerberus. He put the ring in his back pocket, and like the paper it flashed, vanishing and reappearing in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now I can make copies as need be.\u201d Percy said, mostly to himself. He pressed his hand to the book, the ring still in his palm. \u201cI wonder... No. No experiments right now that aren't necessary.\u201d He said, berating himself. He slipped the ring out, holding it as he imprinted a seal onto his hand. One he had used quite a few times in the past, even in this world, his home world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved up to the large hound, who felt like it should back away in fear. Primal fear, the fear of the unknown. And Cerberus certainly didn't know what the person could do, nor what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's going to be okay.\u201d Percy said, gently. He extended his hand for the large dog to smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe the human wasn't so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus sniffed at the offered hand, three noses taking in the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he didn't smell of bad intentions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay, baby.\u201d Echidna said, rubbing the side of Cerberus's right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy placed his hand upon the middle snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was a bigger, more intense light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus howled, all three heads snarling and snapping at the air. It backed up, rearing onto it's hind legs as it's body was engulfed in pure light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Percy could see again, for even the light was too much for his eyes, he saw...</span></div></div>",

He wasn't expecting this at all. \u201cI think her head touches the ceiling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the giant woman was Cerberus. The former hound of Hades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the dog had been twice the size of a woolie mammoth, it seemed the woman was easily the height of a certain storm giant, if not larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly, Percy imprinted yet another seal into his hand, slapping it onto Cerberus's foot. Well, pinky toe. Instantly, the gargantuan woman shrank in size, growing smaller and smaller before she could actually do any damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was too close.\u201d Percy said. \u201cThat could have gone badly. Really badly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Everyone but Melum and Styx asked, rubbing their eyes. Even shielded, they still almost went blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry.\u201d Percy said, brushing off their questions. \u201cIt's best you don't know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he could see Cerberus's full body, Percy took in an eye full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus was darker then pitch black, except on her belly, the inside of her legs and the underside of her arms. Those were a dark mahogany. Her fur was coarse, though it was shiny nonetheless. She had one blue eye, though it was more leaning to a slight purplish color, and a dark brown eye, almost like fresh dirt, both almond shaped. She had a short muzzle, filled with still surprisingly sharp teeth. A long tail swung from behind, sweeping the ground behind her. She was also very well endowed, rivaling Clotho in the breast department, while Lachesis was now having close competition for having a great rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy slipped the ring onto the dazed woman's finger, though she did try to pull away. If Percy wasn't as strong as he was, his arms would have been ripped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Percy could see that the ring took effect. The Chimera and Cerberus both looked the same, in terms of their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my!\u201d Echidna squealed! Yeah, that's right. Echidna, mother of all monsters, squealed. \u201cOh, my darling girl is so adorably dangerous.\u201d She said, hugging her new humanoid daughter. She was referring to Cerberus's teeth and claws, which still looked like they could eviscerate someone like they were a wet paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus ignored her mother, looking directly at Percy. \u201cAlpha.\u201d She said, bowing her head. She twitched, lifting her head. She now had blood red eyes, staring him directly in the eyes. \u201cAlpha.\u201d She said, this time a little more primal and forceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twitched yet again, Percy able to see her eyes shift to a deathly blue/purple. \u201cAlpha.\u201d She said, happily wagging her tail as she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give!\u201d Grover yelled, looking at the new addition to the group. \u201cWhat's next? Artemis? Athena? <b>HERA</b>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico and Bianca were looking, though neither was absolutely sure what they were seeing. Nico was too young to understand the implications of a dog turning into a woman, but Bianca wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to the big dog?\u201d Nico asked innocently, looking curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca could only watch. She couldn't even voice her... wonder? Horror? Complete and utter bafflement, coupled with a wonder if she was in a coma of some kind, and had been for a long time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it was probably that last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus twitched again, going back to her original personality. Percy guessed that would be the neutral one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon. We gotta move.\u201d Percy said, picking up Cerberus. She would need to get used to walking on her own time. \u201cMelum, toss me the master bolt backpack.\u201d He ordered, catching it with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked through the metal detector, which made a high-pitched sound before completely short circuiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, too much magic power I suppose.\u201d Percy said, looking as the contraption started melting. \u201cOh well, no skin off my back. I can give my uncle the money. Oh, and you two better cover your ears.\u201d He said, pointing at Nico and Bianca. \u201cGoing to get really noisy for the three of us. Melum, can you hear them?\u201d He asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I can easily ignore them.\u201d She said, even toned instead of whispers. It was quite nice, hearing her talking normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Cause we're going to the place with the most dead under the earth.\u201d Percy said, walking around the heap of slag. \u201cWelcome to the Fields of Asphodel.\u201d He said, walking into the dark mist beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ About an hour or so later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked up at the obsidian palace. \u201cStill got nothing on the dark tower.\u201d He muttered, looking specifically at three bat like women flying above the palace. \u201cHey!\u201d He yelled. \u201cGo tell Hades that we want to speak with him! And no funny business either!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a faint screech of anger, but the three women flew down into the palace, disappearing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChimera, Pe\u00edsma. Help Cerberus walk.\u201d He said, putting the newest monster woman down. Chimera and Pe\u00edsma did as told, Cerberus growling slightly at Chimera, though giving Pe\u00edsma a good lick to the side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMade sense, since Cerberus was technically her ancestor, and Cerberus probably thought of her as a pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNico, Bianca, up front with me.\u201d Percy ordered, making the two scuttle quickly in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Percy sighed. \u201cLook, you two don't need to be afraid of me. For all my menacing presence, I wouldn't think of hurting family. Well, unless they needed a good ass-kicking.\u201d He said, drawing a glare from Bianca at his use of the swear. \u201cOh, don't look at me like that. Kids gonna learn to swear at some point. Though if you don't want him to hear anything too bad, keep him away from Ares.\u201d He said. \u201cNow come on. Let's go meet your dad, and my uncle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait.\u201d Bianca said, stopping him. \u201cYou said That we're meeting our father, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we're going to see the god of the dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that means...\u201d Bianca said, realizing the implications only now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHades is your father, yes.\u201d Percy said. He wondered if he should tell them they were the half siblings of Adolf Hitler. Nah, better not. \u201cSo? I'm a child of Poseidon. He's not supposed to have children either, not anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201d Bianca started to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d Percy asked, turning his eyes towards her. \u201cYour father is one of the most honorable Olympians. He may be lord of the Dead, but he is not evil. His children may have done horrible things in the past, but he is not responsible for their actions. Whether or not you accept him is your choice, but for all intents and purposes He is one of my favorite Gods, personally. He may be shrewd, but that's only because his family has turned their backs on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back, starring her in the eye. \u201cWould you abandon the people who need you the most?\u201d He asked. \u201cYour brother? Your Father? Both need you equally, but for different reasons. Nico still needs someone to watch for him and help him grow. And I think your father has already lost enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cIt won't be easy, I know. You'll be ostracized for being children of Hades. But you got family here. And not just down here,\u201d He said, waving around him. \u201cBut you got me, Melum, Annabeth and everyone else here. Right?\u201d He asked, getting rounds of agreement from everyone who could talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca looked down. She had been thinking of trying to pawn Nico off on somebody, anybody really. Just a month in that hotel had already driven her crazy. She didn't want to have to watch out for him all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy knealt, placing a hand on both hers and Nico's shoulder's. \u201cLook, not everything you hear about the gods is true. After several things came to light, I'm not very fond of my own Father. You remember aunt Em?\u201d He asked, getting nods. \u201cShe was Medusa. And yes, she did turn people to statues. But before you freak out,\u201d Percy said, seeing both go pale. \u201cI solved her little problem. My dad...\u201d He paused, looking back at her, getting a nod. He wanted her permission. \u201cWell... he did some bad things to her. Athena cursed her, and then my dad did even more bad things. It scarred her, and I know it still does. But she wasn't as bad as the legends made her out to be. Hades isn't evil, and Zeus isn't a great ruler. Remember that.\u201d He said, standing up. Without another word he walked through the bronze gates of the fortress.</span></div></div>",

Glad you didn't get dragged to Tartarus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wasn't going to fall into Kronos's hands.\u201d Grover said, trying to put on a show of bravado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would have got you Grover.\u201d Percy said. \u201cTrust me, I would have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover nodded, sensing the truth behind Percy's words. He wasn't lying at all, he knew it for certain now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one ate the fruit, right?\u201d Percy asked, looking back. They had just passed through Persephone's garden, with the dreaded fruit of the underworld. He got shakes of their heads, telling him that they didn't. \u201cGood. We're almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large group walked down the hallways, the dead military that Hades used as palace guards bowing to Bianca and Nico. The dead came from all era's of history, all nationalities. Though none of them were from a time older then the start of the Greek pantheon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico was looking around, finding it all to be, in his own words, awesome and cool. Bianca was less excited, though she did try to stay strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo large bronze doors appeared out of the gloom, signifying the end of the hallway. Two U.S. Military men were carrying RPG's, guarding the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was about to open the doors when they opened by themselves, letting the stalest air ever flow through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover had to cover his nose, it was so foul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group walked in, the throne of Hades Occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was as Percy remembered him. Ten feet tall, dressed in black robes and crowned with braided gold. His skin was albino white, his shoulder-length hair an oily black. He wasn't compensating for anything with his physique, unlike a certain war god, yet he still radiated a godly power. His eyes were radiating that same, devilish charisma that any leader would, if you could call the likes of Hitler or terrorist leaders, well, leaders. That same charm that could make people lose any and all sense of decency or morals, and do horrible things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, that wasn't really his fault. Just the way he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Uncle.\u201d Percy said, unafraid of the Aura Hades emanated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades eyes bored holes into Percy, glancing irritably at Melum once or twice. \u201cYou are foolish to come here, child of Poseidon. And you as well, outsider.\u201d He said, looking at Melum. \u201cI should incinerate you here and now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can try, Lord of the dead.\u201d Melum said, glaring right back at him, her voice scathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now Mel.\u201d Percy said, raising a hand. \u201cUncle, we came here to negotiate and come to an agreement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades was snarled at Percy. \u201cFor my helm? Bah. You just want to take more from me don't you? In the name of your Father? If you want your Mother back, you will give me my helm. Or she will die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now uncle, surely you can see reason.\u201d Percy said, his finger twitching. That was another thing Percy never forgot. His mother was held captive. \u201cYes, I have the master bolt, but I never stole it from Zeus. And I don't have your helm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLies!\u201d Hades roared. \u201cI am not as foolish as my youngest brother. You and your father cannot fool me! You were the thief on the winter solstice! It was then that you stole my helm, and the master bolt! I will not be strong-armed into supporting your father!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't give a damn about my father!\u201d Percy roared, voice deeper then Hades. Armor appeared on him in a flash, covering his entire body. He posed a powerful, terrifying figure, his eyes glowing a poisonous green instead of sea green (Foot note: Armor looks like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://overlord.wikia.com/wiki/File:Arcanium_Armor_Concept_Artwork2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://overlord.wikia.com/wiki/File:Arca...</a>). \u201cNow give me back my mother Hades!\u201d He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades didn't seem to be put off by anything though. He merely leaned back in his throne, holding up on hand with a glowing orb. \u201cOh, you mean her?\u201d He asked, loosing a golden fire ball at the steps of his throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Jackson appeared in the explosion, frozen it time. The pain of the minotaur crushing her body was etched onto her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I took her Perseus Jackson.\u201d Hades growled out his name like it disgusted him. \u201cJust as I said I did. I knew you would come to bargain for her soul. Return my helm to me, and she will be free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy growled, the eyes on the gauntlets focusing angrily on him. Percy's anger fueled them, and they wanted to feed on this gods power. \u201cWe don't have your helm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPity.\u201d Hades said, Sally disappearing as he held up a golden orb again. \u201cPerhaps I should just crush her, be done with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy snarled. He really didn't want to do this. \u201cWait just a damned minute Hades.\u201d Percy said, reaching behind him and Grabbing the Di Angelo children. \u201cYou wouldn't risk the lives of your children, now would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades stiffened. \u201cWhat?\u201d He asked, looking at the children in Percy's grasp. His eyes widened. \u201cHow- No. It must be another trick.\u201d He said, glaring at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWilling to bet?\u201d Percy asked, putting the smallest amount of pressure on Nico's arm. \u201cSorry about this.\u201d Percy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! Ow ow ow ow!\u201d Nico cried, the finger spikes digging into his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca looked up at him with horror etched into her features. She tried to tear from his grasp, but his grip was too strong. \u201cHey! Let go of him!\u201d She said, trying to hit Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she did was bruise her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't make me do this Uncle.\u201d Percy said, slowly increasing the pressure on Nico's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! Stop it Percy!\u201d Nico said, blood starting to seep through his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Hades roared, making the room shake. He appeared in front of Percy, fist already flying at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy held fast, letting Hades's fist connect with his face. He didn't even budge, nor did he let go of the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour move, Uncle.\u201d Percy said, his voice sounding metallic in his helmet. \u201cEither you agree to talk civilly, or you lose a child. And don't try to destroy my mothers soul. Don't try to bargain, don't try to weasel your way out of it. Just... talk.\u201d He said, trying to calm himself. \u201cAnd trust me, it won't leave you empty handed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades growled, the dead taking aim at Percy. He didn't understand why he couldn't hurt the child of Poseidon. He didn't understand how Percy could know that he had children, nor where they were. He couldn't fathom how much he didn't know, nor how little power he held in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades was at a disadvantage.</span></div></div>",

He had so precious few, even before the pact of the big three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d He said, though it wasn't hard to hear the dissatisfaction in his voice. \u201cI will hear what you have to say, child of Poseidon. Just please, do not hurt my children anymore.\u201d He said, looking down at them with a look of fatherly worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you hold your end of the bargain, Uncle.\u201d Percy said, pulling his fingers out of Nico's shoulder. He gently pushed the boy back to Annabeth, who began to wrap up the wounds and gave the boy some ambrosia. \u201cShall we begin the 'negotiations'?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is as good a place as any.\u201d Hades said, sitting on his throne. He gestured to the guards, signaling them to leave. They saluted, sinking into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cIt's going to take a while, so I've got a little help to keep Zeus and Poseidon from starting the war while we talk.\u201d Percy said, as three familiar women in white dresses appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd who are these?\u201d He asked, genuinely curious as to who could freely enter his domain, and more importantly, his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You should know us well, Hades.' One said, her black eyes glinting with mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. Do you not remember how we helped during the gigantomachy?' Another chided, fiery eyes twinkling knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or perhaps how even you cannot fight our power?' The last asked teasingly, her golden eyes focused on Hades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Moirae?\u201d Hades said, questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it one Hades.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, it is us.' Atropos said, moving to sit at a long obsidian table that appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We shall be... mediators, of sorts.' Clotho said, sitting next to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And time outside this room is currently on hold. We believe Percy has a tale to tell.' Lachesis said, sitting on Atropos's other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd negotiations.\u201d Percy reminded, sitting at the opposite end away from Hades. He wasn't actually sitting, per say. But it was more a relaxed slouch then anything else. It was as if he knew exactly what he was doing. As if he knew Hades couldn't touch him. It didn't even look uncomfortable in his armor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never let go of Bianca either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet my daughter go.\u201d Hades growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Mother then. I won't let you hold the cards, Hades.\u201d Percy said, trying to keep a calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades glared, but a snap of his fingers and Sally's soul orb was in Percy's hand, claws still stained with Nico's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Percy said, releasing Bianca. She immediately ran over to Nico, whose wounds from Percy were just starting to heal. \u201cLook Hades, I'm going to get right down to business. The tale can wait until the end. You don't like either of your brothers, I don't like my dad or Zeus. The Fates want me to take them out. They say it's time for a change in regime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades eyebrow rose. \u201cReally?\u201d He asked, looking at the Fates for confirmation. \u201cDo tell then. Do tell.\u201d He said, leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smirked, not that anyone could see it. 'Hook, line and sinker.' \u201cI'll level with you Hades. There will be a war soon. Kronos will rise, and so will the other titans. Make no mistake, they will come back. Zeus won't listen to reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades snorted. \u201cNaturally. Zeus always was arrogant. Even though we worked equally, he always tried to take the credit for all out achievements when we did work together. Father, Typhon. It didn't matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cRight, that's another problem. Typhon will rise again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Hades shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don't worry, he will be put down. For good this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Hades asked. \u201cHow will the greatest threat to us gods 'be put down?'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatience, Uncle. It will be told soon enough.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know these things?\u201d Hades asked. \u201cSurely the Moirae haven't given you knowledge of what is going to happen?\u201d He asked, the three shaking their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, it is not us who gave him knowledge.' Clotho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, knowledge need not be given if it has already been learned.' Lachesis added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The knowledge is his, though it has not yet come to pass.' Atropos stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now Ladies.\u201d Percy said, chiding them for their cryptic ways. \u201cWhat they mean to say is that I've already lived through this once. Time travel, if you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades scoffed. \u201cPlease. You expect me to believe something as stupid as that? I'm a god, boy. I know for fact that time travel is impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot when Kronos's energy is in flux, and another source of powerful energy connects with it.\u201d Percy countered. \u201cIt ripped open a hole in the space-time continuum, with me right at the epicenter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's true, before you accuse him.' Lachesis threw her two sense in, silencing Hades accusation of lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Hades said, though not with a grumble. \u201cThat would explain the knowledge about where my children were kept hidden from my brother, among other things. But that still doesn't explain the outsider.\u201d He said, looking at Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, once again the tale will explain.\u201d Percy said. \u201cWe're getting off topic. I want an alliance. Not between you and my father, but between you and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades scoffed again. \u201cWhy should I ally with you, demigod?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hades could feel a hand on his throat, crushing it. He could feel his godly energy being drained, his very being unraveling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Percy said, glowing eyes Narrowed as Hades started struggling for breath. Which was odd, since air was something that gods didn't need. \u201cIf you don't, I will kill you and take command over the dead. I will take your spot as lord of the dead, and I will make sure you know it as you die. Everything you held dear would fall to my command. Persephone, your children. Every. Single thing. And make no mistake, I can and will do it, if you force me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suddenly as it appeared, the pressure on his throat vanished, Percy back in his spot as if he didn't move. \u201cBut I'll be honest here. You're one of my favorite gods. At least you can hold your promises. Though I have no doubt that is because Styx was always so close, keeping an eye on you. You actually seem to care for your family, even if you're willing to play chess master to try and give them the roll in the great prophecy. You are somewhat above petty squabbles, since I know you would ride to your families help if they truly needed it, despite everything they've done to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat they've done to me hardly counts at 'petty.'\u201d Hades snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it isn't. Killing the woman you love, and trying to kill your children when they were still young? No, that's not petty at all. Ostracized you for being lord of the dead? No, that's not petty either. That's borderline hate right there.\u201d Percy admitted. \u201cBut their time has come, Uncle. Olympus will change. One way or another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou speak like a mad man, Jackson.\u201d Hades said. \u201cHow I would love to see my brothers taken down a notch or twenty, I have no real desire to see Olympus fall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho ever said it would fall?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cI said it would change. Zeus will likely die, as will my father. Zeus will never take this laying down, and I will take my father down for... Personal reasons.\u201d Percy said, dodging around his reasons for killing Poseidon. \u201cEither way, Olympus would retain the other gods, barring them trying to keep Zeus in power through any means necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do I know you won't turn on me?\u201d Hades asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA justified question, I'll admit.\u201d Percy said, his voice laden with amusement. \u201cSimply put, you don't cross me. You don't betray me, and I don't turn my sights on you. If you do that, you can live freely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades crossed his arms, looking at Percy. \u201cOther then that, what would I get out of this?\u201d He asked, not entirely sure whether or not to buy his Nephew's claims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smirked again. \u201cWell, how does respect among your fellow gods sound? Free reign to go where you want to go without fear of provoking a war if you so much as look outside the underworld?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cI'd also be willing to lend a hand in keeping the underworld secure, due to... my own workforce, I guess you could call it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork force?\u201d Hades asked, eyebrow raised again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's still part of the story. Though I think it is time to tell the tale.\u201d Percy said. \u201cOtherwise, you would not give thought to my claims. Best settle down and get comfy. It is quite the tale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere to begin...\u201d Percy mused, tapping a clawed finger on a chin, hidden in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why not the beginning, Perseus?' Clotho asked, looking directly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, after the defeat of Kronos.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould be a good place as any to start.\u201d Percy said, his armor clanking as he shrugged. \u201cWell, it all started in the throne room of Olympus...\u201d</span></div></div>",

In a flash of light, the Eronomicon appeared in his hand. It appeared to be a large, worn tome. Nothing special about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at it, disbelief in his eyes. He looked at Percy. \u201cAnd you say that behind you are not only Echidna, but also the Chimera and Cerberus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Hades.\u201d Percy said, sighing. He thought he made that perfectly clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you honestly expect me to believe that you have gotten Athena to pledge herself to you, along with other outrageous claims?\u201d Hades asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. And I have. I've also got your Furies at my command, if you recall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Hades said, looking as calm as could be. \u201cOf course, cannot forget that. Taking my most loyal servants, ones who I considered my second in command during my short absences.\u201d Hades laughed bitterly. \u201cCan't forget that, now can I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared at Percy, his eyes glowing black. \u201cWhat made you think you had the right to do that?\u201d Hades growled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged again, his armor clanking. \u201cYou tell me. The leader, Alecto I think, pissed me off. She said that you would, and I quote, 'Use my mother like a toy, and they would force me to watch.' End quote.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades growled again, though this time at the Furies. \u201cDamn it! I'm not like my brothers, and they know this.\u201d Hades said. \u201cVery well, I'll forgive it this time. If I was in your position, I would likely have done the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you see things my way Uncle.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you also expect me to believe you killed gods?

I will help you change Olympus, Perseus Jackson.\u201d Hades said, standing up. \u201cFuture... Harem god.\u201d He said, the title feeling strange on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled at his Uncle, though it was unseen. \u201cGlad that you did. Honestly, you and Hestia are my favorite gods. Would hate to have to get rid of one of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else could I say to one who has bedded the Moirae?\u201d Hades asked. He was still in shock about that, and only the Fates made him believe. \u201cI would be a fool to go against the only person they favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are no fool.\u201d Percy said. \u201cThis proves it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally, this would be the time to say something like 'We shall see.'\u201d Hades said. \u201cBut I highly doubt that you could disappoint.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would hope not.\u201d Percy said, nodding. \u201cNow, I believe we should get to business at hand. Outside this room, Zeus and Poseidon are about to go to war. Ares has your helm. I'm going to head up with my group, and I'm going to fight Ares. Send the Furies up there ASAP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what of my children?\u201d Hades asked, looking at Nico and Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want them to stay here?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cYou could train them in their powers, make them stronger then the camp ever could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades nodded, thinking. \u201cYes, that does seem like a sound plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen they'll stay. Just try and send them up to camp every once in a while. I can take them to explore the world and learn how well they trained. Besides, I don't think you would be breaking any sort of cosmic laws or any other crap like that.\u201d Percy said, standing up. \u201cIf you are, just have some ghosts train them. Just keep them away from Minos. He'll try to manipulate them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades growled again. \u201cFoolish ghost. If he tries anything he'll be sent so deep into the fields of punishment that he'll wish he were in Tartarus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don't jump the gun and punish him for something he may do.\u201d Percy warned. He walked back to Nico and Bianca, the latter glaring at him while Nico flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy knelt down, looking into Nico's eyes. \u201cI'm sorry Nico. I didn't want to hurt you. But you see this?\u201d He asked, holding his mothers soul orb up. \u201cThis is my mother. Your father held her captive, due to a misunderstanding. I had nothing to bargain with that I could stand to lose. So I had to use both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis helmet disappeared, showing his eyes. They were hard, but had a certain softness to them. \u201cI'm sorry that I had to do that. I'll understand if you both resent me for that.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut at least I brought you to your dad, didn't I?\u201d He said, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-where are you going?\u201d Bianca asked, looking up at him as his helmet appeared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going up top. Got to fight our cousin. You two are staying down here, to learn how to use your powers. And, hopefully, to bond with your dad.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Hades called, making Percy look back at him. \u201cWhat about security? If Cerberus won't be here anymore, who will help guard the underworld?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said she would be leaving.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI'd be willing to let her stay, if you actually take care of her this time. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, but at least let her have a few breaks for play time. I'm sure she would love to play fetch still.\u201d He said, looking right at Cerberus, her triangular ears perked. \u201cRight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlay! Fetch!\u201d She said, her playful personality showing, her bluish eyes sparkling at the prospect of playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cBut I'll also supply some of my more powerful wraiths. Good thing about them compared to this world is that they don't complain. They just follow orders.\u201d Percy said, snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, several skeletons shot up from the ground. They looked like Hades undead servants, but they only wore armor. Said armor was rusted, with blood stains and gaping holes in the armor. It only carried a sword, looking like basic infantry for an old army, before guns. It was a nasty looking cleaver, also rusted and stained with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one was almost the same as the first, but it wore heavier armor that was less damaged, as well as a helmet. It carried an even bigger sword then the infantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third one was dressed in lighter armor then the bulky one, but more then the first one. It held a musket, seemingly made of hollowed out bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one was drastically different. It had a robe, and wielded a scythe. It looked like the typical grim reaper. It's skull showed under the hood, bleached bones spattered with blood. It's grin seemed very... off, unlike a normal skeletal grin. It screamed insanity in the dead being. Even it's eyes followed suit, the empty sockets somehow shining with insane glee. The weapon it held was jagged, and it's bony fingers held it with intent to use it on anything they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou four will grab the strongest under your command.\u201d Percy said, already delegating orders. It wouldn't do anything to greet them with any pleasantries. \u201cYou will be stationed here. Reapers will take the fields of Punishment. Go.\u201d He ordered. The robed one bowed, bones rattling as he sank back into the ground. Even that sounded like insane laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe rest of you will provided security where it is needed. Commanders will have platoons of twenty skeletons each, and you will regularly patrol the underworld looking for souls trying to escape, and trouble makers. You are by no means to enter Elysium, under no circumstances at all. Go\u201d He ordered. The sword baring skeletons bowed, jamming their swords into the ground as they did so. They too sunk into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the musketeers will provide extra support at the gates. You will watch for runners, and shoot to capture. Now go.\u201d Percy said, dismissing the final skeleton. It raised the musket high up in the air as it sank into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was looking at what Percy did, even the Fates and Hades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, how-\u201d Annabeth started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter I killed the Forgotten god, the dead pledged to serve me. Simple as that.\u201d Percy said. \u201cThe dead come from that world, so don't worry. And, even as we speak, more and more people die of natural causes. I gave strict orders for Rose, Velvet or Jewel to not attack anyone. Collect taxes, yes, but no killing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone just... nodded. They really couldn't do anything else. Well, Annabeth, Grover, Nico, Bianca, Hades and the Fates did. The others didn't care if Percy had done that.</span></div></div>",

Expect some trouble up on Olympus soon. I intend to shake things up.\u201d Percy said, vanishing, along with almost everyone in the chamber.

You're getting my helm back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid Perseus Jackson have it?\u201d She asked, almost wanting him to have done it.

He would be having a talk with her and her sisters. But right now, he had more important things to do. \u201cCome here, children.\u201d He said, eyes softening as he looked upon the last two children he ever had. He stood up, shrinking to a normal size for a mortal man. \u201cLet your father hug you.\u201d He said, a few tears gathering in his eyes as he knelt down, arms wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ On the surface<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Co appeared on the beach of Santa Monica. Echidna ran off towards the city, Medusa, Pe\u00edsma and the Chimera following effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked down the beach, seeing Ares leaning on his bike, aluminum bat propped on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he still hadn't changed out of that stupid ass biker outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey little cuz.\u201d He said as Percy walked to him. \u201cNice armor. Been hitting the steroids?\u201d He asked, before looking at the women following Percy. He grinned lecherously, wolf whistling at them. \u201cHey babes! Want a ride?\u201d He asked, not referring to his motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStuff it Ares.\u201d Percy said, glaring dangerously at Ares. \u201cGive me Hades Helm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres glared at Percy for trying to interrupt his attempts to woo several woman at once. \u201cFuck you Jackson. You were supposed to die down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smirked. \u201cYeah, well, sorry for messing up your plans then you ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres growled, the sand around him turning to glass. \u201cYou little shit! You're impeding the war effort here. You were supposed to die down in the underworld. Old Seaweed would have been mad at Hades for offing you. Hades would have had the Master bolt, so Dear old dad would have been pissed at him. And Corpse Breath would have been mad at both of them because he doesn't know who stole his helm.\u201d He said. \u201cThough I don't know how you knew I had the helm.\u201d He said, taking a ski mask out of his pocket. He set it on his handle bars, making it turn into an elaborate bronze helm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well I don't give a damn what you planned you fuck.\u201d Percy said, walking towards him, Grover behind him. \u201cWhat I care about is kicking your ass. I know you won't give me the helm. Oh, and Phosphora is pissed at you for tampering with her home.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhosphora?\u201d Ares asked. \u201cDon't know who that is, but she sounds hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh she's hot alright.\u201d Percy said, vanishing for a second, reappearing with the master bolt sheath. \u201cHot enough to glass half the continent, at least.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ares asked, obviously not understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's the master bolt you moron!\u201d Percy said. \u201cShe wants to fry you personally for messing with the magic of the sheath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres growled. \u201cCall me a moron one more time Jackson.\u201d He said, his glasses melting. \u201cI dare ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoron. Fool. Idiot. Retarded monkey. Fucking stupid.\u201d Percy said. \u201cGonna do something about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more sand turned to glass around Ares, the air getting hotter and hotter. Several feet away, a surf board stuck in the sand burst into flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boar erupted from beneath the glass, sending shards of it everywhere, some bouncing off of Percy's armor. Grover was safely behind Percy, so he wouldn't get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's your target Grover. You deal with the boar, and I'll mess with Ares. I believe in you G-man.\u201d Percy said, running at Ares, leaving Grover to fend for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy vaulted over the giant boar, stomping the glass back into sand as he landed. The boar didn't stop charging, going right for Grover. \u201cScrew you Percy!\u201d He yelled as he brought out his new pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres smirked at Percy. \u201cGoing to leave your friend to die?\u201d He asked tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI know that Grover can beat that undercooked barbeque easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I'm surprised.\u201d Ares admitted, his atomic explosions for eyes glaring heatedly at Percy. \u201cHow are you staying alive when you're so close to me? Right now you should be cooked in that tin can. Like a tuna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot has changed Ares.\u201d Percy said, circling Ares as he took out the master bolt and Riptide. \u201cEverything as you know it will never be the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres snorted, not unlike a bull or ram. \u201cPlease. You expect me to fear you?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would do well to fear me, Ares.\u201d Percy said, hearing as Grover started playing his pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! That's a good one.\u201d Ares said, slapping his leg as he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to have a fist meet his face, breaking his nose as he went flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres screamed in pain, holding his nose, golden Ichor spilling down his face. \u201cWhat the Fuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared over Ares, stepping on him with one foot. He slowly applied pressure, breaking ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFear me now Ares?\u201d Percy asked, narrowing his poisonous eyes. He held the Master bolt to Ares's throat, sparks arching to the god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even the smallest bit.\u201d Ares aid, holding his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Ares turned, hearing a pig squealing in pain. Grover was playing his pipes rapidly, large amounts of seaweed strangling the large boar, one of its legs broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Go Grover!\u201d Percy yelled, cheering his friend on. He felt his foot heating up, as Light started shining below him. \u201cGrover! Glasses!\u201d Percy yelled, getting a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked down, at the glowing, golden Ares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou damn demigod! Why won't you just die!\u201d Ares roared, grabbing Percy's leg in an effort to throw him.</span></div></div>",

The war god now stood taller then Percy, at least eight feet tall. His clothes had turned to gleaming Bronze Armor, the bat having turned into a sword in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres got up, using a knee to help him stand. \u201cFine.\u201d He said, still holding his nose. \u201cI'll just have to beat you to a bloody puddle then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy scoffed. \u201cGood luck with that. One more hit and you'll be running to Olympus begging for someone to heal you.\u201d He said. \u201cWell, if I let you go, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you could beat me.\u201d Ares said, cracking his nose into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at yourself Ares.\u201d Percy said, still holding the master bolt and Riptide. \u201cIf you can't tell, I can look at your godly form. I'm not dead, so that should tell you something. And not only am I kicking your ass, but I'm doing so with no effort. Grover took care of your little pet, which you were cowardly enough to use in the first place. Face it. You lose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never lose!\u201d Ares roared, getting to his feet and charging at Percy, attempting to skewer him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cPhosphora, would you mind?\u201d He asked, holding the Master bolt aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres charged blindly, heedless of the danger. All he wanted was Percy's head hanging above his fireplace. Speaking of which, he would have to get a fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to get the biggest shock of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres went flying back, twitching as smoke rose from his blackened body. His armor was melted, his skin was scorched, charred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he hit the ground, he could do nothing but lay there. He couldn't even scream, as he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres let his golden form go. Well, it was more like he didn't have the energy to keep it up any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres opened his eyes, painful as even that was. He couldn't hear anything, and he wanted to know when Jackson was coming to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to see large, towering walls of water on every side of him, trying to crash down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ares could speak, he would have said something along the lines of 'Fuck my life.' as Percy appeared above him, both weapon poised at his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see now Ares?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cHow powerless you are to fight me? And it's not even because of the master bolt that I won. No, that was only Phosphora's revenge. I could have done so much worse. Taken your immortality, ripped out your immortal soul, or any number of things really. I could have stolen every single memory you ever had, leaving you as helpless as a newborn baby. But I didn't.\u201d Percy said, calming himself. \u201cYou are weak Ares. Always have been, always will be. Despite being the god of war, you never could take pain. You never planned anything. The only thing you had was strength. That alone makes you weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy put riptide away, capping it with one hand. He lifted the master bolt away from Ares, wondering what he should do with the god now. He'd broken Ares, he knew. But should he kill him the literal way, or the metaphorical way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, Percy would take his power fully, and his title as god of war, along with everything Ares claimed was his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other, Percy would have another ally against Olympus. It would also Change the status quo, though he wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions.</span></div></div>",

Gender change, level one, version one.\u201d He said, light shooting up from the leather pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pulled his hand back out, holding a glowing... energy. It couldn't be described, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held it up to his face, whispering words into it. Not English either, though that would have sufficed. Nor was it Latin, though that would have also sufficed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Percy whispered in a language that the people of this world could not describe. It wouldn't drive them mad, as some languages he knew. But it would probably knock them out as their brains tried to comprehend the tongue that he spoke. And really, that was a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he was speaking a language that worked best for certain types of magic, such as the one he was currently using now. A language of complete change and magic. One that any who could use would have to tread carefully, and speak softly. It was a powerful language, that could do many things when used in whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Percy was currently using it to empower the spell in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing. Percy had learned how to take the pure form of magic from spells, incantations and the like. That, coupled with the boots enhancing any and all thief like skills he might pick up during his immortal life, allowed him to steal the magic energy that anyone used against him. Useful didn't begin to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous overlord learned that the hard way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, holding the raw energy of magic also had other uses, as well. It was more powerful then the 'refined' magic that almost every mortal and most godly beings used, if harder to control. But that also allowed many previous rules to be circumvented, with the right preparation, and normal limits of magic to be easily passed. Combined with the language he was using...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's just say that not even Ares would remember being, well, him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy ceased his whispering, holding the, now wild, energy in his hands. It was kept firmly in his grasp though, no chance of it escaping. He flicked it at the charred, broken body of Ares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, but not yet instantly, the energy engulfed the broken god, shielding what was happening from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy ignored that though, knowing it would take some time, and the bodily damage would need to be repaired still. He held up the Master bolt, looking directly at it. \u201cSee? Told you I would be able to handle you soon Enough Phosphora. And I delivered as promised, frying the war god. Now, just a little demonstration for Zeus, and we should be good. Might involve even more time travel, but that hardly phases me anymore.\u201d He said, knowing he couldn't hear the female personification of the most powerful weapon in the world. \u201cBetter get you back to you home, and bring Ares back up top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, everything in that area that didn't belong there was gone, the waters crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy reappeared back on the beach, Master bolt and Ares in hand. Metaphorically for Ares, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover was standing next to a large pile of monster dust, a strange seaweed sculpture growing from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! How'd it go?\u201d Percy asked, making Grover look up from his pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover shrugged. \u201cBetter then I thought it would. The boar didn't land a single hit. What about you?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I've got fried War god. I think I broke Ares, showing him that he wasn't as bad as he thinks he is.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kill him?\u201d Grover asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. Something in my mind I consider far worse. Remember when you joked about waking up as a girl?\u201d Percy asked. Man, did that feel so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover went wide eyed. \u201cYou didn't...\u201d He said, making Percy jerk a thumb at the glowing form of Ares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's happening right now. I figured another ally would do us good.\u201d Percy said. \u201cAnd don't worry. I only use that when I think someone truly deserves it. You're not losing your manhood, unless you do something absolutely horrible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarning taken.\u201d Grover said, covering his groin. \u201cSo, what's going to happen to hi- er, her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, don't really know. When Ares goes female, he's not going to remember ever being male in the first place. The new woman will probably still have the same personality, but she'll rewrite her own history in her head. That much I do know. But I'll be able to do something if she tries to do anything funny.\u201d Percy said, with a shrug. \u201cAnyway, I'm going to go get the Sheath for Phosphora, grab Annabeth, Melum and Styx, and we can leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Echidna?\u201d Grover asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe'll meet us at camp in a few weeks.\u201d Percy said. \u201cShe's going to help train the campers for war. I might pop in to grab Medusa though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover nodded. He didn't want to know why Percy would grab Medusa, his Satyr mind instantly going the route into the gutter. But, Grover had some inkling that sexual reasons might not have been the only thing Percy had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy vanished, reappearing a few moments later with Melum, Annabeth and Styx. The Master bolt was nowhere to be seen, though Percy was wearing the backpack. \u201cNow everyone come on. I'm going to drop everyone off at Camp. Annabeth, I want you to ask Chiron to heal up our new ally. Nectar and ambrosia, lots of it. Melum, I want you to take control of the minions and make sure they aren't running rampant. Styx, you'll stick with me. We'll be heading up to Olympus together. You can chew out Zeus and My father then.\u201d He said, taking total command. \u201cAny objections?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe received a raised eyebrow from Grover, as if thinking 'You really think I'm going to object?' Otherwise no one objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo? Alright then.\u201d Percy said, as the scenery shifted around them. \u201cCamp Half-blood. Annabeth, I'll take my mother's soul now.\u201d Percy said, eerily calm about the subject matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth carefully handed the golden fire to Percy, which he in turn held with an even greater care. He looked down at the small, flickering flame, a great happiness shining in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was also... indecisiveness. He seemed to be deep in thought about something important, looking at that fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, the sound of cheers and shouts sounded. This was enough to bring him from his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone, put that,\u201d He said, pointing at the energy cocoon on the floor. \u201cOn the bed. That would be the minions, making all that noise. Someone go make sure they haven't started a bonfire made of the campers or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I thought you said you quelled their destructive nature?\u201d Annabeth said, looking at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, given how many magical items are here, I don't know. Makes them crazy, and monstrous, when they come into contact with magic that isn't my own, or the tower heart's.\u201d He said. \u201cHaven't learned how to control that yet. And until I have them attuned to more magic through the tower heart, specifically the magic of this universe, it will be a hazard to leave them unsupervised for much longer. Who knows what the mist could do to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum nodded. \u201cAs you wish it, Master, it shall be done.\u201d She said, quickly leaving through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover looked away for a second, hearing what sounded like a scream. When he looked back at where Percy had been, the demi/semi god was already gone.</span></div></div>",

Every time he had been here, he was in a life-threatening situation. Mostly from the gods, wondering if they should just kill him for being the child of Poseidon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArguing from the top of the floating mountain peak could be heard, even down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cWe better go. It seems that the gods are about to go to war.\u201d He said to Styx. He followed, his armored boots making loud clanking sounds as he walked up Olympus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed, Nymphs and Satyrs hid from his intimidating presence. But Percy knew they were there. Well, the Nymphs at least. But he knew that where Nymphs were, Satyrs were never far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he and his companion trudged farther up the mountain, the arguing got louder, and the residents of Olympus seemed more on edge. Like they were waiting for the inevitable to happen, they just didn't know when it would explode into all-out war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long, maybe half an hour or so, to reach the summit. Percy was able to make out the words clearly now... well, he had back done there, but now it was even clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all noise ceased as his boots clanged on the steps, echoing throughout the large throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Percy stepped into sight of the gods, all eyes turned towards him. Even Hestia, who was tending her hearth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a uneasy silence, as the gods were wondering who the armored figure was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus in his pinstriped suit, sitting on his throne of pure platinum, narrowed his eyes at Percy. \u201cWho are you, who would walk into the throne room of the gods?\u201d He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone who just did you a favor.\u201d Percy said, holding up the backpack. \u201cCatch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he flung the backpack across the room, directly at Zeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus caught it, looking at it with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, open it!\u201d Percy said. Did someone really have to explain things, simple things, to Zeus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, normally Zeus, or any of the gods currently there, though Ares did go missing, would have killed the man who dared talk down to them, but they were Curious. What could the man be? He didn't seem to have the power of a god, but he seemed utterly unconcerned about where he was. What could he have brought for Zeus? And who was the woman behind him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus unzipped the backpack, looking in. The only sign of him being surprised was the slight widening of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone, save for Poseidon, leave.\u201d Zeus commanded. \u201cNow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gods looked at one another, before they all vanished. Something was happening, but their king had commanded them away. Even Hestia left her hearth, the fire seeming less welcoming as it crackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus pulled the Master bolt from the backpack, no longer the cylinder capped with bronze. It was a twenty foot javelin of pure lighting, making the air in the throne room charged with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus looked at Percy again. \u201cI'll ask you again. Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy lifted his helmet off, his face hard as he looked at both Zeus and his Father. \u201cI am Perseus Jackson. The one you falsely accused of stealing your bolt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus bristled. \u201cI accuse those who are guilty, boy.\u201d He said, looking down on Percy, even from across the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I am here to say that I am not guilty.\u201d Percy shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus was about to retort, likely with a barrage of lighting bolts following his words, but Poseidon spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell us your story, boy.\u201d The god of the sea said. \u201cI would like to know why my son looks like a trained warrior.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would still claim him then?\u201d Zeus asked, looking at his brother. \u201cYou would claim to have sired a child against our sacred oaths?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman next to Percy bristled, about to say something, but Percy held up a hand to calm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've admitted to my wrong doing. Now I think we should hear him speak.\u201d Poseidon said, looking back at Percy. It was not unnoticed that both gods stole glances at Styx, eying her like meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Percy told them a little about what had happened. Most of it lies, or at least half-truths. Lies about Melum entirely, such as her being a goddess from before Gaea's time. As such, he was her only connection to the world that kept her from fading (Not entirely untrue, thinking back on it.) She had helped train him, singing so beautifully that time halted in it's flow to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could see their minds working to think about wooing the goddess, but only for her power. It disgusted Percy. He may have been Lust incarnate, a womanizer and the Overlord of evil... but even he still had standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, he told them about his quest, the dreams he remembered having (Another thing the Eronomicon improved, his memory) about Kronos (Without naming the titan lord of course), Ares Betrayal (Only the fight with him, not what had happened to the war god after) and all that. He held back certain topics, such as anything having to do with the Eronomicon, his various relationship's, the servitude of Athena, Medusa or the deal with Hades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus scratched his beard, flakes of electricity sparking out of it. \u201cI sense he tells the truth. That would also explain why Ares left on his own during the... meeting...\u201d He said, looking side-long at his brother. \u201cBut these dreams...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus and Poseidon spoke quickly, in ancient Greek. Percy didn't bother listening in. He knew Zeus would deny it being his Father, rising again from the deepest pits of Tartarus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus held up his hand angrily. \u201cWe will speak of this no more.\u201d He said, standing up. \u201cI shall go to purify this in the waters of Lemnos. That should cleanse the human taint.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy scoffed. 'Human taint... please. He's just being all high and mighty about being a god again. It's not like it's corrupted or anything.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Lord Zeus.\u201d Percy said, trying to be civil with an extremely uncivil person. \u201cI've also brought someone else here, as you can see.\u201d Percy said, motioning to Styx. \u201cShe would like to talk with you, both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx glared at both of the gods, making them shudder for an unknown reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd... who may that be?\u201d Poseidon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx scoffed loudly. \u201cWell, I'm surprised that you don't remember me. You always use my name, but never actually hold to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded to the three of them. \u201cI'll leave you to it.\u201d He said, before looking straight at Styx. \u201cYou're welcome to come by my house when you're done here. I'll try and air out the garbage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Percy turned to walk away. He was barely down the steps when Styx began chewing the gods out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt brought a smile to Percy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the small orb in his hands again. He remembered having the same choice, long ago. At camp, with Clarisse. But now, with his own mother, he had little idea of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he include her into his Harem? Would that be another great betrayal, Like Thalia? To manipulate her so? Had she heard everything he had spoken of with Hades? Was she aware of what he was doing now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. Too many thoughts. This wasn't something he could just ask her though. But the more important question plaguing his mind was if she were in a similar situation like Medusa. He didn't know. But if she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd be the True god of the Sea far sooner then planned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked down the path to the elevator, ignoring the now more active residents of the mountain. They sensed that whatever problem was brewing with the twelve major gods was quelled, for now. They hadn't heard about the master bolt being stolen. No, Zeus wouldn't allow that knowledge to go free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weaker beings still coward at his mere presence, hiding as he passed. He had put his helmet back on as he left the throne room, so no one could see his face. His cape bellowed in the wind, striking an imposing figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy smirked again. 'Phosphora will stick to the plan, I hope. Just a few years, until the end of this damned war. Then she can be free of Zeus.' He thought. 'As will we all.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at the ball of flame in his hands, his mothers soul. \u201cWell, time to get you home...\u201d He said, vanishing in front of the elevator.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't even felt his presence. \u201cWhoa, it's just me.\u201d He said, putting a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa calmed, hearing his voice and feeling his touch. \u201cOh, Percy.\u201d She said, placing a hand on her heart. \u201cYou scared the life out of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Percy said, pulling her into a hug. \u201cI was wondering if you minded coming along to my old house. Help me with something...\u201d He said, holding her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sighed happily, melting into his arms. \u201cAnything. You know that.\u201d She said, before looking up at him. \u201cBut why didn't you just keep me around then?\u201d She asked, taking note he was out of armor now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I didn't want my Father figuring out who you are.\u201d Percy said, sitting in a chair, never letting go of Medusa. \u201cThis is a nice hotel you got here.\u201d He said, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well, I didn't want to live in the back alleys. Echidna and the others may have monstrous strength,  among other attributes, but all I have is my eyes. If someone covered my eyes, I'd be powerless.\u201d She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, smoothing her hair. \u201cSo I take it that they're going to be staying in the less human friendly areas of town then.\u201d Percy stated. \u201cWell, that's fine. If that is what they want, then that's fine. I just hope that Echidna doesn't sacrifice anymore people to gather her children. But enough about that. Shall we go?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne moment, let me grab the gift you gave me.\u201d She said, prying herself from his arms. She sauntered over to the bed, hips swaying a tad more then normal. She bent down, her dress tightening around her shapely rump as she crawled onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you trying to seduce me?\u201d Percy asked, raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps...\u201d Medusa aid, wiggling her hips some more. Percy's eyes followed them, something she took pride in. \u201cIs it working?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be...\u201d Percy said, standing up. \u201cBut, unfortunately we don't have time for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa pouted. \u201cFine...\u201d She said, grabbing her new Staff off the pillows. \u201cLet's go then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have you back before long.\u201d Percy said, grabbing Medusa tightly once more. The area around them turned black, a pure void of all color's, sounds, and sensations. Everything but his body against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa shivered, pulling herself even closer to him. Whatever this place was, she didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuildings melted into existence before her eyes. It looked like a run down part of Manhattan. Even the sounds, suddenly louder then she would expect, were that of the city. A much different state of being then that black void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGabe, please. I'm tired, and I don't know what's going on.\u201d A voice said, sounding both confused and sleepy. \u201cJust... please let me go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d A nasty voice said, one that made Medusa recoil at the sound. And the stench of the place... even monsters would avoid this place like the plague. \u201cYou've been gone for a month. That means you've got a months paycheck to make up on. You will get your ass out there and work, now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy used all his self control to keep himself from going in there and killing Gabe in the most brutal way he could. It wasn't worth it, it would scare his mother back to Hades, and he didn't want anything the bastard might have had if he killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know why you called me here now.\u201d Medusa said, covering her nose. The stench from this close to the door was repugnant, and she almost lost her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, his jaw tightened so hard he couldn't speak. If his teeth were any less strong as they were, they would have broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally sighed, something that was audible from outside. \u201cYes... Okay Gabe. I'll get going then...\u201d She said, resigned to what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded at Medusa as he walked forward. It took everything he had not to bust down the door as he knocked. Cracks did erupt along the door though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Gabe said. \u201cWho the hell's banging on my door right now? Sally, get that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of footsteps, then the rattle of the door knob, and the squeaking of the hinges as it opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Jackson stopped at her doorway, looking up at Percy with very little recognition in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d She asked, stifling a yawn. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy unclenched his jaw, seeing his mother alive and well. Not just in a soul ball form either. But moving around of her own accord. \u201cIt's me mom. Percy.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked, blinking. \u201cYou must be mistaken. Percy's-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, looking at the man again. While he may not have been her little boy, she noticed that he had qualities that she figured he would have later on in life. Except for the being extremely tall part. That same unruly black hair, those same sea green eyes, that tanned skin that he always had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a long story mom...\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut first I need to do something. C'mon Em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, wha-\u201d She said, only to have Percy gently move her away, Medusa following closely behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho's at the door Sally?\u201d Gabe called, never getting up from the couch. He looked at Percy, his eyes widening. \u201cJesus fuck! Who the hell are you! Get outta my house!\u201d He said, leaping up in a surprising display of any movement at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy said nothing, walking closer to the fat bastard with a death glare. Said bastard was backing away, trudging through ankle high garbage, knocking over beer cans and all round almost failing to stay upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis man, he could never forget. A horrible person in general, even in public, his tormentor for the times he was home before his demigod life began, and worst of all in Percy's eyes, the abuser of his mother. Oh yes, that was something he never forgot. Not even before this new mess started with the Eronomicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! I-I'll call the cops!\u201d Gabe said, bumping against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy still said nothing, merely watching as Gabe slid to the floor, a slightly fouler odor emanating from the man now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d He cried, trembling. \u201cTake whatever you want! The TV, the food, my beer... My wife!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fist planted itself elbow deep in the wall above his head. Percy's eyes were glowing dangerously as the air wrapped around his other hand, a terrifyingly visible effect, causing cracks to appear mid air as he clenched it into a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPathetic.\u201d Medusa said, holding her dress up as she tried to step around any garbage. It wasn't easy in her high heels, but she made due. \u201cSuch a disgusting human is real?\u201d She asked, her amethyst orbs reflecting her disgust as she looked down at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa...\u201d Percy said, his voice deep and rumbling, completely different to his regular voice. The area around him darkened, and the armor slowly bled into existence across his body.  His eyes were turning that poisonous shade of green again, his pupils glaring, like spotlights upon Gabe Ugliano. And... was that a tremor in the wall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Gabe said, openly sobbing now. He didn't like what was happening, and it didn't seem like it would end well for him. So, he did the only thing he knew how to do with people that were better then him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeg and plead and grovel, then if he lived, curse their very names. This situation would warrant a call to the police as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! Don't hurt me!\u201d Gabe pleaded.</span></div></div>",

Think you're all high and mighty because you hit women? Threaten kids? Huh?\u201d Percy asked, lashing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it was a miracle Gabe didn't explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAH! Fuck!\u201d Gabe cried, clutching his stomach. Internal bleeding was a certainty, and unrepairable. Most likely didn't have some organs left to fix. He coughed, sending blood all over the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell guess what! That karma is a real bitch!\u201d Percy said, stomping on a knee, making Gabe cry out again. His knee caps were likely dust, the area already swelling with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere's your power now?\u201d Percy asked, roughly picking Gabe up by his tear stained shirt. \u201cWhere is it? Where's that power you loved flexing now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe just couldn't speak, and he was losing consciousness fast. He was starting to feel light headed, color draining from his face. He felt heavy... but also light. Percy's words were fading, like his vision. It was all blurring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked behind Percy, seeing something beyond his attacker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge flames rose up from nowhere, and he heard mad cackling. It was getting clearer and clearer as Percy faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked, seeing the light fade slowly from Gabe's eyes. \u201cOh no you don't.\u201d Percy whispered. \u201cMedusa, now. Do it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy dropped Gabe down, his body landing in a heap. He knelt down, moving Gabe to Face Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those flames moved closer, the last thing Gabe saw was a flash of purple before it all went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood up, looking at the grotesque statue. It wouldn't be good for anything. Maybe gravel, but even that was a stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-p-percy...\u201d Sally's voice asked, thoroughly disturbed by what she just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked back, seeing his mother looking at them with wide eyes, shaking like a leaf in the wind. Her face was pale, and her back was against the wall near the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom...\u201d Percy said. The dark aura vanished, his armor following suit. The cracks in the air disappeared. He pulled his arm from the wall, part of the dry wall falling on Gabe's stone body. His eyes turned back into their natural sea-green, looking at his mother with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it.' He thought, scolding himself. 'It happened again, didn't it. I blanked out. Damned rage. Damned ruthlessness! My mother shouldn't have seen that. I need to stay in control! But it's so damned hard with people who push all the wrong buttons!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy took a step forward, walking with his head hung down. He slowly walked towards his unmoving mother, not even saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, for her part, couldn't move. Her mind was trying to process what had happened. All she could do, was watch as the thing that claimed to be her son approached, shaking. Her body wanted to run, her mind agreeing, but she just couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up, keeping her eyes on the monsters face as it stood before her. It towered over her, casting a shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could think clearly, she probably would have thought something cliched. Probably along the lines of 'this is it, huh...' or 'Is this the end?' But she couldn't even think that. Not with this hulking figure looming above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry you had to see that.\u201d The monster whispered, leaning down slightly to wrap his mom in a hug. He hugged tight, picking her up off the ground. It only took a few more seconds, but she went limp in his arms. He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Medusa asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm smashing the statue.\u201d Percy said. \u201cAnd then we're torching the place. No one will think twice about it, if the supervisor knew what's happening here.\u201d He cast a look at all the trash. Even in the kitchen too, ankle high garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere will we take her?\u201d Medusa asked, looking at Percy's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCamp half-blood first, to explain things to her when she wakes up. Then, we'll see where she wants to go. I'll give her the means to do whatever she wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa nodded. She started to ask something, but she paused. Was it right to ask something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy heard her stop mid breath. He knew that sound, distinct as it was from other breaths. He knew she wanted to say something. \u201cWhat is it Medusa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa fidgeted, but opened her mouth again. \u201cWill she be... joining us?\u201d She asked, waiting for a rebuttal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know yet, Medusa.\u201d Percy said, sighing as he looked at his mothers face, ignoring the floating words above her. \u201cI don't know yet.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The sounds of sirens were already getting closer, and a large gathering of people were watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one who lived near the apartment was left inside, all part of the crowd. No one noticed how there was a part of the sidewalk that was cracked and indented, as if something had gone through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one's going to die in that fire. Good.\u201d Percy said, looking down at his mother again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose minions do a good job...\u201d Medusa said, looking at the billowing smoke. \u201cNothing in that place is going to survive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the minions can do, they're the best at. I'm still surprised that becoming what they are now had such a profound effect on them. Increased mental capabilities, durability, and aptitude for what they do. Honestly, they're probably the best army to have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa nodded. \u201cIt seems that way, if what you said during your tale is any indication. How many conquerors would beg to have an army like that. Working together perfectly, taking any orders they receive, a willingness to die for their leader...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething I try not to make them do.\u201d Percy said. \u201cWell, at least not before killing my predecessor for the title of Overlord. Didn't mind tossing them into a boiling cauldron when they were foul little imps. My armor is really useful. Extremely durable on it's own, but with certain modifications...\u201d He said, trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa rolled her eyes. \u201cYes, yes. I'd love to hear about your smithing and magical crafting prowess and all, but I think we need to get going. Your mother looks like she needs a nice bed to sleep in. And we don't want to get caught.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, shifting his mother slightly in his arms. He held her gently, wondering something once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes... perhaps that would work.\u201d He said to himself, before vanishing with Medusa from the roof top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Camp Half-Blood<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Medusa appeared in the room with the energy covered Ares. The glow was starting to die down, and the cocoon seemed thinner then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like Ares, or whatever name she gives herself, will be awakening soon.\u201d Percy said, walking to the door with Medusa following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked down a few doors, opening it to find another guest room/makeshift hospital room. Not as good as the ones in Apollo cabin, but still good for just recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering, he placed his mother on the bed. He knew from experience that they were comfy. He pulled the blanket over her, looking down at her sleeping face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa, watch over her.\u201d Percy said, making the woman nod. \u201cI'm going to go quell the situation outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knelt down, kissing his mothers forehead as he strode from the room. He stopped, just before leaving though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what it's worth Medusa, I want to thank you for everything you've done for me.\u201d Percy said, not looking back before he vanished around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa watched him go, pulling up a chair. She felt happy that he didn't just think of her as a tool, a possession. Though, she had a feeling that even if she did, she wouldn't have cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thanked her. His voice was quite sincere as well, without his special rituals or seals or whatever. He sincerely thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she still shook her head. \u201cYou fool. I can never repay you. This is the least I can do.\u201d She said, before turning her attention to the unconscious woman. She too wondered if Sally Jackson was like her, in terms of their relationship with the sea god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy threw open the front door to the Big House, taking a quick survey of what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinions, all accounted for. Campers tied up, and a large burning... something behind them. That must have been the fire he heard earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerseus Jackson!\u201d Chiron's voice called, the centaur galloping up to Percy from the forest. \u201cYou will tell me what is going on right now or-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr you'll what, Chiron?\u201d Percy asked, leveling a glare. The minions readied their weapons, ready to beat the horsey-man to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head, gesturing for the minions to stand down. \u201cSorry about that. Just had a very bad anger issue a little bit ago.\u201d He explained. \u201cBut I'll tell you what is going on in a bit. Melum! Clarrise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the two were in front of him. Neither looked winded after their dead-sprint to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse whistled upon seeing him, looking him up and down with approving eyes. \u201cNow you look like someone I could be proud to be a servant of.\u201d She said, giving him a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy and Chiron both raised eyebrows. \u201cYou're not curious as to why I look like this?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah.\u201d Clarrise said with a shrug. \u201cOne of the robed women told me that you were a powerful warrior now. Surprised they knew I was a retainer of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they can sense that type of thing. Apparently serving under me leave a mark or imprint on your soul.\u201d Percy said. \u201cAny problems Mel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess shook her head. \u201cNo. Only one camper tried to do something after most of the fighting was quelled. That was the scream you likely heard earlier.\u201d She said. \u201cHe's being taken care of right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cGood, good. Chiron, did Annabeth come see you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur blinked. When did Percy become a leader of some sort? \u201cUh, yes. She did. Asking for the ambrosia and nectar storage. She said that someone was horribly hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded again, closing his eyes. \u201cGood. We're going to need that when our special guest wakes up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron opened his mouth to speak, but Percy held up his hand. \u201cJust wait for half an hour Chiron. Once I deal with this, I have something else to deal with, then we can talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stepped up to the railing of the porch. \u201cCamp Half-blood!\u201d Percy said, calling out to the conscious campers that were tied up. He didn't know where they got the rope, but he wasn't going to call anyone out on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe war that was building on Olympus has been averted! When you are released, you will go to your cabins! Make no trouble, or there will be consequences!\u201d Percy said, before gesturing at Melum and Clarisse. \u201cStart cutting them loose. Make sure there is no trouble. If they start, break an arm or something. Make sure they don't think we're messing around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerseus,  what are yo-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not allow this camp to be torn apart Chiron. Not over petty squabbles.\u201d Percy said, interrupting the centaur.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy turned to re-enter the Big House, when pained yell and squelch sounded, reaching his ears. Percy turned around, since the pained yell was definitely one of the minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the blues had a dagger going through her heart, stabbed by the camper she had freed. It seemed to be a boy from Hermes cabin, though he didn't look like the roguish god. Probably an unclaimed kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRage boiled in Percy. No one did that to his girls! NO ONE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions around the boy were about to pounce on him, as more robed women hurried to their sister. The stabbed woman had already fallen to the ground, unmoving. She was dragged back, away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camper got up, going to run for the armory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>STOP</b>!\u201d A voice roared, shaking the ground. Everyone froze, save for the blues as they desperately tried to save their sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to Percy, who was once more clad in his armor. But it was different. It was pitch black, sucking in light, like a black hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>BROWNS! DETAIN HIM</b>!\u201d Percy shouted, again shaking the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, several of the brown-eyed women jumped on the camper, pinning him down. He tried to struggle, his demigod blood and ADHD trying to make him get up and fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked from the door, the wood cracking under his feet. The steps broke, his foot falls heavy on the wooden boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said anything, the only sounds that of Percy's armor and the campers struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the ground cracked. As he passed, the minions bowed, any who were in his way moving to the side, pulling campers out of his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing too, since Percy was causing some serious damage to the hard, packed earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Percy stood over the struggling boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold him up. I want to see him kneel.\u201d He said, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly, the minions propped the boy up, on his knees with his hands behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy crouched down, looking the boy directly in the eyes. He could see the fear, yet the sheer audacity to do what he did shown as some type of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the campers part, he would have screamed if he could. He couldn't see anything about Percy's face. It was a void, nothing but black. It didn't help that all the light around him seemed to die down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet for a bit, as Percy stared into the campers eyes without blinking, not even moving. It was like he turned into a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is she?\u201d Percy asked suddenly, making the camper flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue sighed. \u201cShe is gone, Master. Stabbed right through the heart with one of these bronze daggers. For some reason, we cannot heal it as we normally could.\u201d She said, looking sadly at the corpse of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy growled, a terrifying sound. Like a hell hound would appear and kill the camper on the spot. \u201cTake her back down the minion gate. Take her to Morticia, and have her use one of those prisoners to resurrect her. I won't be losing any of you, especially not to some upstart punk.\u201d He ordered, making the blue nod. The robed ones picked up their sibling, taking her back to the tunnels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said anything still, as Percy never took his eyes off the camper. Chiron wanted to speak, but he just... couldn't. For some reason, he just couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few more minutes before Percy spoke again. The camper was starting to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you think you are hot stuff huh?\u201d Percy asked, unnervingly calm. \u201cThink you're some big damned hero for stabbing someone who cannot defend themselves in an attempt to get away from nothing but going back to the cabins?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-W-Wha-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't talk.\u201d Percy said, still unnaturally calm voiced. Even some of the minions fidgeted at that tone. Nearly every camper already did. \u201cSo you think you're in the big leagues now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said, don't talk.\u201d Percy said again. \u201cDo you know that you killed someone who healed sick people? Dying people? Children?\u201d He asked, still calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you didn't.\u201d Percy said. \u201cMay I ask, why, you did that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-because she w-was an i-invader...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, a hand was gripping his face, hard. \u201cYou think that's an excuse do you?\u201d Percy asked, still calm. \u201cTell me, other then detain you all to keep you from fighting a pointless fight, what did any of these women do?\u201d Percy asked, gesturing to the minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-nothing...\u201d He said, his face starting to hurt very badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see. So, other then make sure you guys didn't kill each other, they did nothing wrong. And she deserved to die for that.\u201d Percy said, still that unnatural calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the laugh... oh gods, the laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started low, with no mirth or joy to it. But it was a real laugh alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laugh of insanity, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you hear that Minions?\u201d Percy asked, never halting his laughing. \u201cYou did nothing, so you deserve to die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughing grew louder. \u201cIsn't that nice? For all the trouble you went through, you have to die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughing grew louder still, and even Melum was starting to feel some type of fear, though hers was for her masters sanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the minions began to laugh, along with Percy. That same insanity tinged their otherwise normal voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood up, laughing still. \u201cIsn't that rich!\u201d He said, doubling over in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone there that wasn't a Minion was starting to feel primal fear, the insanity leaking from Percy and the minions. Whatever these women looked like, they obviously weren't human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it stopped. Everything was silent. Almost as if it was rehearsed or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't rehearsed, not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the minions looked at the lone camper, making him squirm once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy crouched again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll show you what happens when you kill a woman and I learn about it.\u201d He said calmly, as if he hadn't just had a psychotic episode of laughter. \u201cEspecially when she has done no wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camper opened his mouth to say something, but it was cut off by screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own, to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHHH!\u201d He screamed, his arm cut away from his body. Tears sprang forth, falling with no shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy picked up the appendage, holding Riptide in his other hand uncapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched as blood spurted from the campers right shoulder, tapping the ground with the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout Percy speaking, one of the scantily clad fire women walked over, placing her hand on the wound. Flames spread, cauterizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go.\u201d Percy said, offering the bloody appendage to the red. The smell of roasting flesh started to waft around the camp quickly, some campers losing their lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman brought the arm to her mouth, taking a large bite. Her surprisingly sharp teeth tore into the flesh easily, ripping it from the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chewed, giving Percy a hug before skipping away with her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy never stopped screaming either. No one could blame him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at the boys face, unmoving, unflinching. If one could see his face as of now, it would be as stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is why you do not even think of harming a woman in my presence, much less kill one.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the screaming stopped, Silenced by Riptide's edge. Instantly, everyone stopped caring about the boy. They ceased caring about Percy's actions, torturing the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood up, dusting his hands off after capping riptide once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped, shaking his head. \u201cNow, everyone, Listen carefully. When you are released, go to your cabins. Clean yourselves up. Good day.\u201d He said, walking back to the Big House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened door, he paused. \u201cChiron, please try to calm the campers now, and make them cooperate right now. Melum, you help. Minions, make sure everyone stays where they need to stay. Clarisse, please come with me.\u201d Percy said, his armor gone, having faded as he walked away from the scene of the execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was no other word for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExecution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a horrible word, for a horrible event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse only nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy felt something tap his shoulder. He looked over, seeing one of the Ninja girls/Green Minions. She pointed to the corpse, raising an eyebrow in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead. Feast, use it for a training dummy, I don't particularly care.\u201d Percy said. The ninja girl bowed, turning transparent and walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou talking to one of those sneaky bitches?\u201d Clarisse asked. Percy raised an eyebrow, turning to look at her. His eyes held a questioning gleam. \u201cWhat? They look sneaky, and they weren't too nice about stopping the fighting. Thankfully those robed ones can heal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.\u201d Percy said, turning around again. He started walking again, opening the door and entering the big house. \u201cTell me, I didn't see Castellen around. Where is he?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clarisse closed the door behind her, shrugging. \u201cDunno. I think I overheard one of the Apollo kids saying that he'd been asleep for several days. They haven't been able to figure out the reason either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stopped for a second, thinking. \u201cHmm. Must be having a very long talk with the bastard right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk? With who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind that. You did good work Clarisse. You will be rewarded nicely for that.\u201d Percy said, moving again. \u201cBut later. Right now, I have some business to attend too. And you need to meet someone, when they awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse looked at Percy with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWell, alright then. Thanks for the reward, I guess.\u201d She said. Her mind started drifting, not of its own volition, towards thoughts of what this 'reward' could possibly have been. Given her status as Percy's \u201cRetainer\u201d it was no wonder her mind drifted to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she would mind, looking at him. Percy seemed to be well built for someone who should only be twelve. Wearing armor, the blood of his enemies splattered across said armor, and being a generally imposing figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made the blood of war in her burn with passion found only in the teenaged daughters of, well, a war god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn here.\u201d Percy said, drawing her from her thoughts. He was holding open a door for her, with a strange cocoon on the bed. \u201cWait until the energy dissipates, then talk with the person. You should be able to figure out who they are soon enough. Annabeth should be back shortly with nectar and ambrosia to heal up their injuries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse nodded. \u201cAlright. I'll wait I guess. Should I be civil or what?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be cautious, but be strong. This person is more like you then you may know.\u201d Percy said, something akin to amusement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Clarisse entered, Percy closed the door, heading back to his mothers room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is she?\u201d He asked, opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill unconscious.\u201d Medusa answered from her chair. \u201cBut otherwise fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cGood. Good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked next to Medusa. He leaned down, giving her a quick kiss. \u201cThank you. I should take you back to you apartment then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa shook her head, wrapping her arms around her love. \u201cThat can wait. I would like to spend a little more time with you, if I could?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled at her. \u201cSure. No problem at all.\u201d He said, giving her another kiss. \u201cBut once I have an answer from my mother. And only if I don't find reason to immediately go to war with Olympus.\u201d He said, frowning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sighed. \u201cYou sure know how to put a damper on those warm fuzzy feelings, huh.\u201d She said. \u201cBut I understand completely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, stealing one last kiss. \u201cI'll see you in a little bit.\u201d He said, vanishing from Medusa's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa blinked. She didn't expect that. She figured he'd wait for his mother to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, sitting down. Maybe a nap wouldn't hurt for now. She had a long day so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~???~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was sitting at a table in her house. It was nothing fancy, just perfect for two people. Just perfect for her and her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet, solitary and far from the dangers of their world. Never mind Poseidon, never mind their wars, never mind horrible Gabe Ugliano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mom, I'm home!\u201d She heard Percy call, running through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was school today Percy?\u201d She asked, sipping some coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, it was okay.\u201d Percy said, entering the kitchen to grab an after school snack. \u201cHate math though. Mr. Randell's boring as all heck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally laughed. \u201cYeah, math wasn't my favorite subject either in school.\u201d She said. \u201cDid anything interesting happen today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head, sitting across from his mother. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no reason.\u201d Sally said. 'Good. That world has left us alone.' She thought, taking another sip. Only to realize she was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shrugged, standing up to get another cup of coffee. She added a bit of creamer, and a dash of sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the blue food dye. Can never forget that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally hummed as she did all this, eyes half closed at the peace of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping the side of her coffee cup with her spoon, she set it in the sink to wash later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Percy. Did you see any cute gir-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SMASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoffee washed over the tile flooring, the coffee cup shattering as it fell from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shook, her eyes wide in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere her little boy sat was a dark, imposing figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-who are you?\u201d She asked. \u201cWhat are you doing in my house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure looked around, ignoring her for a scant moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?!\u201d Sally asked again, reaching for a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this what you wished for? What you truly wanted?\u201d The figure asked, turning his eyes back to her, freezing her in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the eyes held any malice. No, they didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure stood up, a towering figure, and slowly walked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stood stock still. She couldn't have moved if she wanted too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure stood above her, looking around again. \u201cIs this what you want, mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don't know who you are, but I am not you mother.\u201d Sally said, trying her hardest to keep calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure sighed, closing his eyes. \u201cIt is understandable that you would deny me for what I look like. Would this be any better?\u201d The figure asked, armor melting away into shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, for all her fear, gasped in wonderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dark, terrible armor faded, she could see who exactly it was that wore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not so little, really. He was older. Stronger. Perhaps a little battle-weary, to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe towered over her, at seven feet tall. That swath of black hair he had hung just over his eyes, looking as if it hadn't seen a shower in weeks, if not longer. His face was clean shaven, not a hint of stubble. His eyes regarded her with warmth, though that only eased her mind slightly. His skin was tanned, like an islander or a surfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked so much like his father when her and Poseidon had been together. When she was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no mistaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her baby boy, all grown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a world where he had to fight it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world of gods and monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome, mother. Sit down.\u201d Percy said, taking his spot at the table. \u201cThere's so much we need to talk about. So much I need to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Jackson didn't move. Couldn't move. She was so busy having trouble trying to wrap her mind around what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, standing up. He walked over to his mom, grabbing her hand gently and walking her over to the table. She followed, an unconscious reaction to being pulled along, robotic. Percy gently pushed her into a chair, going to grab her another cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the mug in front of her seemed to snap Sally out of it. She looked around, blinking. This wasn't her apartment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello mom.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally jumped, looking at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy?\u201d She asked, reaching a shaking hand up to try and touch him, make sure he was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mom. It's me.\u201d Percy said, allowing her to touch his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB...But how?\u201d Sally asked. \u201cJust a few minutes ago you were my baby boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed again. \u201cI know, I know. I saw it all before I intruded on this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlace? This place? Where are we?\u201d She asked, feeling something akin to anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked around, taking in everything his eye caught. \u201cCurrently, we are in your mind. Specifically, a place your mind would go to as it tries to rationalize what happened in the real world, keeping you distracted in a fantasy to keep your mind from rejecting the work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally could only blink. Percy never talked like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimply put, we are in your minds safe room, if that makes any sense. Perhaps it is the subconscious, but I don't really know if that's the right name for it.\u201d Percy said, looking around still. \u201cAnd from the looks of it, you wished to be as far away from the world as possible. With me growing up normally, living a boring, but peaceful life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, what's going on?\u201d Sally asked, feeling confused. Her head was starting to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry to relax mom. Please. I just need to talk with you, explain what's going on in the real world. Explain what happened with... Gabe...\u201d Percy said, trying not to call the pile of rubble formerly known as Gabe Ugliano something horrible in front of his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashes in Sally's mind. Blood, Gabe being turned to stone, Gabe crying and begging...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped her head. It was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo... Percy isn't like that. My baby boy wouldn't do that.\u201d She said, her body curling up. The pain was getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, relax.\u201d Percy said, if a little forcefully. \u201cYou're going to hurt yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d She yelled, nails digging into her head. Another image, Percy hurting Gabe, beating the man senselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe might have been an inhuman monster, for a human that is, but not even he deserved that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Percy yelled, seeing blood start to trail down her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy... No... not like that...\u201d She said, trying to deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grabbed her hands, pulling them away from her head. 'Shit, this isn't good. She needs to calm down, or her mind could snap from how forcefully she rejects what happened.'</span></div></div>",

Her eyes flew open, seeing Sally as she convulsed. The previously unconscious woman's eyes were open, looking about wildly with no focus, no recognition or understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove!\u201d Percy shouted, appearing next to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going on?\u201d Medusa asked, backing both her and her chair up to give him space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer mind is falling apart. She cannot grasp the fact that I did what I did to the Bastard in front of her.\u201d He said, pulling out the Eronomicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon... C'mon...\u201d Percy said, flipping through the pages of the little pocket book. \u201cI know you would have something to do something about this. Anything would work, just let me help her Damn it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eronomicon, sensing the Marked one's desire, flipped to a page in the small form it held. It would do as the Marked one asked, but maybe not in the way he expected, but it would have to do on such short notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy glanced it over, knowing the book wouldn't lead him astray. He grit his teeth in anger, but he had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMemory Databanks!\u201d He called, furiously and desperately. The room was engulfed in a light, quite like all the other times Percy called something out from the book or used a powerful ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also an audible 'thud' signaling that something mildly heavy was called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa blinked her eyes furiously, catching Percy's silhouette furiously moving and putting something on Sally's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she could see again, Medusa saw that a strange machine was attached to Sally's head, securely despite her seizure. Blood poked it's way from her nose, slowly running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork Damn you! Work!\u201d Percy said, drawing Medusa's attention to him. The strange helmet-like machine was connected to a computer through several thick wires. The computer was on an old, but elegant desk, made of what looked like fossilized wood. Strangely enough, it didn't seem to be connected to any source of electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, what are you doing?\u201d Medusa asked, before the door burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy! What's wrong?\u201d Annabeth asked, holding a bag of Nectar that she was going to give to the new Ares. When her eyes landed on Sally, the bag dropped, spilling the food of gods on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time to explain!\u201d Percy said, watching as warning symbols flashed on the moniter, but a progress bar filled up steadily. \u201cC'mon, work.\u201d Percy said, tapping the desk with anger evident in his voice. All he could do now was wait, and watch, and hope. He couldn't think about anything else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n78%...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n85%...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n92%...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n100%...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA message popped up on the screen, though Sally did not stop having her seizure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Download complete.

No No No No NO!\u201d Percy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was by her bed in less then a second, grabbing her slowly stilling body. \u201cMom! Don't do this! Snap out of it!\u201d He said, shaking her shoulders, wiping away the blood from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~With the Chimera and Echidna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chimera was currently on the ground, roaring in pain and sadness. She felt a great ache in her heart, and sheer, icy terror pierced her brain. Both experiences were new to her, so they hit even harder, making the pain two-fold. Everyone who could hear her cry grew fearful, locking their doors. An unholy beast was prowling tonight, it seemed to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchidna, however, just knew that something was wrong. Percy was feeling incredibly distressed. She wouldn't have needed to hear her daughters cries to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, since she was not able to comfort Percy, she did the next best thing. Holding the Chimera in her arms, stroking her mane as tears flowed down her cheeks, her tail lashing out wildly. She could only hope that Percy received some comfort from it as well as the Chimera cried into her chest.</span></div></div>",

He heard a loud howling in the distance, and cries that were completely like those of a mortal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlecto!\u201d Hades called, the furry Fury appearing in a flash of fire. \u201cGo see what that noise is. I need to finish these papers up before I can spend some time with my kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fury nodded, her feminine frame covered in her usual rags of tortured souls. She needed nothing more. She bowed, leaving in another column of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ At the Gates of the Underworld<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouls backed away in sheer terror as Cerberus beat the ground, leaving craters where she hit. She howled in a fury, swatting away those who got close to contain her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the scene that Alecto and her sisters came to find, with large chunks missing from the fortress like walls that surrounded the court pavilion of the dead. She held her flaming whip aloft, barking orders at her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRestrain her! Corral the souls! Make sure that none escape!\u201d She commanded, flying at Cerberus, lashing her whip out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whip wound around the beast-woman's wrist, the flames licking at her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it would Deter the mighty Cerberus in her rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the feel of the heat, Cerberus moved quickly, mind solely focused on a new task. Her eyes switched between the red and blue/brown color violently as she darted forward, pulling the Fury along with her through the air, trampling souls that were too slow to move out of her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus ran, and ran, and ran. All the way to the river Styx. Even now, she could see the other side of the river, where Charon was lazing about again. She only saw one thing there though. A soul that just entered the lobby, waiting for passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining more speed, moving as fast as she could, Cerberus <i>leaped</i> off of the cliff overlooking the river bank, plunging into the dark waters of the river of the dead with a mighty hiss, the flames extinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~In the Lobby of the dead-sprint<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharon sat at his desk, rubbing his neck. It still hurt, even now. That godling had done a number on him alright, without any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that was worse then the time Hercules barged in here demanding Cerberus.\u201d He said, flipping through his magazine, merely looking up at the new arrival for a second in disinterest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to have it all fall apart as the wall <i>fell to pieces where his ferry was docked</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharon yelled in surprise, falling back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was just not his day. It really wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus stormed through the crowd, crushing more souls who had been waiting for their turn on the ferry, heading towards the newest arrival. Water from the river flew from her fur, hitting spirits that were out of her way, making their after-lives so much more irritable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Jackson stood there, in the lobby, holding her head. It hurt something fierce. What happened? She... didn't remember anything really. Just... the Minotaur attack... had she died from that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even notice the chaos, as she tried to puzzle out what happened. She only blinked when she felt herself being gently picked up, looking to see the face of Cerberus, who pulled her close like a teddy bear, growling at all the souls around her to back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alpha wants to protect her.' Cerberus thought, all three voices in her head saying it in unison. 'So we protect her for Alpha! Protect her from everything!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Back at the Big House<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No life signs detected. No brain activity detected. Body not fit for use as a new soul host. Please find new subject for soul copying or find a suitable body for soul imprinting.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the monitor read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked down, unblinking at the face of his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unblinking face of his mother stared back at him, but not seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dead. Pure and simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was so... so... unreal, even for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he caused it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear fell onto the cooling face of Sally Jackson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth inched closer, not sure how Percy would react to sudden movements right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy?\u201d She whispered, moving a little closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did I do it?\u201d Percy asked, but Annabeth and Medusa didn't know if he was asking them, or himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy?\u201d Medusa asked, moving close enough to put her hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't even flinch, didn't even feel her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo show her I would protect her from anything?\u201d He asked, seemingly having an argument in his head. \u201cShe didn't need to see what I did to the fat bastard though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, please. Snap out of it.\u201d Annabeth said, close enough to grab his shoulder as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo give her somewhere familiar to wake up?\u201d He asked. \u201cNo, that's a lie. I could have released her outside the camp. It would have been even more familiar to her. The last place she remembered. Could have had Grover talk to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy!\u201d Annabeth said, shaking his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, let's just say Percy would have to clean splinters from his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy blinked, feeling his gift to Medusa break over his head. It didn't hurt or anything, he'd taken far worse blows. But he didn't have that blank stare in his eyes anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn't I just wait until she woke up?\u201d Percy asked, his shoulders shaking. \u201cI could have talked to Chiron. I know he has a lot of questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon Percy.\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cSnap out of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a minute, nobody moving, Percy trying to take a few breaths.</span></div></div>",

Respect for the dead after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy?\u201d Medusa asked, worried. \u201cYou don't plan on tearing apart the underworld to get your mother back do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head, looking sorrowfully at the corpse of Sally Jackson. \u201cNo, but what I'm going to do is going to be dangerous nonetheless. Even for me. And you two are coming with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, what are you talking about?\u201d Annabeth asked. \u201cWhat kind of dangerous are we talking about here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUniversal collapse, at best.\u201d Percy said simply. \u201cAnd the possibility that my mind may suffer some severe damage from viewing three places in real time and acting in all of them as well. Unfortunately, I don't know how that would effect Either Cerberus or the Chimera, having to deal with three sets of emotions at once, even if they are all the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Medusa asked, utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime travel, Medusa. Time Travel.\u201d Percy said, as if that explained it simply enough. Though, it seemed to do so, but it also brought up more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that part I get.\u201d Annabeth stated, having done time travel herself, even if it was Percy's doing. \u201cBut what's that about three places at once? And damaging your mind?\u201d She said, suddenly very worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimply put,\u201d Percy began. First time he was able to use that on Annabeth, instead of the other way around, it seemed. \u201cThat as we go back, I'm going to split my conscious into three parts to do different tasks. One part each to go with you two to your past selves, and another to go to my own past self and merge with it, giving it the knowledge of what not to do.\u201d Percy said, looking up for the first time. \u201cI'm not entirely sure if it will be as horrible as I think it may be, but the most I've ever split into is two.\u201d Percy said, shaking his head. \u201cBut I've got to do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why take us with you if it's so dangerous?\u201d Medusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Percy said, suddenly holding both of them tightly against him, the computer and desk gone in a quick flash of light. \u201cI want you two to understand what I'm capable of. What lengths I'll go for those that I love.\u201d He said. \u201cNow hold on, and close your eyes. Going through space is nothing like going through time. It might get a little rough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth looked up at Percy, their eyes filled with both worry and love. They nodded, closing their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ In the Time Stream<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt something like cold water, but without getting them wet. It was swift, like a raging river, fighting to drag them forward and into the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy wasn't having any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strode against the tides of time, both Annabeth and Medusa clinging to him as the flow of time tried to rip them from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also several familiar presences watching them, it felt. The Fates, for one. Percy could feel their eyes widening in shock as he backwards across the tapestry of fate they weaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKronos was there, as well, but it was fleeting. As if Kronos forgot about him every second, then saw him again and remembered. Not surprising, since Kronos, even as the Titan of Time, lived in the present. The presence was weak as well, as if the titan barely was able to pay attention. Made sensem given he was still in Tartarus, and probably conserving energy to talk to his agents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they weren't the only two groups Percy could feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. He sensed the white and dark-eyed presence, the one that watched him after his time with the Fates. How he knew it was that exact presence was simple. It did nothing hiding itself from him, appearing all around him at different times. It hid from the Fates though, so perhaps it was a curious out-of-universe god? It seemed likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how did it know about him before he left the universe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one more presence Percy felt. It was very, very far off. Almost dormant as well. He couldn't place his finger on what it could have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back to the task at hand. He could wonder what these extra sets of eyes watching him were later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, this is more difficult then the time with Nico and Bianca.\u201d Percy said aloud, tightening his hold on his girls. \u201cBut that isn't going to stop me.\u201d He said, determined to change the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, more then it already was, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the difficult part. Separating his conscious into three separate, yet connected, parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked forward's, trying to empty his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy, given the circumstances that led to this, but he managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree separate Percy's walked up the river of time, battling it's mighty power. Two of the pieces of Percy held on to a girl each, while one walked alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to cause the worst headache in existence, I can already tell.\u201d They said at once. \u201cBut I don't care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked a little further, time's stream raging harder and harder the further they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, center body needs to go faster if this is going to work.\u201d They said, making an obvious effort not to completely synchronize in motion. \u201cNo, wait. The one with Annabeth goes first, then the single one, then the one with Medusa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodies switched their movements again, the far left one walking faster, while the other bodies slowed down enough for it to be in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should do it. Wait, no. Damnit, I got it wrong again. Solitary, Medusa, Annabeth. No, all together simultaneously? Yeah, that's it. Man, thinking with three brains is hard. Especially when your fighting the god damned flow of time!\u201d Percy roared, frustrated with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf something else went wrong... He was not going to be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with great effort, the three bodies moved for the last time as they neared their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go!\u201d Percy said. \u201cNow remember! When you meet your past selves, you have to look them in the eye, otherwise you won't merge with them. And that would be very, very bad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it!\u201d Both girls yelled, before they felt a pull on their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ (On Olympus)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy blinked. He could hear yelling on top of Olympus. He could see that he held his Mother's soul in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't all he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone okay?\u201d He asked, speaking through three mouths at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~With Medusa<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, everything's good.\u201d Medusa said. \u201cI... can see my past self now.\u201d She hesitated to say that, her mind already starting to hurt at the implications. \u201cPlease don't ever make me do that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~With Annabeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Medusa. Annabeth?\u201d The third Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see myself now, if that's what your asking.\u201d She said, having an easier time accepting what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't mean that it wasn't mind-boggling even still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Okay. Remember, eye-contact with your past selves. The merging might be a little jarring, but stay calm. A feeling of panic might kick up, but it should only last a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Back on Olympus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're not making this any easier.\u201d Both of them said, at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy couldn't help but laugh. \u201cAhh, sorry you two. But it's just a fair warning. Now, we've got to hurry. Annabeth, I want you to tell Grover to meet me just outside the camp entrance before you do the thing with Ambrosia. Medusa, just sit there and look pretty. I'll be there in a second. We've still got trash to take care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith pleasure~\u201d Medusa basically purred... Hissed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now we got to hurry. Not only am I getting the headache of the century, but I don't feel like drawing attention from anyone we would rather be under the radar of.\u201d He said, thinking back on the unknown presences he felt moments ago... Would feel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh... Time travel...\u201d Percy said with a shake of his collective heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe absently wondered if this is what Cerberus had to deal with when she was still the large three-headed guard dog.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy downed some Nectar and Ambrosia, making his headache go down slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, it really said something when the blessed food of the gods did little to ease even a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever again.\u201d Percy said, holding an old-fashioned goblet provided to him by a minion, who immediately refilled it with the drink of gods. \u201cNever again am I splitting my mind into three parts that are all connected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron payed Percy little attention, still stupefied by the women who served him. One minute they were wild forces of Nature on the battlefield, tearing apart the well trained campers like a harpy through an unarmored demigod, and the next they were acting like perfectly trained servants, not even needing Percy to say anything for them to be moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Percy kept several around the Big house, cleaning it up, dusting and what not. He even had some of the... Robed ones, or as he liked to call them, the 'Blue' minions, up in the attic, going through the, admittedly, heaps of old junk. Percy insisted that they might be able to make something of the old trophies or broken weapons of heroes passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that not even the Hephaestus cabin was willing to try out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Jackson was currently laying in a room, recovering from fatigue and letting her mind rest. Mr. Underwood had told her quite a bit of her sons exploits from the future that was no more, as Chiron called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you should stop looking so dumbfounded by the minions Chiron.\u201d Percy said, swilling his drink before taking another sip. \u201cThey can be quite mischievous if they think that you're easy prey.\u201d He said with a humored tone, like the thought amused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing Chiron noticed. Percy seemed utterly at ease, yet he sat with a dignified air about him. It was as if he had sat in the throne of a king, by his own right, and knew exactly what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, if what Percy told him was true, he had, and he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron rubbed the bridge of his nose, sitting in his magic wheelchair. It was getting more and more complicated, the life of Perseus Jackson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne last time, for the sake of my mind, you're telling me that the glowing energy...cocoon... that is currently upstairs in one of the guest rooms is Ares.\u201d He said slowly, trying to make sure he understood exactly what he was saying. \u201cAnd that you, by some magic, have turned Ares into a woman, who will not remember anything about being the old Ares. Am I correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, Chiron. It is the truth. Though I'm not sure how the Olympian council will take this fact.\u201d Percy mused, completely unconcerned at the thought of having to go to war with Olympus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron let out another sigh, sipping his tea. He could feel his age catching up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was immortal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Percy,\u201d Annabeth said, coming in from the hall. \u201cWhen everything isn't moving so fast and you have had a little time to relax, you can be quite regal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to Percy, sitting on his lap and wrapping her arms around him. \u201cFeeling any better?\u201d She asked, looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner, the red minion who filled Percy's drink giggled perversely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I am. Sorry about the mental break down back there.\u201d He said, smiling sadly. \u201cHow are things going out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe campers are back in their cabins, Melum is currently overseeing the minions as they help the Hephaestus cabin repair things and stock pile their 'spoils'\u201d She said, using air quotes. \u201cGrover is busy talking to the council of cloven elders right now, though about what I don't know. And it seems that a quite a few of the Nymphs have heard through the grape vine that two people, one matching Melum's description and your younger self held a concert about twenty days ago with only a flute and singing. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged. \u201cI had energy one night, and it was before I got used to the duties and pleasures of my new station. I think it was after I took you and Medusa out on that moonlit dinner from France. That Very same night, I'm sure of it.\u201d He said. \u201cSpeaking of Medusa, do you know where she went? She kind of vanished when we got back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think she said something about going to lie down. A killer headache I think.\u201d Annabeth thought, though she was unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose committing both murder and arson twice in the same day will do that to you. Especially when it's on the same person and the same building, twice. Combine that with time-travel and I'd be surprised if she didn't have a headache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron coughed, bringing himself back to their attention. \u201cYes, well, that is something I would like to call you on, I really can't. I can't really say the man deserved it, but I won't fault you for it. Hero's have done worse in the past.\u201d The centaur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Percy said. \u201cChiron, I respect you, so I will tell you this. I will not have someone call me out on doing things that don't fit with their world views because they can only think a certain way. As I told Charon, I am not a good person. But, that doesn't make me evil either. I can be kind, I can hold a meaning of justice, so on and so forth.\u201d Percy said. \u201cLet's face it. With all I've experienced in one year's time, something I've barely scratched the surface with telling you, I would say my moral code has changed drastically from what this world thinks a hero should be. I am not a selfless paragon of good, nor will I become one. I refuse to be controlled by the gods, as all hero's have been before me. But that doesn't mean that I will go on a murderous rampage. I'm not a monster, despite having killed people in the past and having demonic legions at my finger-tips. And if you can't accept that, then I will be willing to let us go our separate ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent in the meeting room, the sound of a fire burning in the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem stead-fast in that resolution.\u201d Chiron said, the lack of windows making the fireplace cast shadows across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d Percy said, hardening his face. If it came down to it... if it was necessary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would put the old horse down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tense silence, as the two stared each other down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Chiron said, pausing to sip the last of his tea down. \u201cI've never had a hero say that to me before. And I've trained a lot of heroes, as you should know. They all tried to make their happy endings, did great deeds that gave them fame and glory. But they tried too hard, and they all broke down at some point or another. They tried to fit a mold that wasn't possible for anyone to fit. A perfect hero. Selfless, self-sacrificing, always putting the people first, not killing people without due reason. Honestly, I think only two hero's I trained ever came close. Your Name-sake, Perseus, son of Zeus, and Hercules. They still fell far, far behind on what the mold called for though. They still broke though, at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, smiling ever so slightly. \u201cBut you are the first one to come out and say you wouldn't fit that mold, nor would you try to. I cannot say I condone your actions, but you are being honest with me. And you would probably do what needs to be done, not what you think would be right. People sometimes forget that they aren't always the same. Personally, I blame the Hollywood Cliche's.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I'm glad we understand one another. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to spend some time with Annabeth. I haven't seen her for a year, and I haven't had a chance to relax and enjoy the time with her.\u201d Percy said, picking his queen up in a bridal carry as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I could understand why you would want to be with her.\u201d Chiron said. \u201cBut... it feels so strange. Not even a month ago she was twelve, looking to go into the world to prove herself. Now she is a woman of the ripe age of sixteen. Sometimes I detest magic.\u201d He said, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll see you in a bit Chiron.\u201d Percy said, carrying Annabeth out into the hall. The minion quickly cleaned up before going back to the minion gates, heading back to the Dark tower.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy walked through the camp seeing the minions keeping order. The campers were kept in their cabins, and this time around they suffered no casualties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of the Hephaestus cabin already getting to work on repairing, having been the only neutral cabin in the inter-camp war they got special privileges, mixed with the barking of orders of the smarter minions to their small groups as they patrolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it was needed, but it was something to do. Besides, they were still waiting on the Succubi to find a spot for a new Dark Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I can walk, right?\u201d Annabeth asked, her arms still wrapped around Percy's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. But I prefer holding you close.\u201d He said, smiling slyly at her. \u201cWould you prefer being down on the ground?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth seemed to think about it. \u201cNo, this is just fine.\u201d She said, snuggling into his well muscled chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so.\u201d He said with a smug grin, walking past a minion patrol. They stopped to bow, Muttering 'Master' and 'Mistress' with nothing but loyalty and devotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept walking, all the way up to Thalia's tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's Thalia's tree?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would that be named and titled really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's tree of Thalia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Percy sat beneath the tree, holding Annabeth close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had dreams of you, you know.\u201d Annabeth said. \u201cThalia I mean. I don't think I ever told you that. When it was just me, her and Luke she would talk about you, without really knowing who you were. All she knew was that she loved you. Strange how I forgot to tell you that. I wonder why she joined the hunters if you were with her though.\u201d She mused. \u201cNow that I think back on it, I somehow knew she was talking about you. I think Luke knew it too. Strangely, Luke didn't seem all that jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stayed quiet, listening. 'That's how it works, huh? I knew it basically rewrote reality, but I just didn't understand how. I figured it would just be no one cared how I acted about Thalia.' He thought, listening to Annabeth ramble on about how Thalia praised him, knowing he would be strong, about how she was proud to be owned by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though how Annabeth can say that with a straight face, basically owning Thalia like she were less then cattle... Nah. I'll think on it later.' He thought. Besides, he had news that he wanted her to hear, and her alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Annabeth, can I tell you something?\u201d Percy said. \u201cIt's really important, but I didn't want anyone else to hear it for now. Just something between you and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it? You know you can tell me anything Percy.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. But this is a matter I don't want to reveal to everyone just yet. It's kind of shocking, really. Even to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, spit it out Seaweed brain. It's not going to tell itself.\u201d She teased, but had a seriousness in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see... During my time as reigning Overlord, I had several mistresses to look after the tower while I was out doing... stuff.\u201d He said, making Annabeth nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I remember. You told Hades that, back in the Underworld.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, like I said, there's one bit of info that I didn't tell anyone.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI... I'm a father Annabeth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe merely raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cYou really think that something like that would surprise me? To tel you the truth, I half expected it, no, almost certainly expected it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I figured you would want to have my first child, and I don't think I would have been a good Father-figure in that world. Being the embodiment of all they fear, no matter how good I am to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth shook her head. \u201cIt's fine Percy. It really is. Besides, I'm not ready to be a mother yet myself, even though I would love to be one with our kid. So, who's the lucky lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose. Or as I like to call her, the good mistress. Maybe a little Naive, and a little bit stuck up, but nowhere near as her sister Velvet. Or Jewel for that matter, before I did something with her. Now Jewel could be considered the Neutral mistress if anything. Anyway, I found out shortly after my fight with the Forgotten god. Guess all that time making the tower shake caught up with us.\u201d He said with a laugh and a far away look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how the woman's pelvis survived.\u201d Annabeth muttered. She had a feeling that 'Shaking the Tower' was not a meaningless euphemism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, given the difference in time's flows between us that that universe, I would say that she's probably given birth by now. I'm going to go visit sometime. She is going to be the heir to the throne of the Overlord after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe? How do you know it's a girl?\u201d Annabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo reasons, but only one of them is important. One reason is that the forgotten god was the previous husband of that world's goddess. As in, she would be like Gaea. She was called the mother Goddess I believe. I don't really know her name, but I know that the Elves worshiped her. Anyway, I'm getting off topic. Since I am basically one of the two driving forces in that world, I can see the fate of that universe when I want. I know that my daughter will be basically the spawn of evil in that universe, becoming the next overlord and enslaving the minds of the people, but also ending the reign of a mad, oppressive emperor with both a inferiority complex and a superiority complex who wants to become a god by killing all things magical.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe second reason I know,\u201d Percy said, not giving Annabeth any time to take in what he told her. \u201cIs that I can't have male children. At all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Annabeth asked, still trying to wrap her head around the first fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally. Something that the Eronomicon did to me without me knowing. It told me that almost every god was usurped by their sons, and that male children of gods tend to be jealous of their parents to the point of trying to kill them, or at the least seal them away and take what the god owns for themselves.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth was silent, before something dawned on her. \u201cThis means that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'll probably end up having sex with my daughter's, grand daughter\u2019s, and so on. Hey, it's not as bad as some gods, who have kids just to sacrifice them. At least I'll try and care for my children, unlike our divine parents.\u201d Percy said, looking with an accusatory glare at the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, with how many children you're likely to have it won't be possible to be with them all the time, especially with the different flows of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. Even with all my power it's going to be hard to do so, but I'll be damned if I don't try.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent, the only sounds the sounds of the camp rebuilding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy closed his eyes, holding Annabeth close. It was a nice day to lay in the sun...</span></div></div>",

Some Satyrs just did not know where they stood on the chain of command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sire, we've settled the deal for the land to build the tower on.' A voice said in Percy's head. 'We should be ready in a few months for it to be erected.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled. 'Good work. Tell me, how are things going on that end? Are they going as planned?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes sire. We've evacuated the tower, and spies have been set up in the town of Nordburg. The Netherworld tower I being repaired as we speak for your daughter's coming of age.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Excellent. You've done well... Eres. By the way, how is the second tower heart faring? And how are you liking the body?' Percy asked the spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm loving the body, thank you. So much magical power, and I feel so connected with everything. It's like a wet dream for me.' She said, moaning lewdly. 'But the second tower heart is doing well. Should have enough magic in it to draw in the Elf.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good, good. Then we'll keep an eye on things. I'll know when things start moving along, so just try to work on this side of things.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure. Now, when do I get my reward?' She asked, none to subtle in what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned. 'How about tomorrow night. My bed. Maybe several of the Succubi.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres laughed. 'You know how to make a girl feel special, don't you. That sounds like a good time to me. And make it twelve of them. I've been feeling quite active lately.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You got it.' Percy said, walking up to the big house. That's where he was currently staying, not wanting to sleep in the Poseidon cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he could have bunked with Annabeth or Clarisse, but he didn't want questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the goddesses would have minded either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, a little explanation is in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Ares, or Enyo as she liked to call herself now, had become the War Goddess of Olympus. She, like Athena, was under Percy's command, but it was different then with the wisdom goddess. Enyo wanted to follow him, since he bested her in combat. She, like her daughter, liked the way he commanded her and brought her to heel. It made her all hot and bothered, and she had tried to jump him several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut each time she had done so, the tables turned on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she minded, really, but still. It would have been nice to be the dominate one at least once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also caused quite the stir on Olympus, since most were wondering what had happened to Ares. They vaguely remembered Enyo, from times long forgotten. Apparently, Enyo was one of Ares followers, like Eris, essentially being his female counter-part. She loved complete and utter destruction, something she showed eagerly when she and Percy sparred, or made love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, they were one in the same to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never recalled being Ares, rewriting history in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, those on Olympus ceased caring. Anybody was better then Ares, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Jackson, having time to adjust to her son's new purpose in life, though she wasn't told all of it, was more then a little wary of him at first. She worried that he would do something to her, like what had happened to Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least she hadn't been in the same situation as Medusa had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the only reason that Olympus was standing right now, and there were still as many gods as there were previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Somehow, Percy was a child of love between the two of them. Or maybe not love, but of a one night stand. Percy never asked his mother to Elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had given her a choice. She could join him, be treated like a queen and still be able to live her life, something he would provide for her with money here and there without interfering too much. Or, she could be treated like a queen, living her life with him providing money here and there without interfering too much without joining him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she was going to be treated like a queen. No question about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a few days, and some talking with some of the more intelligent minions (Read: Blues) along with Medusa, Melum and Annabeth to reach a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she...</span></div></div>",

Please, let me show you my appreciation.\u201d She said, sitting up to capture his lips in a full on kiss, heated by her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, the blanket she was using fell down, revealing her naked breasts. She rarely slept with anything on, and never when she slept with her master. She was ready for him at any time, even if she wasn't as shapely as other women in his ever growing harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Percy minded. Either her sleeping naked or her being 'plain', something he never thought about her. Besides, variety was good. What was the point of having all perfectly hourglass-figured women?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently pulled him into the bed, laying him atop her as she kissed his face, running her hands down his body. To her, it was perfect. To her, <i>He</i> was perfect. No matter what he did, would do, or had done, he would be perfect for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who gave her purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was not idle either. His hands were teasing her, no help from anything magical. No seals, no gauntlets of incredible power, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all him, pleasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caressed her modest breasts, giving the pale globes the attention the deserved. He kneaded them, pinching just the right spots to make her moan, fondling them in a way only he knew would drive the goddess beneath him wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was working wonders, evidenced by the fact that her skin flushed, her breathing got heavier, and sweat started to gather on her body as she moaned into the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pulled back from Kissing her, looking at her with a teasing smile. \u201cI can tell you're all wet without even touching you.\u201d He said, grinning down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster~\u201d She said, trying to contain herself. \u201cI was supposed to show you my appreciation. But if it is your desire, please use me as you wish.\u201d She said, acting cute, placing a finger in her mouth and sucking on it suggestively, licking it and moaning around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy chuckled at her, taking her finger from her mouth. \u201cYour foreplay has gotten better Melum.\u201d He said, giving her a quick kiss. \u201cBut I'll let you show me your appreciation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, letting Melum take the lead, Percy found himself on his back, Melum's juicy pussy above his head as she worked his rod with her mouth, eager to taste both his man meat and his thick seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy moaned, feeling Melum bob her head up and down on his personal trident, humming around it strongly even as she deep-throated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Percy would be the first to tell you that when a goddess of singing was humming around your dick while she gave you a rather great blowjob, heavenly didn't begin to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy wasn't letting Melum go unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he grabbed her hips, pulling her sopping wet cunt down to his face, giving her pleasure in return. He tongued her hole, probing it's depths with his extra long tong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSide-effect of the Ritual of the silver serpent included a long tongue. Not that he knew for the longest time though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his tongue out, licking and nibbling her clit, using his teeth to pull it gently, giving her mound several good licks. All of it culminated in more and more of her wonderful love juices, until she finally exploded in his face with a loud groan of pleasure, sending more of her lovely vibrations along his rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt being all she had for warning, Melum pulled her mouth up, letting the tip rest in her mouth. She grasped his divine cock in her hands, quickly rubbing it, lubing it up for even more activities as she brought Percy to Climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy groaned, letting his baby-batter shoot into Melum's waiting, eager and quiet warm mouth. The first filled her mouth completely, which she greedily drank down, barely in time for the second shot. It was no less powerful then the first, filling her mouth again. Again, she gulped it down like a man dying of thirst given their favorite drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't able to get it all down though, as Percy continued to let his load go in her mouth, his cum trickled from her lips, her cheeks puffed up with the amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot able to take anymore, Melum pulled her face from Percy's dick, another less powerful shot splashing across her face, dripping to her chest as she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed the last load she could, moaning as Percy licked at her eager lips, showing how she was still ready for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you saved some for me.\u201d A female voice from the door said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said, still having his face straddled by Melum, sending shivers of pleasure up her spine as he spoke, each movement of his lips brushing against her flower. \u201cC'mon in Styx. Join the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d The Titaness said, licking her lips. Melum was looking pretty tasty, with the spunk still dripping from her face. She stalked into the room, not bothering to shut the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Downstairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron picked up his earplugs, not wanting to hear Percy's activities... again. Once was enough, thank you very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be young again.\u201d He said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a camper came running in. \u201cChiron! Monsters at the border! Tons of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron's eyes widened. Percy never said anything about this, nor to prepare for anything like this. It must have been an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, alert the rest of the campers! Tell them to prepare for battle!\u201d Chiron ordered, getting out of his wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes~\u201d A woman's moans floated down the stairs, making the camper blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d The camper asked, not sure if they wanted to go up and interrupt Percy and his time with his ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember what Percy told the campers the other day?\u201d Chiron asked, raising an eyebrow at the camper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to rely solely on him to fight the battles that come to camp.\u201d The camper said, still blushing as more lewd sounds were heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. And he was right to say that. Now go.\u201d Chiron said, waving the camper away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Back with Percy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should tell you that Echidna is waiting at the border of camp for you with enough monsters to lay siege to the camp.\u201d Styx said, licking Melum's breasts as her pussy was ravaged by Percy's wild fucking. \u201cSaw her on my way in. I think a camper is alerting Chiron as we speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grunted, Melum's tight pussy feeling incredible around his crotch sword. \u201cShe's right on time then. Well, let the campers have their battle. I've got two lovely ladies here to take care of right now. Besides, this will show them how ready they are for the real thing.\u201d He said as Melum came again, probably the third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how sweet.\u201d Styx said, biting one of Melum's stiff nipples, her tongue doing wonders to her fellow goddess's pleasure center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. I'll deal with the backlash later.\u201d He said, feeling his balls churn...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTwenty-seven critically injured, four with missing limbs, and almost everyone sustaining injuries of some kind.\u201d Chiron said, sighing in his office. He had just got done helping Apollo cabin patch everyone up, including fixing those who lost limbs get them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd something was strange. Compared to the amount of monster's there were, and the amount they killed, there should have been no reason for the monsters to retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters should have overrun the camp easily, given their numbers. Not a demi-god should have been left alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a feeling that Percy knows something about this. I don't know why, but I just do.\u201d He said, holding his head in his hands. It had been a long day, and the minions hadn't been seen in the battle either. So Percy was holding them back? For what reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d A voice said, making Chiron jump. He hadn't heard them enter or anything. \u201cHow'd the fighting go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, seeing it was Percy, sitting in a chari with a bored look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we had no casualties, if that's what you were asking.\u201d The old Centaur said. \u201cBut I wonder how they got through the barrier. And where were you during that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could tell you, but you have to promise to keep it a secret from the campers.\u201d Percy said. \u201cYou see, it entails a certain mother of Monsters. I asked her to gather a good deal of her brood and bring them here. Not all of them, mind, since that would be too much to deal with. But a good amount. I had her do this so we could test how well prepared the campers are for an actual battle. Not just capture the flag, nor one on one fights in practice. Real fights, real battles, and almost real losses. I want to see how they fend for themselves when their home is under attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut tearing limbs off? Almost losing lives?\u201d Chiron asked incredulously. \u201cPercy, these are kids! Not battle hardened warriors, nor some ferocious hoard of demonic women!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, and that's why I'm doing this. To show them that being a hero isn't all about the glory. There will be fighting, there will be bloodshed, and there will be the fear of death constantly breathing down their necks every time they leave the camp.\u201d Percy said simply. \u201cBesides, I will keep Thanatos away. Remember the story about Hercules beating him down to save his hosts wife from death? I'll do the same, if people die. I'll hold their souls for a bit myself, so that people will understand that people will die, and can die. Especially in our world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron bristled, feeling fury, but he realized Percy was right. This would be the best way for them to learn the hard way, without actually having it be permanent. Learn to feel the fear first hand to keep them in check, keep them cautious and alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Chiron said, calming slightly. \u201cSo I take it Echidna is leading the hoard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the Chimera second in command. If two woman-looking monsters enter the fray, it'll likely be them. And FYI, I gave them back the use of the abilities they had as monsters, so the Chimera might not hold back. That's the reason Echidna will be there, to keep her in check.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you control her though? The chimera I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically, I do, but I set her on a 'default' setting for her emotions. So she'll be calm outside of battle, perhaps someone could talk to her during that time. But if she starts getting agitated, or is in the heat of battle, she'll go crazy unless I enforce my will on her. But I can't do that all the time, or I would prefer not to do so. Same with Cerberus, but she acts like a loyal guard dog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron sighed, nodding his head. \u201cVery well. How often will these attacks come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno. I left that up to Echidna. Otherwise, the monsters won't mess with the campers, and the campers shouldn't go looking for trouble.\u201d Percy warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Chiron said, yawning. It had been a long day, fighting as hard as he had. \u201cI think I'll be turning in early tonight. Also, Dionysus said he would be back tomorrow morning. That little stunt you pulled with Ar- Enyo has had them talking about what to do in case something starts hunting the gods and keeping them prisoner somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask you to take care of that?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cI know Mr. D can be nice sometimes, but I don't want to do anything that could turn Zeus into an admittedly legitimate paranoid mess. I don't want that just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron nodded. \u201cI'll deal with Dionysus. I'm rather fond of the fellow, even if he cheats at pinochle.\u201d He said. \u201cAll I ask is that you let me get some sleep tonight. I understand you not wanting to sleep in the Poseidon cabin, but the room I gave you is not for your... activities... at all hours of the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan do.\u201d Percy said, not missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy.\u201d Sally said, hugging him tightly as he walked in the door. \u201cReady for our date?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was all dressed up, her hair was down and a smile shone on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a black, lower-thigh length dress, accompanied by two inch heels, also black. She wore heart-shaped earrings, with a little dusting of make-up on her already beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy whistled at her, drawing a blush. \u201cYou look beautiful Mom.\u201d He said, looking her up and down. The dress seemed a little tight, though Percy didn't know if that was his mind playing perverted tricks on him or his mom did that on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also noticed how more beautiful she was, now that she was younger. Her breasts were perkier, though no less full then after she had gave birth to him. Her hips were nice, filling out the dress, with a little help from the cute little ass she sported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs, while not the best he had ever seen, were good-looking. Long and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you Eronomicon.' Percy thought, grinning in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Percy had convinced his mother to become younger through the power of the book. It would do nothing else to her. Just make her young again. This way, she could live the life she wanted, since she had taken care of family, and then him for quite a bit of her life, leaving it mostly barren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had taken up collage again, aiming to become a writer again. Percy had payed for her first semester, as much as she was letting him pay, since she started looking for a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was living in a high end apartment in a nice part of town, close to NYU for her classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm ready to go mom.\u201d Percy said, linking arms with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Sally. I can't really be called your mother anymore can I?\u201d She asked, leaning against him in his tux.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn't matter to me, 'Sally'.\u201d He said, teasing her with just the sound of her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked to their date, Sally wondered if tonight would be a good night to take him to bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~On the far edge of Existence, just outside the universe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sleeping being stirred, it's consciousness awakening after so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><b>P</b><b><i>e</i></b>R<b>S</b><i>E</i>uS <b><i>J</i></b>a<i>c</i><b>k</b>S<b>O</b><i>n</i></u>...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what it thought, focusing on this strange person. He piqued its interests, this creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have to watch him, closely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery closely...</span></div></div>",

It's time to get up Percy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy cracked his eyes open, yawning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little laugh, almost a giggle. \u201cMorning Percy.\u201d The voice said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy squeezed the woman in his arms, one of the two sources of warmth in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Sally.\u201d He said, breathing lightly on her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \u201cStop that.\u201d She said, playfully trying to pull away. \u201cYou know that tickles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned. \u201cI know.\u201d He said, starting to nibble on the same ear as his hands roamed his mother and lover's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally moaned under his expert touch. He knew which spot's turned her on, and which spots made her putty in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, this wasn't the first time she had woken up like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned in disappointment as he pulled his hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on.\u201d Percy said, sitting up. \u201cOtherwise you'll be late for work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't mind.\u201d Sally said as she sat up as well, the blanket falling to reveal her nude body. \u201cI've never missed a day of work before. One day won't kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy flinched slightly, the events of nearly a year ago coming to mind. \u201cPlease don't say kill. You know how I feel about that.\u201d He said, wrapping his arms around her protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally frowned, feeling a little bad. \u201cSorry.\u201d She said. It was still weird. Knowing that Percy had seen her die once. It was weird knowing she had died, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sire,' the voice of Eres entered Percy's mind. 'Will you be coming to check on the construction of the tower today?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Probably.' Percy thought back. 'How's Tyson handling being around the minions? Still too embarrassed to work around them?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Somewhat, he just has a hard time looking at them and speaking with them at the same time now.' She said. 'Such an innocent cyclops. Hard to believe you and him are related at all.' She chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Different upbringing and all.' He said. 'By the way, I've been feeling more and more people die in the other world. Has that elf started his empire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Sire. The original dark tower has, sadly, been destroyed in the magical explosion.' The ghost said. She liked the dark tower, feeling so connected to it. 'The second tower heart rejected him, as you said it would, exploding.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What of the secondary minion homes?' Percy asked, watching as Sally got dressed for her job. 'And my daughter?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, the secondary minion homes have been scattered as per your orders, corresponding with your daughter's projected path. And your daughter is growing up in Nordburg. Jewel occasionally checks in on her, anonymously leaving gifts to the little terror.' Eres said, laughing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl really took after her father, being incredibly strong for her age and speaking in what the villagers deemed demonic tongues when she was mad. A real spitfire, that girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rose has infiltrated the empire, using the blue minions as her agents. Velvet is currently watching over the netherworld tower, overseeing as the minions repair it and make it fitting for an overlord, or over-lady in this case.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. 'Good. And the succubi?' He asked, referring to the lust-filled demonesses that he had taken from the Knight he once fought along side before becoming Overlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Other then gathering and spreading lust energy, they aren't really doing much. They have gone back to hell, spending time torturing the souls of the damned or engaging in week-long orgies.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. 'As expected. Any weakening of the universal tower or the pathways?' He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'None to report. My power alone should be enough to support the ways. With you constantly feeding me some of that delicious energy of yours it should be no problem.' She said. 'By the way, I think it's almost time for my weekly... recharging.' She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned, slipping on some clothes. 'I remember. Just make sure there are no problems with the stability. I don't want the universe to collapse and be consumed by the void. I fought for that place, and I intend to keep it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past year, Percy had been busy. He had done quite a lot, and so much had changed from the ways things had been in the previous time line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe campers were getting better at dealing with a variety of monsters, and their team work was astounding. Echidna was working them hard with her random attacks on the camp, sending more and more monsters at the camp slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention Tyson, Percy's clyclopian half-brother. Percy had picked him off the streets, taking him in so that he wouldn't be attacked by monsters or deal with little bastards at the Merriweather collage prep-school that Percy remembered. Percy had set him up doing something he loved, building things, helping to construct the dark tower. The poor cyclops was so embarrassed by the forms of the minions that he could only work alone for a while, needing Percy to help him to get used to his 'big-sister' figures as Percy described them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa had started started working at the NYU art division as a teacher, primarily working with sculpture and pottery. Turns out she was good at making statues from scratch as well as people. She had been happy with her new life. Occasionally, she would have sculptures done over night, but she never told anyone her secret...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't worry, they were all the lowest dregs of society that did horrible things. Drug dealers, rapists, malicious thieves and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth had gone back to her Father, still wanting to have a connection to him. It was a real pain, having to explain that his daughter was older and a trained warrior, probably drawing in even more monsters then last time she lived with him due to her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer step-mother had not been happy about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum had, at Percy's insistence, started a music career. He felt that she should have something to occupy her time, and Melum had asked what her powers could help her achieve. Being what she was, music seemed to be perfect for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it had worked! Her music was a hit, moving audiences with the sound of her voice. Having no need for the money, since Percy was willing to provide for her, Melum gave most of it to Charities across the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem had been finding a recording studio that wouldn't try to force her to change her appearance for a certain crowd. You have no idea how many of her managers ended up 'disappearing' because they tried to force her into things, often trying to hold a contract above her head or legal action if they didn't follow their instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would think that people would call her cursed, but it just wasn't so. Her music was so good that any risk was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyx had gone back down to the underworld, and with help from some of the more powerful blue minions had started cleaning up her river. She popped up every other week or so to check on things with them, and every other day wherever Percy was for some sexy-time, never minding the place or how public it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat never meant that Percy Never took the girls on Dates though. No, he was often taking them places, treating them and making them feel special. Percy felt that it was good to have an actual emotional attachment to his women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should have seen what he did for Christmas, Valentines day, anniversaries and their birthdays this last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he wasn't only active in this universe. He had, through a hard-fought battle, created a small universe that would connect to all universes he conquered. Currently he only had a few pathways, connecting this universe and the one where he ruled as Overlord along with some others that really hadn't been too much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to say he hadn't started to gain little footholds in other Universes while he was out and about the cosmos. Of course he had, he was an Overlord after all. Conquering was part of the job description after all. And universes were no exceptions to that rule. But he was focusing on the home front right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster? Can Birdy be let out of her cage for a flight now?\u201d A song-like voice came from another part of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and he got a pet Harpy. He caught her attacking Tyson, and he figured why the hell not. Besides, he wondered what she would look like as a human-bird creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'll come let you out.\u201d He said. Walking out of the one bedroom in the whole apartment. Why bother with more rooms if most guests were women who shared Percy bed? It was big enough for four people...</span></div></div>",

They've busy as of late. They should learn to relax a little. I mean, sure, they probably have the most important jobs in the world, but still.\u201d He said, shaking his head. \u201cThat much stress can kill a god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud sound of a motorcycle driving up rattled the windows of Percy and Sally's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned, summoning his armor. \u201cMaybe I'll wait on going to the tower for a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Percy!\u201d A female voice called. \u201cGet your ass down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Percy said, his armor molding around him into more biker-style apparel. \u201cGoing to wait on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had made peace long ago with Biker outfits. Ares may have been an ass, and over-compensated with his clothes, Percy had to admit that they fit during certain situations, as long as you didn't go overboard with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked out of his apartment, not bothering to lock it up. The harpy could come back anytime, and no one ever tried to break into his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time that happened, they found the bodies hung up by their own entrails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one, and he meant no one, followed Sally home from the store in an attempt to rape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew york everybody. Even the higher class areas had the horrible kind lurking in the alleys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the police could ever pin it on Percy. There were teeth marks, jagged inhuman teethmarks, and Percy didn't leave any fingerprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloves had been a bitch to wash though. As powerful as they were, they might as well have been hand-wash only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Percy had figured out that one trick before that time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sexy.\u201d The Goddess of Destruction said, leaning on her motorcycle. She was standing at 6' 4'', with medium-length, messy blood-red hair. Her leather jacket was open, showing off her blood-red tube-top. She still wore the wrap-around shades she had when she was Ares. She wore thigh-high leather boots, and the tightest leather hot pants that Percy thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, it was like they were painted on! He could even see a Camel toe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, she wore a black belt, studded with something that looked like bones, with a red-painted skull design on the buckle. With the aforementioned hot pants, It was easy to tell that she wasn't wearing anything underneath it all. She had a pair of fingerless gloves, studded along the knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was smirking at Percy, and Percy could feel her eyes looking up and down. \u201cYou clean up good.\u201d She said, giving him an, admittedly sexy, growl of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't I always?\u201d Percy asked cockily, grabbing a handful of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d Enyo said, retuning the favor as she captured his lips in a dominant kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah. Definitely going to wait on the tower.' Percy thought, fighting back, slipping his tongue into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Enyo acted like this, it was going to be a good-time all around. Fighting, Fucking and Drinking? He'd have to be mad to turn it down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnyo pulled away, knowing she had been beat, since Percy had been able to push her back on her ride, rubbing at her already hot snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d She started. \u201cYou ready for our 'date,' stud?\u201d She asked, grinning viciously at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned right back. \u201cAs if you had to ask.\u201d He said, letting her stand back up. \u201cSo, you driving this time, or are you going to feel me up again from the back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnyo never dropped her smirk. \u201cI'll drive. I want you to get me all hot and bothered, that way we have an even better time.\u201d She said, getting back on the motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, the hornier Enyo was, the better the fight would go. And the post-fight sex, can't ever forget that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me.\u201d Percy said, climbing on back, making sure he was grinding his cock against her toned ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's it~\u201d Enyo said, revving the engine to life as her personal engine flared up with a burning sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeled out, leaving inches-deep skid marks on the asphalt, tearing through the streets as Percy held onto her, one hand between her legs and the other on her well muscled stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin Minutes, they were outside the city, leaving a thick cloud of red smoke in their wake. Enyo could feel the vibrations getting to her, and Percy's hands constantly teased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout ready to go?\u201d Percy asked, snaking the hand resting on her stomach up and underneath her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnyo was breathing heavily, but she grinned in defiance, grinding back against Percy. \u201cAlmost. Just a little longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me.\u201d He said, working his magic fingers. \u201cBut you know, I'd say you're starting to put up less resistance. Going soft are you?\u201d He teased, knowing he was making the ensuing events that much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorny and angry Enyo? Oh fuck yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rage sex was absolutely amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnyo growled. \u201cI'll show you whose going soft.\u201d She said, feeling her juices pool in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they drove a little more, Percy teasing and baiting the Goddess in his arms. The air around her was shimmering with her anger, and her glasses had long since melted away. Percy could hear her teeth grinding as he riled her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! That's it!\u201d She yelled, bringing her skull back to bash him in the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy leaned his head out of the way, the Motorcycle swerving at the sudden weight displacement. He grinned wildly, eying the furious, sweaty form of Enyo as the bike crashed beneath them, skidding to a tree. Both were unharmed though, having taken bigger hits from the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this is more like it.\u201d Percy said as the two circled around, keeping their eyes on the other. Enyo had drawn a sword, the celestial bronze gleaming in the sunlight. He took the time, slipping his gloves off and into his pocket, the ground around them shaking before he could reign in his power again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnyo lunged at him, swinging her sword with pure strength and fury, cleaving into the ground easily, knocking over several trees behind Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnyo rolled out of the way, Percy's fist sending up small spires of rock. She quickly stood, delivering a kick to where she thought his head would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy caught the foot, lifting her up into the air by it and slamming her into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou getting Better, girl.\u201d Percy said condescendingly, his eyes flashing to the same poisonous green that had brought many men to their knees in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnyo roared, kicking at Percy with her other foot as she tried to stab his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, scary.\u201d He mocked, grabbing hold of her other leg and jumping in the air with her. \u201cI remember you making the same mistake a few months back. How did it end up again?\u201d He asked, using her body to spin in the air, throwing her down into the ground before landing on her back. \u201cOh yeah, something like that. Ready to give up yet?\u201d Percy asked, grinding her hand into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d Enyo yelled, throwing her body up with all the force she could muster. And when you are the living embodiment of destruction, that was a lot of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's head collided with a tree, drawing golden Ichor from the spot. He coughed, licking his lips and tasting his own blood. \u201cI'll fuck something alright.\u201d He said as he got up. He ran at Enyo, who had just managed to get up, but was still going strong. He dove, tackling her as they both disappeared into thin air, leaving only a ripple behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnyo kept her mouth shut as rocks and dirt were ground into her face as she skid along the ground, Percy holding her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said, fuck off!\u201d She roared, flipping onto her back, sending both of them Skidding away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the warriors stood up, facing one another. Enyo gripped her sword, eying Percy, watching for the most opportune moment to strike with all her force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy, meanwhile, held out his hands, a large, flaming Mace appearing in his hands. Holding the massive weapon in one hand, Percy grabbed at the air with the empty hand, water appearing around him en masse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in a tower over-looking them a woman sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like Sire is not pulling his punches again.\u201d The woman said, closing her book. \u201cGiblet, can you keep working on that project of mine while I'm gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forge mistress nodded. \u201cYes tower-mistress. Giblet do good with project.\u201d She said, going back to the forging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorticia, would you mind helping in keeping the energy under control?\u201d Eres said, pausing. \u201cYes, that means you'll have to come through the pathways.\u201d She said. \u201cGood. Giblet will be expecting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres sat down, looking out the window at Percy and Enyo duke it out, the landscape drastically changing as they went at it harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing Percy can fix all this.\u201d Eres said, waiting for Morticia to arrive before leaving. \u201cBeing his universe and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres paused again, looking up at nothing. \u201cAh, yes. Hello Mistress Annabeth. Have I seen the master? Yes I have. He's fighting Enyo right now. No, I don't think He's been to the construction site today. I don't know when He'll get done with his spar. Yes, I'll remind him. Yes. You're welcome Mistress.\u201d She said, blinking her eyes back into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing she hated about her new job, it was that she acted like a call center for Percy and the far-away, or universally separated, members of his Harem. Well, hate was too strong a word. Maybe just generally disliked. At least the Minions weren't aloud to use it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, better enjoy the show.\u201d She said, kicking back in the air as she watched the power-houses collide again.</span></div></div>",

He smacked the Goddess of Destruction on the ass, making her moan and slap at him halfheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be good at fighting, Girl.\u201d He said, still mocking her. \u201cBut your stamina needs work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fuck you. We can't all be amazing sex gods you know.\u201d She said, rubbing her rear, the ground around them stained with her and Percy's activities. As well as a few imprints on the hard, unforgiving ground, most of them looking suspiciously like various part of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncluding her ass, hands, knees, shoulders, one that looked like her face slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could she say? She liked it rough. Really, really rough. Being a goddess that specialized in war and destruction left her with a very high pain tolerance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo very much unlike Ares before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, before anyone calls anybody out, she did get to return the favors, somewhat. And she had taken her toll on Percy as they fucked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Percy said, leaning back on the ground next to her. \u201cBut I can try my best to make you amazing sex goddesses. And I fully intend to do that. We could go for another round if you want to test your luck again.\u201d He said, leaving it up to her if that was fighting, fucking or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. As much as I want to, I've still got to go do my job. There's been an area in Spain that's been pissing me off. I'm gonna go raise some hell there.\u201d She said, before feeling a warm stickiness flow from her holes. \u201cThat, and I don't think I could take anymore. I'm stuffed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI aim to please.\u201d Percy said, shrugging with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'll say.\u201d Enyo said, scooping a bit of Percy's cum off her leg, licking it off with moans she had been making not even ten minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping the last of the cream off her finger, Enyo pulled the digit from her mouth with a wet 'pop!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, better then any ambrosia.\u201d She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving fun you two?\u201d A voice said from above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Eres. What's up?\u201d Percy asked, tilting his head to look at the glowing woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she was literally glowing. You know, being filled with Arcane energies and what not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres stood at 5'7'', purple energy radiating from her body as light. She wore nothing, exposing her bare form to the world. Her purple skin looked like it was very much alive, looking like the energy she contained was rolling and billowing about her. Instead of hair, she had pure energy cascading from her head, only acting like hair.  She even floated off the ground slightly, maybe an inch or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her skin may have looked unnatural, that didn't mean she wasn't beautiful even still, nor was she any less of a woman. Her breasts were still as big as they were last time, and she was still very shapely, and very much sexually active. Something that she reminded Percy of every chance she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear,\u201d She said, smiling down at him. \u201cYou've been going to too many universes where the laws of physics allow you to do outlandish things. Stop breaking physics in more stable universes please.\u201d She said, smiling even still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't help it.\u201d Percy said, shrugging at her. \u201cIt's more fun to do that sort of thing. If I didn't have as much time to relax and have fun, with as much time as I spend planning and plotting and conquering, I would have snapped by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saying that we're not fun?\u201d Enyo asked, scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. But there's more to an immortal existence then fighting, fucking and booze. Trust me, I don't think I'll get tired of that for a long time, but still. Sometimes a guy has to let loose, break physics and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, wise-bitch is probably having a hell of a time still trying to figure out how you do that. She pestered me for weeks on trying to make you explain it to her.\u201d Enyo said, referring to Athena. \u201cI still think she's trying to figure out how you did that one thing. You know what I'm talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think I do.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut all I can tell you right now, as I've said before, is adapting to other universes is not easy. How we look, right now, the texture of our skin and everything else, is completely unrealistic to them. Tell Athena to look at anything that is drawn, painted, or whatever, and think that to the people in the art, that is how the world is supposed to look. Physics also apply, along with thought patterns, fiction, reality and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah blah blah. Don't care.\u201d Enyo said. \u201c Quantum theory, or whatever it is you call it, isn't my type of thinking. I'll pass on the message for ya, but don't expect me to understand it.\u201d She said. She was a fighter, not a planner. Unbridled destruction was her thing, not hard thinking or philosophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well, anyway Sire.\u201d Eres said seriously. \u201cMistress Annabeth wanted me to remind you that today would be the day the barrier's fail. You know, the barriers protecting the half-blood camp?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was today?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sire.\u201d Eres said, nodding. \u201cAccording to Mistress it is. You had Echidna pull away a few weeks back, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right.\u201d Percy said, standing up and stretching. \u201cWonder how well they'll fare when the monsters bring the fight into the camp itself, and they aren't going easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I got to raise me a town to the ground, maybe set fire to some crops or something.\u201d Enyo said, standing up and draping her arms around Percy. \u201cMind dropping me off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Just let me check on a few things first.\u201d Percy said, the three of them appearing in the tower. \u201cEres, can you see if Melum is doing anything? I want to talk with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower-heart personification bowed. \u201cAt once Master.\u201d She said, stepping near a scrying pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Melum? Are you busy?\u201d Eres asked, an image forming in the small water basin. \u201cYes, Master would like to talk with you. Hold on a moment Sire, the image will appear in a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water shimmered, showing Melum's cheerful face. \u201cHello Master Perseus!\u201d Melum said, smiling at him with a happy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mel. How are things going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust fine Master. Though there has been one person hitting on me. I'm sure it's a god though. Apollo I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy frowned slightly. \u201cHas he been too... insistent? Bothering you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d She said, sighing slightly. \u201cHe's just an annoyance. After all, you're the only one for me Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy chuckled. \u201cI know, I know. You tell me that every time you see me.\u201d He said, before turning serious. \u201cSorry to say though, this isn't a social call. I was wondering if you wanted to go on another little quest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen and where?\u201d Melum asked, her voice becoming the regal tone it was when she was serious about doing something for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFew days, sea of monsters. Going to grab the golden fleece to protect the camp and bring Thalia out of the tree. Always something fun to do.\u201d Percy said, skimping out on real details. \u201cBut you don't have to go. I know you're in the middle of recording-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine Master. Besides, some time away from the studio might do me some good right now. And I truly miss being beside you all the time.\u201d She said, reaching out to grab his face through whatever she was looking at. \u201cOh, right. You're not really here right now.\u201d She said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you're sure you want to go...\u201d Percy said. \u201cI'll pick you up in a few days. You go square things away with your managers.\u201d Percy said, waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Master. I'll see you in a few days.\u201d She said, blowing him a kiss. \u201cLove you Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too.\u201d Percy said as the image vanished.</span></div></div>",

'You shall sail the iron ship with warriors of bone.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You shall find what you seek and make it your own.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But despair for your life entombed in stone.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And fail without friends, to fly home alone.' Lachesis said, finishing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good. I really see no problem with it. Although, you three are the masters of this stuff. I remember what it means, so you don't have to spell it out for me. But tell me. Is there anybody that could use a little bit of a prison break?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm.' Clotho thought, putting a finger to her cheek in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder-' Atropos thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Would she remember though?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And her cell mate...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And them?' Clotho wondered, making her sisters blink at her. 'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in their lives, one of the Fates had surprised the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Would it be wise?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perhaps not.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But it would be unfair!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Remember that they too are prisoners.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, explain please. Who are you talking about?\u201d Percy asked, putting a stop to their little argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, the first is Scylla, one of the monsters guarding the sea of monsters.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A nymph, she was. Glaucus, a long-forgotten minor sea god who worked for your father fell in love with her. Due to some events that took place, she was turned into the monster she is now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, but that isn't all. For all this time, she's been consumed by her anger and sorrow. She may have lost her mind by now, but perhaps not.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Even so, we suspect that you could help her in some way, like with Medusa.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno. I don't mess with mind of people much any more. Not since last year. Though I'll try, I won't be going into dangerous waters where I can do more harm then good.\u201d He said. \u201cThe others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, Charybdis as well. A naiad, a daughter of Poseidon and Gaea just before the primordial was forced into her slumber.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Your half-sister, if you want to be clear-cut. A powerful girl, Charybdis.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. She claimed land in the name of the sea, covering the land in Poseidon's name. She was the second in command of the waters, and she claimed many lives.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But Zeus did not care for that. Only that she was taking the land away from his followers with which to worship him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd let me guess. He cursed her, like so many other people.\u201d Percy said, gripping the sides of the Basin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. This one might be justified, except for the fact that Poseidon commanded her to do it. As his daughter, she couldn't have refused him at the time. It just wasn't something daughters did at the time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. The Olympian makes another take the fall in his place. Typical of Poseidon and Zeus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just as a heads up, Charybdis might have been a little...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Broken. While Scylla may have still had the ability to think, Charybdis was reduced to little more then the monster she is now. If she has any thoughts at all, they will be little more then eat and swallow the earth.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cAnd what of this third group? The one you seem to be indecisive about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates looked at each other before Clotho stepped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Grey Sisters. You should know them.' She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrey sisters... Grey Sisters...\u201d Percy said, tapping the side of the Basin with his finger. \u201cThe three old women who drive the Taxi of the damned? With the one eye and one tooth between them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Exactly, yes.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They are the sisters of Echidna, and helped your name-sake on his quest to slay Medusa way back when.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how are they prisoners?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates shuffled their feet, looking at one another. Almost ashamed of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You see...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's kind of...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Complicated.' They all said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean complicated?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well... The Grey sisters were very powerful seeress's.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And they would have an immortal life due to their parentage.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Zeus wanted their power curbed, so as to not jeopardize Olympus's standing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But they also wanted to bargain for a little more power.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We... granted both requests.' Lachesis said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We gave them more power, but reduced them down to a single eye to share. With it, they would be able to see exactly what we weaved. But they would have to fight over it to see at all.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, in essence, they are our prisoners.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Prisoners of fate.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you Percy. You can fix what we broke.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What we, the Fates, were too shameful to admit.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We understand now that what we did was wrong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But we cannot do anything about it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Our cursed pride won't let us!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please Percy! We beg of you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa. Everybody settle down.\u201d Percy said forcefully, his power flaring, making the tower and the surrounding land for miles shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the tower, Giblet yelled as hot metal splashed from the forge and landed on her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd be fine though. It would probably leave a light burn for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToughest minion Percy had after all. It would take a medium-sized army to fight her and take her down. Little bit of molten hot metal wouldn't do much of anything.</span></div></div>",

They said, bowing their heads. A faint trickling of power from beyond the universe reached them. Percy was not happy at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Percy said curtly. \u201cNow, I want you three to listen to me. I want you to fix this mess. You caused it yourselves. I will not fix it for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Perseus.' Clotho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'B-but... can we ask you...' Atropos said, wringing her hands like she didn't really want to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To help us?' Lachesis finished, little more then a quiet whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d Percy asked, both angry and, now, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-we don't think that...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We can give them their old forms...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We cast their eyes so far away that we wouldn't be able to recover them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If we can make peace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And free them from their bonds ourselves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Will you give them that which we stole?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stared into the water basin, the Fates fidgeting under his glare. \u201cMaybe. But you will try to fix it. Am I understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three fates nodded. 'Yes husband.' They all said, sorrowfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, looking at Eres. \u201cYou can cut the image now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres nodded, stepping away from the pool of water where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is done Maste-\u201d Eres stopped mid-sentence. Percy was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~In the chamber of Fate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What should we do sisters?' Lachesis asked, sitting down at the table again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We should do as Perseus says. He is right, as we all know.' Atropos said somberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We know that, sister.' Clotho said. 'But what about our husband himself? He seemed angry with us.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'As he should.' Lachesis said with a sigh. 'What we did, to the Grey sisters, was unnecessary.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True, it was.' Atropos admitted. 'But we-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But nothing.' Clotho interrupted. 'We are in the wrong this time. If the Olympian's are being forced to change or die... perhaps it is time we did the same.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. With a husband as powerful as our dear Perseus, it would be unwise to try and weave around this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We should, as the mortals say, bite the bullet.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder...' Lachesis asked, drawing her sisters attentions. 'Does Perseus think of us in the same light as the Olympian's now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I do not think so.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least, we hope not...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy fear stabbed their hearts. Yet another thing that was new for them. This last year or so had been full of firsts for them. Love, compassion, the fear of death, relief, the pleasures of the flesh, happiness... They were feeling it all, thanks to Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the fear of rejection. The fear that Percy would see them in a darker light then what they wished him to see. That they were no better then those he was already fighting against, in his own ways. No better then those who punished for little to no reason, often a fate worse then death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, like the women of the olden days, they thought the world of their husbands. They did not wish to cause Percy to view them in distaste. Even if they had control over him still, they would have weaved him a life of happiness. Maybe trials, yes, but of happiness whenever he came home to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop thinking things like that. You know I don't hate you.\u201d Percy's voice said, from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates jumped, something that they never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down now. I'm only here to talk to you in person.\u201d He said as they stood up, turning towards him very quickly. \u201cI just figured that you wouldn't want other people hearing this, even if it stayed within the 'family'.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked over, gently pushing them back into their seats as Percy took one of his own. Something they had kept around in case he ever came up to talk with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tense silence, as Percy looked at them, waiting for one of them to speak. And the Fates... well, they felt something else. Another first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey felt like children, in a way. Children that were about to be scolded for something they did and tried to escape punishment for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W...We're sorry Perseus.' Lachesis said, bowing her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We did not mean to try and thrust our problems onto you.' Clotho said, hands clasped in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cGirls, I just want you to realize that even if I am more powerful then even you, I won't be fixing up every little problem for you. Not even Annabeth, or Melum, or Medusa. I would help, but I won't be doing it all for you. And like I said, you caused this mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates each opened their mouth to say something, even if they spoke without even saying anything vocally, but they quickly closed their mouths. Percy was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be willing to be there when you speak with them, since I have business with them myself. If you can square things away with them, I'll talk to them about this myself. Deal?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Y-you're not mad at us?' Atropos asked, almost childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're not disgusted by our actions?' Lachesis asked, afraid he would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No, no.\u201d Percy said. \u201cA little disappointed, yes, but I'm not mad or disgusted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood up, walking over to Lachesis, who sat in the middle between Clotho and Atropos. He  disappeared for a second, before three of him appeared in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved exactly the same, each having a look of utter concentration on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith slightly clunky movements, there was a Percy standing in front of each of the sisters, whose eye's widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You said you wouldn't do this again.' They said, a little stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d They said. \u201cIt wouldn't be fair to only hug one of you at a time. Besides, I've got to practice it anyway. I have the feeling that I'll need it in the future... or Past. Time-travel still gets a little mixed up. But enough of that.\u201d Percy said, holding them all tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't think I could ever hate you.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fates didn't know how to react to that. They had feared the worst, but had only a minor scolding. Perseus still loved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, relief washed over them. For the second time in their lives, they felt their hearts ease and flutter away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another first happened that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright.\u201d Percy said, rubbing their backs as they clutched at his shirts, afraid to let go. \u201cI'm not leaving you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ The next day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy opened his eyes, feeling the warmth of the Fates around him. He was looking up at unending darkness, and the bed felt like he could fall through any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep. Still in the chamber of Fate.' He thought, the Fates snoring lightly. It was a cliche name, he knew. And about a million different universes had something called the same, but he didn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'-ire? Are you awake Sire?' Eres asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, I am now.' Percy said back. 'What's up?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The servant girl, Clarisse, wanted to know when, or if at all, you would becoming by the camp? The attacks from Kronos's army are growing stronger already.' Eres said. 'And that tree of yours with the girl has been poisoned.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Ah, shit.' Percy said. 'Does anyone know who did it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'The traitor, Luke Castellen.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy sighed silently. 'Should have known. But it's always been an assumption over the years. Never a certainty. Thanks Eres.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'It was no trouble Sire.' The ghost-woman said, her conscious fading from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Well, I better go see Clarisse.' Percy thought. 'Check in on the campers as well. See how they're doing. I trust Clarisse though. She was most likely ready for this type of event. Probably been preparing the camp since I called off Echidna.' He thought to himself, vanishing and leaving pillows underneath the sleeping heads of the Moriae.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy appeared atop the hill, over looking the camp. Right now, the campers were fighting for their lives. Not the wild, yet controlled monsters at Echidna's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNay, these were wholeheartedly trying to kill the campers, without anyone to command a retreat or cease-fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, even with the Campers in a full on war inside their own camp, for once, they were holding their own. All the time fighting Echidna's brood had done them good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing besieged for a whole year tended to make a person a good fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't what concerned him by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy placed his hand on the tree, Thalia's tree. He could feel as the poison burned her. Not just the tree, but the soul of Thalia herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Thalia.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI hoped to have prevented this. Or at least try to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime-travel may have solved a lot of problems, but it wasn't to be used willy-nilly. The few times he had used it for anything less then an emergency had been him messing around, but it was also very detrimental to the universal structure of, well, the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's... okay Percy</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what he heard the tree say. He could see Thalia writhing in pain inside the tree's soul, close enough to be called her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It-It's not so bad... with you around... It doesn't hurt as much...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled sadly. \u201cThat's my girl. Be strong.\u201d He said, patting the tree bark. \u201cSave your strength. Keep yourself strong. We'll get you out of here soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Y-yes... Percy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy felt as Thalia's conscious faded further into the tree, and the slight shimmer of the barrier began to fade. The monsters that were still fighting to enter found themselves tumbling in, causing more harm to themselves then anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmall Fry.\u201d Percy said, bored, but in a bad mood. He held out his hands, grabbing the mace he had used against Enyo from thin air. \u201cBut they'll have to do right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stalked down the hill, armor forming around him in its dark glory, Cape billowing on the flames of war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove you bastards!\u201d Clarisse yelled, her group dodging out of the way as some more monstrous beasts barreled towards them. She slashed at one of them, lopping off an arm in the process. \u201cGot you, ya bastard!\u201d She yelled, blood landing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse looked older now, just slightly. She had grown fit... well, fitter over the year, fighting constantly, training when she wasn't fighting. Hell, she had even sparred against Percy, though she knew he was going easy on her. But really, besides her godly mother, who else would be a good measuring stick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had cut her hair slightly, no longer having the hair to tie in a pony tail. Her arms were slightly muscled, and she could kick in a shield if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slashed at another Monster, only barely managing to keep her footing as a monster felled by a comrade fell behind her, turning to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh shit.\u201d She said, looking up the hill as the sounds of more monsters joined the fray. \u201cArchers! Take aim!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the roofs of the cabins, various groups of campers, all wielding bows, took aim at the attacking horde that flew down the hill to them. They let loose volley after volley, taking down a few monsters here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClarisse! There are too many!\u201d A camper yelled down. \u201cWe can't take many down before they reach you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake what you can!\u201d Clarisse barked, ramming her sword through her opponent. \u201cThen get down here and join us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a giant boar sailed over her head, squealing as its fur blazed. More soon followed, storms of dust being blown over the camp as more and more monsters suddenly, and violently, exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you got your act together Clarisse.\u201d An armored figure said, brandishing a giant, flaming mace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Percy.\u201d Clarrise said, looking up at the giant. \u201cNice weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, slicing at a hell-hound as it jumped at her, beating it down with her shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Percy said, crushing the head of a harpy as it flew at him. \u201cLooks like you could use some help still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe ain't going to say no.\u201d Clarisse commented, grunting as she nimbly dodged out of the way of another charging beast. \u201cThese ain\u2019t Echidna's are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse had been the only camper to know about Echidna's horde. But that was only because she served him, and faithfully to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about basically being not only her superior, but also her divine mother's superior. Guess that made him above Zeus's level in her books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorked for him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, they ain't hers. A certain titan lord's, and his crony's.\u201d Percy said, grabbing a hell-hound with his bare hands, snapping its neck and tossing it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of them minions with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Currently preoccupied.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha. Any other back up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, I'm not enough?\u201d Percy asked, mocking a hurt tone since no one could see his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you're more then enough alright. But what about when things really go to shit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll deal with it then. Right now, duck.\u201d Percy said, bringing back the mace in a batters stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse, not being stupid and feeling the ground shaking under her feet getting worse, ducked. She really did not want to get hit with that mace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mechanical bull charged, hoping to impale campers or cook them alive. Fire blew from its nostils, and the metal it was made of was burning hot to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt 'mooed' as much as a mechanical bull could, running right towards Clarisse and Percy. It saw Percy bring his club up, thinking this would be the best opportunity to do some major damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crunch!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Monster went flying, the front half of it's body missing completely, stuck on one of the jagged bits of the outlandishly large mace in Percy's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice swing.\u201d Clarisse said, dusting off her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. I'll deal with a few more of the bigger guys, maybe a few little ones, and leave the rest to you. I've got business elsewhere today too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it. Campers! Regroup and Attack!\u201d Clarisse shouted, mustering all her courage and spreading it to every other camper. This is what they trained for! This was just like the past year, random monster attacks. They could handle this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse picked up her sword and shield, having beat down the last hell-hound down with her hands. \u201cThat should be all of them!\u201d She called. \u201cAnyone else found anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll clear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse nodded. \u201cGood! Now let's get to cleaning up! Rest, drink and food await!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse's group yelled, before groaning. Their bodies ached. They had only recently started suffering battles like this in the past year. And then a full on war from Monsters that didn't retreat after so long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't used to this just yet. Nothing this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse rubbed a bruise she had gotten, one of many, along with a scar. It didn't really hinder her, just a minor annoyance. \u201cC'mon. Let's go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer group slogged back through the woods, where they had chased the last of the monsters. She could already see as Satyrs and Nymphs were rushing to and fro for medical supplies, helping wherever they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Aphrodite's cabin had found something useful to do. They may have not been fighters, but they were like walking sedatives. Just put them next to someone who wouldn't calm down, and the person would slowly calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange how no one thought of that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill all cabin councilors please come to the big house for a meeting.\u201d Chiron's voice rang out over the groans of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys go on ahead.\u201d Clarisse said, waving her group forward. \u201cI gotta deal with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer contingent saluted, walking past her as she walked away from getting treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has something to do with the attack today, doesn't it?\u201d Clarisse asked, sitting in the meeting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ms. La Rue.\u201d Chiron said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Barrier failed, unlike this past year. I do not know what has caused this, but I do not know if the camp can withstand another attack of this magnitude. We must figure out why these monsters are acting different from the ones we have previously fought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's because the tree has been poisoned, centaur.\u201d Percy said, walking in the door. \u201cAnd we all know who would have done it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron nodded. \u201cYes. Luke Castellen.\u201d He said. 'It's turning out just as you said, Percy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what are you going to do about it?\u201d Percy asked, standing at the end of the table, looking at each and every councilor there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent, while every camper thought about just what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Oracle?\u201d The Apollo councilor asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Oracle would know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it be a quest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that it would be a good idea.\u201d Chiron said, nodding. \u201cBut who should go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurmur's filled the room. Who wanted to go up to the attic to speak with the Oracle? Who would be worthy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about war girl here?\u201d Percy asked, pointing at Clarisse. \u201cIf the Oracle tells her anything, she can try and prepare for the worst if need be. If it isn't her, then no harm done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone blinked at Percy, before talking amongst those close to them. It couldn\u2019t hurt, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so.\u201d Percy said. \u201cGet going Clarisse. The rest of you clear out. I need to speak with Chiron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, while the campers filed from the room, and Clarisse went up to the attic, Percy and Chiron went to his personal office.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clarisse looked around the, now neat and less creepy, attic. What little the Minions had left last summer during their 'raid' on Percy's orders had left the previously cluttered attic now spacious. What was left, such as useless trophies that even the Minions didn't want, were stacked and ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Oracle had been given a nice place to rest. The mummified corpse now sat in a special place, made specifically for it. It was a small, round table, much like one would find in a cafe or something similar. The Oracle was propped up, looking like she was looking at something as she leaned on the table. Several candles were around the room, though they had no wicks to light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse walked over, taking her seat at the table. She looked into the hollowed eye-sockets of the Oracle, feeling the woman stare at her from them, even if she wasn't alive anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse swallowed, her mouth suddenly feeling very dry. 'What's going on? I shouldn't be acting like this! I'm a warrior, and a damn good one at that!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what is my quest?\u201d She asked, mentally berating herself for stuttering in her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a gleam in the Oracle's eyes, as her jaw creaked open. Green mist spewed forth, the candles in the room flaring to life in various colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what appeared from the mist was not what Clarisse expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree beautiful women appeared around the table, looking at Clarisse intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Clarisse felt very, very small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello child.' One of the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do not fear us. We are... friends.' Another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-who are you?\u201d Clarisse asked, hands trembling slightly under their own power. Clarisse clutched them into fists, nails biting into the palms of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three chuckled, sharing a joke between themselves it seemed to Clarisse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do these answer your questions?' The last one asked, producing an item, along with the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spindle, a measuring rod and large scissors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree items that any demi-god knew were bad news when combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse felt her face pale, her eyes locked onto the three godly items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you're t-t-the f-f-f-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes child.' Atropos said, chuckling. 'We are the Fates.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We are the ones who control your destiny, and your life.' Clotho said, trying to sound menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be slapped by Lachesis. 'Stop that. We aren't here to scare her to death.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Correct. And we have other work to do.' Atropos nodded her head, ignoring her sisters. 'Now, Clarisse La Rue...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes?\u201d Clarisse asked, cowed in the presence of the three great beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't be afraid of us child. We wouldn't think to hurt you right now.' Lachesis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Besides, you serve the one we call husband.' Clotho said, mischievous glint in her eye as she waited for the reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse froze, letting that thought sink in. It repeated over and over in her head, pounding away at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think I broke her.' Clotho said, tilting her head as she looked at Clarisse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters sighed, looking at her. 'Give her a minute. I would not expect any less of this revelation.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though I am surprised that Percy did not tell her of us.' Lachesis said, her sisters nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strange. What reason could he have kept the knowledge of us hidden from her for?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perhaps he did not want her to get complacent?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or perhaps he just wanted to surprise her?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters looked at each other, then shrugged. Each was as possible as the last, the reasons Percy did not tell his servant about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what?!\u201d Clarisse suddenly yelled, her brain finally understanding and accepting what she was just told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It is as we said, child.' Atropos said. 'We call Perseus our husband, and you serve him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please, do not question us.' Lachesis said, making Clarisse fall silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You are here for your prophecy, yes?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To save the camp.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse nodded, still silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos laughed, patting the girl on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'As we said. Do not fear us. Your time is very far off, if it ever really comes. Now, hear your prophecy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You shall sail the iron ship with warriors of bone.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You shall find what you seek and make it your own.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But despair for your life entombed in stone.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And fail without friends, to fly home alone.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages flashed in the girls mind as the Fates spoke. An old battle ship, skeletons manning the deck. A golden ram, an island in the middle of monster infested waters. A large rock that even with her strength and ten warriors of equal standing they couldn't move, and the area around them was a deep darkness. And, for the last set, she saw her blood-stained corpse, no one around to mourn her, and her flying through the sky with... something. She couldn't tell what. She was still alone, but her heart felt light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she was back in the attic. Her skin felt clammy, but she was sweating. Her head pounded something fierce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you feeling fine?' Lachesis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wouldn't you know?\u201d Clarisse asked, trying to be respectful, but her head hurt too much, and her body, already fatigued with battle, felt like she had been tossed into a meat grinder. Twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True.' Atropos said. 'But the question still stands.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah.\u201d Clarisse said. She tried to stand, but the room was spinning. \u201cOough. My head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just sit back down. We have a message for you, that you can pass onto Perseus and the centaur if you want.' Lachesis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You can wait on taking the quest for a while. We are surprised that Perseus would send you up here so early.' Clotho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. Wait until the child-eater arrives.' Atropos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And ask our fear husband to give you some help to defend the camp. Not much, mind you. But enough to give you time to recover.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, there won't be an attack that bad for a while. But when it does happen, you'll know you should go.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d Clarisse said. \u201cI'll let them know.\u201d Her head still hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Such a good retainer.' Lachesis said, smiling. 'Don't worry. It will pass in a minute.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We should leave, sisters.' Clotho said, getting nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We'll be seeing you, retainer. Give our regards to the centaur.' Atropos said, her form dissipating into smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And be ready. The trials ahead will be... strange, to say the least.' Lachesis said, following her sister's exit with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And do not rely too heavily on Perseus. Stand on your own two feet, during these times.' Clotho told her, vanishing into smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe candles snuffed out, the smoke retreating into the Oracle's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a while before Clarisse could even stand again, let alone climb down from the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just what else has Percy kept from me.' Clarisse thought, before shaking her head. 'No. He's the boss, and he had a reason for not telling me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ With Percy and Chiron<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where was Dionysus during all this? I would at least expect him to pop in at any moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDue to the poisoning of the tree, even though it's only been a day, Dionysus has been called to Olympus. Again.\u201d Chiron said with a sigh. \u201cEvery time something comes up...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot surprised. He should be back soon then.\u201d Percy said, sitting in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well.\u201d Chiron said, looking over some camp reports halfheartedly. \u201cIt's all happening like you said Percy. The tree, the sudden assault, everything so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it was worse then what I remember being told. There were hundreds of monsters here today, bordering on a thousand. Kronos must have sent a lot more monsters, probably hoping that I wouldn't be prepared or the camp was less then defenseless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFortunately for us, neither of that was true.\u201d Chiron said. \u201cI don't think I've had to fight like that for years. And, to be honest, I really haven't missed it. But to protect and raise the Campers has been what I've done for so long. I wouldn't trade it for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Chiron looked old. Once again, it seemed as if his age was starting to catch up with his immortal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy opened his mouth to speak, when there was a knock on the door. \u201cThat's Clarisse.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in, Mrs. La Rue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open, the daughter of the goddess of war stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow'd it go?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d Clarisse asked, unsure if Chiron knew about the Fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, sure. Be back in a moment Chiron.\u201d Percy said, walking out of the room with his 'retainer'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked through the big house, empty as it was. If one looked hard enough out the front windows, they could just make out the dining pavilion. The campers that were well enough to stand on their own, and weren't still helping the wounded, were eating a dismal, but hard-earned meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?\u201d Percy asked nonchalantly, looking no worse for wear then he had when he entered the fray earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you know.\u201d Clarisse said, keeping her tone neutral. A surprise coming from a daughter of someone like Enyo or Ares before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFates showed up told you about our relationship, huh?\u201d Percy asked. He figured something like this would happen. He recalled them saying that they would handle any prophecies that revolved around him or any of the girls in his ever growing Harem. Didn't expect them to show up in person though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they did.\u201d Clarisse said, stopping to look out a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWondering why I didn't tell you?\u201d Percy asked. Again, he knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr did he?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cA little, yeah.\u201d Clarisse said. \u201cI know you have to have a reason for not telling me. Either that, or you just forgot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot.\u201d Percy said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat earned him a punch from Clarisse. \u201cLiar. You took that answer too quickly for it to be true.\u201d She said, silently wishing she could actually do some damage to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy laughed, patting the girl on the back. \u201cTrue, true.\u201d He said. \u201cTo be honest, I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to get complacent, thinking Fate would always have your back. I want you to fight fate as much as you can, even if it is impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds kind of pointless.\u201d Clarisse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but it means that you won't be happy just being a slave. I don't want slaves, Clarisse. I want people who can think for themselves. I already worked through that with the Minions, and I fixed that, for the most part.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse nodded. Percy had told her about what he had done to her, last summer. That necklace thing, and what it made her do. She knew he could have taken her, broke her and made her a mindless whore, and she would have thought it was what she should have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even with Echidna, the Chimera or Cerberus. Sure, he may have altered their thought patterns, or given them the capacity to think like a human and act upon it, but he never truly enslaved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, even Athena was technically free to do what she wanted. She just didn't want to, due to whatever it is Percy had done to her. Clarisse didn't know the details, but she knew that Athena was on their side now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint is, Percy never took away their free will, never forced them to do anything they absolutely detested doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the freaky magic that his book contained, he could have easily had them all eating out of the palm of his hand, sucking his cock or whatever it is he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they couldn't have done a damn thing to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Percy said, pulling her from her thoughts. \u201cAny reason why they would have shown up? They could have fed you the prophecy through the green smoke visions instead of coming in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse nodded. \u201cYeah. They said that I could wait for a few weeks. There wouldn't be an attack as bad as this one for a good while. If there is, I know when I should go. Wait until the child-eater arrives, or something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, right. Almost forgot about that stain upon humanities already blood-drenched history.\u201d Percy said. \u201cWell, you'll see in a week or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they also told me to ask you for some reinforcements. Nothing too big, but enough to help the camp recover faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, slowly. \u201cHmm, I can see that. Wouldn't be too bad to do so. I'll allow it. Expect them by tomorrow.\u201d He said. \u201cAnything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d Clarisse said with a shrug. \u201cSo, you plan on sticking around for a few days? Or are you going to go do some of that shady stuff you normally do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not entirely sure really.\u201d He said. \u201cI might stick around for a few days. I'm going to talk with Beckondorf about letting Tyson stay at the camp, help out at the forge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're cyclops half-brother?\u201d Clarisse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Does good work with metal, as befitting of a cyclops. But Tyson does it just a little better. Besides, he probably needs a break from being surrounded by sexy, scantly clad women as they work up a sweat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse hit him again. \u201cCould you stop thinking about women for once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn reality, not really. I find my mind being drawn to one woman or another. All I can really do is try and distract myself with planning and relaxing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy placed a hand on Clarisse's shoulder. \u201cSpeaking of relaxing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse blushed. Damned female hormones acting up around such a sexy, commanding warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, she was sixteen! Give her a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d She said. \u201cBut I get to be on top this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned, both lustily and challengingly. \u201cYou can try. I dare you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBet your ass I will.\u201d Clarisse remarked, grinning right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Percy said, before they were in a bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse turned to face Percy, but found him holding her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, the ones she had been wearing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse blinked, feeling around her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup. Definitely the ones she had been wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow'd you do that?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'd be surprised at what I can steal.\u201d Percy said, tossing the garments aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, without him vanishing from her sight, Clarisse felt a hand on her shoulder, and another tugging at her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her was... another Percy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo is a lot easier then three.\u201d Both Percy's said. \u201cLess focus needed. Easier to control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasier to act separately?\u201d One of the Percy's said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, me.\u201d The other Percy, the one that was just standing there, watching her, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill a hassle, seeing myself acting, or not acting, in real time when I know I'm doing both.\u201d The Percy said, pulling Clarisse's shirt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, enough of the syncro bull-crap.\u201d Clarisse said, pulling away from the Percy that was touching her. \u201cThat's really creepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Percy's chuckled. \u201cBut it will feel so good, Clarisse. For the both of us...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree of us?\u201d A Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSemantics, me.\u201d The other said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said stop with the double talking!\u201d Clarisse said. \u201cAre you insane or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably.\u201d Percy said, both of them shrugging. \u201cBut I also find it amusing when people freak out, thinking I'm crazy and talking to myself. That, and even though I have far better control with two bodies then three, it's still hard to keep my thoughts from slipping out of one mouth. A knee jerk reaction, really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Percy's closed in on Clarisse, wrapping their arms around her. \u201cDo you feel uncomfortable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf so, I can go back to one body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Clarisse was feeling a little uncomfortable. Two guys, even if they were technically the same person, and she was sandwiched between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with the Fates, Clarisse suddenly felt very, very small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, hey. This would be a first for her, and it was the same person. And if he ordered her too do this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he hadn't ordered her to do this, so it was entirely her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did she dare take it?</span></div></div>",

Semi-god? He was more then a demigod, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d The two voices of Perseus Jackson said. \u201cBut first, we should get you undressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do that-\u201d A cold breeze washed over her body, giving her goose bumps. \u201cMyself! Wait, when did it get cold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, neither Percy having stopped their manhandling of her body. Her nude, previously clothed, athletic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit doing that!\u201d She said, punching one of the Percy's in the chest, blushing as she was felt up even still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them chuckled again, holding up her missing clothes. \u201cLooking for these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey once again tossed the clothes away, the Percy in front of her pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse was about to ask what he was doing now, but she was stopped as her lips were captured in a heated, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Percy behind her chuckled, watching her melt into the kiss. Nothing like her mother during bedroom activities, surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that would come with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mouth was preoccupied, the Percy behind her dipped a hand down to her mound, tracing around it as he started to tease her stiff nipples instead of mauling her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse moaned into the kiss, the sudden assault of pleasure so, well, sudden. She should have expected it any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't expecting the lips that latched onto the side of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'One.' Percy thought, racing along two minds at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Two.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Three!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse was laying on a bed, Percy, in his two separate yet connected bodies, standing over her. She was gasping for air, trying to keep the raging flame inside of her under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so close too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had a knack for sexual torture, it seemed. The double assault had almost done her in quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up, looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn you.\u201d She growled, keeping herself from trying to induce the pleasure herself. It just wasn't as satisfying if she brought herself over the edge once Percy got her going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrust her, she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now.\u201d They said, the voice in stereo sounding just as weird as you could imagine. \u201cIt would be too easy for you to get it so easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chair in the room. Clarisse didn't know how she didn't see it before. It was a regal chair, almost like a throne. Red cushions, gilded in gold, exquisite craftsmanship. The works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Percy's moved to sit in it, lounging in it as two sets of eyes looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other moved to the bed, crawling behind her and grabbing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She asked, feeling a little more uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I would love to get right to it...\u201d The Percy holding her started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel it would be best to have a little fun first.\u201d The one in the throne said, grinning just a tad sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-\u201d Clarisse managed to get out, going to tell him off for acting like this and torturing her with sweet, sweet pleasure that was just out of her reach, when she was cut off as The Percy holding her hand slipped a finger into her velvet tunnel. \u201cOoh yeah.\u201d She said, trying to thrust into the hand as it slowly slid one finger in, and then another, and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly... she couldn't get that last push. She felt as she reached her pleasure high, fully expecting to find sweet release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gods!\u201d Clarisse moaned, thrusting harder and harder against Percy's hand. She could feel it... another orgasm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned, both of him, watching as Clarisse used his fingers to try and reach her climax to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother seal Percy had found. It would keep the person it was used on from finding their peak of pleasure, keep it building higher and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, he had only tested it once so far. On himself, technically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed it on his fingers, since the seal was small. Testing it on one of the Nymphs a few weeks back. Using only his fingers, he brought her to climax several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll without letting her cum once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nymph was surprised, at first, before he brought her to her second orgasm, without letting her cum again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the pleasure built, and built and built...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Percy brushed against her thigh with his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of his hand on her thigh alone had caused her to explode with her love juices, drenching the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was what he was doing to Clarisse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired beauty was thrusting frantically against his hand as Percy slowly, tortuously slid his fingers in and out, in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...\u201d The Percy on the throne said, his manliness rock hard as he eyed Clarisse's body as she started to lose herself to pure passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was starting to glisten with sweat, her chest heaving with her rapid breathing. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes starting to dull with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease... Let... me... cum...\u201d She breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Percy on the bed let go of her hands, which went up to grab his head involuntarily as she rode his hand for all she was worth. He used her other hand, seal applied of course, to spread her legs wide, giving the other Percy a good view of the girls sopping wet cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLetmecumletmecumletmecumletmecumletmecum...\u201d She said, barely breathing between words. She could feel her mind receding, one goal taking up her thoughts entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's eyes flashed, a strange, dark pink. \u201cYes... Debase yourself for me.\u201d He spoke, his voice a deep, sensual sound to any who could have heard. \u201cMoan at my touch, want nothing but what I am willing to give.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He had a front row seat for it, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched it with a sadistic glee. \u201cYes. Moan for my touch, filthy whore!\u201d He said, a lust-filled smirk on his face, his teeth showing slightly between cruel lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSea green flashed in his eyes as he gripped his head. The Percy on the bed did the same, brushing his arm against Clarisse's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl moaned, almost screamed, in pure ecstasy, staining the bed with torrent after torrent of her orgasm as she mindlessly humped the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, Clarisse fell to the side, panting. Her entire body was drenched in sweat, and her eyes were half-way rolled into the back of her head. She twitched every few seconds, still moaning with ever breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was panting as well, though for an entirely different reason. He had his hand in his hands, clutching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Percy on the bed vanished, leaving Percy with one whole mind, not dividing his attention between two that doubled the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn...\u201d He whispered. \u201cWhat was I about to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up, seeing the light of intelligence slowly return to Clarisse's eyes. Her breathing grew stronger, and slowly the spasms died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy got up from his chair, walking over to the bed. He sat down next to Clarisse, looking directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon Clarisse.\u201d He said, moving the hair from her face. \u201cYou can come back from this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-so good~\u201d She moaned, moving her face closer to his hand. Anything to touch him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnap out of it Clarisse.\u201d Percy said, grabbing her shoulders. Had he gone too far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease... Touch me...\u201d She said, her words slurred as she reached out for him. \u201cTouch your filthy whore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not a whore, Clarisse.\u201d Percy said sternly. \u201cCome back from this. I know you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he doing? Did he really just do this to Clarisse? What in the world had possessed him to do such a thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...\u201d Clarisse moaned, in slight pain this time. \u201cPercy... what happened?\u201d She asked, starting to come to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed in relief. It seemed she would be fine. Good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry about it. Just rest.\u201d He said, pushing her back on the bed gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse shook her head, trying to push his hand away. Still very sensitive, she moaned at his every touch, even the touch of the sheets was incredibly pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what happened?\u201d She asked, trying to keep the pleasure out of her voice. She really wanted to know what was done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don't really know.\u201d Percy said, grabbing a blanket from the side of the bed. He apparently had used this place before, and knew he would again, since there was fresh blanket. \u201cOne second I was myself, the next...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI just don't know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat. Happened?\u201d She asked again, trying to keep herself from demanding what he had done outright. The lingering wisps of pleasure still clouded her mind, but an aching pain was clearing that up, along with a case of dehydration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pursed his lips, displeased with the turn of events. He hadn't expected something like this to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA passion filled night, yes. Possibly give Clarisse one of the hardest, most pleasurable orgasms she would ever feel, yes.  Not suddenly having his usual personality do a complete one-eighty and almost breaking her mind and turning her into a mindless human fuck-toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's just say... you were this close to never thinking for yourself, or at all, again.\u201d He said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy said nothing, merely brushing his hands against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned, even now still sensitive to every touch, every sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy pulled his hand away, and Clarisse found herself trying to grab it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo~\u201d She moaned in disappointment. \u201cKeep your hand right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's the problem.\u201d He said, pulling his hand away, much to her disappointment. \u201cJust rest for a while Clarisse. You'll feel better in a few hours. I've got... something to check on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, wai-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the spot he sat. She didn't even blink, and he was already gone. She didn't even realize her hand was trying to grab at what wasn't there until it hit the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared blankly where he had been, her mind starting to really process what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit...\u201d She whispered, the truth hitting her like a freight train. \u201cFuck...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had sad that she was 'that' close to not thinking for herself again. The weight of that suddenly made her thoughts from earlier that night all the more true, and infinitely more terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse laid her head back down, her eyes looking up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust what really happened with you Percy?\u201d She asked no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have thought on this further, but her exhaustion was too great, and her mind too fatigued. Slowly, despite her fighting it, her eyes drifted shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going to happen now?' Was her last conscious thought before Hypnos claimed her for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was right to wonder what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Percy alright? If he was only just able to stop himself from destroying her mind, someone he had explicitly said he trusted and cared for, in some fashion, what was he willing to do to other women who he didn't feel so connected to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would think on it in the morning. Right now, she needed her rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad that rest would be plagued with nightmares of an sadistic, merciless Percy and her as a mindless whore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked along the banks of a river. Not <i>his</i> river, mind you. Well, technically, it <i>was</i> his river. In this world, all rivers were his. Like the trees, the ground, the bugs, the stars...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't the river he had taken from the river god, the first casualty of his gauntlets he almost constantly wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he could easily control his power now without them, but he had grown attached to them. Figuratively speaking of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an oddly satisfying feeling, being able to grab things that were otherwise intangible or impossible to hold in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave you ever held a star in your hands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, for a person who had been brought up as a mere mortal, even living the life he had lived as a son of a god and fighting supernatural monsters, to think of holding a star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially one he had created himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe're getting off topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked along the banks of <i>a</i> river. In his world, Poseidon didn't have eyes and ears everywhere. Outside the universe he had been born into, Poseidon was as powerless as any mortal against a titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant Percy could relax in the water. Not have to worry about his father calling on him or spying. That was why he actively avoided going to even small bodies of water, such as a small lake, in that world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was always relaxed by the water, even after declaring that he would not follow his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the Eronomicon had something to do with it. Maybe not. Percy didn't care too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. What he cared about right now was his actions just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had he done that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just, not even fifteen minutes prior, said that he didn't want mindless slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet what he had almost done to Clarisse would have been much, much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that just before he had snapped out of it? It was him, he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time, not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis 'dark side' perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs clich\u00e9 as it sounded, it seemed likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side, he had the Eronomicon slowly corrupting him to be more aggressive in his pursuit of women, loosing the chains of morality from his soul, and essentially making him into a horny devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew this, and he accepted it. So far, after two years of being around it constantly, since it was not only connected to him spiritually, but he also carried it with him wherever he went, he figured that something like this would have happened far, far sooner, if even at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn yet another side, he had the corrupting power of the Overlord and a dark god of all things evil, including lust, infused with his natural power. Gnarl, traitorous though he may have been, had been very knowledgeable about the power of an Overlord. Eres was even more so, since she had essentially become the personification of the one thing that knew more about the Overlords then Gnarl could have ever hoped to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second he donned that helmet and armor he had accepted the power of the Overlord. Just as he accepted the powers of the Forgotten god when he ruthlessly butchered the deity, absorbing his power into his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, after so long, had the two somehow merged, creating a split personality? The ruthlessly evil mentality of the Overlord of all thing Evil, and the goals of the Harem god, mixed into one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA truly terrifying combo, even to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was there some other explanation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it just a heat of the moment thing? It was the first time he had attempted such a thing, splitting his mind into two parts for something like that, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was worried.</span></div></div>",

It reflected back his image, a grim look about him. \u201cWhy did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sire, is something wrong?' Eres asked, communicating through the connection he shared with the tower heart. She, like the others who were connected to him such as Echidna or the Chimera, could feel his aggravation with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost likely.\u201d He said, not moving his stare from the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's the problem?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost went too far with Clarisse tonight.\u201d He said, not clarifying what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In what way? I know for a fact that you and her have been together before.' The ghost asked, clearly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost broke her, Eres.\u201d Percy said simply. \u201cAlmost destroyed what made her, her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah.' She understood now. 'Like what you did to Jewel that one time, a few years back?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cYes, like Jewel a few years back.\u201d He said, exasperated. \u201cBut, instead of that resulting from inexperience, this was the result of, seemingly, a split personality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really?' Eres asked, sounding intrigued. 'That is... very strange. I didn't sense anything different about you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don't say that.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI'm already worried enough about this as is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent, and Percy thought that perhaps the ghost was going to let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you intend to do about it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed again. \u201cI dunno. This doesn't seem like something I can ignore. Who knows when the split personality, if that's what it is, might pop up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent, as Eres thought over the words he had said. This was indeed a delicate situation. She could sense the undercurrent of worry in his mind, raging like a sea during a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perhaps you should speak with someone about this.' She advised, as she was supposed to. 'Someone to help settle your mind. The Mistress, perhaps?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded slowly. \u201cPerhaps... yeah. I will. Annabeth has the right to know what's going on. And the Fates, Melum, Medusa... Should also get in contact with Grover.\u201d He said, mind starting to plan. It was a simple plan, what he would tell them. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it distracted him for a little bit, despite thinking indirectly about what the problem was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Mistress is currently with her family, Sire.' Eres said, knowing he would go to her first. 'Medusa is currently working at her home. You know where Melum and the Fates are.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple matter for her to determine where the other women in Percy's harem were. If they were connected to him, they were connected to her, in some fashion. The blues hadn't been lying last summer when they told Clarisse that serving Percy left a mark on their souls. If she focused, she could even see what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cThank you Eres.\u201d He said, standing up and looking at the stars he created. \u201cI should go now. It would be better to talk about this sooner then later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It is no problem at all, Sire.' She said, and Percy saw the image of her bowing elegantly. 'I live to serve.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep an eye on my daughter, please.\u201d He said, before vanishing from the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres closed her eyes, sighing. 'This is strange. Why would something like this happen?' She thought, before dismissing it. The Overlord had given her an order, and she was bound to follow it. 'Let's see what the little terror is up to now...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing!\u201d Annabeth said, the knocking on her door ceasing when she had made herself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy!\u201d She cried, opening the door to see her love standing there. She quickly embraced him, something he returned with much gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's good to see you Annabeth.\u201d He said, holding her tightly to him with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I hear that Percy was here Annabeth?\u201d Came the voice of one Frederick Chase, coming from one of the rooms. \u201cOh... How good to see you Percy. Come in, come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, the man was unsure of how to feel about Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he had protected his daughter, and brought her back to him with not one single scratch on her. He was grateful for that, really he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time... His daughter wasn't the twelve year-old girl time demanded she should have been. She was older, having already blossomed into a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had, in no uncertain circumstances, told the man that it was his doing. That he had turned his little girl into the woman she was now, also having had physical relations with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrederick had, understandably, been upset about this news. So upset that, in a fit of paternal rage, he had taken the knife he was using to cut some frozen chicken and stabbed the semi-god with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had taken this very well, merely chuckling as he pulled the blade out, stained golden with his blood. After cleaning the knife, Percy had told the man that it was good that he was protective of his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut warned him to not try that again, under threat of very severe consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming both men down, Annabeth had told him what had, and would likely, transpire. The war, being flung back in time, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, save Percy's conquest of her mother. He didn't need to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr about the harem. She didn't want her father to have a heart attack, go crazy and try to brutally murder Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo.. it was kind of iffy on where exactly he stood with Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was fine with the guy, personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Mr. Chase.\u201d Percy said, waving to the blond-haired man. \u201cUnfortunately, Can't stay long. Urgent camp business. Annabeth knows what I'm talking about.\u201d He said, weaving both truth and lie together easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was urgent business, but not with the camp. On the other hand, there was camp business, and Annabeth did know what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was about to start heading there. Would have only taken me a few days, give or take.\u201d She said, letting go of Percy. \u201cLet me go grab my stuff first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran off, leaving the two most important men in her lives alone with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't... tense. A little uneasy, yes. But not tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d Frederick started, licking his lips. Percy seemed different then the last time he saw the teen. For one, his power had increased by an almost palpable amount. It was almost akin to a physical presence like the aura of other gods. One that screamed of power, even to mere mortals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the fact that Percy seemed to be... anxious about something. Not a good anxious, either. It was hard to tell, though Percy made no move to hide it outside his normal emotional state, which was an air of control and calculated calm. Whatever it was, it was something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow're Mrs. Chase and the other kids?\u201d Percy asked, making casual conversation. He knew the man was uneasy around him, and had the right to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Frederick said, unwilling to look Percy in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's good. Any monster attacks lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not for the past week. Something to do with the camp business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I'm ready.\u201d Annabeth said, coming out with a backpack and a suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe backpack had clothes and other necessities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit case on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, let's leave that as a surprise, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl hugged her Father, getting a farewell hug in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe safe.\u201d Was all the man could get out, his voice choking back sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry dad.\u201d She said, pulling back. \u201cI can handle myself. I've had to save his butt more then a few times, after all.\u201d She said, jerking her thumb back at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's right.\u201d Percy said, stepping up to grab her suitcase. \u201cAnd anything she can't handle, I won't allow to lay a finger on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, trying his best to fix a glare on Percy. \u201cIf anything happens to my girl-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be fine dad.\u201d Annabeth insisted, interrupting him before he could go into his incredibly protective father rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, sighing. \u201cI know, I know. Forgive a father for wanting his daughter safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine, Mr. Chase.\u201d Percy said, putting his hand on Annabeth's shoulder. \u201cWe should get going though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, stepping back from his daughter's grasp. \u201cI guess I'll see you soon then, Annabeth.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d She said, waving. \u201cBye Dad.\u201d She said, before her and Percy were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey appeared in the Dark tower, in the master bedroom. The pale moon shone through a large window, the doors out to the balcony opened as wind blew in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth blinked, looking around slightly confused. \u201cPercy, why are we here? Weren't we going to camp?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head, standing up from the bed where they were sitting. \u201cWhile we'll be going to camp, there's something I need to talk to you about. And that's the urgent business. The camp is fine, save a few differences in the strength of the monster attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth could tell Percy was shaken. He didn't show it, other then his pacing around the room. But, really, that was all she needed to see to know that something had disturbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's wrong Percy?\u201d She asked, getting up from the bed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stopped his pacing, opening his mouth before closing it again with sigh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI would have to say that the problem is myself.\u201d Percy said, starting his pacing again, not bothering to even look at the first Mistress of his harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about Percy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA split personality, maybe.\u201d He said. \u201cIt seems most likely. I don't think that, in my right mind, I would ever try and do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, please...\u201d Annabeth said, steeping into his path, finally getting him to stop. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed again, though there was a slight quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost did something horrible tonight Annabeth... Something that I didn't have complete control over.\u201d Or maybe he did, but he didn't want to think about that possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth moved closer, looking up at Percy's face. His brow was furrowed, and in his eyes she could see his mind racing. The slight downward curve at the edge of his lips showed her that he was thinking about something unpleasant, but necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was plenty worried, she knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for what reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was with Clarisse tonight,\u201d Percy said, stopping her before she could even open her mouth to ask her question again. \u201cFigured she should relax after defending the camp. And I wanted to try something special on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy started moving again, moving to the side of Annabeth. His form began to jump about the room, though it was likely he didn't even notice as he recounted the problem to Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt started out normal,\u201d There, on the far side of the room. \u201cForeplay and all. She had just gotten back from meeting the Fates for her quest into the sea of monsters.\u201d Now next to her again, his form flickering in and out of her conscious view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a really strange experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI split my mind into two pieces, wondering how it would feel to have two bodies fooling around at once.\u201d Again, he vanished, reappearing from the shadows, color slowly appearing on his silhouette. \u201cI was teasing her at first, hoping to give her a very pleasurable night using a new seal from the book that I found.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe often spent his time browsing through the Eronomicon, looking for anything that might either be helpful to him in the near future, or interested him. The girls knew he did this, since he made it no secret. It was no surprise when he found some new, interesting... thing... in the ancient tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d He said, his body slowly turning into the shadows themselves as he walked through a patch of them. \u201cSomething went wrong. With me, really. I kept up pleasuring her, even when her mind was starting to reach the limit. If I hadn't stopped myself...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared next to her again, but upside down, standing in the air. He shook his head, somehow not noticing where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't exactly know what happened, as I said.\u201d He vanished, appearing right-side up again as he continued his pacing. \u201cBut, for a brief instant, I didn't see Clarisse. All I saw was an object, given human form. To be used at my leisure. What did it matter if it had a mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy quickly shook his head again, clearing those thoughts. \u201cHer mind was almost shattered, seeking only pleasure, if even that. Quite possibly she would have retained only the most basic of brain functions to keep her alive, breathing and what not. Something... less. Less then an animal's instinct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe vanished, for the umpteenth time, appearing behind Annabeth, who was wishing that he would stay in one place, or at least on one plain of existence. He had stopped his pacing, almost none the wiser, with Annabeth looking around for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close to him. She looked up at him, meeting his downcast eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully, I was able to stop just short of breaking her.\u201d He said, looking directly at Annabeth. \u201cBut I don't know why this happened. Was it just a spur of the moment thing? A split personality? Something else entirely?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes, unblinking, looked directly through Annabeth, at something only he could see. \u201cTo be honest... I'm scared. What happens if this... whatever it is... happens again, and I can't control it? I couldn't bare the thought of losing myself to that, or you, Melum, Sally... anyone really. If it really is a split personality, what else would it be capable of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy let go of Annabeth, backing away. \u201cWhat lengths would it go to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth, to be honest herself, quite understandably scared. She had a good reason, more then a few in actuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, she needed to steel herself. Having a paranoid break-down wouldn't help anyone, nor would it help her try and figure out was plaguing Percy's mind; beyond his own assumptions, at any rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a shaky breath, Annabeth calmed her nerves. Enough to hold a conversation in the calmest voice she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, why exactly are you telling me this?\u201d She asked, turning around to look at him. \u201cI mean, I'm glad you're telling me that something's wrong, but why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy blinked, coming back to the present. \u201cI... don't know...\u201d He admitted. \u201cPerhaps it's the part of me, the old me, that always relied upon you coming up again.\u201d He walked back to Annabeth, standing in front of her. \u201cThat part that always relied on your quick thinking, your plans and intuition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised a hand to her face, gently stroking her cheek. \u201cI know you can't do much, if this is truly a darker aspect of myself. I couldn't expect you to. Using the full capabilities of the Eronomicon, with no moral boundaries, I doubt that any woman would be safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother prospect that was not comforting to anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I felt as if I should have told you. Perhaps... perhaps I thought that you might be able to help me think of something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a moment, the two of them just staring at the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth sighed, moving closer to Percy. \u201cI don't know what I could do to help with this, Percy. But what I do know is this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him with stern eyes, though not glaring. \u201cIt's not like you to be so doubtful of yourself. I know this is bad, especially if it is a split personality; But I know we can beat it.\u201d Her eyes softened, looking away. \u201cDon't know how... but I know we can. I know you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy did nothing, said nothing, for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a small grin, followed by a low chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs always, you're right.\u201d He said, shaking his head as his low laugh died off. \u201cCome hell or high water, I won't let this thing, dark side or otherwise, put me down or make me doubt myself. I really can't afford it, for me or anyone else. Nor will I allow it to do as it pleases.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that's the Percy I know.\u201d Annabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always know what to say, and when to say it.\u201d Percy said, looking down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a gift.\u201d She said playfully. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you're out of that mood, no matter how short it was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said, smiling down at her again. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime. Just don't make it a habit to start feeling so down on yourself. It doesn't suit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won't, I won't.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked out to the balcony, looking at the land, Percy's land, under the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe replica of the original Dark Tower stood tall, scratching at the sky. A giant black obelisk that was visible for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrounding the base of the tower was an extremely large city. Despite being night, there was still the sounds of hustle and bustle about, though not nearly as much as during the day. Blacksmiths were still awake, working on their wares underneath the cover of darkness, selling wares that they would otherwise have to compete for in the day. Merchants, for the most part, had closed up their shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly bars, taverns and inns were open in full force. The sounds of people partying, though very distant,  were able to be heard by Percy at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surrounding landscape was wide open plains. Though he could see the Ocean not far from the city. The beginnings of expansion already showed that he was having the city expand to the vast body of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly he knew what lay across those waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can't believe that you created all of this.\u201d Annabeth said, looking over the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy chuckled. \u201cSometimes, neither can I. Though I wouldn't say that it's all that great. I still have to create my own animals, natural formations, and continue expanding. If this is going to be my main base of operations, I will need a bigger world. Not to mention the stability, especially around the pathways. Have to make absolutely sure that they won't fall apart and have the void come pouring in, erasing everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure you'll do fine.\u201d Annabeth assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know I will.\u201d Percy said, his tone not conceited, only very sure of himself. \u201cBut I'm just thinking of the amount of work it will take that I alone can do right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked up at the sky, seeing his copy of the constellation of Zoe Nightshade amidst the stars. \u201cI have a few more things to do tonight Annabeth. Why don't I go take care of those real quick, and then we go for a walk on the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds nice.\u201d She said, leaning into his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it would. Why don't you go down and talk with Eres. I'll be back soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left, Percy gave his First Mistress a deep, loving kiss. It conveyed everything he wanted her to know. His love, obviously, but also his gratitude, his happiness, the joy of just being around her... Everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Annabeth opened her eyes again, Percy was already gone. Her arms hung in the air where she had circled them around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled up at the night sky, watching as the moon slowly sailed across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, she made her way back inside. She wondered what news there was of Percy's little girl. That was something Eres always loved to talk about.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy sat in the throne room of the tower, listening to the reports from the various leaders of the factions that made up the city. Merchants guild, the leaders of the construction teams, the (admittedly pointless, to him at least) expedition leaders that just returned from their latest ventures into this new world, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we believe that we have the resources to finish building the wall to the designated port area,\u201d A large, muscular man said, speaking for the construction teams. \u201cThough we know for certain that there won't be enough to start construction on anything in the area, such as warehouses, homes, inns, or a ship yard. Even then, it will take six months, at the least, to even finish half of the new city limits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you propose that it would be done, ports, housing and all?\u201d Percy asked. He expected something like this, but it was no major worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe builder's and masons all looked at one another, muttering a few things to each other before their speaker spoke up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout two years, at the least, Mi'Lord.\u201d He said. \u201cAnd that's if we work constantly, having teams during both day and night working on construction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy hummed in thought, placing his armored hand against his shadowed chin. It wouldn't do any good, working the people like animals. There would be accidents, people would be injured, and the construction would slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have two and a half years to complete the wall and port district. In three and a half years time, I want ships sailing across the waters. No need to put people in danger over a matter as simple as this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe builders bowed, each and every one of them. \u201cAs you command, Overlord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Percy said as his eyes looked over the gathered delegates of their respective communities. \u201cI believe it was the heads of magic up next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA robed figure coughed. It was a man, just under middle-aged. His hair was a shade of gold, and his skin was a tad pale. His body was frail, frailer then most men his age. He had, next to his chair, a wooden staff. Nothing out of the ordinary about it, save for the small runes that had been carved into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Overlord.\u201d He said. His body may have been weak, but his voice was strong. \u201cWe have little to report since the last meeting. As per your instructions, we have kept a close eye on our magicks for any loss, or changing, of power. One of the only thing that is of note is that our magic gets stronger near the 'pathway's' to our old worlds. Other then that, me nor my colleagues have had any problems with the universal transition with either magic or body. The only other thing that I can think of, off the top of my head, is that some of the more... eager... member's of the magical community have been hoping that you would release the ban on mixing magic from different worlds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Percy said immediately. \u201cUntil there is sufficient time and resources to build specific locations for such tests to take place, I will keep the ban in place. I am not so willing to allow possibly dangerous experiments to endanger the city, nor the stability of the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, leaning back in his chair. \u201cI thought as much. I may not be as experienced as some of the older member's of the various orders, but I have more then enough sense to not mix things like this haphazardly. I've destroyed many a good labs in my younger days, concocting both new magic and new potions. I know enough about unstable energies to understand the risk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would hope so, as the representative of magic in this court.\u201d Percy said. \u201cRemind the magic users that I will know if they start trying to experiment in this matter, and punishment will be severe. Also remind them that summoning outside forces, such as demons or gods that have not been cleared will result in the same. I don't want to have to fight another legion from the deepest pits of -\u201d Percy made a noise, an unnatural sound to be coming from human, animal or, as some could attest to, demon. \u201c-Again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore then a few in the room shifted uncomfortably, all having sudden, and very fierce, headaches. One man had to wipe some blood from his nose as his body twitched slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile knowing that Percy was, essentially, a god, and that he was prone to doing things that they couldn't possibly comprehend, such as the noise he made earlier, helped ease the blow of it, the point of the fact is that he could still do things that were so incomprehensible to them that it could kill them all with just a few sounds. And even still, knowing that he could do all this, still did not stop their minds nor bodies from reacting to his otherworldly actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-understood.\u201d The Wizard said, leaning back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eres, I want you to double the patrol's of blues in the city, and I want the green's and Browns to tighten security around the gates to the town.' Percy said mentally to the tower heart's personification. 'Starting tonight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At once Sire.' She thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy closed his eyes, looking at the heavens from his throne to see the position of the celestial bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis meeting has gone on long enough for today.\u201d Percy said suddenly. \u201cIf there are any important matters to discuss that need my attention right away, stay seated. Otherwise, you are free to leave. We can pick up again in a few days time, barring any sudden emergencies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people, for there were both men and women in that meeting, agreed. They had been in this meeting for more then a few hours. They had work to finish up for the day, and several had families to go home to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA retinue of browns entered the meeting hall, their normally air-headed personalities kept in check by the fact that Percy had commanded all minions to act seriously when these meeting's took place. Even from the simple-minded browns and bestial reds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as Minions, they were both compelled and happy to do so. Everything that they did, everything that they were... was for the Overlord. Their lives, their souls (If they had such a thing), their bodies... everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, did everyone at the meeting go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy watched as all the delegates stood up, muttering their farewell's to the fellow leaders of the community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How far we've come in such a short time.' Percy thought, waving at several who he had befriended during his time among them. 'Already a full blown city...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was mostly due to him, several powerful magic users and a very diligent workforce in the minions and humans alike. He had sculpted the land to fit a city of great proportions, while the humans and minions brought materials for building. The magic-users had actually constructed the city, though they had said that they would only do it this once, claiming it was a waste of their talents and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustified, in that any one of them could have leveled a city far grander by themselves as easily as putting on a magic show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only ones who weren't so adverse to the task, wholeheartedly accepting this task with glee, were druids and other types that used magic that could easily build something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very diverse city, with varying types living in it, all with their own thoughts on who a city should look. Their building styles reflected that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more nature attuned types had much more plant-life, for example. It was common to find homes that were made out of tree's that were grown just so, to provide a living space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, to counteract any problems that might have risen, Percy, and the faction leaders, had agreed to wall off segments of the city from each other. Not to segregate them though. It was a precaution, to ensure that the populace wouldn't overrun each other and cause undue problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simple to get through to whatever section you wanted to visit. There were gates along each wall, each half a mile away from the others. And, if you were on the opposite side of the city from where you wanted to go, there was an inner ring that allowed one to travel directly to other districts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis inner ring was directly outside the walls of the Dark tower, which stood in the center of the city. It would take half a day to walk around it completely, with the entrances to each district little more then a mile away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who made up the citizens of the city, you may ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch an answer can be both simple and complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short answer would be everyone, though without context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer answer would be everyone that Percy had come across during his travels that wished to move to a new city, providing they followed his rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people who would have died in the explosion from the fake tower-heart were the first to populate the world, though they were quickly joined by others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Percy had gone to other worlds, other universes, he had done much in little time. Though he had not particularly gone out of his way to save anybody, he had come across quite a few in different universes that had required assistance with dire situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers had joined him for various reasons. Some served goddesses that he had brought into his fold, others saw that what he offered would be beneficial to them, or any number of reasons really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just women that he saved and brought to the new city, though that had been the majority of the population. He brought men as well, as evidenced by the meeting just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he had, in no uncertain terms, told everyone who joined him just exactly what he was. A god of lust and perversion, and a hard but fair leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy, in a show of good will to the men and women with families, had given his word that he would not use his power in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may have gone against the nature of being the Harem god, but he was willing to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had his principles after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy mainly used the minions as the peacekeepers, with the smarter blues leading groups of browns, while separate groups that consisted entirely of blues walked around the town to keep track of the magic that was in use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowns and greens kept watch over the gates,with the greens making sure no one tried to get anything past the browns. Sadly, that was a simple task, hence the greens being there in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reds... well, the reds were kept in reserve. If the need ever arose to use them, then they were used. Otherwise, they were kept away from the city, mostly in the dark tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but Percy had the Blue minions working with the more responsible magic users to create a security net for magic over, and under, the city. That way it would be able to detect magic, what type, no matter what part of the city, to make sure that the ban wasn't broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should have been a simpler task then the language barrier's that allowed the people from different worlds to communicate easily, but it wouldn't seem to be. Apparently, breaking down language barriers that shouldn't have ever existed in the first place, due to being from entirely different universes in the first place, was simpler then detecting magic from different worlds. Though, obviously, there were just things not meant to be heard by mortal ears from any universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to say that only the minions were doing community work. There were 'human' guards for each district, all who had three 'human' commanding officers that each overlooked a third of the district, who in turn had a single, of course, 'human' commander above them that was the overseer of the entire district, who then in turn answered directly to Percy. Human being the term for any mortal being, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'pathways' that were spoken of earlier were actually outside the city, for the moment anyway, but all had outposts of mages and minions, the mages being stationed at the pathway to their own universe. While Eres was connected to them, it was nice to have people watching for anything that Eres might miss due to being busy with something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had created these pathways to connect universes that he had brought people from, or had connections or footholds in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of right now, since Percy had no power over time, nor a goddess who could control time, Percy had connected the flow of time in the universe to himself. However fast time moved for him, it moved for the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for around the pathways. Time was distorted around there, but not by much. The pathways speed up or slowed down the flow of time as one got close to them, causing strange phenomenon to those caught in it for extended periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only pathways in the city were buried far underground, so they would have no effect on it. The one to Percy's home universe, and the one that led to the universe where he was mantled Overlord, where the dark tower used to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the dark tower, it should be said that this was the only thing that he created within the city structure-wise, for reasons that only he knew. He had made it to serve as not only his home, but also as the prison, court house, palace and other community functions on the ground levels, and training grounds, living quarters for special guests that he allowed to stay at the tower, or, should he ever get any other then the minions, staff for keeping the tower in order. He also kept a lab up there for mundane, harmless experiments, though with very powerful magic and construction for protection. The same could be said of a personal forge, used by either him or Giblet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the area underground, which served as home for the minions, training area for new minions, a forge that tapped into lava veins for heat, an armory, a lab for the more dangerous experiments that Percy had started to preform, and an incredibly large audience hall for when he wanted to address all minions at once and in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the empty room, Percy had made the tower that way in case expansion was needed. After all, where would his future daughters sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just to top it all off, it was a fortress of its own class. Percy had planned, with help from great minds well versed in warfare, for any great attack. Percy knew he had pissed off a lot of the gods and goddesses whose universe's he had 'invaded' over the course of the last year. It would be no surprise to suddenly be in a battle against various gods and their armies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pathways were, unfortunately, a double edged sword. They granted Percy a way to easily traverse between them, and allowed mortals to travel between as well without asking Percy to take them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this also meant that <i>other</i> things could come through. Monsters, demons, gods and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was something Percy could not ignore. It was as likely as anything that a vengeful god would gather allies to launch a full blown attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even if Percy could deal with them, he knew there would be collateral. Even with the help of the greatest warriors and magic-users, there would be collateral, in life and land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprise that they hadn't been attacked yet, in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, shaking his head. It would not do well to dwell on events that may never occur. And even if war did knock on his door, he already had plans in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome may call him paranoid, but he needed to be prepared for absolutely anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the vast, infinitely expanding multiverse, almost anything was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he would, hopefully, be ready for it all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several days later, Percy was looking at the half-constructed dark tower, scaffolding and other such dotted the smaller replica of the tower he personally created. Old-time pulley systems littered the top-most completed floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy <i>could</i> have gotten cranes and other modern things that could have helped the construction, but there were two reasons he didn't. One, the minions, and Tyson, worked well enough without the machines. The other was that... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's just say minions did not work well with machines beyond steam-powered technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt always, <i><b>always</b></i> turned out badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not necessarily in funny or life threatening ways either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad I learned those barrier spells from \u0245\u0244\u0251\u0267\u0289\u028e\u02ab\u0416\u04b2\u1efb\u1f03 to make sure that planes and other stuff would fly around this. Dare I say it, it works better then the mist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of the incomprehensible name, a small area around Percy shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201d Percy chuckled a small bit. \u201cSeems not even Gaea can understand things from outside the universe. It must have given her quite a headache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy strode into the half-finished tower, the minions never stopping their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the minions, unsurprisingly, most were dressed in the bare minimum of clothing they could manage for the construction of the dark tower. Considering that mostly browns were working on the construction, that was bordering on bare skin. Anything that killed them would have killed a mere human several times over, so it's not like they could have been anymore protected if they wore work clothes of any type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, they had several teams of blues at the ready in case of any serious emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a rope snapping above Percy reached his ears, and a whistling sound was rushing towards him along with the sounds of breaking stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy merely looked up, hearing as, what he could only assume to be, a large load of rocks was falling from way up the tower. He could see the stone above him crack, small bits falling around him before the entire portion of the ceiling he was under collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Even without something controlling my life, it seems like my luck can be just as bad as usual.\u201d Percy muttered, looking up unworried as stone fell towards his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to raise his hand to do something about this minor annoyance, he felt someone charge at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy!\u201d A, distinctively male, voice called as Percy found himself being hoisted up from behind and carried out from under the debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, his carrier ended up tripping on their own feet, sending both crashing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy put out his hand, putting a crater in the ground as he pushed himself and his would-be savior from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyson...\u201d Percy said, keeping calm despite his irritation. \u201cGet off me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's cyclopian half-brother scrambled off off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He mumbled as Percy stood up and dusted himself off. \u201cForgot that Percy's really strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay.\u201d Percy said, patting Tyson on the shoulder. \u201cNo harm done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy thought it strange, being taller then Tyson. Instead of Percy being dwarfed by the young cyclops, Percy now stood nearly a foot taller. And while Tyson was built thicker with natural muscle, Percy could easily out-bear-hug his half-brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow's it been going Tyson?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cHave the minions been giving you trouble?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson looked over at the closest minions, which had already gotten to cleaning up the pile of rubble, and blushed as he quickly looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy laughed, patting Tyson on the shoulder. \u201cIt's okay Tyson. Come on now. Eres told me you wanted to show me something?\u201d He said, pulling the embarrassed monster away from the main area of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson's mood did a one-eighty, going from embarrassed to excited almost immediately. He was bouncing in place, grinning ear-to-ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Percy and Tyson walked to the latter's room, something in the darkness slithered behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are great Tyson.\u201d Percy said, rolling up the last paper and setting it back on the table. \u201cI'll see what I can do to get you the materials and send these plans to the minions in charge of construction. And I'm sure Giblet would like to see some of these herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had finished going over the last of Tyson\u2019s design plans, for both the tower and other projects. While Percy would admit that Giblet was good at making armor and weapons, and the minions were a good workforce, a cyclops was naturally better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson was grinning still, happy that his idea's were worth something. And, having met the leader of the brown minions personally and seen her work, Tyson felt like he had won the lottery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson's room was fairly large, even for someone Tyson's size, with various little projects Tyson had going on at the moment scattered around, but not in the way of anyone's feet. Even more numerous were sketches that Tyson had made. Weapons, armor, anything that he felt like drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Annabeth was surprised with how much detail the cyclops had put into the sketches for whatever he planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what.\u201d Percy said. \u201cWhy don't we go into town and have some fun. A reward, and to say sorry for not coming around very often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Tyson cheered, wrapping his arms around Percy in a tight hug. \u201cThank you Percy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem big guy.\u201d Percy said, returning the hug.</span></div></div>",

No animals were foraging, nor bugs buzzing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely silent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo a normal person, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can come out now.\u201d Percy said, stopping where he was. \u201cI can hear you, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA presence, one that had been following him around the tower and the surrounding areas all day, slithered from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering when you would acknowledge my presence.\u201d The faceless voice said, moving around the darkened forest. \u201cYou know I hate being ignored for long periods of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy chuckled, not even turning to look as his stalker closed the distance from behind, slender arms wrapping around him and two mounds of flesh pressing into his back. Hot breath tickled the back of his neck as a long tongue flicked out to lick him. Around his feet, a long serpentine tail was wrapping around him in a vain attempt to hold him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving fun?\u201d Percy asked as four sharp fangs were drawn across his neck, trying their hardest to make him shiver in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery much.\u201d The voice said, laughing at how he kept his poise in a situation that would make most people turn into a blubbering mess. \u201cAnd you? Are you enjoying my attentions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery much.\u201d Percy parroted, his legs completely wrapped in the coils. \u201cThough I must ask, where are Pe\u00edsma and the Chimera, Echidna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleeping.\u201d The mother of monsters said. \u201cThey were picking fights with the others, as usual. Today was a particularly energetic day for them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cI hope you find your new body, and the abilities it gives, suitable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchidna chuckled, letting go of Percy as her upper body moved into his view. \u201cI certainly do, my love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere once her skin was tinged green and had scales on her arms, she now had unblemished, chocolate colored skin. Her hair was as long as ever, and her breasts had not diminished. Her pupils were slits, like a snakes, the previously sickening yellow from before Percy had changed her was glowing a hypnotic golden even in the shadows beneath the trees. The necklace Percy had given her was still around her neck, the charm of a small platinum heart with a diamond center hidden in the valley of her chest. Her stomach was slightly taut, a small layer of muscle being the only sign of her extraordinary strength as a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her waist down, though, was something completely inhuman. It was a large, snake like body, currently wrapped around Percy. It was covered in green scales, which shone like emeralds when exposed to light. It was about seven feet long, from where it started to the tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail tightened around Percy for a second before letting back up as Echidna moved her face near Percy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say though, the only things I liked about my human body were being able to walk among humans and laying with you.\u201d She trailed a few fingers across Percy's face, a sharp nail drawing golden blood from him. \u201cThough I'm sure if you were willing, we could... experiment... with this form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. \u201cI'm good. While I may be fine having sex with a furred person and demons, I'm still not sure about having sex with something whose lower body isn't humanoid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pity.\u201d Echidna said, a slight frown on her face. \u201cBut I'm sure at some point you'll decided to try it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably.\u201d Percy said, shrugging. \u201cI really wouldn't doubt it, given my nature. You'll be the first one I ask though, when that day comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchidna smirked, patting him on the cheek. \u201cI would hope so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned her face in, flicking her tongue out to taste his blood before tenderly kissing the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lower body uncoiled from around Percy as she continued to lavish affections on him, and he lavished affection on her in return, wrapping his arms around her and hitting the right spots on her back to give her a pleasant feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchidna moved away, leaves crunching under her now human feet, scales negating any need for shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut for now, this form will do.\u201d Echidna said, her eyes filled with the utmost love as she leaned against a tree, spreading her legs. \u201cTake me Percy. Fill me with a new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at Echidna for a moment before walking closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, there was one Nymph that got no sleep as her home was shaken and a woman moaned into her ear.</span></div></div>",

Not created a copy. I know you said that you were working with something when I sprung the sudden, urgent request on you, but even still...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>To be fair, I have apologized countless times for that. Not only that, but I distinctly remember you asking for something to preserve her soul, no matter what. Technically, I did as you asked. You could have given the soul a new body... But perhaps it is because of the way this world works. It is easy for someone like yourself to go to the land of the dead, and it would be far from the realm of imagination for you to go there and happen to run into the true spirit of your mother</b>.' The Eronomicon said. <b>'But I am sure that this will do exactly as needed. Restore the eye sight of these three women, and the de-aging seal has been worked into each seal so they won't be ancient in appearance</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, fishing out a golden drachma from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeen awhile since I spoke in ancient Greek.\u201d Percy said. \u201cThough, thanks to you,\u201d he said, patting the book in his pocket. \u201cI guess I shouldn't have to worry about it. Still, it's still a pain having you cram as many languages into my brain as you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'It is for the best, Marked one. Otherwise, you would not have been able to communicate with people of other universes, among other things. In any case, I haven't even gotten to the more powerful languages yet, despite what I have already given you</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cI know, I know. You told me that before. By the way, how long do you think that it'll take for you to cram all that language stuff into my head? I've been curious about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eronomicon was silent for a moment, though Percy swore he heard muttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Given how fast your limits are breaking now, and based upon that knowledge alone without factoring in future power spikes and increased growth speed provided by women... I would hazard a guess of about thirty five to seventy years, give or take</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a pretty big gap in time.\u201d Percy said, eyebrow raised questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'True, but it also depends on if certain languages are needed faster then others. There are so many languages still to come, quite a few dwarfing what you already know in power, complexity and size. I find that it would be easier to work with the simpler things right now, work your way up in difficulty and make it easier to learn the more complex ones. As I said, I might need to force the knowledge into your mind instead of letting if flow, as I am now. Though, if you were to ascend, that would cut down on the time drastically.</b>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow drastic we talking about?\u201d Percy asked, flipping the golden coin and catching it repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Down to, at max, three years, with a minimum of six months</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy whistled, grabbing the coin for the final time. \u201cWell, as interesting as that is, we have work to do. We can talk more about my ascending to godhood later, and the fringe benefits it would give.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the coin in his hand, imprinted with the empire state building and Athena\u2019s head on the sides, Percy tossed it in the middle of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>St\u00eathi, \u00d4 h\u00e1rma diabol\u00eas</i>!\u201d Percy shouted, the ancient Greek rolling off his tongue easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to other languages, it was a trivial matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could ask any one of the woman he had been with. His tongue could do amazing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteresting how that worked, in all seriousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the coin had landed, the area around it began to smoke, the asphalt bubbling up as it turned to a deep, dark red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no notice, a black, smoke-like taxi burst from the red ooze. It leaped from the seemingly bottomless murk at full speed, landing many feet away with a screech of the tires as it drove wildly, turning and jumping the curb more then once as it sped back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPassage? Passage?\u201d A mumbling, ancient voice asked from the crack of the passenger window as the taxi skidded to a halt in front of Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm here for business... Tempest is it? You should have been expecting me sometime this week.\u201d Percy said simply, not making a move towards the vehicle of the damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went silent in the taxi, not even the breathing he had heard incredibly faintly, even for him, was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d The same voice said, merely a whisper and now focused. \u201cYou are the one we were shown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Another voice said, the same intensity but at the same time sounding very bitter. \u201cEnter, enter. We would like to get this business down with and out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back door popped open, wisps of blue smoke wafting from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged his shoulder's, climbing in back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door shut behind him, the ooze from before boiled from beneath the taxi, which slowly sank into the bloody abyss without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taxi rose from a the abyss, at a much slower pace then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked out the window, taking notice of where they had ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were on an island, Percy knew. It was also very cold, if the snow was any indication. Lifeless trees dotted the over-all bleak landscape. Ice floated just off the edges of the beach that Percy could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn empty, dark sky hung above, stuck in perpetual night without the stars or moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow there was any light, Percy didn't exactly know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up Anger.\u201d One of the three said, voice as cold and bitter as the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't start with me Wasp.\u201d The sister behind the wheel snapped. \u201cIf you would give me the eye, I could see exactly where I was going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't have it.\u201d Wasp said. \u201cTempest has been hogging it all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Anger would give me the tooth, I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Percy said. He was not going to listen to three old ladies bicker about who had what body parts they had to share. \u201cI will say this, if our meeting goes well today, you won't have to worry about such matters again. But I will not listen to this drivel between you the entire time. If you want any chance of being freed from your current torment, I suggest you three keep your tongues in check. Whichever one of you has the eye, give it to the one driving. The other two can fight over the tooth for all I care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, leaning back into the beaten-up leather of the cab, which seemed similar to the clothing and leather you could find made out of damned souls in the underworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many different types of material did they manage to work souls into in this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's hell was only able to torture people ironically. A dwarf turned into a golden statue for instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should ask Hades how he did things like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grey sisters muttered in anger, sickening sounds as they switched out the eye and tooth between the three of them. Wasp and Tempest were fighting over the tooth as Anger stuck the eye-ball into one of the empty sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Percy muttered, rubbing his forehead as he tried to ignore the pink aura around the three ancient women as their faces tried to imprint themselves into his mind with the words above their heads. 'I really don't want to remember what they look like now.' He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sire, I wanted to remind you that the empire will be approaching Nordburg in less then a week, about five days, according to the time of this world.' Eres's voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed again. 'Okay. Have Jewel deliver the last gift, and get the brown minions ready to move for assistance. I'll even allow them to take the wolves for this.' He ordered. 'Now, please, no more interruptions. If anything comes up, I want you to hold it off unless it is of the utmost importance.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'As you wish, Sire.' Eres said, the image of the ghostly personification bowing reached Percy's mind as her presence faded from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope this meeting goes well.' Percy thought, going back to his current situation. 'And I hope that the Fates are already there.'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The chariot of the damned reached the crest of the hill it was climbing, all four of its riders silent. The sight of the beach was lost long ago. But nothing else had changed with the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could see through the windshield that the house of the Grey sisters was not large, by any means, nor grand or even in good repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rundown house, with the paint, if there had been any, long stripped away. The shingles were falling off, and the cobble-stone chimney was half gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good thing about the house was that, despite all its faults, it looked well insulated for what it was. The windows seemed secure, there were no visible holes and the door looked very solid and heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTempest, did you leave the fire going again?\u201d Anger asked her sister. \u201cIf you did, I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn't me. Wasp dealt with the fire before we started today's rounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't blame me. I distinctly remember putting it out. Even shoveled the ashes because you two are too lazy to do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you take that tone with me!\u201d Anger and Tempest said at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, there was a large pile of ashes, almost covered by snow. It was just to the side of the door, but enough to not get in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me the eye, I want to see!\u201d Wasp said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Anger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, let's leave the details to the imagination for how she extracted the eye, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat going on?\u201d Wasp asked, feeling rage build with her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy saw it as well. A smoke trail from the broken chimney, and an orange glow in the windows of the derelict abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, seen only to him, three pink aura's were in the home, sitting around what he could only assume was the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems the others are here.\u201d Percy muttered to himself. \u201cGood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. He should have expected something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo small amount of yelling had taken place in the last ten minutes, most of it just just the screeching of pure anger and hatred. Objects had been thrown and broken, and Percy had more then once had something directed towards him, which he casually avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos looked at Wasp, her face emotionless as both sets of sisters stared down one of the opposite group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you quite finished?' She asked, rubbing the charcoal marks from her face and smoothing out her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClotho and Lachesis did the same, never taking their eyes off their would-be attackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst they had done was give them a crappily done makeover with ancient utensils and ruffle their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind you, this was in an attempt to kill them with said utensils, probably in a gruesome fashion that included breaking their teeth and trying to cut their faces, smash their bones and various other ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters Grey were breathing heavily, their faces slowly returning to a normal shade instead of the outlandish red they had sported not even two minutes ago from their attempt to scream the Fates into non-existence, damning their very names and curse everything they had ever done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, what anyone normally did if they met the Fates if they had a bad life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, for once, it was justified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that that's over,\u201d Percy said as he stood up. \u201cShall we get to what the point of this entire thing was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone made it clear he was not in mood to deal with annoyances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Anger yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Tempest shouted, banging her old hands on the table with a surprising amount of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even after the end of time!\u201d Wasp raged, they eye glaring at all of them simultaneously in a frenzied manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy rubbed his head. 'Keep calm, this was as expected for the most part.' He said, trying to calm himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about an hour since this discussion started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, it would have only taken five, maybe ten minutes to have the Fates say their part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only the sisters Grey would let them speak for more then a minute without starting back in or just getting up and leaving before Percy had to bring them back in forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again, this was expected for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe true extent to their hatred was far beyond even Percy's expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't really see what you have to lose just by thinking on it.' Clotho said, still emotionless as she looked at the three people who hated them the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. We are offering not just our apologies, but also a way to fix what even we cannot.' Lachesis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And do not resort to petty violence again.' Atropos warned, the only emotion she had shown for the last hour. 'As with last time, it will have no effect other then mess our appearance up. But if you do that again, there will be consequences.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can take this 'deal' of yours and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Percy shouted, at his limit. He slammed his hands on the table, smashing it into pieces. \u201cEnough of this asinine bickering! I don't care what was done to you, but you have no reason to continue acting this way! They are trying to amend for what they did to you, which is a lot more then anyone from Greek history has ever done without being forced to do so! Are you going to let this chance to be free from your curse slip through your bony fingers because of some petty grudge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you call this petty!\u201d Anger snarled at him, not fazed by what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I dare this petty!\u201d Percy shot back. \u201cHow many more people have had far worse punishments then you three? At least you can see, at least you aren't in pain every day! At least you aren't alone, stuck on an island for just being someones daughter! You haven't faded!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stood, standing on the debris of the table as he looked at the ancient sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd face it! You brought this on yourselves. You were already powerful enough seeress's on your own, from what I've been told. Sure, the Fates could have gone about it better, and maybe they let their pride get in the way for once during their work, but you were prideful as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey made us! They controlled us, as they do everything!\u201d Wasp shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't seem to understand where we are coming from.' Clotho said, her voice suddenly very cold and bitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You do not truly understand our power, or even the limitations set by it.' Lachesis said, glaring right into the empty sockets of Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though we may weave the lives of every thing in existence, we are still bound by laws. Just like everything else.' Atropos said heatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We may weave all destinies, but we must do so with the thought of how each person must act in order to get there.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like a story-teller of the olden days, there must be structure for it to work.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If there was not, it would be chaos.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We cannot make things with no precedent happen, at least by ourselves.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You yourselves truly wanted power you did not need. We did not make you want the power.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It was simply the place you ended up on the road of choices that make up both life and destiny.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And even then, this is simply a very, very simple understanding of our power.' Clotho finished, her voice never warming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don't give a-\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI said enough!\u201d Percy roared again, Riptide appearing in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe less powerful trio of sisters flinched, all taking a step back. Even the ones who didn't have eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perseus!' Lachesis said, reaching out to grab his shoulder. 'Don't kill them!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy turned to look back at the Fates, his eyes glowing green, though they did flick to pink for a second, fast enough to where even Lachesis wasn't sure she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not going to kill them.\u201d He growled. \u201cBut you really won't care what happens to them in a minute. Or they, in turn, care about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head back to the three ancient women, shaking as he held his sword at the ready. He could easily see the bond the three shared with the Fates. It was the biggest bond they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthereal ropes, about a foot wide each, stretched from the hearts of the sisters, black with hatred and pulsing like the heart of a live beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were smaller threads, connecting to far off places in different realms and planes of existence. Some were so tiny to almost be non-existent, while most were still tiny, but big enough to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no warm colors, nothing to signify that these women had an emotional attachment that was made from anything other then indifference and hatred. No signs of respect, nor compassion, or trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even between each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could see the names tied to each string that ran from the sisters Grey. He could see every single person they had ever met, even the dead and forgotten, or even the people they merely saw for the briefest of moments out of the corner of their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the bond they had with him was black, and growing larger by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy raised Riptide, swinging twice at the three largest bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, most of the tension was gone. The hostile air was gone, though replaced with the sudden air of complete indifference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just as smothering, to be honest, but in a vastly different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the bond between them and himself was changing, going back to a small indifference, though not on the level between the two sets of sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Those bonds were completely gone. Even looking directly at the others didn't create a bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bond between them and him was, by proxy, through the Fates. That's why the animosity was fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're leaving.\u201d Percy said as he turned towards the Fates, Riptide disappearing. \u201cThis was utterly pointless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head back, looking Wasp directly in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wasted the first time you have been truly given completely free-will. Now you're going to be stuck like that, with no one to hate, no true drive. There was no controlling anybody here, neither from myself or these three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned, walking to the three Moirae, who didn't even regard the three other women's existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you think on this deal further though. I might offer it again, possibly with some changes to it though. Until then, you can stew with the thoughts of have a chance for freedom at your grasp, but you pushed it away by being petulant when they tried to make amends, even if you couldn't care less about what they did now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't need the power of the Severer to know that the string connecting them was growing black once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the group of four vanished from the island as the Grey sisters raged at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of them appeared in the chamber of Fate, Olympus far below their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is probably going to bite me in the ass later.\u201d He muttered. \u201cSomehow always does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the bed, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need something to calm my nerves. I can't believe it was that... that...\u201d Percy growled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Fates sat on the bed, sighing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot in anger at the Grey sisters, but in exasperation as the fact that Percy's plan didn't work. Wasted time, when they could have been working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, they felt like something was missing. A guilt of some kind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, didn't you say that there was something special about your sword Percy?' Lachesis asked, pondering what this feeling was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh, right. I only mentioned that in passing. The Eronomicon had a blade in its possession to fight against beings who grew stronger the more people felt about it, be it fear or love. It's called the Severer, and it cuts the bonds between people. No trace of emotion between them whatsoever. You might even forget them in a few days. It did me the favor of mixing it with Riptide. Ironically, I did this for sentimental reasons. But I don't need to tell you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So your saying you used this...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'On us?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said, sighing angrily. \u201cI was tired of hearing the same thing over and over again from them. You should have seen it though. The amount of pure hatred they held for you... I don't think I saw something like that. It was disgusting.\u201d He said, voice mirroring his revulsion for what he saw. \u201cIt needed to be cut down. And really, it's a just punishment. For so long, they thrived off of hating you. Now, they have nothing to hate. They let it all slip through their fingers, just because they hated you all so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent as Percy leaned back on the bed, taking some comfort in the sheets of darkness beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You look so tired.' Atropos said, leaning back onto an outstretched arm, placing a hand on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. Forget what happened. Relax for a while.' Clotho whispered sensually as she did the same to the other arm, also placing a hand on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You did what you could to mend the situation. For that, you deserve a reward~\u201d Lachesis giggled, her thoughts turning from the apathetic conversation they had been having to thoughts of something far more precious to her and her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime with Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis stood up, not having an arm to lean on. She moved between to stand over Percy, between his legs as they were firmly planted to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned down, laying directly on top of Percy, giving him a full kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLachesis moaned into the kiss, her fingers entwined in Percy's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy couldn't help but smile between the kisses, a soft chuckle escaping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could spend a day or so here. I really don't spend enough time with you three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's fine, dear husband.' Clotho said, hushing him with her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We are very busy, you know. And you have your own plans.' Atropos reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though,' Lachesis started, pulling away with a coy smile. 'It wouldn't hurt for you to come around more often, now would it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in the slightest.\u201d Percy said with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, another Percy appeared, walking silently over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he was in place, Percy smirked playfully at Lachesis as the body he had faded, leaving the Fates flat on their bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mere you!\u201d Percy said, picking Lachesis up by her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, there was much bonding between the Fates and Percy. Not just sexual bonding, but emotional bonding and family bonding as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, uncle. How have things been around here?\u201d Percy asked, tossing the red rubber ball in his hands across the fields of Asphodel for what seemed the thousandth time that day, Cerberus happily chasing after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame thing that's been happening since I took this position.\u201d Hades said, relaxing in a smaller, less ornate throne. \u201cThough I've been trying to make time for my children, whenever I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is their training coming along since I last saw them by the way?\u201d Percy asked, sitting across from his uncle at a small table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was, obviously, visiting the underworld. He had come to check in on Cerberus and his cousins training, among a few other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were currently sitting outside the palace, off to the side in what amounted to a picnic area outside the normal garden of Persephone. It was a nice place to relax after a day of attending to the duties it took to run a kingdom, living or dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades sighed, rubbing his eyes in exasperation. \u201cI detest these rules that I have to abide by. I can only leave cryptic messages to their instructors for them to figure out, which can sometimes take the better part of a week. But they are progressing nicely, I'm happy to inform.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's nice to hear.\u201d Percy said, taking the ball from Cerberus as she ran up to him, chest heaving as she took deep breaths. She was panting, tongue lolling from her mouth as she kept her eyes fixated on the ball to the extent. \u201cBy the way, how do you turn tortured souls in clothing and the like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat's a sudden subject change. Might I ask why the sudden interest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged, throwing the ball again, this time to the other side of the sprawling field. \u201cSome souls have started getting used to the torture that they've been subject to for so long. And I figured that the souls that are no longer receptive to the torture might as well be put to some use. After all, I'm sure I can figure out a way to make them useful for more then clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades chuckled, a deep baritone laugh. \u201cVery well. Normally, the soul needs to be dipped in the atrocities that it accumulated during life...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Several hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d Percy said, stroking Cerberus's sleeping head as she laid it on his lap, snoring softly. \u201cI'll have the reapers get right on that. Things like that are their specialty, after all. And Uncle, one more thing I would like to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it's about Bianca, my answer is still the same.\u201d Hades said, sounding only what a loving and protective father could sound like. \u201cIf you can win her heart, without your tricks and divine powers, then she will be yours. But be warned, that if I think that you are cheating in your attempts to court her, I will kill you. Immortal or not, and even if I die in the process, I will kill you. The treaty we have be damned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. And as I said last time, I would abide by your rule, as one god of the dead to another. I assure you, I wouldn't misplace the trust you or Bianca have in me. Besides, I mostly prefer to have some attachment to the women I bed.\u201d Percy assured, keeping it to himself how it was getting harder to care these days about something like an emotional attachment. \u201cBut I think we should go check in on them, to see how well their training is going. Maybe give them a little spar.\u201d Percy said, carefully picking Cerberus up, making sure not to wake the demon-dog woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Several hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy whistled, standing at the shore of the river Styx in a small cave-like inlet. He waited, looking over the black water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the blue minions effort, and actual effort on part of Styx herself, the water was less polluted. The oily substance, while still there, was reduced greatly from what had been far worse then Percy imagined. Less debris floated down the river as well, though there was still much of it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that the debris that floated down the river was the regrets and dreams of the dead, made manifest by the great amounts of Mist that was contained in the underworld. It only appeared on the river Styx for a few reasons, namely the concentration of souls that crossed and their lingering sorrows, which were then in turn manifested by the magical force as they made their journey with the Ferryman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Charon being stubborn about taking people across, there was enough backed up sorrows to keep the river polluted for thousands of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the blues had figured out a way to filter, so to speak, the magic from the debris, causing it to vanish and disperse into the mist that made it up. These arrays of magic runes were all along the river's length, dispersing more and more as they floated down the river's current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was only so much magic that could be dispersed at once, so it wasn't a like a catch all net. Things still got through all the time, and some of the more condensed regrets had to reach the river Lethe to finally disperse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, all in all, it was much better then what it had been. The major problem was still the oil though, as the promises of the gods, or invoked in Styx's name, could not be so easily cleaned. Too many promises had been made in the titaness's name, and the water was still covered in the manifestation of broken or unfulfilled sacred promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched as Styx stepped from the river, her skin dripping with water. Her eyes were locked on him, her lips curled up into a sultry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Perseus.\u201d She said, wrapping her arms around his shoulders and giving him a kiss of the cheek. \u201cWhat brings you to my little part of the underworld?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was visiting family here in the underworld, checking in on how Nico and Bianca were doing with their training.\u201d He said, wrapping his arms around her waist. \u201cI figured I'd stop on by to see how the river's cleaned up since last month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve cleaned up very well, as you can see.\u201d She said with a coy smile, pressing herself closer against Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was talking about the actual river,\u201d Percy said, teasing her. \u201cBut I can't ignore the lady of the river when I make that statement, now can I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would hope not.\u201d She said. \u201cBut you know I can't stay mad at you.\u201d She said, nuzzling her head into his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Percy said, almost sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut enough about that. How long will you stay?\u201d She asked, her eyes lighting up in joy at the mere prospect of him sticking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA while. I was going to try my hand at helping clean up the river, and just spend a little time with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, we should get started.\u201d Styx said, moving her arms down his back. \u201cI know a spot that has need of your... <i>cleaning</i>.\u201d She said hotly, a small laugh at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed back from him, out of his grasp. Turning, she ran back to the water and dove in, disappearing beneath the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy grinned. \u201cTease.\u201d He said, running after her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOoh Yes! Right there!\u201d Medusa moaned, writhing under Percy's touch. \u201cDon't stop! Don't ever stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy chuckled, removing his slick finger's from the woman's body. She moaned at the loss, feeling all strength leave her body. She didn't want the feeling to end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I can't do that.\u201d Percy said, chiding her in a teasing tone. \u201cBesides, I wanted this to be special. For a job well done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease... I need your magic fingers Percy~\u201d Medusa said, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you've had enough for now.\u201d Percy said, walking over to a desk. \u201cBesides, don't want my massages to ever lose the magic touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a towel he had set there, Percy wiped the massage oil off his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Percy was in Medusa's apartment, just above Sally's own. The massage was a reward for keeping up with her job, which Medusa had, at first, been reluctant to accept. But she found that she enjoyed it, and was quite good at it, thus taking the job to teach. The only part she wasn't fond of was having to grade the projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a rose from a vase, Percy smelt the unassuming flower. To him, it was as good as a normal rose. To women, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis rose was a particular kind. Percy had only given out two of them personally, last summer. One to Medusa, and the other to the waitress in the diner in Denver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese roses would draw women in, like a fly to honey. They would desire the flower, and they would take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was when the trap was sprung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would, inevitably, prick their finger on it's thorns. In doing so, they would begin to obsess over him, and him alone, though Percy did not know the details of how it did that. All he knew was that the effect lasted until he either told the woman to wait for him, which would only pause the effects for a few months, or had sex with them once, which would stop the effects where they were at in terms of severity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he concentrated, he could find the location of the flower, and by extension, the woman who was captivated by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had come into this knowledge, Percy had remembered that he had given one to the waitress. It had slipped his mind, in the long year away from this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, curious to see how the woman was, Percy had gone to her house. He paid no attention to the other points where he could feel energy. He figured that it had something to do with not being experienced in sensory abilities outside his eyes. Something that was merely due to his inexperience in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what he found was a grim reminder of the damage that either he, or an item from the Eronomicon, could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had been bordering on stark raving mad. Disturbingly accurate pictures of him were everywhere, and a large field of the flowers surrounded her slightly run down house. She had journals that described her descent into madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, the usual behavior of insane people in horror movies and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, she even had a cult of women that followed her, doing crazy rituals in their attempts to call him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that certainly explained the extra points where he sensed the flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ego would likely have been inflated when they started bowing to him, offering themselves and calling out his name when he made his presence known, if not for two facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, Percy felt responsible for the state of these women. They looked like they hadn't interacted with anyone for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo... It was downright disturbing to him, the way the chanted his name with such fervor, begging to be taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was worse then the minions when they got into it for special occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Percy had no choice but order, for they took anything he said as such, to get their lives back on track before he even started to think about taking any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't so far gone, yet, to where he would want women to dump their lives and worship him in such a crazy fashion for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so far gone enough, however, that he allowed them to keep the 'cult' to continue meeting up, if they also talked about other things and stopped the rituals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, they did nothing. He didn't even know they were preforming them until Desiree, as the waitress was named, had mentioned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Medusa, who was still lying down, he held up the rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many of these did you send out to women again?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots.\u201d Medusa said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the seeds they produced? You must have had quite the horde of them, having this for a whole year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, another thing about these roses. Despite being cut from the bush, they still produced seeds, a few everyday. They were quick to grow, and never wilted, to Medusa's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept a bouquet in her class room, and already had given some to the female students anonymously or if they asked for one, as was not uncommon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlower shops, flower delivery services, green houses around the area... and I'm sure I planted a few around central park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy couldn't help but sigh slightly. That was an obscene amount of paces where they would be spread even further. Especially when special events, and Valentines day, rolled around. By then, Percy suspected that at least half the roses in the city would be from the Eronomicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that meant more women would be tempted to take the roses, and prick their finger, and so on and so forth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to be busy, lest a cult suddenly pop up and get out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again. The one thing that kept him from finding these seeds was the fact that he couldn't sense them without already having a woman under their power. Otherwise, he would have quelled the sheer number of plants that would be spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all of them though. He wouldn't deny himself a small power boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, was it really his fault if some couples broke up because of pure random chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy put the rose back in its vase, turning to Medusa. \u201cWell, what's done is done. I won't do anything that could destabilize the universe, so time travel is out of the question. But Medusa, next time please run this by me first. When this comes to a head, and those roses are distributed and bought and all that, I'm going to be extremely busy. Why did you do this anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust felt like... spreading the love.\u201d She said, still running off the pleasant feeling of the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, did Percy know his stuff around the female body, and not just for sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at her from the corner of his eye, now holding a few photo's that they had taken over the last year, of time spent together in various places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the time that they went to Egypt, which Percy felt eyes following them the entire time. He would have dealt with it, but it was of no concern. As long as they didn't attack, he wouldn't make a scene in ripping them to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the time they visited some Mayan ruins, which Percy found boring. He'd been to many abandoned temples over the two years he had gone traveling universes. You'd be surprised at how similar they all started to look after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was the time he had taken her to the top of Everest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an interesting story behind that trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was a tale for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, putting that behind us.\u201d Percy said, putting the photo's down. \u201cHow about we relax tonight, the two of us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d Medusa asked, bring her head up from its rest, half-lidded eyes staring at him with no true focus. \u201cThat sounds nice. How about dinner, dancing and a little walk through the park? I quiet enjoy our little walks under the moon, you know.\u201d She said, smiling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy smiled back, nodding. \u201cYou're right, that does sound good. Though, you'll have to forgive me if I trip up again. I may have fast feet meant for a thief, and everything the practice employs, but the fancy foot work for a dance floor is beyond me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something that he never really was interested in learning, the thought never really crossing his mind until it was brought up. He could weave through a battlefield, walk among the stars in the sky and had traversed where very few gods could say they have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut dancing? Might as well give him two left feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's alright.\u201d Medusa said, sitting up, her chest exposed. \u201cI've been taking lessons myself, since my last attempt was a disaster as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn't say disaster...\u201d Percy said, but trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it was a disaster. He would be lying to say it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you go get ready. I'll be fine getting dressed on my own, after I wash off the oil. Besides, I want my dress to be a surprise for you. I'm sure you'll love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn hour then?\u201d Percy asked \u201cOr a little longer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd say a little longer.\u201d Medusa said, before winking at him. \u201cBut it'll be worth it, I assure you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure it will.\u201d Percy said, looking out the window at the night sky. \u201cI'm sure it will.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Now I know why Prometheus is more then a little bitter about having his liver being eaten everyday and then regrown every night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Percy.\u201d Chiron said, walking into the room, his bow in one hand as he set his quiver down. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBusiness Chiron.\u201d Percy said. \u201cAnd could you not talk so loud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre... are you hungover?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Percy bit out. \u201cI just happened to take a Minotaur\u2019s axe to the head last night, blade first. Twice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven't you taken worse hits then that?\u201d Chiron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you're talking about my fights with Enyo, then yes. But I always prepare for those by making sure I pack some Nectar to cut down on the pain and regeneration time, plus Enyo is emitting so much lust energy that I can draw on that to help things move along painlessly and almost instantly. And Enyo's pretty resistant to most anything, unlike when she was Ares. I was, sadly, unprepared and, infuriatingly, caught off guard. Teaches me to not focus my solely attention on a nice night out.\u201d He growled, wondering when the minotaur would reform again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to make a nice leather chair from its hide. Perhaps snap a few more horns off, since they could come in handy later on. At the very least they would make nice trophies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d Chiron said, furrowing his brow. \u201cYou said twice? How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy said nothing, merely moving his fingers across his head, first horizontally then vertically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuined the night with Medusa, since the resulting gore made her sick. And this damnable headache has been bugging me since. I'll give Prometheus credit, since he had to deal with something like this for centuries.\u201d He said. \u201cI'm just glad that I was able to get my armor on quick enough to where it wouldn't cut into my chest, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to fight back reasonably well. You don't know how hard it is to fight when you have no head to see with, and your eyes are twenty feet apart and you can still see out of them. Very disorienting, to say the least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorse then having three consciouses on the same plane at once?\u201d Chiron asked, remembering that night almost a year ago that Percy had told his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose, but not quite.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Chiron said, walking by to his office and room. \u201cWell, I hope your business here goes well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure it will.\u201d Percy said absently. \u201cAnd Chiron, my offer still stands, should you grow tired of the Olympians and their games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll... think about it.\u201d Chiron said, stopping for a moment. He seemed to consider it before giving his answer and moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way Chiron, don't freak out if you see magic around Thalia's tree.\u201d Percy warned. \u201cThat's part of my business here today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Chiron said as he walked away. \u201cIt is yours to do with as you wish, you know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a heads up. I know you don't like surprises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Percy turned to walk out. The only reason he had even come to the big house was the fact that he was going to warn Chiron about his business with Thalia's tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't feel Dionysus' presence anywhere, nor was the god in any of his usual spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Probably up on Olympus, all of them discussing what to do about Thalia's poisoning.' Percy thought. 'Soon, Chiron will be replaced with Tantalus, and things will get worse from there for the campers.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged it off, walking to the hill where Thalia's tree stood. If Dionysus wasn't here, then it was better for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that he hated the man, but damn, did the god just get on his nerves sometimes, despite Percy also promising to him that he wouldn't try and break him and his wife up as long as the god didn't rat him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in general, they had come to an agreement to just stay away from one another when possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, if Percy kept away from him while he went about his business, Dionysus could truthfully say he didn't know what Percy was doing, and keep the god from more trouble. That, in turn, would have likely made the god bitter towards Percy, and likely to hold a grudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Percy said, announcing his presence to the group on the hill. \u201cBlue minions, start the ritual. Greens, I want you to put the poison in the glass jars to take to Nix when you're done. She should find some use for it, and should be able to figure out the extent of its lethality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue Minions nodded, their robes discarded in the early morning heat. It was a tad hot for the heavy cloaks that they usually wore, so they were in only their underwear, which were fashioned out of cloth. Their skin shone from the beads of sweat, as they had not anticipated the heat when the had come to the camp, thinking it to be cooler this early in the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green minions, though they themselves perspired slightly, kept their clothing on, as it was light enough to keep them from overheating. The only heavy garments they wore were thick gloves to handle the poison, since not even they were sure if the poison would be too strong for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in a circle around the tree, the blue minions, about twenty in all, started to chant. Their tattoo's glowed with arcane energies, their hands twitching more and more as blue mist seeped from their hands, surrounding not just the tree, but the surrounding area as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Thalia trying to keep the poison from spreading, it was too strong for her. In just a week, it had already spread around the hill, getting quite the distance in such a short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was what the blue minions were taking care of. They were pulling the poison into Thalia's tree, and would then pull it out from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason it had taken so long for them to do so, or Percy to order them to do so, was the fact that it had taken time to research nature magic from the world where they came from, and then try to not only convert it to this worlds magic energies, but to also work in a secondary spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis spell would cause all who looked at it, even the gods, to see the tree as if it was still poisoned. Thus, they would to cure it, making it stronger through the natural magic of the world and Nymphs and Satyrs nursing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only would that strengthen the tree, which would be helpful for the camp as a whole, but it would strengthen Thalia as well, and make the transition from tree to human much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for why Percy didn't do it himself, with the gauntlets and power he possessed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't trust his ability to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, nature magic wasn't his thing, nor poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, he knew he didn't have the precision to handle a matter as delicate as this. It would have been like handing scalpels to someone who was prone to having seizures and telling him to preform open heart surgery in a disco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the power of his boots didn't allow him to 'steal' the poison from the tree...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, he didn't think so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, he mainly used the boots for travel purposes, and walking silently. He hadn't really experimented beyond a few petty pickpocket attempts, and literally stealing the clothes off of women without their notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have to experiment with that more, like with the gauntlets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy turned his thoughts outward again, watching how the mist receded back into the tree, wrapping it up tightly. The grass the mist covered was now free of blight, fresh and green as if it hadn't been poisoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It hurts! It hurts!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked closer, mindful of the blue Minions as they continued their chanting, now increased in both pitch and speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his hand on the tree, feeling the bark grow hot from the poison, the tree rapidly decaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's okay Thalia. Just hold on for a little longer. We'll have the poison gone then.' He thought, knowing it would reach the girl trapped inside. It always did, without him even needing to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It burns Percy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see her soul, writhing in agony as veins of some viscous liquid, the poison, were wrapping around her, piercing her skin. Her very soul wept, trying to break free of the poison, slowly engulfing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know... I know. Soon it will be gone.' Percy assured, watching as the tree turned a sickly shade of yellow. \u201cIs it ready?\u201d He asked, turning to look at one of the Blues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one, they nodded, their hands making gestures to the greens before they started the second part of the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green minions, each holding their glass jars open, walked forward as the mist around the tree slowly gathered to a singly point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy couldn't help but cringe, Thalia's scream of pain reverberating in his head. He swore it was almost loud enough to be physically heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't just because of his headache that he cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few motions of their hands, pushing or pulling, depending on where they were in accordance to the point of magic, the blues began to draw out the poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the small light grew, into a ball of magic mist, growing larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green minions surrounded the ball, which was larger then Percy was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn my mark.\u201d Percy said, never taking his hand off the tree. Thalia was weeping now, though it seemed that the poison was completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greens readied their bottles, placing the openings to the magic sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked around, making sure the blues were keeping themselves steady. If anything went wrong, it would be good bye to the entire hill, and possibly his minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Pulling out the filled container, the magic sphere closing before even a drop of the stuff could fall, they switched containers, giving the filled ones to the secondary team to stop up and get ready for trasport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they were done, there were more then fifty large bottles of the stuff, all rolled gently in wool to keep them from breaking as they were moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blues had finished with the illusion, and were all catching their breath, their hands finally still due to using up so much magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia was resting, trying to ignore the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job.\u201d Percy said, to both the minions and Thalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Master.\u201d Some of the green minions intoned all at once, their voice carrying their no nonsense attitude as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Percy didn't know better, sometimes he would swear the minions were hive minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy!\u201d A familiar bleating rang out, several of the green minions springing to the ready for a fight at the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt ease.\u201d Percy said, leaning back against Thalia's tree. \u201cIt's just Grover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their Overlord commanded, they relaxed, but most of them did fade into the scenery, standing guard over the poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy!\u201d Grover called again, rising over the crest of the hill. \u201cWhat was with the... oh... never mind.\u201d He said, taking note of the blue minions all sitting around. \u201cI was going to ask if you knew what the whole blue mist thing was, but I guess you caused it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I had some of the minions go over some spells that would help Thalia's tree fight off the poison. As you can see, they were able to draw out some poison from the surrounding area,\u201d He said, motioning to the bottles and the grass and trees around them. \u201cUnfortunately, they weren't able to pull out much poison from the tree itself. It's latched onto Thalia's heart, or the equivalent of it while she's a tree. If we tried to pull it out, it would be like pulling the plug in a hospital. Strangely, the poison is keeping her alive, or she would have died quickly. It could be akin to a parasite, feeding off of Thalia's strength and creating more of itself, which would make for an interesting poison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover looked at the bottles, never noticing the guards around it. His nose wrinkled at the mere sight of it, turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who're the two kids? New campers I presume, obviously.\u201d Percy asked, pointing behind Grover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a large male, with thick muscles. He looked like no stranger to hard work, but his face was less then pleasing to look at, but not exactly ugly. Probably a kid of Hephaestus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one was a girl, who was trim, but not like the girls of Aphrodite cabin. She had some muscle on her, looking like a runner of the sort. She had sunny blond hair, and it seems she had been kissed by the sun, given her tan. Most likely one of Apollo's daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they're the demigods I was sent to get. Rather nice trip, overall. No horrifying monster attacks, no divine retribution, no running from mortal police... Not often that I get that on my job as keeper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, nobody is <i>my</i> keeper.\u201d The girl said. \u201cAnd I don't care what your stupid card says about it. The only reason I'm here is to keep my mom safe and get stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the minions, sneering in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you guys keep to the old tradition that women aren't good for anything more then having kids or cooking?\u201d She asked heatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, no.\u201d Percy said, standing up. \u201cThose women happen to work for me, and have overworked themselves, so they had to remove most of their clothing in an attempt to cool off. And I'll have you know, that if you think we keep them uneducated as well, that these women have access to, and trust me when I say this, magical abilities. Those ones over there, by all the bottles, are actually highly trained assassins, also working for me, to keep monsters from breaking into the camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said this was a safe place?\u201d The guy asked, looking at Grover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it is. I assure you.\u201d Percy said. \u201cIt's just that we had a traitor poison the tree behind me, which is the thing that keeps the barrier up around the camp. Currently, the barrier is down, so there have been patrols set up, which I will soon be providing back up for. There's something being done about the problem now, but it will be a while before we find what we're looking for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you're saying a traitor can just waltz in and do whatever he likes?\u201d The girl scoffed. \u201cYou must all be lazy or something to let someone do something like that to the defense of the camp. And why have a tree hold the defense? Seems stupid, if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy growled low, some of the greens getting ready to attack if he gave the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't really get it. This tree isn't ordinary. It's the prison for a demigod, much like you. Though, unlike you, she had, and still has, friends. She actually cared enough about those friends to sacrifice herself to become the barrier to protect the camp, which was always on guard for attacks before she did what she did. And, also unlike you, she was powerful. Unfortunately, the traitor happened to be one of her old friends, who was bitter at the world he had to live in. So, before you go running your mouth about something you don't know, realize that you'll just make a fool of yourself, along with some nasty enemies.\u201d He snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, please.\u201d Grover said, sighing. He didn't think Percy would hurt them, but they didn't need to get off on the wrong foot with the idea of the camp. It was supposed to be their home away from home, though at this home you risked serious injury and possible loss of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, hey, how were you supposed to become a hero otherwise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, excuse me.\u201d The guy spoke up again. \u201cGrover here explained a little bit about camp during our trip here, mainly about the cabins, a history of the gods and how they actually exist and all that. You've obviously been around here for a while, and I was wondering if you had any tips for us while we're here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood head on your shoulders, I respect that.\u201d Percy said. \u201cWell, for one I can say stay away from Aphrodite's cabin, and any of the campers from that cabin, if you can. Horrible teases, all of them. If you're not good with teasing from a guy or girl, you'll often find yourself having one or more teasing you most of the time. Also, don't try and go all out on the obstacle course for a while. Learn the feel of it. Lastly, don't fight with any of the kids from Ares/Enyo cabin... you will lose, no matter how big you are. Remember, this is a camp where people learn how to take down monsters and fight for their lives. Fighting a human is a piece of cake for most anyone here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dusted his clothes off, getting some dirt off. \u201cOh and before I forget, and pay attention to this girl.\u201d He said, getting her to scowl at him. \u201cDon't go messing with the women that don't look like campers, as in older then a teenager, or the Nymphs and Naiads. The ones who look older then the campers have been given special permission to beat the living crap out of anyone who attempts to interfere with their work under the assumption that they are also a traitor. The Nymphs and Naiads are also horrible teases, but are more prone to go through with the deed. Trust me when I say you couldn't stand the gossip that surfaced afterwords.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two.\u201d Percy said, pointing at two green minions. \u201cWould you please escort these two to Chiron? And introduce him,\u201d He said, pointing his thumb at the guy. \u201cTo Beckendorf. He looks like he'd be good around a forge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions nodded, motioning the two to follow before walking away, not even bothering to wait for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey guy, finally noticing how they were dressed, blushed, averting his eyes as he started after, though Percy could tell he took a few peeks here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl scowled at him, apparently not liking the fact that he talked down to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo more, follow unseen. Keep an eye on the girl, especially. The last thing I want is to have her bitching at me for being some sort of sexist bastard or something because of the way you act on your own time and what you decide to wear.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could handle someone talking to him like they were tough shit. But he would not have somebody slander him, or bitch about him, while not knowing his circumstances. He felt he had a good grasp on respect for women, despite his station as the Harem god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions nodded, two more quickly scampering off into the brush on one side of the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Percy said, looking at Grover. \u201cHow are things with Juniper?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy sat down next to a bed, a small form underneath the blankets. It was shivering, making noises that were slightly unnatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minions entered quietly, looking curiously at the bed and their master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't even notice them though, gently moving a strand of cold hair from the form's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove along, darlings.\u201d A soft voice whispered, shooing away the minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions did as ordered, moving along on their way, off to do other things. If they could remember, they would tell other minions the good news!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked up, smiling gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Rose.\u201d Percy said to the first woman he had bedded after becoming the Overlord, and the mother of his first child. \u201cEres told you, I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed she did, Sire.\u201d Rose said. \u201cThough I won't be able to stay long, since 'Emperor' Florian is paranoid about anything going wrong without my presence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is of no concern, Rose. You know that.\u201d Percy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d She said with a sigh. \u201cI just don't want to listen to his whiny voice as he talks down to me if I'm gone for a day or two. Nor do I want to listen to that creature he calls a right-hand man try and propose to me anymore. You know how hard it was to keep myself from letting the minions deal with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy growled, pulling Rose down onto his lap a little forcefully before shaking his head. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d He whispered, looking at the mass on the bed. \u201cI wonder how she'll take it all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighed. This had always been a point of contention with her since she found out herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly don't know, Sire. I was always against it, you know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know... I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. What he had done was something he found... unsavory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, hadn't he just abandoned her to a backwater town of moronic bigots for eight years? Sure he had Jewel and other minions watch over her, while he created, or had Giblet create for him if he was elsewhere, gifts for her. Though he knew what would happen in the future, with the Elf, he did not prevent it so he could watch his daughter grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because he wanted her to become the next Overlord? He said that, a year or so ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he watched, silently and from afar, how many times did he want to burn the town to the ground and slaughter them all in pure paternal anger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll because his daughter was different from an ordinary human. Blue-tinted skin, glowing green eyes, the ability to use magic in some small amount...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he really any different from his own Father for doing this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey even threw her to a genocidal empire for no reason other then to save their own skin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only thanks to the minions that she had been able to live through that ordeal, because she had fully armed, though poorly trained, soldiers trying to kill her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it was only due to his knowledge that she would be perfectly fine that kept him from bringing a horrifying death to them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that... tomorrow... she should meet her parents. For the first time.\u201d Percy said, though unsure of himself. It was going to be awkward to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree. But, who will train her?\u201d Rose asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, obviously. Though... I really don't want to have her along on a quest. I know I could protect her, but she'll need to get used to being around people first. To be honest, I'm surprised that she even worked so easily with the minions as she did. They seem human enough, and I know she has a distrust of humans from her time in that damned village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it is in her genes, Sire. She is the daughter of an Overlord, after all. She may have known they weren't human, despite how they look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly.\u201d Percy said, looking at his daughter, laying shivering on the bed. \u201cWell, I can certainly say she didn't take to my affinity for water. Maybe your affinity for fire or lightning perhaps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I hope so. I would love to be able to teach her something that will help her later on. Will we have Jewel join in on training her? I'm sure she'll take to sneaking about like one of them ninja of yours.\u201d Rose said, almost raising her voice in her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think so. We can try to have her learn, but I suspect she'll be a bruiser more then anything.\u201d Percy said, only to get a slap on the shoulder from Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair, using your ability to see the future.\u201d She said, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose, she's going to tower over people by several feet. By the time she finishes growing, she'll be a giant, at almost eleven feet tall. Thievery is not for her. Besides, that's literally what the minions were made for, to do the work in which the Overlord cannot do themselves. Well, other then being an easily replaceable fighting force.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighed. \u201cI guess you're right. Though I wish she would have taken more after me, in terms of inherited traits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, it's not enough that she got your hair color, magical affinities, natural body shape or beauty?\u201d Percy asked teasingly. \u201cAll she got from me was monstrous strength, some inherent knowledge of otherworldly languages, my eye color and the genes of an Overlord. I'd say she benefited more from you, then me, in terms of her genetics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're forgetting one thing though, Love. She has the parentage of a god, so she'll be made of much sterner stuff then any regular human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch good I've done at being a parent I've been these past ten years.\u201d Percy sighed. \u201cI still don't understand why I did what I did. I can see her future, see the outcome if I molded it in any way even hypothetically, and yet I still did this to her. My first born daughter...\u201d He said, looking to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes, I wonder if my mind is my own sometimes. Given the fact that I sometimes confuse even myself with my actions, and find myself wondering why I acted as I did. Even when I was mortal, before I came into possession of the Eronomicon, I was like that. Not as often as now, surely, but still. For example, that tree I was telling you about, the one with a friend of mine imprisoned in it. I don't know why I did what I did, taking complete ownership of it, and my friend through that. Perhaps it was the power of the item that allowed me to do so, and that was the first thing that popped into my mind. I just don't know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head, leaning back in his chair and pulling Rose back with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I'm not happy with your plans, whatever your reasoning, I'm just glad I can see our daughter in the flesh for the first time in years.\u201d Rose said, before her jaw cracked with a mighty yawn. \u201cOh, forgive me. But that blasted Elf has me working from dawn to dusk, wanting his own plan to be flawless, dealing with incompetent soldiers he sends to me to experiment on. Something about creating a super-soldier, whatever he means by that. My only saving grace are the little cherubs that work under me. So caring, despite what they were like as those little imps before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Percy said, having remembered something. \u201cRemind me to kill that Cyclops Yeti hybrid that took my daughter from the minions while they were distracted and tried to bring her down with it to a watery grave. I don't care if it's technically related to me through mythology, or similar to actual cyclops from my world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. I'm sure it would make a nice rug by the bedroom.\u201d She said, unconcerned that it was technically an innocent creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tried to kill her daughter, even if it didn't mean to do so. Did you think she would let that go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you go to bed.\u201d Percy said, stoking Rose's face gently. \u201cI'm going to stay here tonight. Send in a red to light a fire, and I'll have one of the blues give her a quick once over tomorrow. And tell Eres to contact Jewel. I want to speak with her in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, my Overlord.\u201d Rose said, Kissing him goodnight as she stood up to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose looked at her daughter, who was slowly relaxing into a deeper, more calm sleep as the shivering subsided. She sighed wistfully, wondering what it would have been like to see her grow up from a mere babe, instead of waiting for eight years after only caring for her for ten years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she was off to go about her duties before turning in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy kept watch throughout the night, his daughter muttering in her sleep. Most of it was gibberish, nonsensical and without meaning. But there were a few words here and there that actually had meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother, father, please, why, Kelda, everyone, die...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly in that order, and there were a few more, but those were several of the more prominent ones, and spoken in varying languages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they gave Percy food for thought as he racked his brain, trying to think of what he should tell her. Not as an Overlord, or as a god who knew her destiny... but as a father, and one who wasn't there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, he would have little more then what he started with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy was looking out the window, watching the sun rise over the horizon. The city was starting to awaken, and smoke rose from Chimneys as meals were being prepared before the day's work began. The window he was currently looking out of overlooked the area of the city that common folk, those without magical power or any inhuman attributes lived. The market area was next to it on the left side, while the more industrial area that housed the workshops of blacksmiths and carpenters and other such craftsmen set up their shops was on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy heard a grunt from his daughter, who slowly began to stir from her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over, seeing her sit up and rub her head. After she looked around, she noticed that she was someplace she had never been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, she was immediately on guard, springing to her feet with her hands balled into fists. She was wrapped in dark cloth that hung loosely to her young body, two separate pieces for a shirt and pants. Her eyes were constantly glowing a darker shade of green then Percy's when he was angry, and her face was twisted into a snarl, showing her teeth, which were jagged and looked ready to rend flesh from bone much like the minions teeth were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit back down.\u201d He said, making her jump and turn towards him, holding her fists up. \u201cYou're in no danger here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daughter looked at him, her red hair falling down her face in dirty strands as she regarded him with hostility and caution. Her thin frame, though sporting some muscle, was a testament to how she would have to steal food, when Jewel or the minions didn't leave her food. She had a faint scar across her face, not unlike the scar Luke sported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy would make sure that it wouldn't turn out like Luke and Hermes though. He wouldn't let that happen, despite his horrible job of being a Father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, horrible was putting it lightly, but even Percy didn't know a word to really say what he felt about how badly he fucked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said nothing, her eyes darted quickly around the room, trying to find an escape while trying her best to keep her eyes on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she seemed to notice something above his head, staring at it as her head cocked to the side slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood?\u201d She asked, though obviously speaking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her eyes, above Percy, floated that single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had only seen that word a few times. Over her friend, Kelda, and the women from last night with the big wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe otherwise only saw the word bad above people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople who had the word 'bad' above them were not nice to her, and would hit and yell at her if they didn't ignore her altogether or avoid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they all avoided her after a while, if they knew what was good for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelda was the only person who was nice to her, and those women who saved her but then lost her to the stupid bear thing. They all had good above them, except for the bear thing. It didn't have a word above it, like animals or masked people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood?\u201d Percy asked, genuinely confused. She didn't seem to be addressing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him in the eyes, before looking at the word above his head. \u201cGood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to relax a little, though she still looked at him with a cautious curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy took a tentative step towards her, wondering if she would move away. Seeing that she didn't, still staring, he moved closer, and closer until he was standing next to her, her neck craned up to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, he would have felt more guilty if she had flinched. He didn't want his own daughter to be afraid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then why'd you leave her alone?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shut up.' Percy thought, trying to shut his guilt out. He could do better now. 'I don't need to deal with you every time I interact with her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So you say...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Percy wasn't worried for his Sanity beforehand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay.\u201d He said, crouching down to look her in the eye. \u201cNo one here's going to hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him in the eye, trying to see if he was lying. But the words had never been wrong before. They had never lied to her, unlike what so many people tried to do when they had to interact with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d She asked, her voice a little more masculine then a girl her age should have sounded, but nothing overly noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA friend.\u201d He said, though against his better judgment. \u201cI sent those women to help you last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy went to move some of her hair from her face, when by reaction she grabbed his wrist, a surprisingly strong grip trying it's best to break his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't touch.\u201d She growled. Despite him being 'good', she would not let him touch her. It had been months before she had even let Kelda see her face, keeping her body wrapped up entirely so people wouldn't see her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, there's no need for that.\u201d Percy said, though he did move his hand away, pulling it from her grip. He could tell that surprised her, probably used to people being reduced to crying wrecks as their wrists snapped like twigs. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. Of course she would be hungry. What a stupid question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen follow me. We'll get you some food.\u201d He said, standing up. He walked over to the door, opening it as he looked at her expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him, seeing if he was going to do anything, but still didn't sense any hostility, and the word good never changed either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, deciding that this person wouldn't try anything again, she walked out of the room and into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster!\u201d A cry rang through the halls, making the girl crouch down with her fists brought up again, back pressed against the cold stone wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman in armor walked up to Percy, looking like one of the women that had helped her last night. She, too, had the word 'Good' above her, so the girl relaxed slightly at seeing what seemed to be a familiar face. The only difference seemed to be the clothing, since armor not unlike what the soldiers that attacked her wore, though it was shinier and seemed to provide better protection, replaced the fur that they women wore the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Eres said... said...\u201d The woman said, before scratching her head. \u201cWhat did Mistress Eres say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was stupid, the girl could see. Though, in her books, she was smarter then any of the people in Nordburg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter looking too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd smelled nicer. The people of Nordburg always smelt absolutely putrid, and it was horrible on her sensitive nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had the word 'good.' That had never lied to her about people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d The woman exclaimed, smiling proudly. \u201cMistress Eres said that she was going to take a sleepy-break. And that Master would need to see her when her sleepy-break was done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nap? Did the woman mean a nap? How stupid was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, right. It's that time of the week again. She probably knows that I've been dealing with a lot of things these past few days, so held off as long as she could.\u201d The man said to himself. \u201cThank you for letting me know. Go down to the kitchens and let them know to prepare some breakfast for Mistress Rose and our... guest.\u201d Percy said, almost letting the word 'daughter' slip from his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master.\u201d The woman said, both saluting and bowing before she quickly went back the way she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to see Rose and Eres have been able to teach them some manners. If only they remembered that they only had to Salute or bow, not both.\u201d Percy said. \u201cCome along, we'll wait in the dining quarters for the food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ate the food, though it was very... different, from what she normally ate. Instead of seal meat, raw potatoes or carrots and possibly rabbit, she was having some, what did the man call them? ehgs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some strange meat called haym, and something called milk for her to drink. The most she really ever drank was melted snow. There was tons of it in Nordburg year round, so she was never thirsty. And the little sparks she could create created fires on logs well enough, so it was just a matter of taking some cookware to melt it and finding enough dry wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forewent the knife on the table, using the one she kept with her all the time in the village. The man had given it to her when they entered, saying that it was on her when they brought her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle witch.\u201d She said, answering the mans question before she went back to eating her food. He had asked her what her name was, or at least what the villagers called her as he ate, and a woman with the word 'good' above her as well. At first, she doubted the word above the woman, as she stared at her for a while, watching her every move and making her nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more women had entered, though they were quick to leave. All had the same word above them, and seemed to hold no Ill will, nor were they repulsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's hardly a name for someone like you.\u201d The woman spoke, her eyes looking directly into the girls own glowing ones, showing no fear. \u201cHow about... Millicent? That seems like a fine name for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'After all, it was the one you were given at birth.' Percy thought, watching as his daughter decimated the food placed before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he was going to get an earful from Rose later that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he could only say he deserved it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou're pretty tall for someone your age, and much too skinny.\u201d Percy said, standing across from Millicent. \u201cAnd you're strong, I know. We'll start your training today to help you get back at those bastards in Nordburg for what they did to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, they were in a large room underground. Percy had told Millicent that this is where the women that she had seen around the tower, and that helped her, trained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were racks upon racks of training weapons, and the room was large enough to train over three hundred people at the same time with enough room to keep the fighting separated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was made for small scale battle training after all, though it was mostly used when the red minions were involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't want them to burn down the countryside, now did he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the only two in the cavernous room, at the moment. Torches lit up the walls from top to bottom, with a few hanging braziers that held flames for the central area of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were dressed for their purpose in this room, with non-restrictive clothing, but not so loose as to trip them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent currently held a wooden club in her hand, much like the one she had used in the village when she wasn't using her knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned devilishly at the thought. Get back at those who made her life miserable? The thought almost made her happy. It would be so nice to see their looks of fear as she cut them down, one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, we'll need to see which weapon, or weapons, you are good with. That's what we'll find out today. Any of those weapons you can lift,\u201d He said, pointing at the weapon racks. \u201cYou can use. I want you to attack me with everything you have, with every dirty trick you can imagine. In a fight, there is no such thing as being cheap, or dishonorable. It is a fight for survival, and only the strongest and smartest will make it. We'll start with the club, seeing as how you used it so well before you were rescued from the soldiers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent nodded. Who was she to argue if the man wanted her to attack him with everything she had? She had taken down entire houses before when the people were still active in their hatred of her, instead of avoiding her and her ire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, she did feel as though seriously hurting him would make her regret the act. The one time she had hurt Kelda, Millicent had actually felt remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemorse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the club in both hands, Millicent ran at him, faster then the bulky clothing that was required in the cold climate of Nordburg normally allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar, she attempted to bring the club against his leg, which would have snapped his kneecap if not shatter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing? You missed by a mile, swinging that early.\u201d The man said, though not taunting or teasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? She knew she was about to hit him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, her weapon hit the ground, leaving a small crater as the, surprisingly, sturdy wood held under the force of impact. She looked up, seeing the man standing a few feet away. Had he tricked her, using magic of some kind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent brought her club back up, and without a seconds hesitation, she ran at him again She wouldn't be falling for that trick again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good. You did well.\u201d Percy said, his daughter looking at him with her eyes narrowed, the club broken on the ground. \u201cGo choose your next weapon. It you can hit me, we can take a small break. And don't waste time to rest either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped he knew what he was doing. He honestly didn't know if he was being a good teacher, never mind the father part right now. He could only hope he could create some type of relationship with Millicent during her training as the next Overlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent huffed, kicking the remains of the weapon to the other side of the large room, where it broke into more pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was angry at him for toying with her, for not taking her seriously. He had dodged, avoided or tricked her the entire time, making her look like a fool! Why didn't he stand there and take it! At least those soldiers took the hit, even though it crushed their shields and killed the person holding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, given that this man was able to easily escape her grip and had no fear of her strength or strange skin or magic, she shouldn't have been surprised. This man seemed... more then what he let on, despite the word that constantly hung over him. There was a... glow around him, unlike any other person she had seen. It was dark, yet at the same time, not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to figure it out later though, as she looked at the weapons. There were four that caught her eye. A sword, and even larger sword that might have taken two hands for a normal person to carry, a large mace and what seemed to be a large ice pick, though one side was blunted and looked like a hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the pick-like weapon. She had some knowledge of them when she would steal them from the village and go climbing, just to see what was in the mountains. She had made a nice little home away from the village, though she had remained relatively close since she had to steal a little here and there and had to bring it up the a steep hill that she needed the ice pick to even get to. Amazing strength or not, she only had two arms to help her get up, and she needed both of them to do so, and it was hard enough with just her clothes to make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo bringing crates of food up there for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason she chose it was the fact that it was far enough away from the village that she could sleep in peace, and it was a nice cave that blocked out the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad she had to deal with the brats that attacked her on her latest supply run from the village, and was thus kicked out by those stupid people to save themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got back at them though, as the women who saved her knew enough about siege weaponry to use a trebuchet, and as if sensing her desire, used it to not only destroy a large group of soldiers that would have been in their way, but to also smash some houses in the village, hopefully killing some of the worthless peasants inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe war hammer?\u201d Percy asked, raising an eyebrow. He didn't expect her to go for that, seeing as how she would mainly use swords and maces in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, he'd also been caught off guard by the fact that she had some kind of ability in her eyes, not unlike him, but with a different application.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could, apparently, see whether or not people had good or evil intentions for her, though she had grown up using it to tell if people were going to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work on animals or people with concealed faces, possibly indicating that it had to have a humanizing characteristic. Though, he wasn't going to rule out only needing a human face either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe due to the fact that she was the daughter of a multiversal being? But then, why was he able to see her destiny so clearly? Was it because that is what her destiny was supposed to be, if he wasn't her father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know. He still didn't entirely know what it meant to be a multiversal being, or any effects that it might have on his children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy barely dodged out of the way, the spiked end of the weapon catching his shirt, barely missing him. A torn bit of the cloth was hanging on the spike, and Millicent was already getting ready for an overhead swing as she stepped towards him with the intent to, apparently, crush his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, at least she's eager.' Percy thought, moving to the side as the blunt end moved towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, that's enough.\u201d He said, a few beads of sweat on his brow. \u201cIf you keep that up, we can move past combat training faster then I would have thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was, once again, genuinely surprised. He didn't expect Millicent to be that fast on her feet, and with him not relying on the power of the boots to move, she had actually managed to keep up slightly, though she was still a ways away from matching his speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraters littered the room, some large then others. Scars from a blade marked the spots she had tried to back him into a corner, only to miss as he dodged over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent was gulping down air, drenched in perspiration. In her hands was all that remained of a sword, just the handle and guard. The blade was stuck in the ground from where she tried to stab his foot to prevent him from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her eyes narrowed, showing her annoyance as she tried to glare him to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't hit him once, and thus had been allowed no breaks. Given the lack of sky in the cavern, she had no idea how long they had been training. It felt like hours, and for all she knew, it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd say you earned some rest.\u201d He said, looking around the room. \u201cAnd we'll have to find a better place to train, since I don't want to keep having this place repaired. Maybe an island, there are hundreds of them that would suit this purpose, and would really allow you to grow and test the limits of your power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back to her, ignoring the annoyance she held for him. \u201cBefore you rest, however, we're going to see Giblet. She'll fit you for some armor, and should have it ready tomorrow morning, at the latest. We'll grab some dinner after that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAre you sure you'll be fine watching over her training for a few days?\u201d Percy asked, standing in the heart of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'll be fine. Trust me, Overlord.\u201d Eres said, sitting on the large glowing orb of magic that she currently was bound to. \u201cI'll make sure that the minions are thorough in their training on the island, and Giblet has already made some new training weapons with magicks that will keep them from breaking, even with her immense strength. They'll leave a miniature version of the tower-heart in the heart of the island, allowing me to observe, but not much else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I know I can trust you with this.\u201d Percy said, nodding. \u201cBut remember, she isn't the Overlord yet. And make sure Velvet keeps the Netherworld tower in good condition. If I have to go down there to fix another of her screw ups because she decided to have the minions dig for some jewels or gold in a important structural foundation again, I will not be happy. You know how I hate going to places with Lava and too much heat. It's why I stay out of Hell.\u201d He said forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a giant stalactite hanging over what amounts to an abyss that Lava from the core of the planet falls endlessly into, leading to Hell itself on a one-way plummet, was not the ideal place for him to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had more then a few close calls when Ember and many blues were actually called in to repair some structural damage to the Netherworld from her making the minions work on digging out shiny things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet liked shiny things, more then a cat likes string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy swore that sometimes she was worse then the browns and their love of hats and battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes. I know.\u201d Eres said, stroking his arm as he stood next to her. \u201cNow, Mistress Annabeth is wondering where you are. Seems the centaur has been fired already. The one you call Tantalus, the Child-eater, will be arriving soon. The god who watches over the camp, besides you Sire, is there as well. I could never bothering to remember his name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDionysus, Eres. That's his name.\u201d Percy said, looking around the room. The scrying pool, filled with clear water, and the library that Eres had been working on filling out with knowledge from the tower-heart. There were shelves upon shelves of books filled with information already, and there were still stacks of books on her desk, filled with nothing but blanks pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no bed, since Eres retreated into the tower-heart itself should she require sleep. And she required no food, since her energy was supplied by... other means. Namely Percy giving her some of his energy through intercourse, though if he was busy for extended periods of time, and she wasn't, she could draw back some energy from the minions like Percy does when he takes bits of their life force for smithing or enchanting without sacrificing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough that normally required lots of minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever something like that happens, Eres normally just went into the tower heart to sleep and conserve energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for letting me know though.\u201d Percy said, looking at Eres. \u201cI trust that everything will be handled here for a few days, as usual. If anything important happens, let me know. And I want Giblet to look over Tyson's designs again when she has the time. She couldn't give me an answer last time, due to being focused on a project and forgetting about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, of course. I'll have her look them over again.\u201d Eres said, nodding her head absently. \u201cNow go, Already Mistress Annabeth is getting fed up with the Child-eater, and so are the servant girl and the minions stationed around the camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Percy said flatly. \u201cI guess I had better stop them before they hurt him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he waved at Eres before vanishing, walking through the void to his home universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, did he need to name them or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared next to Thalia, who was still resting from her ordeal the other day. Night had fallen on the camp, and already Percy could see the campers sitting down for dinner at the pavilion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster.\u201d A minion said, emerging from the bushes in dark clothing and bowing. Her dark hair helped hide her in the dark, though her green eyes shining in the moonlight worked against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny news to report?\u201d Percy asked, watching as satyrs and nymphs joined the campers for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone, save for the fact that the Child-eater is grating on even the brown minions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, that bad? I figured Eres was talking about you and your sisters.\u201d He said. \u201cBut if he's annoying the browns...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her, seeing her want, bordering on need, to deal with the annoyance in one of most violent ways possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you switch out patrols, see if Nix is done with the poison we sent her the other day. Before he's sent back to his prison, we'll give him something to remember us by.\u201d Percy said darkly, though with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile that the minion was happy to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, my Overlord.\u201d She said, none too subtle in her happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she melted back into the foliage, letting the shadows consume her as she started back on her patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, better go deal with this.' Percy said, ignoring the signs of a recent battle all along the hill side. It was nowhere near as bad the day Thalia had been poisoned, which showed that it wasn't time for Clarisse to leave on her quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now for some changes in the summer activities this year.\u201d Tantalus said, giving the campers a crooked smile in his prison jumpsuit. His pale skin shone with an eerie glow from the light of the fire. It wasn't a raging inferno, but neither did it look like it was on the verge of dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe campers looked at him questioningly, wondering what in Tartarus he was talking about. Couldn't he see they were not in the mood for any news right now? They wanted to eat, set up patrols and go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll be reinstating the chariot races this year!\u201d He said with a demented glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurmurs broke out amongst the tables. Chariot races? They'd been canceled for years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I know that they were canceled some years ago due to, ah, technical problems.\u201d He said, almost wistfully, thinking on those 'technical problems' that led them to be canceled in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree deaths and twenty-six mutilations!\u201d One of the campers called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d Tantalus said, the sadistic glee barely hidden from his face. \u201cBut I know you will all welcome me in reinstating-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you just shut up, you demented child-killer?\u201d Percy said as he walked into the dining pavilion, glaring daggers at the man. \u201cAnyone who knows your story, and how bitter you must be, knows you just want people here to die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who, exactly, are you?\u201d Tantalus asked, narrowing his eyes at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot denying it? At least you're honest about that. As for me, I am Perseus Jackson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the child of Poseidon I was told about.\u201d Tantalus said, his eyes darkening with disgust. \u201cIt must be nice, having daddy back you up. Though you are older then what I would assume for a camper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy growled at the man, the area around him darkening. \u201cShut your mouth, you miserable waste of life. I do not rely on Poseidon's power or name for anything! To assume so would be suicidal on your part.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what could you do to me?\u201d Tantalus asked, strangely haughty for a damned soul. \u201cI'm already dead, if you've forgotten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake no mistake, child-eater.\u201d Percy said, his voice as cold as steel. \u201cWhether or not I can kill your soul doesn't matter. It's whether or not I can make your afterlife even more miserable then it already is. And trust me when I say that I can, and if you cross me, I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPah, you can try. I've dealt with my torment for over three thousand years. Nothing you could do could make it worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve that if you want, but realize that you brought it upon yourself.\u201d Percy said, on the edge of the pavilion. \u201cAnd aren't you going to say something Dionysus? He is your responsibility while he's here, after all. If something were to happen that would draw the ire of the other gods because of him, well, I'm sure they won't go overboard in your punishment for his actions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe god sighed, obviously not happy or interested with what was happening. Though, when was he ever happy when he was at the camp?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, as much as I loathe being stuck here as well, I must ask that you keep your exceedingly unpleasant tendencies to yourself. Though, I do miss the chariot races as well. If we give them time to prepare, it would cut down on the casualties and dismemberment. In a week's time, we shall have the first race in years. Finally, something that's entertaining.\u201d He muttered at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTantalus fumed, but chose not to speak. He tried to wildly grab at a plate of ribs that had been set on the table a while ago, but the plate flew out of his reach faster then the man could move, which was a surprising amount of speed for someone who had been starved for three thousand years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The horribly thin man said testily. \u201cTeams can sign up in the morning. And the winning team shall have their cabin exempt from chores for a month.\u201d He said, obviously not interested anymore if there wasn't the chance that someone would die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy ignored the glare the man, if he could be called that, sent him, as if promising to make his time at camp as miserable as possible.</span></div></div>",

He'd be more then happy to help in the forge.\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sure. It's no problem. It'd be great to have a cyclops in the forge. Besides, he's so creative with his designs. Last time he was here, he built a mechanical horse that could turn into a bird and fly around. It's like having the imagination of a five-year old with all the skill to build one could ever want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normally silent leader of Cabin nine was grinning at the thought of working with a cyclops, his normal scowl gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. I'll bring him by tomorrow then.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBy the way, if Tantalus tries to have Tyson driven off because he's, well, a cyclops...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry.\u201d Beckendorf said, hefting the forge hammer he had next to him. \u201cWe at cabin nine will make sure that the man doesn't try anything. Cyclops are well known for being our father's assistants, and Tyson's considered an honorary camper while he's with us. Tantalus can't touch him. If he does try something...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Percy said, nodding. \u201cAnd good luck with the chariot race.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he turned and left the forge, Beckendorf quickly going back to his project, whatever it may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d Percy said, appearing atop the climbing wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey yourself.\u201d Clarisse said, pulling herself over the lip of the cliff-like training course. She was sweating slightly in the noon heat, a few holes in her clothing where the lava burned through. It wasn't lava though, more of a... magic gel? That's really all it could be called though, since while it was indeed incredibly hot, it wasn't something that would kill someone if they fell it it, which a lot of people did. It, at the most, gave light burns on non-vital areas of the body, such as eyes or throat, and burned a decent bit of their clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no, Percy hadn't tampered with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stuff that the Harpies used in the kitchen to wash the dishes was closer to actual lava though, which was why campers needed special gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Clarisse asked, barely breaking breathing hard from her treacherous climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was toned from fighting all year, training harder and harder, breaking past her old limits, creating new ones and then crushing those ones as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing much. Can't a guy spend some time with his loyal servant?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d She replied. \u201cBut normally you only come to camp when it's important, or speak to me when you have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm hurt.\u201d He said, faking emotional pain. \u201cYou don't remember Christmas, do you? Or your birthday? I thought I did a good job there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse blushed slightly. \u201cYeah, I guess you did.\u201d She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat can she say? Sometimes even a warrior woman needs to feel like, well, a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get all dolled up or anything, but it was nice to relax, and let her... less masculine side out. Clarisse would never admit to having a feminine side, even remotely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you sit down with me.\u201d Percy said, patting the stone beside him. \u201cI just want to relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse nodded, admitting she could use a little break before she got started on her chariot with her cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, you expected her not to enter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d She said, sitting next to him. \u201cHeard you finally met face to face with your kid. How'd that go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy flinched slightly. \u201cYeah... not so well. She doesn't really know I'm her father, or that Rose is her mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked flatly, clearly not believing what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because I have an unbending will doesn't mean I don't have my own share of fears, so don't start.\u201d He said. \u201cAnd I've already beat myself up over that, and still am. There's that ever annoying voice called guilt in the back of my mind, and I actually allowed myself to be chewed out by Rose over the fact, after I told her that we weren't going to tell. But I will tell her, at some point. And if she tries to kill me, I'll let her take her best shot.\u201d He said, rather heatedly. \u201cBut really, I'm not sure how to be a Father. You can sympathize with me there, not having a Father around. Hell, half the camp can sympathize with not having a father around, and everyone without having both birth parents around! My only example for so long was that bastard, and the gods aren't very good parents most of the time. Even with my knowledge of her future, I did what I did and I don't fucking know why!\u201d He said, slamming his fist into the hard rock. \u201cNow I have to live with my mistake, despite having so many chances to stop it! I'm reluctant to use time-travel, because that could damage an already cracked world, due to the magic explosion, and I really don't feel like dealing with split time-lines in trying to fix the time stream when I have no Idea at what I'm doing. And even then, that would only set things back by a year in this world, ten in the other!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a breath, calming himself a bit. He knew he was getting more then a little agitated. \u201cSorry, but I know I fucked up being a parent. But trust me when I say I want her to get her revenge on everyone who made her life hell. Even if that includes me.\u201d He said, looking down with a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Clarisse said. \u201cThis took a turn for the depressing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said, though he didn't sound angry at Clarisse. \u201cI'll let you go now, to build your chariot with your cabin. And keep an eye on that new girl, with the blond hair and tan. She's a nasty piece of work.\u201d He said, vanishing. The only sign he had been there was the imprint of a fist on the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was floating around in the ocean, looking at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was angry, but not at anyone in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he screwed up. He couldn't seem to escape from that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was his own guilt building, his mind not letting him forget his mistake, but it seems everybody was going to bring it up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why did I do it?' He thought, looking up blankly, focused inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, why? It did no good for her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know that!' He said, arguing with himself. 'You being here is proof of that!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That still doesn't change the fact that you caused her grief, and you don't know why.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know...' He thought, turning over to look at the darkness of the sea. 'But what am I supposed to do now? Time travel is out of the question, since it would possibly damage the world irreparably. For all my knowledge of the fate of that world, I seem to be screwing up more and more since things are changing beyond even what I can see. I didn't expect that even a small amount of my power in the fake tower heart would cause ripples in the foundation of the universe when it exploded. The destruction was greater then what it should have been, and the world, as crazy as it was, is more at risk then ever. Time travel could cause it to destabilize, not only retroactively killing Millicent, but Rose, Velvet, Jewel, and everyone else. That would also cause more problems, since I've brought the minions to other worlds, and that would effect them as well, leading to who knows how much chaos.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Excuses...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then what? Then <b>fucking</b> what?' Percy asked, gritting his teeth. 'What do you think I should do then?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, that's what I thought.' Percy said. 'You're just the guilt that's eating away at me. You don't know any more then I do.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked down at his hands, sighing. The bubble of air floated up past him, bursting on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Despite all my power, I just have no idea what I have to do. I try and plan ahead, but I failed at being a Father. If I could punch my past self in the face, I would. But making eye contact is impossible with myself, considering the whole one-eighty degree thing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed again, another air bubble escaping. He looked down, his divine eyes piercing the darkness of the ocean he created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I need to stay occupied right now.' He said, diving down slowly, leisurely kicking his feet. 'I can think on it after I've calmed down.'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLet's see if those stupid birds will appear again.\u201d Percy said, looking over the race track from the top of the big house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBirds?\u201d A certain sapphire-eyed goddess asked, standing next to him asked. Her voice, so gentle and soft, was lifted slightly in question. \u201cWhat damage could simple birds do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStymphalian birds, Melum. Nasty little beasts, with beaks made of razor sharp bronze.\u201d He explained. \u201cThey love to kill, tearing flesh from bone in a mad frenzy. They're incredibly fast, even for birds, and they move like a horde, never very far from one another. They all attack at once, like a cloud of death, and possess some cunning to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d She said, turning back to watch. \u201cThis is the first time I've seen these chariot races. Mortals never invented these in my universe, as far as I can tell. So this may be interesting, unlike those races that are popular in the mortal world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy chuckled, putting an arm over her shoulder. \u201cI hope you enjoy this then.\u201d He said. \u201cThis'll be the first time I've seen one as well, when I'm not the one behind the reigns that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure you are marvelous.\u201d She said, resting her head against his shoulder. \u201cI would have loved to see you race, though.\u201d Her pure blue eyes were sparkling at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess was currently wearing a simple black dress, her black hair was let down, cascading down to the center of her back. Her skin, which was still the slightly pale yet shiny skin she had when Percy freed her from the music box, was warmed under the sun. The ring finger on her right hand had a diamond ring perched upon it, dazzling in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone had asked her, then she would say that it was evidence of her marriage, always commenting that her husband wished to remain anonymous. There had been a few times the paparazzi had tried to press her for info about her life, and the magazines that had interviewed her under more professional means had done the same, but she always ignored the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other piece of jewelery she wore was the necklace Percy had made her almost a year ago. She almost never took it off, only to sleep or shower. She took care of it, making it look almost as if it was brand new every day. For her shows, during the times she toured, it would dazzle those who came to see her, shining as brightly as any star in the sky. The sapphires, which Percy still claimed were less beautiful then her eyes, glistened brightly in the midday sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love to as well, but I detest being near the child-killer.\u201d He said, venom dripping from his lips. \u201cI would not want him to ruin such a good day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you just kill him, Master?\u201d Melum asked. \u201cIf he displeases you so much, and is of no importance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's not worth it, to be honest.\u201d Percy said simply. Campers were starting to fill the stands. \u201cAnd besides, he'll get his comeuppance soon enough, and it will be sweeter to me then simply killing him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Melum said, her eyes half-lidded as she placed a hand on her master's chest. \u201cI see. If it pleases you, Master, then it must be good. Though, if you wish him gone, I shall be more then happy to sing the song that kills his soul.\u201d She said, sounding so deadly for such a gentle voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you would, my dear.\u201d Percy said, smiling slightly. \u201cI know you would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two stood there for a while longer, watching as the chariots and their riders rolled up to the starting line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ares/Enyo cabin's chariot, driven by Clarisse and one of her cabin mates. A boy, with weapons strapped to his back, and inside the chariot itself. The blood-red chariot was drawn by two skeletal horses, almost certainly war horses from years long gone, having died in battles long forgotten by the mortal world. Truly, the only dead Enyo could call upon were the dead that died in battle. Dead human's, dead animals, or dead weapons of war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the chariot of cabin nine, Hephaestus cabin, driven by Beckendorf. It was wrought out of bronze and iron, the metal built for both speed and strength. The horses, bronze automaton's that snorted fire, were horses that would never tire, built with control in mind. Many a trick was hidden inside that otherwise unassuming chariot, by magic or sheer skill depending on the trap itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Apollo chariot was third to line up. Crafted from gold, it shone in the sun, an attempt to blind the other chariots no doubt. Filled with long ranged attack options, mostly arrows, the chariot was designed to hold a veritable silo of ammo for the fighter. It was drawn by two palominos, obviously well taken care of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond to last was the Chariot of Hermes. Befitting the house of travelers, the chariot was worn, looking like it had seen many a journey in it's life. The green paint was slightly chipped and weathered, but it looked sturdy enough to get you where you needed to go. The Stoll Brothers, co-counselors of the cabin, manned the chariot, sly grins adorning their faces. The horses that drew the chariot were nothing special either, looking like the kind one could find at any farm or ranch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was the chariot of Athena. It was a greyish-blue, in honor of their mother's eyes. A spear was emblazoned on the sides, but that was the only decoration. Otherwise, It was simple. And in it's own way, that was Elegant. Like most other chariots, it was built for speed, sleek and maneuverable. A few weapons that required the precise and steady hand that few could attest to, outside of Athena's cabin, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here comes the loathsome wretch now.\u201d Percy remarked, seeing Tantalus walk with no real enthusiasm towards the staff table, which Dionysus was already sitting at. In contrast to his usual demeanor, and the downright unpleasantness of Tantalus that the man emitted every second he was alive, the god seemed to have some interest in what was happening for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something caught Percy's attention, fluttering in from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d He looked at it, seeing the gleam of bronze in the light. \u201cAh, and here comes the winged creatures now. Strange that they would arrive with Tantalus. Almost as if the man was so horrible that he drew monsters in to attack others, since I don't recall him ever having a scratch on him the last time this happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, more and more of the aerial devils gathered, blocking the green of the trees with black feathers and gleaming talons. Their eyes were locked on the chariot racers, as if waiting for a distraction before they began to swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum, get ready.\u201d Percy said. \u201cWhen they attack, we're going down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d Melum asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to try something, which happens to be something you excel at. I want you to try and sooth the birds, sing to them with that beautiful voice of yours. If horrible noises, such as brass bells or Dean Martin, make them flee in fear, perhaps the sound of your voice can calm them down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if that doesn't work, I am to make them flee?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously.\u201d Percy said. \u201cBut, I have no doubt your voice can calm them. After all, if you have the earth itself obeying your commands after hearing you sing, it should be simple to captivate simple minded creatures such as these. Ah, and there they go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy turned his attention back to chariots, which now left the starting line. The Hermes and Apollo chariots clashed, with Conner Stoll tossing Greek fire at the wheel of the opposing chariot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enchanted fire quickly melted the soft metal, though it did blind the foolish demigod and render him defenseless as the Apollo chariot fighter quickly shot a blunt, but heavy, arrow at him, knocking him into Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, in turn, caused Travis to lose the reigns, and the two of them to be tossed from the chariot just as their golden opponent's wheel gave, flinging the two children of the sun god from their own chariot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully that'll teach them not to build something entirely out of gold.\u201d Percy muttered. \u201cAt least add some other metals to it and make it an alloy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Annabeth is fighting for the lead with the bronze chariot, Master.\u201d Melum said, somewhat excitedly. \u201cGo Mistress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won't last for long, unfortunately.\u201d Percy said, watching as some of the Stymphalian birds rose from their roosts to attack. \u201cWe should get down there now, I suppose.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Flying through the air, ripping and clawing at any exposed skin on anybody, and any skin that was clothed was soon bare. Cuts appeared on bodies as the winged devils descended on the campers, doing their level best to rend flesh from bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDisgusting creatures.\u201d Percy said, swatting aside several that tried to attack him and Melum. \u201cMel, you're going to have to do it soon. Otherwise-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy had to close his mouth, as one bird tried to rip out his tongue. He grabbed the bird, making it pop in his grasp. A bronze beak fell to the ground, along with a few feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gonna have to clean that off later.' He thought, though his face did not change to one of disgust as he shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum nodded, drawing in breath through only slightly parted lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne bird, seeing what looked like an opportunity for some flesh, dived at her, with several of its brethren swooping after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no you don't.' Percy thought, swatting them away from the goddess, feeling a piece of his his ear being taken. A few cuts appeared on his face, golden Ichor rising to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There are more then I thought, and they're faster then I expected.' He thought, lashing out at the next batch that dove at them. 'And I think I'm drawing attention to us right now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, more of the birds turned their attention to Percy and Melum. Due to Percy killing some of their number, or the scent of Ichor in the air, he didn't know. But the fact of the matter was the fact that the cloud of feathered death seemed to grow tighter and tighter around him, the sun starting to blot out above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral dove for Melum again, aiming for her face. Percy brought up his arm again, seeing as several more were just behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy didn't want to use the power of the gauntlets here, since there would almost certainly be collateral damage to both life and property, thus drawing the attention of the Gods to him, despite anything the Fate's would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy currently didn't feel Dionysus anywhere, showing that as soon as trouble started, the god ran elsewhere to avoid dealing with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean the god wasn't watching from afar, just out of his sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flesh on his arms was torn, and while it did indeed hurt, it wasn't as painful as having his head sliced into eight pieces, nor anywhere close to the fights he had with Enyo. He really had no need for his armor to deal with this, for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum was about to sing, and bring an end to this awful noise. Thousands of birds squawking was not a pleasant noise, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo order to it, and while she could see the beauty of the sound of chaos, this was just ugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just parted her lips a little more, her lungs filled with air, when she felt it. It was one drop, then two, and more soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was warm, likely blood. She expected that to happen, as her Master could get messy with his kills when he used his hands alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew it was different, since there wasn't the sound of a beak falling to the ground, and she felt her Master twitch in her hold just slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her better judgment, the goddess opened her eyes, catching a few more drop falling down to join the ones that had already landed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolden blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Master's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShed because he was protecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the lack of pain on her Master's face, she knew he was hurting. The birds that had embedded themselves in his arm soon had their necks snapped by his other hand, dispersing into a fine golden dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't paying any attention to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were focused solely on the trail's of blood that flowed from his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaused by protecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum's heart beat within her chest, in a flurry of sudden emotions. Anger, sadness, guilt, hate, worry, anxiety...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had failed to protect her Master, and he was hurt because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had failed to do as he had asked of her, and he was wounded because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Master bled for her, and she hesitated in her duty as his servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese birds had caused her Master pain, because she had failed to do as asked of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese birds were the reason her Master had to defend her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birds were the reason for her Master's pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose feelings that swirled around in her heart soon filled her chest, mixing with the air in her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Master had never had to defend her before. She had been able to take care of herself, for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, in hindsight, they lacked training against multiple foes at once. Especially ones as small, fast and vicious as these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the point, to her at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the point was her Master was hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those that hurt her Master...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum's mouth opened fully, a high-pitched, inhuman sound that even the gods of Olympus would cringe at coming from her. It wasn't like the time she defended against Hades, nor like the time she had attacked Athena. While those had had some semblance of singing to them, this was different in almost every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a sound that would make a Banshee seem silent, and the sounds of a thousand screaming souls seem like a symphony. Nothing less then the pure Emotion Melum felt that moment was poured into her voice, fueling it far after the air had left her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat need for air did she need, to let her wail be heard? She was a goddess, and such things were of no bother to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wail drowned out the sounds of the birds completely, drowned out the screams of the campers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as she began, everything stopped. The birds began to fall from the sky, Melum's power tearing them from the air. The Campers were forced to their knees in pain, even Annabeth and Clarisse. Tantalus was laid out, flat on his stomach on the ground, unable to handle the power of the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the trees around the track were hurting, groaning as they tried to lean away from the source of their pain, Nymphs emerging from their trees in attempts to flee only to fall to their knees, clutching their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Percy was unaffected by the pain of her wail. In fact, he felt slightly better, the small pain in his arm numbing. It felt like someone was trying to soothe him, not just in body, but in spirit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the field was littered with bird corpses, all slowly turning to a fine golden powder. Their beaks were left behind, still as sharp as ever, in small, numerous piles around him and Melum, stretching out for at least fifty feet in a circular area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum closed her mouth, a few tears trickling down her face. She took a few breaths, attempting to compose herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, finally hearing the silent weeping of the campers, curled up on the ground as they held their heads in pain, many unconscious from said pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they didn't matter to her, save for Mistress Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to apologize later, make restitution for her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at her Master, seeing that his arm bled no longer. He looked dazed slightly, staring off into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster,\u201d She asked gently, her voice laden with guilt and worry. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Percy asked, shaking his head slightly. \u201cWhat? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum sighed in relief, hugging her Master tight. \u201cI'm glad...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just... happened?\u201d Percy asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me Master.\u201d Melum said, with some guilt for causing harm to her Mistress, but not the others. The servant girl was debatable. \u201cBut when those creatures attacked you, drew blood from you, because you were defending me because I wasn't quick enough...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum cast her eyes down, looking subdued. Her eyes held no tears, not anymore. If she were to be punished, she would accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked around, sighing. 'Eres, could we get a full team of blue minions out here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At once.' The apparition responded. 'If I may ask, why though?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Melum got upset that some birds managed to draw some blood from me.' Percy answered. 'And prepare a bed in the tower for Clarisse.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course.' Eres said before fading from his notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy appeared next to both the Athena Chariot and the Ares chariot, grabbing his first Mistress and his... head slave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never did give Clarisse an official title for her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting one each over different shoulders, both Percy's walked back to Melum, who was now kneeling on the ground, having sunk to her knees after Percy had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got closer, both Percy's managed to... fuse together, resulting in one Percy that was holding both downed women over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d Percy said, looking down at Melum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess could only nod, merely placing her hand on his leg before the four of them disappeared.</span></div></div>",

Self preservation was very important to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several hours after the incident, and they were currently in the Dark Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, they were in one of the roomier infirmary wards. It wasn't anything fancy, and there was no modern-day equipment that one would find in a hospital in New York, given that the blue minions didn't need any of that for their magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, no electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Clarisse was in a more... medieval style of dress, given that her clothes were shredded by the Stymphalian birds. She had a few scars left on her body from the healing process, though they were in no danger of reopening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum, I want you to explain yourself.\u201d Percy said, turning his gaze at her. \u201cWhy did you attack everyone but me? The campers were no threat, and I wanted you to calm the birds, not destroy them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum stood firm, looking at Percy without faltering. \u201cI did what I did, Master, to protect you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProtect me?\u201d Percy asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. To protect you, to stop you from shedding your blood for me. You have no need to do so for me, no obligation.\u201d Melum said. \u201cIt is I who should shed blood for you, take the pain so that you do not feel it. I faltered in the duty you asked of me, and I caused you pain with my hesitation. The blood you shed fell upon me, showing me that I had failed you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelum, you don't need-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't!\u201d Melum said suddenly, fearfully. \u201cPlease, don't say I don't need to protect you! You are my master, my everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum looked at him, her eyes wide with worry, the blue orbs glistening with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you are strong, and I know you are capable of so much more then I, a lowly slave. But that does not mean that I can put you at risk through my failings!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess quickly wilted from the refined stance she held before, falling to her hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would do almost anything for you, Master! If it pleases you, I will walk the edge of fading, lose my identity and my power for you! I will kill your foes with mere whispers and deliver my sisters to you happily while they curse my name! I will do all that, but please...\u201d She trailed off, her body suddenly wracked with sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...\u201d She whispered, barely loud enough for even Percy to hear. \u201cLet me keep you safe. Even if you are immortal, there are things that could kill a god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked down at his own hands, clenching his hand into a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many times had they tasted the blood of immortals, ending the endless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d He said. \u201cBut even still, you had no need to do what you did. I barely felt their beaks anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky.\u201d Clarisse muttered, clamping shut when Percy turned his gaze to her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Master, I know... But the mere thought of you hurting because of me, because I, in any way, failed you... The mere thought of you hurting in any way, shape or form...\u201d She choked out, unable to even describe what it would feel to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat still doesn't excuse your behavior. I know you can direct the intent of your voice at someone specific, even in a crowd. Many of the campers were knocked unconscious, and I'm pretty sure even the undead horses from Clarisse's chariot were in pain and wanting to die again. Even Annabeth was knocked unconscious Melum!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will make restitution to the Mistress, rest assured. I have no intention of escaping from any punishment that either you or the Mistress give. My only desire was to keep you from pain, my Master. I did not intend to harm anyone but the foul creatures that were attacking, but... I lost control. I am deeply sorry, and beg forgiveness from both the Mistress and yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at Melum, still on her hands and knees and her head bowed, with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where things got all muddled with him. He really should do something about Melum, but he honestly doesn't think he can without changing her. If he wanted her to stop acting like she does, and fearing his displeasure, he would have to rework her entire personality, and he wasn't sure that was something he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Styx, or Jewel, it was simple, though still different cases. For one, he didn't know Styx at all, other then her name and her role in the world, minor as it had been. So, without knowing who she was, it was simple to mold her to what he wished her to be with the least amount of regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJewel had been shallow, twisted by the influence of his predecessor in the title of Overlord. Even before that, she was still rather... unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lucky Khan was so stupid as to not take offense to her during all the time they spent stuck together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum though, he knew, to some extent. She was loyal, immensely so. She was also kind, and that was always a plus in Percy's book, and he wasn't talking about the Eronomicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was acts like this that could cause undue trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy wouldn't change Melum, in any way. He wouldn't have her any other way, then who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy rubbed his brow, already feeling the headache start. He wouldn't be doing something so drastic to Melum as to change her entire personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d Percy said, sighing. \u201cI appreciate the fact that you couldn't stand seeing me hurt, even if I didn't feel anything in the first place, but that still doesn't excuse the fact that you had collateral with the campers and Annabeth. I gave you that necklace to help control your voice, and you still let your emotions get the better of you. You can't lose control every time I get hurt or defend you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand...\u201d Melum said, a few tears dropping to the stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, that said, I can't really say I want to punish you for your actions. And I know Annabeth would forgive you, if give you a lecture. I understand why you did what you did, but I'm really torn on the matter. You <i>should</i> be punished, but I'm not the person to do it. I really don't have it in me to actually punish a woman, and not because I think you're fragile.\u201d He said, adding the last part because he could already tell Melum would say she could handle any punishment he gave her. \u201cThe worst punishment I can think of would be Isolation, but I know that would effectively kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden tensing of Melum's entire body when he mentioned Isolation, being separated from him, told him that he wasn't wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she's getting off without punishment then?\u201d Clarisse blurted out, indigently. \u201cWhat a load of-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said that Clarisse.\u201d Percy interrupted, turning his gaze back to the girl. \u201cI only said that I wouldn't be the one to decide her punishment, since I can't really think of one for her and have no desire to do so. She does deserve punishment, but you'll be the one to both think of and carry out the punishment. In the mean time, Annabeth has been wanting to talk more with Melum about her original universe, so she can leave now until a punishment is decided upon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelum took that as her cue to leave, and rightly so. She quietly slipped out the room, Clarisse sitting back on her bed as Percy locked eyes with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to... what?\u201d She asked, the gravity of the situation dawning upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, you will be the one to punish Melum for her actions. As I see it, you are the most vocal about it out of the three of us, meaning Annabeth and us two. I know Melum should be punished, but I don't feel like going through with it myself, since I don't exactly feel the need to punish her despite what I said earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously not, otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation right now. I'm just going to lay down a few ground rules for the punishment. One, no trying to have her become isolated, as I feel she's dealt with enough of that in her immortal life. Two, and let me be very clear on this, absolutely no physical harm save that of physical labor, if you decided that is what she is to do. Lastly, no trying to change her from who she is. I quite like Melum the way she is, so no trying to rework her personality.\u201d Percy said, before realizing something. \u201cAnd I would hope you know that mental or emotional trauma is forbidden, given how quickly Melum's emotions changed from a respectable goddess to a grovelling slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do then?\u201d Clarisse tried her best to not growl out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure you'll think of something.\u201d Percy said dismissively as he turned on his heel to leave. \u201cRest up for tonight, because you'll be breaking the news to camp about your little quest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Percy left the room, hoping to deal with a complaint from the magical community before things got out of hand.</span></div></div>",

The blues would give orders to the browns, and the browns would diligently work under their leadership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blues had seemed to siphon off more of Percy's abilities then he realized, seeming to know their way extremely well on a ship. The browns as well, seeing as how the blues would order them to a certain part of the ship, and the browns would know exactly where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, Perhaps that was just something that their original creator, the Black Baron, had used the minions for originally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was really going to have to go to an alternate universe that was close enough to the one where he had risen to the title of Overlord. He really wanted to meet the man, just to see what he was like. Perhaps the first Overlord as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, they were not the only crew the vessel had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the minions walked the dead, reanimated skeletons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wore tattered naval clothing, holes letting the wind blow through their empty rib-cages. They milled about their tasks, going through the motions with no real vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had fought their battles, and now they wanted rest. Rest, which currently, was being denied because of their defeat in the civil war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the price of losing a war in a world with gods like the Olympian's, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure your crew will be fine on a more classical ship then the steam-powered one you used in life, Captain?\u201d Clarisse asked, sitting with the leader of the dead portion of the crew as they plotted a course for travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dead man nodded, the shimmering illusion of his face a second behind. \u201cAye, we should be. Though, I don't know if my men will be able to do all the fancy climbing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's why the minions are here.\u201d Clarisse said, looking over the chart again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghostly face sneered. \u201cBah, women on a ship. I don't understand why you allow them on board. They have no place here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying I have no place on this ship?\u201d Clarisse asked, looking at the skeleton with a raised eyebrow. \u201cThat could be counted as insubordination you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sneered again, but grit his teeth. \u201cI'm bound to serve you, if me and my crew wish to finally rest. We'll do as you ask of us, but that doesn't mean we like it. We have our own standards and protocol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to know.\u201d Clarisse said dismissively. \u201cBesides, they may look like women, but they're demons, and good at what they do. Running a ship seems to be one of those things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may, I only see them for what they are.\u201d The captain said, before he himself looked over the chart again. \u201cIf we can keep the ship from being torn apart by monsters, as you say it likely will, we should make good time to the island. Though, without steam power to keep us going, we'll be a little slower if the winds don't favor us. With a good headwind, it will take a week or so, give or take any stops we might make along the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we will be making stops, Captain.\u201d Percy said, entering the smallish room. \u201cAnd you don't have to worry about not going fast enough. The Blue Minions can take care of that, easily enough. And if you don't like women on the ship, I suggest you throw yourself overboard now. These stops will mostly be getting more women, and monstrous ones at that. I don't think they would take kindly to any sense of hostility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain scowled, but stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, have you decided on the course?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we have. We'll head directly to the sea of monsters, since we're well stocked on provisions. After that, well, we'll see what happens.\u201d Clarisse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded. \u201cAlright then. And remember, I'm officially not on this quest with you. I just happen to be going the same way. And I still won't be here much, since I'll be with my daughter. Annabeth and Grover will stick around, so you can get in contact with me if necessary. And, as per your request, Melum is going to be stationed on the ship to act as a storm breaker if the need should arise. If anyone can calm a storm, it'll be her. Now, if you'll excuse me, I want to be out of my father's domain. Safe trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked out of the room and off the ship. He wanted, and needed, to train Millicent some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to be ready, and the fact that time was so incredibly fast compared to this universe meant that drastic measure's may need to be taken to ensure she can take her place as the next Overlord and rise to the challenge of taking down an empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, given the things that he might not know about her now, such as with her eyes, he needed to make absolutely sure he knew all she was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if only there were a way to do so without having to deal with the whole process of time flowing and aging him...</span></div></div>",

The sun had set a few hours ago, and several candles were lit on his desk, the embers flickering as a warm breeze blew through the open window. The sounds of the nightlife in the city reached him, but he ignored it as he would a fly on the other side of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'As ever, Marked one</b>.' The tome spoke directly to his mind, as always. <b>'While technology isn't my forte, to be honest, it was a chance I couldn't pass up. To be able to gain not one, but several powerful items such as these, I would have to be more of a fool then anyone who would stand against you</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy rolled his eyes slightly, but nodded in acknowledgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to have everything, don't you?\u201d He asked, only semi-joking. \u201cWell, show me exactly what you're talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the tome down on the desk, Percy watched as the tome flipped open, perusing its own pages quickly as it made it's way to the requested item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the right page, the paper halted in its maddened fluttering and came to a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's see now, what are the details of this little beauty.\u201d Percy said, leaning over as he pulled the tome closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page image was of a cube, with an arrow pointing to the side at a picture of a hand held device. Under those there were several small boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe reflective video game. Huh, sounds interesting.\u201d Percy mused, lazily scanning over the details, knowing the book would talk about it in depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Indeed, Marked one. Using these may be the solution to your current problem, with the help of some magic</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boxes started to glow, but not in the way that happened when something was being brought out or put into the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'This one in particular. It will allow you to train you offspring without actually aging either of you physically. Mentally, on the other hand...</b>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, and tell me what's so special about this box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Well, the first thing you should know is that this little box is, essentially, a miniature multiverse, in a sense</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now Percy was interested. Very much so, in actuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'While not exactly infinite, it is close. It houses an enormous amount of universes in it, each available for journeying and questing that so many people seem to find themselves in</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of like what I did a year ago with that merry band of idiots before I took my place as Overlord?\u201d Percy asked, though he already anticipated the answer already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Essentially, yes. But, that's not all. It operates on the same principles as the actual multiverse, for the most part. There are countless scenario's of your choosing, each with almost limitless potential to mold to your wishes. The level of danger, the tensions of political factions, civilizations progress, landscape, pantheons... Everything a god could wish for in building a world</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's mind was already thinking of ways that this could benefit him and his girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, it sounds good so far. But what's the catch?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cThere's always some kind of perverted catch with you... Not that I really mind, but I would like to know beforehand if possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'I'm glad you asked</b>.' The tome said, and Percy had the feeling that if the book could giggle perversely it would do so in a heartbeat. <b>'You see, when I commissioned these, I had the stipulation that all monsters would be female, and more or less humanoid, though with the ability to transform into their monstrous primal forms under extreme circumstances</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Percy said, a Cheshire grin spreading across his face. \u201cI'm not seeing any downside to this. You are amazing, you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'It is all to further your glory, Marked one</b>.' The Eronomicon said, and the image of a featureless person, even more featureless then Eres without an item to be bound to, bowing in worship. It even lacked any sense of falsehood, being one hundred percent sincere, with no backstabbing adviser vibes, unlike Gnarl when the minion was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy's mind also turned to questions regarding this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a few questions about this though. First of all, explain what you mean by not physically aging.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Well, when the item is activated, it will pull your mind and soul into the world, creating a physical body for you upon arrival in the world. Until then, you would control things mentally. So, while your mind and soul would age, your physical body will not. Also, time inside any of those worlds is drastically sped up to a point so that you could, hypothetically, live out hundreds of thousands of lives and it would merely be a day out here, or most any other universe</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy frowned upon hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that means that time would still pass here, in this universe. It's connected to my soul, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Ah, yes</b>.' The Eronomicon mused. <b>'That would be troublesome, to say the least. If you used this here, in this universe, your body would feel the effects of the time spent in the item. Hmm... what to do, what to do</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite the conundrum, that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't exactly evacuate the city and send everyone back to their own worlds for eight years, at least from my perspective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all he needed, eight years. More then enough time to train Millicent. Physical combat, magic, leadership...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTell her the truth about her lineage, for better or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, does this item have a training program, something that would be suitable for my intentions?\u201d Percy asked, curious if he would be able to do what he needed to do quickly, or if he basically had to live his life as normal with nothing else changing besides him, Millicent and Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you're asking about a tutorial, as I think they are called, then yes. It will teach you how to use the item, far better then I could.' The tome said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cNot exactly. Well, it looks like I'm going to have to figure out what I'm going to do about this. It seems to be the best option, considering that any other will have time will pass back home with Annabeth, Melum and everybody else. But, other then that snag, I'm still not seeing a downside to this. To me, it seems that I could use this item to, in theory, increase my power infinitely. I create a universe that is populated only be women, have all of them insanely strong, and have entire pantheons of women that are even more powerful then that and claim them all. Or, do the inverse and populate the universe with nothing more then insanely powerful men and fight them all to the death, to take their power as my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Those both sound like good options to me, Marked one. The technomancer I received these from was close to his deathbed when I commissioned these, and he was desperate enough for his magnum opus to be powered that I doubt he would care to iron out such an exploit in the system when he made these</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, well, my darkness and fire affinities that I got from the Forgotten God have needed a boost, though my power over death is sufficient enough for the moment...\u201d Percy mused, before shaking his head. \u201cNo, at least, not now. Even if I could, it would make my existence more a chore then anything. In fact, I highly doubt I would be able to contain my power enough to enter a universe if I did either of those options.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Hmm, yes. That does sound like a problem. Though, I should also tell you that these worlds play by rules similar to something called RPG's, or Role-Playing Games, as the mage called it</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes. I've heard about those back home. They're a genre of video game, so I guess it fits. I think they were all turned based or something.\u201d He said, shrugging. \u201cI don't know from personal experience though, since I was never one for such things. My first foray into the lair of those damned Lotus Eaters was the first time I actually touched anything of the sort. Anyways, I need to think on whether or not I should use this. If so, I'll need too evacuate the city and send people back to their own worlds for a while. I'll need to calm the winds and seas, stagnate the vegetation, so that when I get back the place isn't in ruins. I'll also need to move the minions into the Netherworld Tower, along with the tower heart and Eres. They'll have to spill up into the surface world for a while. And... you said you were the power source behind it, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'More or less</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. I'll think on it for the night, and we'll see where this path leads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Very well Marked one. Should you require further information about this, I'll be more than happy to explain in detail.</b>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy rolled his eyes, pulling his hand away from the book. Standing up, he moved silently to his bed, which would be empty save for him. A rare occurrence anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, Percy fell into a sleep that was as empty of dreams as the void was of existence.</span></div></div>",

Have them deliver the message as soon as possible, even if it means forgoing the patrol routes to deliver it.\u201d Percy said, appearing in the heart of the tower, next to the tower heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt once, my Lord.\u201d Eres said, not stopping in her writing. It was as simple as a stray thought, not interrupting her thought process. \u201cDone. By the way, did you know that in the universe the minions came from, the last dragon was killed by the Black Baron just months before he vanished? He had it hidden away in his own personal cache of rare monster remains that he personally stuffed, and, quite possibly where he went to die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d Percy chimed monotonously. \u201cI'll have to find this some other time, just to see if any of it survived. If only his soul was in hell, I could force him to talk. But that stupid goddess of the Elves, bah! If only I didn't want Millicent to have a challenge in her life, and for her to reach her true potential and take the fat wretch down. How Elves allow their priestess' to gorge on so much food to put sumo wrestler's to shame... all in effort of mimicking the slob of a goddess... What did the Forgotten god see in her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously not much, considering he cheated on her with a mortal women.\u201d Eres said, putting the last dot above the last 'i' in her latest book that covered the newest batch of knowledge she had divulged from her soul-bound object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. All she does is sit in the heavens, <i>soaking</i> up all the praise and prayers that what few remaining elves there are give to her daily. I should have kept that statue to mock her. But no, I had to be the nice guy and give it back to a bunch of ghosts after capturing Jewel and all the plunder she had accumulated, including said statue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I was there after all you know.\u201d Eres said with a sigh. Even with a body made entirely out of arcane energy and the natural lust and perversion of the universe, pulling a three day scribing binge could tire her out. Not to mention she hadn't had any energy from her favorite, and only, source, nor in her preferred way in that time, with her mind barely focusing on the other task she had been given of watching his first born daughter as she trained on an island with several groups of minions when Percy wasn't there himself to train her. \u201cSo, if I may ask, what's this meeting for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have learned of a way to train Millicent in more then enough time to ensure she's ready for her journey, but not without having time pass by in this universe. During that time, I won't be able to be contacted, nor will I be able to give energy to you for maintaining the pathways. More so, I do <b>not</b> feel like leaving the entirety of the magic community alone with the possibility of them trying to satiate their curiosity as to how different magical energies would react to one another, possibly undoing all my work in creating this universe and killing everybody in it! It was hard enough to create it the first time! It wasn't easy easy to create a star or planet the first time around, and I doubt it will come naturally to me after this one time! Hell, I haven't even learned how to actually 'create' anything! Hells, I have yet to deal with the other half of this planet's landscape! Damn it all, I doubt any gods born with this power had to deal with situations like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright, I get it!\u201d Eres snapped, rubbing her temples. \u201cYou don't want everything to blow up, fine! Now, unless you are here to give me some of your energy I kindly suggest that you let me rest, because right now I am incredibly tired. In fact, please don't give me any because I want to experience the closest thing to sleep I can right now. I'll let the minions that are currently with your daughter know that you are on your way, as I know you will be. Now, please leave before I go insane from the stress I've put myself under for these last few days and have a meltdown that will make the fake tower-heart explosion seem to be as devastating as a <i>zit being popped</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy frowned, not liking the way she was acting. \u201cI never asked for you to strain yourself, you know? So I suggest, before I damn the consequences and stuff you into the deepest parts of the Eronomicon and forget you're even there, that you change your tone. If you want to go on these binges of recounting all the info the tower-heart has seen since the time of its creation, that's fine. But I will not be the subject of your ire due to you not knowing when to take a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres growled, opening her mouth to retort. But a vicious glare from Percy and his reaching for the tome in his pocket made her realize that it was not an idle threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d She huffed, crossing her arms and turning away from him. The journal she had been writing in was surrounded by the same energy her body was made of, floating to a book shelf that was just out of sight, certainly heading for the spot that was reserved for any information regarding the Black Baron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis glare softening, Percy sighed. Slowly walking up to her, he wrapped his arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I'm sorry that you're feeling tired. It's such a foreign concept to you, I know. And, given that you've been focusing on so many things all together throughout these last few years, it's no surprise that you are starting to feel everything catch up with you. The next few days though, you'll have plenty of time to rest. But I will not accept you lashing out at me for the reason of simply laying out my reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, a small epiphany over came him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, perhaps I can do without the monologue. It seems to be the downfall of any Overlord type position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed, getting back to his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNevertheless, I expect you to cool down for the next few days. I'll be closing the pathways down once I have the population evacuated to their original worlds. You, and the minions, will be moved to the Netherworld tower. I'll give you enough energy to sustain your physical form for a few days, two weeks at most if you keep to the tower-heart unless when necessary. And no more three day writing marathons for a while. Alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres nodded, stifling a yawn that threatened to overcome her as she leaned back against Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d She said sleepily, her eyes half-lidded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright, this time.\u201d Percy said, moving a few strands of her ethereal hair from her face before picking her up in a bridal carry. \u201cYou just rest for now, I'll handle everything for the rest of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the Tower-heart, which floated in the middle of the room. He looked down at Eres, the eons old ghost already asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep tight. You've more then earned it.\u201d He said, laying her down inside her soul-bound object, watching as her physical body dissipated and merged with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, he left the heart of the tower, letting Eres sleep without him watching over her. He had to prepare for the meeting, and some of the district officials would most likely not be happy that it was so early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, they would just have to sit there and listen. Percy was not going to walk on eggshells in his own universe.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAny objections?\u201d Percy asked, looking down from his throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were murmurs of discussion amidst the officials. Was it a wise idea? Was this in their best interest? Was it fair to tell everybody to pack up and leave, even if just for a little bit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. \u201cI take it that there are.\u201d He muttered, given that several people were speaking in less than pleased tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would be the consequences if we objected to this?\u201d One official asked, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fair enough question. I would say that it would be whatever consequences that befall you from my absence, most likely including the breaking of the ban I placed upon magic users as well as not being able to use the pathways for supplies or escape from whatever comes from the magic experiments. And, given that I have not populated the world with animals, it would soon become a vegetarian only world. Well, unless you people started to resort to cannibalism.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d The official said as they sat down, uncomfortable with the topic now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook.\u201d Percy said, standing up. \u201cI know this is unexpected and sudden, but this information was given to me last night, so I've barely had a night to think on it myself. It's still not a sure thing, and I might find another way to do what I want. But, at the same time, it is also a great opportunity for not just my daughter, but for myself as well. From the information I've received, I will be able to learn how to create from nothing better than what I can do now. If so, that means I will be able to at the very least create a supply of meat should something like this happen again. So, I think it will be beneficial for everyone involved, even if it is a hassle to move the entirety of the population back to their worlds for, at most, a few weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the work done on expansion? Surely what's finished will be rotted or weathered away.\u201d The head of the construction teams asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the crops will be long rotted by the time we get back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a solution to that, though it is only a small one. While I can't do anything for the crops that have already been harvested, I am going to try and stagnate the growth, and death, for the crops that are still growing or are ready for harvesting. As for the construction that's been done, or is underway, I am going to make the winds die down until I get back, and I'll also make sure that the oceans are calmed. The only reason I want the people out of here is human error, as I said earlier. While I can't stop time, I can do something close to it.\u201d Percy explained before signaling one member out. \u201cTarn! I want the magic district cleared out first, every wizard sent back to their own world. As official of the district, I place that burden upon you. You will have as many minions as necessary to ensure the more defiant will have no choice but to comply with the order, as well as move current experiments and supplies that will decay over time that I can do nothing for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou plan to act as if going through with this!?\u201d Another council member asked, as if surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I do. The only reason I called this meeting in the first place was to let you know of the situation so it would not catch anyone flatfooted. I could have done this without giving warning beforehand and caused a panic. But I would like to keep the population on civil terms. And try not to forget that you hold no real power here. You are merely a group of people who have been chosen because you seem to be the most reasonable, have had recommendations by a large portion of your respective districts or, in some of your cases, are more then capable in your respective fields. Make no mistake, you are in <i>my</i> world. I allowed you entry here, and I can deny you the same privilege, or throw you back to your old masters, be they king or god. I am sure that they would not be so happy to see, what you amount to in their eyes, traitors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a few had to grit their teeth. He was right. They had abandoned their old worlds, and thus their old allegiances. He had made it perfectly clear when he offered them the chance to live in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now\u201d Tarn, the golden haired, pale skinned head of the magic district spoke up. \u201cI don't believe it needs to devolve to threats. It shall be as you say Overlord. I'll have the district cleared within a month, rest assured. I'm sure my more knowledgeable colleagues will have their own ideas on how to solve this dilemma in a manner that doesn't involve emptying the city while the young and impulsive will try to object.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf any competent and knowledgeable person of the magical persuasion thinks they have a better idea, then they can come tell me in person. I'll be all ears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back in his throne, Percy looked over the council room, gauging each persons feelings on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome were still feeling negatively about this, though that was expected. Most were neutral, leaning variously to either negative or positive on the matter without fully committing to a stance. The smallest group was of those who thought positively about the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarn was one of such people who thought positively about it. Percy could already tell the man was thinking of ways this could effect the limitations on magic in the city. If he, Percy, grew more powerful, then perhaps he would be willing to help experiment with mixing the magical energies without having young, inspiring minds be put at risk to see which magic was capable of mixing together and which ones would be... volatile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTarn, you are dismissed. I want you to get on this right away. I'll mobilize a retinue of minions to escort you. They'll be waiting outside the wall for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man bowed in his seat before he stood, grabbing his staff as four minions entered the room, two blues and two browns, to escort him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was gone, Percy looked over the remaining council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, we should focus on which districts to empty after the magic district is cleared. I'm open to ideas and reasons behind them.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThis... has escalated quickly.\u201d Percy said, overlooking the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his balcony, high above the world, he could hear the shouts of the people from every district, save the now empty magic district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's only been little over a month since I made the announcement. How have they set up a rebellion so quickly?\u201d He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Have you really thought about their best interests?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, you're back? Great...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I will never leave you until the guilt is washed away with atonement...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Atonement? For making sure they weren't trapped in a world with little food and only half finished? Please, I am doing them a favor right now. Besides, if I can learn anything from the worlds in that miniature multiverse that can help with me actually understanding the abilities a god should have, such as creating life from nothing, then it will be all for the better.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So you s-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't even start with that again.' Percy said, cutting off the voice of his guilt. 'As it is, I'm running low on time. Clarisse and the rest are almost to the sea of monsters, maybe a few days off in their world's time. That amounts for a few more weeks here. I don't have the time to deal with some unfounded guilt.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You will lose the trust of the population...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And?' Percy asked as he walked back into his room. 'I know they were already weary of me because of what I can do. This is merely a reaction to learning that they would have to leave their homes for a while. If... the hell is that whistling sound?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower rumbled, the sounds of something crashing to the grounds soon following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't tell me...\u201d Percy said, slapping a hand over his face as he walked back outside and looked over the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge boulders, a dozen or so, littered the ground, debris surrounding them from their spot of impact against the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot from the tower itself, but from where they had cracked themselves on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy gazed up, seeing the siege weaponry that had launched the stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, outside the city limits, were what seemed... no, they were exactly that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant catapults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are they even structurally sou... Oh, damn it all.\u201d He said, rubbing the bridge of his nose to stave off the encroaching migraine. \u201cOf course they would. Enchanted wood is not easy to make, I hope they know. The druids won't be happy, that's for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Percy, what was that? I felt the tower shake.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It seems we have an uprising, my dear Eres. A lot of people were <b>not</b> happy at my declaration. They've used the wood that was enchanted for some of the more outlandish projects that the magic district had wanted to work on in the future to make themselves... giant catapults.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\u2026'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\u2026'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\u2026'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eres?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're kidding, right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, though I wish I was. Come up to my room and see for yourself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he waited, Percy could only watch in wonder as the rickety, yet sound, giant weapons of war were slowly cocked back to reload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you have got to be...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo glad you could join me.\u201d Percy said, not tearing his eyes away from the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are they doing this?\u201d Eres asked as she floated next to him, eyes wide in absolute wonderment at the sheer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupidity didn't cover it, did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I asked them to leave the world for a little bit. It seems they like their quiet life and don't want to give it up for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the opposite of quiet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. Look down to the inner grounds of the wall.\u201d He said, pointing straight down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing so, Eres had to keep herself from bashing her head into the railing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf all the stupid, childish, disrespectful-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Percy said, though he didn't sound angry. \u201cAt least I know the tower will hold against siege weapons now. Still not sure about a giant attack though... maybe I should have Cerberus test that out when everyone is gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do about them?\u201d Eres asked, pointing in the direction of the catapults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're going to do several things.\u201d Percy said simply. \u201cEres, have all the brown minions gather down in the audience hall below the tower. Every single one. Even Giblet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Isn't that overkill?\u201d She asked, only to have Percy merely look at her expectantly. \u201cAlright then. Give me a minute...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you do that, I'm going to go pick up Millicent. This should be something she sees.\u201d Percy said as he walked away, vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ An island far away ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where could she be...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun away!\u201d A high pitched cry rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe didn't mean to disturb sleepy break!\u201d A similar voice cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth these were soon followed by the sound of breaking trees, likely being broken by an angered punch, and surprised yelps as the minions dodged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was simple enough. Just follow the sound of terrified screams.\u201d Percy said, more then a tad amused. \u201cMy, will that girl ever watch her strength? And it seems she inherited her aunt Velvet's temper regarding the little things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to save the minions from a brutal death, or at the least a beat down that will make them wish for the embrace of death, Percy made his way through the forest that covered most of the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions should be glad they were quick on their feet, for their cries were soon joined by the sounds of more destruction and angry roars of a sleep-deprived ten-year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I believe that is quite enough.\u201d Percy said as he walked into the, newly made, clearing. Up-turned soil and wooden debris lay scattered about, gaping wounds in the earth signified where trees had been moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent had caught up to the minions, grabbing their shoulders tightly and forcing them down to their knees. They were whimpering in fear as she glared at them, and her eyes were glowing enough that Percy could see the light that radiated from them even though her back was to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first-born wasn't winded in the slightest, despite her raging as she chased them. She slowly tightened her grip, feeling as the bone in their shoulders was strained, cracking under the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't care if you look like the women who saved me.\u201d She growled out, every word laced with hatred. \u201cNo one wakes me up like that.<b> Isd</b><i>la</i>u<i><b>ay</b></i>s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTranslation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a very painful, mind breakingly horrifying way that would leave each reincarnation of you a gibbering wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Percy asked, louder this time. \u201cI said, that is enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod of his head in her direction, watery bindings appeared around the girl, clamping tight to ensure she couldn't move. Each of her fingers had what amounted to rings around them, seemingly connected to the rest of her encasement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she moved her fingers in an attempt to hurt the minions, it would cause the water around her arms and head to essentially tighten, the water growing dense and heavier while compressing itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster!\u201d The two cried, looking up at him past the bound form of their captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I would like to know what exactly happened, I don't have time for it today. Millicent, you will release them this instant, or there will be consequences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled, tightening her grip. What should have caused pain from that motion did nothing but annoy her, making her growl louder and narrow her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected. She was made of far tougher stuff then a regular mortal after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two in her grasp whimpered louder, eyes screwed shut in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. He really, really did not have time for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI warned you.\u201d He said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore water appeared around Millicent, condensing to a point where it seemed that the water was more solid then liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water forcefully pried the girl's fingers from the shoulders of the two minions, already starting to swell from the broken veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quickly scurried away from her, towards Percy before hiding behind him, like kicked puppies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll talk about this later, you two.\u201d Percy said to the two behind him. \u201cBut I have things to do today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another lazy nod of his head, Millicent's watery bindings clamped her arms to her side, making her stand straight with no chance of moving even a toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same goes for you.\u201d Percy said, turning her to face him, her eyes glaring at him with, not hate, but something greater then anger. \u201cDon't give me that look. I'm pretty sure I made myself loud enough for you to hear me over your attempted murder of these two. As I said, I'm very busy today, but there is something I want you to watch unfold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Percy vanished with the three, traveling back to the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was that the only stop he made before dealing with this uprising?</span></div></div>",

He thought, trudging through the burning landscape, ignoring the screams and moans of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you sure you want to do this, Sire?' Eres asked. 'And most of the brown minions have arrived.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Absolutely.' Percy thought back. 'Now call Morticia to the assembly hall. And do not object to this course. I merely want them to understand that to rebel against me is meaningless.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear her huff of annoyance at his preemptive dismissal of her concerns, but she quickly closed the link to do as he ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, where is she?' Percy thought, overlooking the ocean of lava for a sign of his target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet Mother Goddess, help me!\u201d A damned soul cried out at the top of their incorporeal lungs. \u201cNo! NO! KEEP HER AWAY! AHHHHH! I'M SORRY! FORGIVE ME! AHH! NO! NO! NOOOO-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again, one of the ways to find what he was looking for that day was to follow the tortured screams of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there some multiversal theme he didn't know about for this moment across all universes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the sure fire ways he knew it was his target was the fact that the Reapers would have let the victim scream longer, making their torture progress in such a gruesome fashion that they would beg to be killed, in as much as one could when already damned, just for the moment of respite before their body repaired itself for even further torture that would be even worse then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother was the use of 'Her' in their wording. Only two women ever came to this place, and Morticia was not in this infernal place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccubi didn't count, since they didn't actually take part in tormenting people. They were more-so there to tempt people and lure their souls to Hell. The only time they actually tormented people was if the only sins they committed were Lust based.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing the ashen wasteland, Percy came upon a sight that was not all uncommon in the land of the damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soul of a mortal, looking to be a man in his thirties from Nordburg or one of the smaller communities around there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at him, seeing what he had done to earn a spot way down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh. A whaler who, while not living in Nordburg, had visited there quite often. He had taken part in adulterous affairs with several married women, killed a man in cold blood by tossing him overboard their ship during a trip, weighed down with rocks in deathly cold waters that held abominations against the Mother Goddess at their deepest depths, and vicious animals near the surface, and had more then once been rude to his hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecent arrival, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was held down by many large rocks, several of which were clung to his genitals by chains that pierced clean through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was held above a special lake of liquid fire, several hands made of the stuff reaching for him, several already wrapped around his wrists and ankles, pulling on the boulders that hung from them. His skin, that which wasn't burnt that is, was stretched as his limbs were forcefully pulled down by both gravity and the hands of magma. In more than one place, the skin was ripped, some just as Percy was within the perfect distance to watch it happen if he were a mortal man, showing the muscles and sinews beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was foaming at the mouth, his eyes rolled back into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that explained the sudden silence. His mind had shut down, for the moment anyway, mid-scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the reason for that currently had her hand wrapped around several of the chains that pierced the man's lower region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hand was different from the ones made of lava. Instead of being semi-liquid, it was solid with a flame raging around it, making the chains burn bright red from end to end. While the lava around it was more orange then any other color, the hand was a dark, smoldering red with two-inch claws in place of nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand was pulling on the chains, as if wondering what they did, only causing the man to spasm and cry, his tears turning to scalding hot steam to burn his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmber! Quit playing around! There's something I need you for!\u201d Percy called into the small pool of torture as he stood at the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand, and the magma equivalents around, jerked at the sound of his voice, two large hands emerging from the lava in what seemed to be an attempt to drag him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to wrap around him in a very loving, almost childish manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing Percy was glad that he didn't have to train in was natural resistance to all things fire related.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it was incredibly uncomfortable to him due to naturally being more inclined with water, the opposite of fire, but he could take anything fire tried to do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, only if his control over the damned element was as natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was being smothered by the lethal liquid hands, a figure emerged from the pool, leaving the poor man hanging there without the extra torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, and it was definitely a woman, was very... Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood at Six foot eight inches tall, with very well defined muscles all over her body. Her skin was the same smoldering red color from her head to her feet, flames dancing across every inch of it in a beautifully chaotic manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was fire itself, though different from the fire that danced around her body. It seemed to try and eat itself, but was also always growing, causing it to change length constantly. It also seemed very adverse to mingling with her fiery aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were a burnt orange, pupils gray like smoke instead of black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sported bull-like horns on her head, not unlike a certain bipedal cow that had been a thorn in Percy's side. They were easily two feet long, and they were much pointier than the original Minotaur\u2019s horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, he had four Minotaur horns now. He should really find something to do with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, she also sported a long, thick tail, more draconian then Echidna's in her human form, with black scales that bounced all light off of them, It swayed to and fro as she walked, and Percy knew it was more than capable of knocking someone through the air without much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Ember, the 'leader' of the red minions. As much of a leader a beast can be, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the magma pool completely, the fiery liquid dripping from her body. She smiled at Percy, slowly walking towards him with her arms out to reach for him, like a toddler walking to their parent. Her smile was held both the innocence of a child and the grace of a predator, her abnormally sharp teeth, even among the minions, stained forever with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the lava she liked to bathe and swim in had long killed any bacteria, and the raging inferno around her kept any from forming on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing about her was the fact that she was completely nude, due to the aforementioned fire that surrounded her destroying any clothing that she wore, and the lava melting anything else that she tried to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footprints she left behind charred the already burnt landscape, leaving flames flickering in wake of her travel. Wherever she walked, the three-toed, or perhaps it should be said three-clawed, footprints were burned into the earth for years to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most powerful red minion at Percy's disposal, one of the most powerful minions in terms of sheer destructive force. Ember was akin to a force of nature embodied. All things related to fire were hers to command, and she could control lava like the blues controlled water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was also the one most driven by instinct. She was a wild animal given the power of fire, and then a human form. She acted on her whims, but never truly thinking of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was his to command, and only him. Even Eres had a hard time ordering the minion around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber reached through the lava, grabbing hold of her Overlord and pulling him close, a rumble from her chest making clear her happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes Ember. I'm happy to see you too.\u201d Percy said, returning the hug she gave him. \u201cI came by to see if you wanted to cause a little mayhem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a sound, the animal equivalent of asking why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she didn't enjoy partaking in mayhem or destruction, mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems some people are not happy with me, and are being very naughty.\u201d Percy explained, talking as if to a child. \u201cI was hoping you could help them see the error of their ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, it seemed as if something in the minion's psyche had flipped. Her happy rumbling had become menacing, the lava within a hundred yards boiling with her anger. Fire flicked between her teeth and her eyes had become those of a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll innocence had been lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped back, looking at Percy before she finally spoke, one of the few sentences she knew and remembered. Her voice was a great rumbling sound, dark as the deepest pits of hell. The entirety of Hell itself shook with her utterance of three words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\"><b>\u201cFor the Overlord...\u201d</b></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy watched as the last of the Brown minions scrambled to join the crowd below the dais he stood upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the span of two years, he had acquired enough life force for this army, this horde of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerely one of four factions, and it was the most numerous by far. Forty thousand strong, and always on the rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than overkill for the situation. Eres had not been wrong about that. Not even a quarter of them would be needed for this, to be perfectly honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting Giblet out in the field would further reduce that number, the forge mistress being the physically strongest minion, more powerful than Ember. With reckless abandon, the eldest of the minions could level the entire city herself without breaking a sweat, pull down a fortress with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing Ember with Giblet would reduce it to a few teams. The two seemed to have worked together in the past, it seemed, as part of a specialized team, if the info Eres dug up was to be believed, and could deal some nasty damage that would change the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding Morticia to the mix was tantamount to genocide. The Blue Reaper, as she was known, was no slouch in battle, be it magical or physical, the latter unusual among the Blue minion tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the three minion leaders, they had joined Percy up on the dais.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorticia was standing, looking at something only she could see with an empty gaze. Her robe, different from her sisters in that it was black instead of blue, with bones sown in at random places. It was tattered, but not exactly falling apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes, the lavender depths dulled, almost lifeless, had bags under them. Her skin was a ghostly pale, not unlike those of the undead soldiers Clarisse currently had at her command. But, where their skin was fake, an illusion, Morticia's was real. In one were to touch it, other than Percy, they would feel the warmth drained from their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcane energies seeped from her feet in an ever present mist, a fog that made it look like she was floating above the ground, an ethereal specter come to claim their souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also sported a mask, carved from the skull of Gnarl. A testament of her loyalty for her Overlord. It was held in one hand for the moment, the other hand holding a scythe that stood taller than Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pole was a darkened wood, with innumerable small notches carved into it, like a tally of some kind. It was sturdy, enchanted heavily to ward off decay, termites, water and physical blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade of the weapon, which had a reach of three and two-thirds feet, gleamed in the light of the assembly hall. It was made entirely of iron, with a coating of silver around the edge of the blade to deal with otherworldly monsters that could not be killed with steel alone. It was polished, almost as if religiously, with not a drop of blood staining it. The edge of the blade itself had been carefully maintained, by hand, with a whetstone that Morticia carried around in a small satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso inside the satchel were various bones, tiny pouches of ingredients for potions that allowed her to maintain her stamina during a heated battle, or round of bedroom activities, and a purse that held not coins, but souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the most powerful Blue minion, Morticia was a powerful necromancer. She was the only minion besides Ember that went into the Infernal Abyss on a regular basis. She could use souls in her magic, unlike any other Blue, and rarely used anything but her dark arts and the abilities afforded to her from her connection with her Overlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had little need of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, in all of the Blue minion tribe, Morticia was the most powerful in the arts regarding death. While it had been difficult for the first few years, she was becoming increasingly competent in her new station, with her new body and powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiblet stood on her left, separating the Minion Minion mistress from the demonic beast known as Ember. While the undead blue disliked being in close proximity to the walking inferno, who was causing the stone around her to melt in her current state of anger, Giblet felt right at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Forge Mistress, and head of the Brown Minion tribe, was idly swinging her beloved hammer back and forth, wishing she could go back to making all sorts of little trinkets and baubles. It had been a slow few months for her, since her Overlord had required so little of her expertise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also wished he would bring the cyclops back to help in the forge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she didn't work fine on her own, but the times her master had helped, or needed help, with forging were few and far between. It was nice to have someone who could appreciate the craft on a professional level to work with though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving worked the forge for... how long had it been?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiblet stopped swinging her hammer, devoting all her mental power to trying to remember how long she had worked the forge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least... twelve years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well, it wasn't important. She liked her job. Given her strength, she was on the reserves of the minions, always in the tower in case there happened to be a little home-invasion problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe it rats or 'heroes'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlegh, the word left a nasty taste on her tongue. While she could grasp that she wasn't the sharpest blade in the halfling, she knew how much grief had been caused for all her previous masters, and how much her current one disliked the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiblet started to swing her arms back and forth again, looking around the cavern for no real reason. There were no shinnies to be found in the stone, no metals for her to tinker with. She knew this perfectly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Forge Mistress stood at six foot three inches in height. She wore a light cotton shirt, permanently smudged with soot and ash and sweat, on her upper body. Atop that was a blacksmiths apron, reaching down to her knees. On her lower body she wore a crude rendition of shorts, made from cloth and tied with a leather belt around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtop her head, she wore a welder's mask, something Percy was quite baffled at, since it seemed she had it around for a very long time judging by the slight warp and the patchwork she had made on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin was, appropriately enough, browned from her long years at the forge. A few small patches of skin, one of which happened to be on her foot, were of new, untanned skin, due to accidents that ended up with molten metal on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it was more than an inconvenience to her. She had taken worse injuries when she had been out in the field, such as the time she had lost three-quarters of her right hand. Thankfully, some Blue minions had been able to fix her right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the time she had been set on fire by a dwarven mechanism...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShot with an arrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeen run through with a spear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer amount of cuts she received from blades, broken legs from trolls and other large creatures...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list went on. And for it all, she had gained incredible defense to near-almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cept poison...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd magic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd acid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so maybe she hadn't gained a defense for almost everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean she wasn't sturdy though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Giblet was probably the toughest minion, save the essentially immortal Morticia. And, outside her skill at the forge and immense strength, she had little else that deemed her 'special' from the other Brown minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was fine with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, when you were as strong as her, as skilled at metalworking as her, could handle pain as well as her, you really didn't want anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber was to the far left of the Dais, the stone around her melted, leaving her to sink a few inches every couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames around her were whirling around, frenzied. She hissed, her chest rumbling with her displeasure. She wanted to go out and destroy those who would disobey the Overlord, not sit here and wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the Overlord had commanded her to wait, saying that soon she would be able to teach them all a lesson. He asked her to strain a resource that she had very little of for any other than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlames leaped from her tongue as she ground her teeth, her claws ready to be like the blood-soaked daggers in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three snapped to attention, as much as any of them could, when Percy cleared his throat.</span></div></div>",

One that, while I'm sure most of you are unneeded to solve, I want to make myself perfectly clear on my position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions were silent, all focusing on the Overlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that some people are unhappy with my decision. As it was, I gave the more powerful magic-users time to think on alternate solutions while they were being moved through the pathways. They could not offer one that I felt would work well enough. And so, I feel that I am doing what is better for the people. But they don't like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark mass started to form at his feet, swirling around him as it rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I anticipated that they would not wholeheartedly except my course of action, I had not anticipated how much they would defy this action. While I had expected outcry, I had not expected rebellion. While I would have forgave damnation and hatred...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, his eyes flashing in anger. The dark mass had risen to his chest, forming a solid curtain that obscured his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not forgive this traitorous action!\u201d He roared, the assembly hall vibrating. His voice had grown deeper, and his mouth was set in a snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI brought them here, offering them my protection from whatever may have befallen them! I promised fertile lands for farming, so that they would not go hungry! I had promised that all previous crimes they may have committed would be ignored if they obeyed my law!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark mass was above his head, fully enclosing him in a pillar of darkness, the light of his eyes the only thing visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had promised them that I would refrain from using my power, be it as creator of this world or as the Harem God, on the people in the city! I have had all of you help them, be it healing the sick or building their houses! And this is how they repay me? Repay us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark mass was dispersing, two lights joining that of his eyes, around the spot his hands would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now, they are making a pitiful attempt to lay siege to the tower! They have used precious resources to aid their childish actions!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtain of darkness was gone, revealing the armor-clad form of Perseus. The eye-like gems on the back of his gauntlets were looking around wildly, sucking in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to feed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will not stand for this! Blood shall be spilled this day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions were getting giddy now. Excited murmurs and fidgeting born of anticipation spread throughout the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiblet was now hopping up and down, her eyes alight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorticia's eyes seemed to focus a bit, the hand that held the mask raising it slowly to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber gnashed her teeth, her tail into the ground as she climbed out of the magma puddle, paying no mind to the super heated rock around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shall unleash Hell upon these traitorous curs! Let the dogs of war gnash at their throats!\u201d He said, getting a roar of agreement from the crowd. \u201cThis shall be a warning to all who come after! No one betrays the Overlord!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the minions were cheering, whoops and cries of excitement echoing, not just within the cave, not just within the underground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one betrays the Overlord!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very foundations upon which the tower stood shook, and not from the fifth or sixth volley of giant boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent was on the balcony at the top of the tower, watching as the rebels took out their frustration over nothing on the tower gardens. They weren't doing much else with the artillery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems he won't take this sitting down.\u201d Eres said with a sigh, floating next to the girl. \u201cNor will he take this at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent said nothing, only focusing on her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be so much easier to control them. Take away their free will, or break it. Either one would have worked. Otherwise, things like this would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they showed signs of growing a spine, break it. Tear it out, throw it on the ground and crush it beneath your heel, leaving them to weep as they did as ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had seen it happen in Nordburg. Though, it was the women who did it to the men, and it was over something as little as an extra helping of seal, or even imaginary things such as a woman thinking that their man had cheated on them without having any reason to be suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, what they tried to do to her, for a while. Before they were forced to abandon that prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, I shouldn't be surprised. After that incident with those seven, he seems to detest betrayal to an insane degree. It was his personal quest for a while to kill them, or in Jewel's case capture, instead of conquer the lands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed again, though this time it was a wistful sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, seeing him about to unleash hell upon these rebels has got me more then a little excited.\u201d She said with a smirk. \u201cI can't wait for him to come back. Drenched in blood, excess energy to burn off... possibly twenty or so minions that he'll want to bring to bed...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent glared at the woman. Was pleasure of the fle... whatever she was, all she thought about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed so to her. Every time she had been around the woman, she had mentioned sex in some form or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be quiet.\u201d Millicent growled, moving a few steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now. Don't be like that.\u201d Eres said with a grin. \u201cWhy, I'll bet that when you've grown, you'll have to stab the suitors with all manner of sharp sticks to keep them away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot likely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, she's probably right, but not for the reasons she's probably thinking of.' The apparition thought, looking at the Overlord's daughter from the corner of her eye. \u201cAnyway, the massacre about to occur should be a delight to behold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I can see much.\u201d Millicent mumbled. Her eyesight may have been beyond human, but even she couldn't see more then a mass of people, almost a blob, from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind whipped around the tower, clouds that had already looked like they would rain letting loose their deluge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than should have been normal, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my. It seems everything is going against these rebels.\u201d Eres mocked, the carnage about to unfold making her quiver with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning flickered across the sky, striking the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what a wonderful spec... Wait.\u201d Eres stopped her short-lived clapping of joy. \u201cHe hasn't gained power over lightning, not even here. And something else seems-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bolt of lightning flashed, Eres's eyes narrowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't coming down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that we may have a naughty little mage in our-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more bolts of lightning went up into the clouds, as if trying to disperse them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was working, as a hole started to form where the bolts struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake it three, possibly four.\u201d She mused. 'Perseus, we may have a problem.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What now?' He growled out mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mages. Three or four of them. They're trying to disperse the clouds you called.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't call any damned clouds. Must have naturally formed. As for the mages, I know how to handle them. Never again shall they think to defy me, or question my power.' He bit out. 'Morticia! I have a special job for y-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the link was cut, and Eres was left to silence as she watched several boulders sail through the sky again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that explains how they were able to obtain this much ammunition, as well as hide these things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the wolf-riders to mount up! We're hitting them with everything we've got!\u201d Percy barked, sending a hundred or so Minions scrambling out of the cavern. \u201cEveryone else head to the armory! Gear for heavy battle! I want these people kneeling before me, be it chains or in death! Gabby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minion, near the front of the crowd, ran up and knelt before the dais. She was dirty, and a miner's cap was on her head with a pickaxe clutched in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to get started digging tunnels behind their lines. I want them confused, scared and panicking. You can have a team of forty to help you. There are extra picks in the armory for them to use. Make them big enough for the wolf-riders to get through as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish it!\u201d Gabby, the second in command of the brown tribe said before she quickly ran into the crowd to pick out decent minions that could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched as the crowd was becoming a surging mass of chaos as they scrambled to fulfill his orders, happy cries and shouts of joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly what the minions were made for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the three tribe leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou three are sticking with me until we get into the thick of i-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perseus, we may have a problem.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day was growing more and more irksome by the second.</span></div></div>",

It was obvious the man was not a soldier of any kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're just hearing things. Stress about this whole mess must be getting to you.\u201d Another man said, taking a sip of water from the river. \u201cC'mon, we got to get back and get ready in case something happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don't understand why we're doing this.\u201d A third said, a youth that was only just starting to grow facial hair. \u201cIt seems a fool's errand to fight the king and his forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, boy.\u201d The second man said. \u201cIt's the principle of it all. We won't be run out of our homes at the whims of anybody, king or god, and not for eight years either! Besides, if the king is so great, he should be ab-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sounds of earth being moved, great amounts of it, filled the air. The sounds of women shouting accompanied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTa-da!\u201d One woman cried, poking her head above ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's one of them!\u201d The boy cried. Even dirtied as she was, there was no mistaking one of the minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill it then! He must be making his move now! Hurry, back to the others!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the man stepped forward, unsheathing his sword, he felt something give in the ground beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't even have time to scream as he fell down, sending the minion under the earth toppling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, looking down before he quickly recoiled. Women they may have looked like, but he didn't like them. He wanted to be as far away as he could from them whenever possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooksies at what we got here.\u201d Another voice said, accompanied by the sound of a wolf growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked up, and the last thing he saw was the fangs of a wolf as it bit down on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad wolfy! Master said offer chance at surr... sirre... sar- giving up.\u201d The minion riding the Wolf said, giving it a stern look. \u201cOh well. Master also said never waste food so... num nums!\u201d The minion said, mood turning completely around. \u201cBut get outta everyone's way first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf wasted no time, picking up its meal and walking up to the hole before climbing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the remaining men, holes were opening up in the ground, large enough to let two oxen pass side by side with their handler between them, though that would be a bit of a tight squeeze. Giant wolves, taller than a full-grown man, were climbing up out of them, one having the now headless corpse of their squad mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger of the two couldn't help it, upon seeing the corpse of man, with blood dripping from the large animal's jaws, he retched. The sounds of crunching bone probably didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder tried to unsheathe his sword, doing so in a clumsy way that made a few minions laugh before he found a spear at his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I'm sorry! I give, I give!\u201d He cried, throwing down his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww.\u201d Several minions groaned in disappointment. They were really looking forward to more bloodshed, or at least a good fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Gabby called, pulling herself up from a hole as more minions, on foot like her, did the same. \u201cDigging team is heading back once everyone is clear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGabby!\u201d A mounted minion called. \u201cThis guy says he gives up!\u201d She said, pointing at the man who threw down his weapon, making an awful sound as he shook in his armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpoil sport!\u201d Another minion called, pouting as she scratched her wolf behind the ears, cooing softly about how he would get a nice chew toy that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did, did he?\u201d She asked. Well, that was fast. \u201cWell, somebody tie him up then! Master said he wanted everybody that's going against him kneeling before him in chains!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr death!\u201d A foot soldier called, climbing out of a large hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight! Or death!\u201d She called, walking over to the young man. \u201cAnd what about him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno.\u201d A minion close to her shrugged. \u201cToo sick to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, poor little baby.\u201d Gabby mockingly cooed as she stepped next to him, not minding the bile that was splashed all over the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed him by the shirt, effortlessly picking him up so his pale face was looking her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you say?\u201d She asked, smiling a little too wide at him. \u201cGive up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy shook harder, seeing those sharp teeth so close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing her patience real quickly, Gabby shook him, grinning even wider. \u201cDo. You. Give. Up?\u201d She asked, a growl becoming more obvious with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. He was going to die. Why had he joined this stupid rebellion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Gabby growled out, her smile never leaving her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout so much a second's hesitation, Gabby tossed the boy, as effortlessly as she had picked him up, to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight into the waiting maw of another wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brown walked over, ignoring the sounds of crunching, almost wondering if she should steal an arm. The wolf wouldn't miss something so small, would it? Besides, the arm was tasty. Not as tasty as, say, the stomach or liver, but still good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it was a possibility for later, the minion picked something up from the ground that lay just underneath the wolf's mouth in a puddle of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small brown orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife force, what minions were created from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive that here.\u201d Gabby said, smacking the minion out of the trance the shiny orb caused the minion to enter as she grabbed said orb. \u201cI'll give that to the master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got another one!\u201d A foot soldier said, climbing out of the earth with another orb in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! Ooh! I'll take it!\u201d Another minion said, bouncing up and down with a pick in her hand. \u201cMaster will be so happy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon those words, it dawned on the minions, those that would be heading back anyway, that Percy loved it when they brought back the minion making energy during times of battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as all devoted minion did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to fight for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting, clawing, pulling hair, knocking out teeth, attempts to break bones or feed to wolves... They did it all. The poor soldier who held it was swarmed, being tackled back into the opening in the earth with more minions following the first group, ending in a giant pile of squirming bodies as they attempted to grasp the ethereal object that would grant them their Overlord's favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the sheer amount of brown minions there were, it was a dog-fight-dog world to rise above the regular rank-and-file. Not to say that there was bad blood in the tribe. It was more of a healthy competition to keep things interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, enough of that.\u201d Gabby said, not really angry or irritated. \u201cMaster's waiting for us. Now, Move it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams echoed down the streets of the city, making those who had not taken part in the rebellion, but had not yet left, cower in their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome wept for those they knew, friends or family, that had entered into this suicidal endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouses burned, and blood ran through the streets as the minions cut down the rebels that would not surrender. Those that gave up upon seeing the horde were treated little better, wrapped in chains and rope as they were tossed, most times literally, to the side like trash to wait until they were brought before the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions cried out, happy with the slaughter and wanton destruction. The ripped down doors, broke the bones of the rebels, bathed in the blood of the fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorticia was among the horde, but her objective was different. While she did not hesitate to cut down anyone who stood in her path, whether or not they surrendered, she paid little attention. Her orders were to head out of the city and raise an army. She collected any and all souls she came across, heeding not if they were traitors or an unfortunate innocent who had tried to flee the city at the wrong time, to help her along with this endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiblet was in the gardens of the tower, grumbling about how these rebels were making extra work for her so she couldn't join in on the slaughter. She was picking up the boulders, a little troublesome even for her because the rock was incredibly dense, therefore much heavier then it appeared. Still, she did manage to lift the blatant misuse of earth and, with a little help from Ember to balance the, now incredibly hot, rocks, toss them out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one reason Ember was not incinerating a path through the city right now, and it was because Percy wanted to keep the destruction <i>in</i> the city to a minimum. The mess a minion horde caused would be far simple to clean up then the mess Ember would make if she was let completely loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the city though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I'm sure you get the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Percy himself, he was back up in the tower, standing with Eres and Millicent as he decided on which weapon he should use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiptide was out, since he wanted people to remember these people for ages, whisper about their foolish actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't keen on the giant mace that he used during the monster attack on the camp. He absently made a side note to himself to think of a name for the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gauntlets already had something planned for their feast, but it wouldn't hurt to allow them to feed more. The hand washing would be a bitch though, since Percy would not allow anyone else to touch one of the single most powerful items at his disposal without them being securely on his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on this, Percy also made note that he really needed to expand his own repertoire of weapons and abilities, as well as train those he already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was another thing for this training trip, he supposed.</span></div></div>",

Will Gabby and her crew be back soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should be a few more minutes. After all, they don't have to dig back this way.\u201d Eres said, mentally ordering about four hundred or so green minions to go look for captives and gather what would in the near future be their sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded slowly, turning to Millicent. \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d He asked, genuinely curious as to what his daughter thought of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted, crossing her arms as she glared at both him and Eres. \u201cI don't know. I couldn't see much. It's too far for me to see clearly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d He asked, looking at Eres from the side of his eye. \u201cAnyway, that wasn't what I meant. I was asking what you think should be done with these traitors. Those that live, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill them.\u201d Millicent said without a moments hesitation. \u201cPeople who act like this don't get second chances. Better to make them rot in the ground then let them try something like this again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something he'd considered. It wouldn't even be a waste of human resources, since Morticia could always raise them back up as undead workers. In fact, it would be beneficial to do so as it would remove the need to waste food on these ingrates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, very tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, You could break their minds.\u201d Millicent continued. \u201cRip out their spines and make sure they never grow back. But killing them would be so much more satisfying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>love</i> the way she thinks.\u201d Eres commented, a grin plastered on her face as the energy that made up her body roiled around in a manner that seemed like a silent laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent seemed a little disgusted by that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiblet dear! We have another volley incoming!\u201d Eres called down, the scream of rage that drifted up making her chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't lying either. The last volley that they would make was flying through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid!\u201d Giblet yelled, hefting a boulder onto her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMean!\u201d She roared, lifting the boulder above her head, digging her fingers in deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBastards!\u201d She cried, rearing back and heaving the giant rock through the air with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiblet just wants to have some slaughtering fun!\u201d She yelled as she dug her claws into the next boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing more then a cry of rage, Giblet threw that one as well, her muscles straining her shirt as she worked them in a fit of blind anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first boulder she threw hit the opposing projectile, the one that was roughly in the middle. They collided with such force that the kinetic energy behind the two caused both rocks to completely shatter, the remaining energies creating a shock wave that sent the other boulders that were heading to the tower to the sides, going wide of the tower and likely to hit the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second rock she threw went through the falling debris, well over the city walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy took pleasure from the screams as one of the catapults was crushed as the rock landed on it. People scrambled to run from the giant siege weapon, from the threat of being crushed beneath either the falling contraption or the boulder itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, mind that these boulders were not small either. These were easily larger then an elephant, and had they been normal rocks would have weighed several tonnes. These rocks had been magically condensed to that point, making them multitudes heavier then they would appear to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that boulder hit, it sunk into the ground, sending a lot of people into the air who would not survive the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy chuckled darkly as he listened to Giblet descend into a frenzied string of curses as she began to hurl boulders haphazardly, fueled by her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so glad I had the earth that the city was built on packed to the point where things like these boulders wouldn't leave too much of a dent.\u201d Percy said before his eyes looked at the other catapults. \u201cWell, there's no reason to let so much rain go unused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his hand towards the weapons, Percy made a tight fist in the air above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain that was falling slowed before stopping, hanging in the air. Soon enough, it was flying back to the heavens, collecting above the war machines. All the water that pooled in the streets of the city, the barrels and the gutters joined with the large mass of water. Even that water that was soaking the ground returned from whence it came, rising from the ground like snakes before rising into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Percy spread the water evenly into five different spheres, moving them above the catapults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should really stop with the theatrics, you know.\u201d Eres lightly chided him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommanding the water, Percy formed five fists in the air, hanging menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore screams filled the air from beyond the city walls, and Percy drank it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that he was starting to let this go on for too long, Percy brought his fist down into his other hand with a loud smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't very surprised when four of the five watery fists were destroyed by lightning, the large amounts of water falling uselessly to the ground without his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be halfway decent mages.\u201d Percy evaluated. \u201cEven as low power as that was, I doubt a novice could have done as much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, one of the catapults did suffer destruction, with a little less damage to the area than Giblet's retaliation caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be taking control now, Eres. Try and make something so Millicent can watch this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morticia, are you ready?' Percy asked the devoted necromancer mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Almost, my Lord. All that is needed is to give the word and these cretins will know fear.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And the wolf-riders?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, yeah! All ready Master!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good. Ember, Giblet! Get ready to go. Forget anything left in the gardens.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shout of joy reached his ears, coming from the bottom of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I want all browns in the city to move to the north district! Morticia, raise the army in five minutes!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Percy stepped through space to appear in the garden, absently calling some water from the kitchens to put out the fires caused by Ember's mere presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Giblet first, pulling her close as he vanished, reappearing several yards away to grab the embodiment of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, they vanished, appearing half a quarter of a mile west of the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what to do, right Ember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grunt and nod was all the response he got, and needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the red minion off there to do what he had laid out for her in incredibly simple details that even she would be able to understand, Percy stepped back into the city via the shadow Giblet cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow he managed to pull someone through their own shadow is best left unexplained.</span></div></div>",

I don't doubt that he could, if what some of the people say about him is true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's true alright.\u201d Another said, shaking his head. \u201cHe's toying with us, it would seem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've heard tales he doesn't take betrayal well. Something about some companions of his in the past.\u201d A third proclaimed with a sigh. \u201cI still feel like something's not right though...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be so depressed!\u201d The fourth and final member of the group exclaimed, their voice betraying their energy. \u201cIf we can show him that we can work together, he'll have to acknowledge that our magic is no different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right, my dear.\u201d A fifth voice said, but not from anywhere specific. It seemed to surround them, an all-encompassing presence. \u201cAnd people like the king only respect strength. You will likely have to fight him with your combined might. But, I'm sure you four will be able to convince him that his ban on mixing magics is foolish, though not misplaced in heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d The third voice spoke, rubbing the back of their head with a sigh. \u201cBut, did we have to incite rebellion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, there was no other way. If you tried this before hand, the king would have stopped you all, and likely put you to death. If there is one thing about the king, it's that he wants to keep the people safe. A little heavy-handed in his ways, yes, but he knows that people aren't as durable as him. I doubt he will do anything... drastic, in response to this little uprising.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, everybody was high strung with the news that they'd have to leave for a little while. It isn't easy to pack up on the fly if you don't have magic.\u201d The fourth voice chimed in. \u201cThe king shouldn't hurt anybody, at least not too much, for this little bit of stress relief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. The king can be a compassionate fellow. He should be able to look past this incident, if he is as powerful as some people can proclaim.\u201d The first voice said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so. I just hope that no one in the town got hurt by that last volley.\u201d The second voice said, concern thick in their tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFear not. I watched as the king himself destroyed the artillery before it destroyed any buildings.\u201d The fifth voice proclaimed. \u201cNow, I believe you should take care of the troops, call them from the catapults. They will be of little use now that you have his attention. Calm those who are panicked, tend to those injured by the destruction of the two catapults. He'll be here soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the voice faded, and an aura that no one noticed permeating the air went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third mage shook his head, like clearing away sleep. \u201cI suppose I should go see if there are any survivors from the catapults, or if they need help pulling people from the wreckage. I doubt that there are many though. Anyone who was caught beneath them is surely dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d The first one said, nodding. \u201cYou,\u201d They pointed at the second mage. \u201cGo with him to help. We'll stay here and prepare for whatever may come and try to slow the king down, and hopefully impress him with our magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the group split up, off to do their jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill,\u201d The third mage sighed. \u201cI can't help but thinks something's very wrong here.\u201d</span></div></div>",

His body was burnt, charred by the unstable energies of those four imbeciles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d He choked out. \u201cThat was worse then I thought. Barely managed to get it out of here in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, gritting whatever teeth he had left in pain, He looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, his body looked like it was in better shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area around him, where he had taken the brunt of the magical attack, was reduced to... something. It was more then the nothingness of the void, but only just. It seemed to be pure primordial energy, twisting and convulsing and screaming and crying and living and dying and doing neither at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I'm going to be sick.\u201d He muttered, coughing again. \u201cOkay, got it. Mixing of unstable energies that were never made to interact equals something that can't be said to exist or not. Fan-<i>fucking</i>-tastic. Now I've got clean this up and figure out what to do with the abomination against life, non-life and oblivion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perseus! You're alive!' Eres yelled in his head, making it hurt worse than having it split into eight parts by an ax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No need to shout.' He told her. 'How long was I gone?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Three hours.' The ghost said. 'What happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't want to talk about it. It'd be too difficult to explain anyway.' Percy dropped to one knee, his hand almost falling in the anathema to both non-existence and all creation. 'Just know that I hurt, and I feel like I'm going to be sick. Hell, this feels worse then the time I suffered from an overabundance of godly energy in a weak body and nearly exploded.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to stand back up, Percy shook his head. 'Is the entire area clear?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. Once the magics started to combine, I called all the minions back. Morticia was against it, but before she could do anything, both you and the resulting energy were gone. Did something happen there? Do you need any assistance?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't send anyone here. There's... something here. I don't like it, and I don't want anyone to touch it. It seems like some type of energy, but it's like a liquid and a solid at the same time, and it's doing some things that energy can't do. I can't say that it's alive, or even if it exists. In fact, looking at it is making me feel worse...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can you make it back alright? You sound horrible.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah... Yeah, I think so. I just gotta find out what happened to those four idiots first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy got the image of Eres frowning, shaking her head in exasperation. 'Fine. Just don't do anything stupid, alright?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEres cut off the link, sighing with both irritation and relief. \u201cHe's safe, at least. I really shouldn't have expected anything else, but even still...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>Of course you shouldn't have</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, book. These last few hours have put me in a foul mood.\u201d The apparition growled out as the ancient book lay on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book merely chuckled, though it had no real warmth. <b>'The marked one is too powerful to die. Even if he could be killed so easily, he'd be too stubborn to stay dead. He'd fight his way back from the void if he had to</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would you have done if he hadn't survived?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'That doesn't matter in the slightest now, so I see no point in bringing it up</b>.' The Eronomicon replied. <b>'Besides, both of us would have known something was wrong, even if you couldn't contact him for the past few hours</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I wish I never found you, you aggravating pile of parchment.\u201d She bit out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'And you should not have tried your luck when you did</b>.' It countered. <b>'But I will not bother bringing up `what if's` with you. For a being such as myself or the Marked one, things like that have little consequence.</b>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't have time to deal with you right now, you tattered old tome. Perseus will likely want reports about everything. Damage to the country side, the stability of the universe, the pathways... not to mention the amount of prisoners we have collected, any loss or addition of minions...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd his daughter.\u201d A third voice said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-\u201d Eres turned around to see who had entered the master bedroom, her eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy slowly made his way away from ground zero, taking small steps in the air over the primordial whatever it was. It wasn't exactly energy, but it wasn't some kind of slime or ooze or what have you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Percy did not want to touch it, at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, he didn't even want to look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, the stuff seemed like it would reach out for him, almost seeming alive, but in a way that not even he felt he could describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, alas, he had to stomach looking at it even as his stomach churned at the sheer wrongness of the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had seen the very essence, or lack thereof, of nothing itself! He had traveled it, fought it, and carved out this universe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this? This strange result of magical energies mixing together when they had not been created with the chance that they might ever come into contact in the infinite possibilities of the multiverse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there were really no words for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm beginning to think that those four didn't survive.\u201d Percy muttered. \u201cDamned shame. I was hoping that whatever happened to them would at least leave remains so I could show people what happens when you don't think the important things, like mixing unstable energies, through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Gu</i>aa<b>hg</b><b><i>h...\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell?\u201d Percy asked, hearing the pitiful cry. It was distorted, and it sounded like several people were making the same noise together in some mangled fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the cries, He found himself at the edge of the affected area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tree that was unstable, likely having been partially uprooted by whatever shock wave occurred in the magical explosion, fell over and landed in the primordial energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the branches touched the stuff, the sound of a high-pitched whine filled the air, accompanied by a... a sizzling sound, he guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe branches seemed to become distorted, warping and dying before they seemed to just fall apart, disintegrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally don't want to touch that stuff now.\u201d Percy muttered. \u201cAnd I have to get it out of this universe. I'm sure I could find a dead one to place it in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, a thought coming to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy isn't it going through the earth?\u201d</span></div></div>",

And right now, I feel like crap. I doubt I could make it to the city on my own power. Anyway, what's the problem over there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'It seems that the reason behind all this is because of a demon</b>.' The tome explained. <b>'Given it's form, I would have to say it is a demon of stupidity, rash actions and stubbornness.</b>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've got to be kidding.\u201d Percy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>Unfortunately not.

Look, I want you to see if you can find whatever is making that sound and bring it to me if possible. If its not safe to touch, just leave it and come back to me. Don't touch the stuff that's eating away the world either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'As you wish, Marked One</b>.' It said, floating out of his hand. <b>'Do you wish for me to give a little bit of my energy to you? I have a surplus, though not much</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that'd be nice. Anything you can spare without losing your own power would work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>Very well</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWisps of pink energy seeped from the tome, connecting to Percy. They throbbed, like the beating of a heart, for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could feel the pain lessening, his skin healing as he finally coughed out the last bit of the foreign particles in his lungs. His head felt better, and he could now focus on the things around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, still looking at the energy-like stuff beneath him, which was now starting to reach out into the air randomly, made him feel sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tendrils of energy fell back, merging with the tome once more. It didn't droop in its flight, showing that it followed Percy's order to the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Percy said. \u201cI think I can make it back to the city now, and deal with whatever problems are waiting for me. You have ten minutes.

He was just on the outskirts of the city, and not instantly in the tower like he wished to be. Like he could have easily done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few more  steps, he was at the base of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what he saw nearly drove him blind with rage.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't dwell on those thoughts though. Not if he wanted to keep his wits about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the tower, Percy was completely silent.

It tried to make him barge in, losing what little self-preservation he had being immortal. And that self-preservation was reserved for dealing with the void and other things that could kill gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling filled the air as Percy pulsed his power, destroying the feeling before it had a chance to latch onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quickly back, however, pressing against his mind once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a testimony to the being behind the presence. Most others would have quailed in fear, reigning in their aura to avoid his wrath. Even if they couldn't, as some beings were burdened with, the aura itself would be hesitant to touch him, if they were not suppressed or outright destroyed by his power lashing out at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had learned about it over a year ago during one of his first encounters with demons. They were demons whose very presence compelled those with weak wills to be influenced by the demons sphere of control. Lust, gluttony, envy, pride, and yes, even something as outlandish as stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot very strange in the grand scheme of things, really; just look at beings like C'thulu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, don't. Not very good for the mind, unless you are someone who can comprehend things from a universally detached perspective when faced with horrors that most mortal minds can't comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on topic, that was the 'unbending will' he mentioned when talking to Clarisse. The power that kept him from falling victim to outside influences that tried to control him in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't exactly sure when he picked up the ability, but he wasn't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexing his power once more, Percy opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't throw it open, nor even open it quickly. His anger had gone full circle. Where he would normally be a walking bastion of fury, like he had a little over three hours ago, and be destroying everything in his rage, he was engulfed in a tranquil fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at the throne, seeing the demon.

Surprised to see someone sitting in your throne?\u201d The demon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was sitting on his throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, truly, it was a demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had the head of a pig, larger then it should have been and misshapen. It's body, twisted in a grotesque fashion that had ribs jutting out in many places while sunken in others, seemed to be rotted hide, and only now was he noticing the smell. Its left arm was bone, while the right arm was covered in some sludge like material, which dripped from the seven-clawed hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stood on the legs of a mule, one foot that of a human, the other befitting the animal the legs mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine or so beady eyes, all on that pig head, stared at him. They were dull colors, every single one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Creepy looking fuck.' Percy thought, walking slowly towards the throne. 'Won't matter in a minute though.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, come on.\u201d It whined. It's voice was high pitched and childish. \u201cSay something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon't matter to you in a little bit.\u201d Percy said stiffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.\u201d It taunted before it started laughing, squealing and snorting. \u201cDon't you want to know what happened? Why the people rebelled against you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I already know.\u201d Percy replied. \u201cBecause I'm so cruel, so unreasonable, thinking that I can have them leave their homes for a few weeks, leave the world that <b>I</b> created. Not to mention those four using this as an attempt to do something this incredibly stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, the beast just laughed harder, doubling over as its tongue flopped about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second mouth, situated on the back of its misshapen head, spoke up, a deeper voice coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love miscommunication, don't you?\u201d It asked. \u201cGets everyone confused, spreads rumors. Makes people jump to the wrong conclusion as the tales grow taller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I'm not in the mood for this. Something, Which I'm going to assume was you, slaughtered my minions just outside my tower. I've had to deal with an uprising, and I took a blast of magic that would have caused wide-scale destruction, to the face. Only to come back, find three hours of my life wasted, and some bullshit residue from the magic that shouldn't exist, at all, eating away at my world. So, you can imagine that I'm not the happiest person right now. Then, I come back to find some uppity demon trying to make some grand performance, implying that it's the whole reason behind this entire debacle. I'm absolutely furious right now, and it is only because that fury went full circle that I'm not tearing out whatever may pass for your throat, or throats. I just want this day to be over, and I have so much to do before I can call it a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, indulge me then. If you think I'll be so easy to kill, let me give my final speech. My last hurrah, if you will.\u201d It said, though no less condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand burst out of its chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Said a second Percy, yanking the demon upwards along with the back of his throne. \u201cI have no reason to do so, and You've caused me nothing but grief if you are the puppeteer behind these events. That just means that I have even less reason to do so, and I certainly don't want to hear you talk more. Your voices are annoying, and your laugh is grating on the ears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing his other hand up, the gauntlet growing longer, sharper claws, Percy drove his 'point' home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight through the malformed head of the demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his hand back out, driving it in again at the demon's shoulder, sending bone and ooze flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again, Percy pierced the demon, leaving holes in his body and chunks of what used to be its body on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without noticing, he could feel the demons power seeping into him. He didn't exactly know what that power was at the moment, but he didn't care. He just wanted it dead, and he had gotten just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was tired, his body was still sore, and he had so much to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it did ease the pain, if only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the carcass drop, Percy shook his arm free of the guts that clung there. The manifestation of his will that stood in the middle of the room disappeared, making his mind whole once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnowing my old self, I would likely have heard him out, wasting precious time that my world does not have right now.\u201d He muttered. \u201cI don't understand why people would do that, heroes or otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping over the ruins of his throne, Percy gently shook Eres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d He asked, a groan all he got for an answer. \u201cCome on, wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Eres lazily moaned out. \u201cWhas happin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDemon's gone, Eres.

Mixed with the aura it put out and the not so subtle hints it made, I just killed it. Which means that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy only had one word for the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tome, we have a problem.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>What is it, Marked one?

And I just killed it with my own two hands.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eronomicon was silent, thinking over any possibilities as to why this would be a problem. It came up with several, but there was one that was more likely to have been the reason its master was dubbing it as trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>The aura</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bingo.' Percy told it. 'Look, forget looking for whatever it was making that noise. I need you to go tell Rose that she needs to come to the tower and evacuate the city. I don't think Eres will be in the right mind to order the minions by herself. I certainly can't deal with it right now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>At once, Marked one</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, there was the unmistakable 'pop' of the traveling tome hopping into the void while their connection was still active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, I hate having multiple auras.' Percy thought, picking up Eres, who had once again fallen into an almost brain dead state again. 'One aura that I'm not used to was bad enough. It's twenty times worse when I get a new one now. Great. How is this going to work with the training trip?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd get to that when he could. Right now, he had to ensure that the world was vacated, not just of people, but of all things of even minor importance in the tower. Books written by the blue minions, Eres's memoirs from the tower heart, experiments that the blues were working on, the entire floor dedicated to housing poisons for the greens, Giblet's armory, the minion homes that were held far beneath the tower, the tower-heart itself, and most certainly Eres herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was certain he would be able to deal with the world-destroying energy with no problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he were in peak condition, not tired, hurt or suffering from a severe bout of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was to say... Not right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he didn't have to worry about Millicent. He knew Eres was not stupid enough to keep her here if the world was in danger. For him to be gone for three hours, with no way of communication, along with four idiots breaking the most important law he had, she would have had the girl through a pathway to her home universe in a heartbeat. Likely off to stay with her aunt for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the power of the boots, Percy traveled through the palace's halls till he made his way to the very center, where the tower-heart resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set Eres onto the large purple orb, which reflected her condition. Seeing her slowly sink into it, Percy sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'One thing down...'</span></div></div>",

Far enough that he hoped the effects of his newest ability wouldn't so much as make them stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose was giving orders to Eres, who was still slightly out of it. She, in turn, relayed them to the minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose had told him, through the Eronomicon since he didn't want to risk having the ghost girl fall prey to the new aura again, that the blues and greens were complaining about all of them felt like Eres did. Sluggish in the mind, second guessing themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of them even equated it to their time as imps, with their lesser brainpower and weaker bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, given that they were in the middle of a crisis, they didn't spend much time focusing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople were being ushered through gates, the minions trying their hardest to keep those with the same language together so as to avoid the chaos that would undoubtedly ensue if they were just tossed into different worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked back from his position in the air, looking over the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see it, the non-energy, slowly encroaching upon the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, he could feel the air slowly thin out as it was devoured, destroyed or whatever it was that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>Marked one</b>.'

Those he had taken the gases necessary to create them, compressing them into the pinpricks of light you could see in the night sky. And the day, in the sun's case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That</i> was how he created this world. He fought for the space to build, and then he took bits and pieces from everywhere else to do so. He had sculpted the landscape with brute force, using what miniscule amount of power over the earth he had from his father, which had grown while the Eronomicon had destroyed the limits of his human body and he had gained many powerful women, to do what strength alone could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, it was seeming like it was all for naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamned mages.\u201d He muttered. \u201cWish I could see whatever became of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving nothing better to do, Percy traveled through the air. He wanted to see how far this had spread already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding three yards away from the current edge of the devastation, Percy forced himself to watch as it slowly ate the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on the far side, in the middle of what was once a thick forest. A river ran without heed into the maw of oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held a thick branch in his hand, at least five feet in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath, wondering if he was really going to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed so. Yes, he was going to poke the world devouring abomination with a stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas his new aura getting to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Percy stepped forward, inching closer and closer to the edge of the energy until he could just touch it with his crude inspection tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing himself for, well, anything, Percy lowered the stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipping the first five inches in, Percy quickly pulled it out.</span></div></div>",

How may I serve you</b>?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to bring me one of the prisoners. Blindfolded, if you can.

It was a clean... cut would suffice, he guessed. Other then the sudden missing part, the stick looked largely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that this energy didn't leave any residue on things partially devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor did it effect the whole. Just whatever part had direct contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with his gauntlets, Percy was glad he didn't actually touch this stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess that's something else I can thank both the boots and my gauntlets for.' He thought. 'Quick and nimble fingers that can grab anything. If I hadn't been able to pull the four different magic energies apart without actually touching the result, something tells me I'd be missing a hand. Or worse.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, this stuff did seem like it could kill a god. If even he could barely stomach looking at it, it had to be some nasty stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>Marked one, I have brought you the prisoner as you requested</b>.' The Eronomicon spoke as it appeared. '<b>Mistress Rose also wanted me to tell you that she is not happy with this course of action</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the tome flipped open. Settling on a page, it started to glow before a person appeared out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were obviously terrified, seeing as they struggled to stand up and run, screeching through the gag. They couldn't see, and ran into a tree for their efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling on their ass, the sacrifice whimpered, trying to curl in a ball and seem as small as possible as they cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost filled Percy with a sense of pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he had to test some things, and pity was not something he could afford himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to grasp the man, and it was definitely a man because of Percy's nature and his way of running things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop your whimpering.\u201d Percy said coldly, hoisting the man up by the collar of his shirt. \u201cYou brought this upon yourself, traitor. Joining that rebellion was almost guaranteed suicide, and you're lucky I don't kill you with my bare hands right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning him to face away from the non-energy, Percy tore the blindfold off the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, when we turn around, there is going to be something that will break you. It will invade your mind, and destroy every concept your mortal brain can ever think of, and even the ones you didn't know you could imagine. There will be nothing left of you, and you will become a husk of your former self, a shell of a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the man was not thrilled about the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, Percy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you think that's your punishment, you would be wrong. No, you're my little guinea pig for an... experiment, if you will. It will almost assuredly end with the cessation of your very existence. And no, I'm not sorry about that in the slightest. I'm going to dip you in that, like Thetis with Achilles in the river Styx.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wouldn't get the reference, but it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, I doubt you'll become nigh invulnerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, pleading for his life and sanity with his mouth gagged, the man was turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched the things that could happen to a mortal upon seeing that which was not meant for their eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body started convulsing, in ways that the body should not have been able to convulse. His ragged cries grew louder, wilder as they tore his throat to shreds, blood staining the cloth in his mouth. His eyes rolled in his head before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>pop</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes quickly swelled until they burst, his screams growing louder still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin turned ashen gray, but incredibly hot to the touch, and even his fingers bent completely backwards of their own accord, snapping bone that cut through the skin. He voided his bowels, then and there as he continued to thrash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy dropped the man, stepping back to watch him thrash about for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ended soon after, though what was once a man still had minute spasms here and there. Its breathing was ragged, and it was very likely that its vocal cords were destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said, picking up the mindless shell of the man. \u201cThat's some nasty stuff. Couldn't be so weak as to cause instant death, after all. But not powerful enough to ret-con his existence just by having him look at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back over to the edge, feeling the air tug slightly as it was consumed by the primordial force, Percy held the husk by its midsection above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly lowering him, Percy dipped his test subject's feet into the primordial energies.</span></div></div>",

It was almost night, with the chariot of Apollo slowly sinking below the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his business done, Percy traveled through the air to his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure this is a big enough place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>Yes. The device isn't very big at all, despite its power and function. Besides, the tecnomancer took it as a self challenge to fit a spacial compressor into the design without losing functionality. So, technically, it's far larger then it looks</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked around the room where they would set this whole thing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room of Sally's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, let's get it set up then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash of light, which was barely kept hidden by the double layer of blackout curtains, Percy called out the two items the entire plan was based around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first item was fairly small, and easily able to be considered a hand held device like a gameboy, or whatever it was that he had seen other kids at his various schools messing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, if not for the shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shaped oddly, not being square or rectangular. It was more of a pyramid shape, but it was slightly taller then it was wider. There were strange carvings, runes carved into it that were filled with a seemingly infinite amount small wires, connecting everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was a small box, looking like it would be a close fit if it were placed in the pyramid shaped object. It was an incredibly cold metal, seeing as the carpet started frosting over the second it landed, and judging by the loud 'thunk' as it hit the floor, quite heavy as well. It also had the strange markings, but it was a continuous design. If he were to trace it, his finger would cover every nanometer of the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Percy went to poke the first item...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so how does this work exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>Give me a moment. It's been so long since I collected this object, and I have not attempted to test this</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book floated over to the first object, letting power seep out and reach for the pyramid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantaneously, the runes buzzed to life, the noise filling the room with a low droning sound. The tiny wires detached one end from the miniature structure, seemingly feeding off the energy as they twisted through the air towards the ancient tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first one pierced the cover, the tome only had one thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<b>I'm glad I don't feel pain</b>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, more wires struck, pulling the Eronomicon down as each individual wire started to glow, the droning growing louder as the pyramid grew brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, normally the sight of this would have made anybody fear for the destruction of the book. Heck, even Percy would have been worried if he hadn't seen it survive much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eronomicon ended up pulled beneath the pyramid, which lifted itself up by the wires to sit atop the book. Both light, which now included the runes, and sound seemed to reach their climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore it all went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><i><b>Please choose either home console or hand-held console</b></i></u>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><i><b>Acknowledged. Please insert game core</b></i></u>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I do that, tell me if the Eronomicon will be fine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><i><b>Please insert game core</b></i></u>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cFine. I guess you won't say anything until I do that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><i><b>Please insert game core, or say \u201ccancel\u201d to end process</b>.</i></u>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He said, picking up the cube, the frost on the carpet now half-inch thick ice and the air around it filled with cold mist. \u201cHere you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe offered it up to the device, pulling back his hand when the army of wires grabbed at it like a drowning man for a life preserver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the cube above it's point, the pyramid let out a soft hiss, like air being released from a canister, before it opened its upper half. The four faces folded outwards to ninety degree angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wires, wrapped tightly around the cube, retreated into the new opening, which snapped shut before Percy could look into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><i><b>Game core accepted. Running scan... Checking power levels... Downloading extra content... Please wait five minutes</b></i></u>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, sitting down on the couch. 'Extra content? Wonder what that means.' He said, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could do with a small nap. He had barely slept a wink since the whole world devouring energy problem started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he didn't need much sleep anymore, it was still nice to be able to do so.</span></div></div>",

The son of Poseidon</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy's eyes opened slowly upon hearing the voice. Not like the owner could possibly hurt him, could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the words finally clicked, Percy said one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a bad joke, and you should feel bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling above him, which looked like his mother's apartment, wavered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I've heard tale that you're more than what you should be</i>.\u201d The voice said, keeping calm. \u201c<i>I can see that they're right</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Percy said, yawning as he sat up. Scratching an ear, he looked around. \u201cSo, which immortal figure am I talking to? I've had a very rough week, and I'd like a little shut-eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Shut-eye</i>?\u201d The voice chuckled, seemingly amused at the notion. \u201c<i>Dear boy, you have no need for sleep. You are currently in my realm, under the thrall of my father. While with other gods you may get the vague image or two, I can do so much more</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded slowly. Not from caution, just from the mental fatigue that came with sleep-deprivation. \u201cYeah, okay. So... Morpheus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice chuckled again, though this came from right beside Percy. He was unsurprised to see the god sitting on the couch next to him, looking at him intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d The god said, his mouth turned up in a small smile. \u201cSo many people confuse me with my father, it gets a little annoying. It's been a while since anyone recognized my domain as my own. For that small acknowledgment, I will avoid all the usual hoops I make people jump through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then. So, what is it you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo reasons. First, because you interest me. Second, because it seems that you will be the deciding factor in this war, a greater piece of this game then previously thought. And trust me when I say that one like you, a child of the big three, was already deeming important enough to issue a kill-on-sight order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Percy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The god said, clearing his throat. \u201cAnd, seeing as I've also heard you have little love for the Olympians, I am certainly interested in seeing where exactly your loyalties lies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, if you've come to try and recruit me into Kronos's army, it's pointless. I won't be joining my grandfather.\u201d Percy told the god of dreams. Having never actually met the god, Percy had no reason to be hostile towards him. Of course, that meant he had no inclination to be all buddy-buddy with him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe god sighed softly, looking away. \u201cI figured you wouldn't if what the son of Hermes was saying was true. I must say though, claiming that the titan of time has his days numbered...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be stupid?\u201d Percy asked, noticing Morpheus trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither that, or very powerful. I hope I haven't offended you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook his head. \u201cNah, it's fine. I can see why the gods would think that. After all, I'm just some upstart that was born of a broken promise. Someone who, by all rights, shouldn't exist. At least you're polite enough to not make me do something nasty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiven how calm you seem about this, I must ask. Were you expecting me?\u201d The dream weaver asked, narrowing his eyes slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExpecting you? No, not in the slightest.\u201d Percy told him. \u201cIn fact, I'm surprised that you even found me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why, pray tell, would that be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal I worked out with the Fates.\u201d Percy said, shrugging. \u201cAnd you don't need to know anymore then that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorpheus let his eyes linger on Percy for a moment longer, trying to see if there was anything off, anything that would make him slip up and talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorpheus gave a tired sigh, finding nothing. Such things were not his specialty, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, I suppose. It really is none of my business.\u201d He said. \u201cThough I must say I find it hard to believe that you have set up a deal with the The Three Sisters. But, as you said, it is none of my business. However...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorpheus turned to look at Percy, a veil of... something akin to darkness fading onto his shoulder. His eyes, which previously seemed to be consumed by the need for sleep, shone brightly. The world around them twisted away, slipping away beneath the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter how interesting you may be; no matter how important you are to this prophecy... I cannot allow you to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy just looked at him, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you commit to that action, I want you to know some things. One, I'm allied with Hades. If I were to, somehow, end up dead, whoever did it would soon have the entire kingdom of the dead after them. Secondly, I have my own loyal army, both living and dead, who would seek retribution against my killers. Third, and the most important I would think...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy lashed out, grabbing Morpheus's face. For good measure, he dug the newly formed claws of the Alpha's Armlets into the god's skull, drawing Ichor from his now mirage-like body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that I can kill you, end your very existence, quite easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled Morpheus close to him, looking him in the eyes without blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right. I can kill gods. Because, in the grand scheme of things, I am beyond you. I've gone places that you could not begin to understand the dreams of those who dwell there. I could easily kill any being in this universe, be they Zeus, Kronos, Typhon... Anybody. I've already killed one god in this universe, though he was only a minor river god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly tightening his grip, digging further and further into Morpheus's skull, slowly letting the power of the gauntlets flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might have absolute control in the world of dreams, but my power is above your own. You cannot control me, nor can you kill me. My loyalties lie with myself, and I will not have some weak <i>peasant</i>,\u201d He spat out, making the Sandman blink as some landed in his eyes as his own gained a green luminescence. \u201cOf a god trying to cow me into submission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his claws out, taking some flesh and Ichor with them, Percy pushed Morpheus away from him, off the couch. The god landed in an undignified heap, clutching at his bleeding temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropping his feet up on the god, showing him place, Percy slowly pulled back his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I don't normally do this.\u201d He said, the light of his eyes dimming to more mundane levels. \u201cBut, since I'm in a decent enough mood, I'll let you live. You can run back to Kronos if you want, tell him and his little lapdog Luke what you've heard if you want. It would make this entire war so much more interesting if they double their efforts, futile though they my be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and by the way,\u201d Percy said after a slight pause. \u201cFor a god who doesn't fight, you have impressive pain tolerance if you didn't scream as I started crushing your skull. Good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Percy woke himself up with a quick, painful pinch.</span></div></div>",

He had a cloak, not unlike one would wear in the event of a storm fastened around his shoulders, the hood pulled down. He was also wearing some kind of cloth around his neck, like a mask for keeping sand or ash from filling his mouth. His shoes were worn, though they were well maintained by the look of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color scheme of his clothes, if it could be called a color scheme at all, was what would have tipped anyone off that this man was anything but normal. They were made from all manner of elements, splattered here and there without any rhyme or reason. Brightest light, deepest shadow, all the hues of a painted desert, a pattern of greenery that wouldn't look out of place in a forest, the grays of stones in the mountains, several different materials for everyday clothing and even the decaying flesh that one would find at the scene of a massacre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was even more interesting was the fact that they all mixed together, changing and mutating to even more variations, twisting around one another in a way that <i>should</i> have been seamlessly if not for the fact that none of them mixed well with one another, but made so much <i>sense</i> at the same time! It was a paradoxical clash of being both right and wrong, both in terms of aesthetics and, very likely, practicality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man himself was old, no two ways about it. His face was worn, weathered by years of travel in harsh climates. His face was clean shaven, with unruly gray hair atop his head that looked matted and unwashed. His body was thin, and it was likely that if he was human, it was about the age when he would have to settle down, no longer able to bear the burden of long journeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, if one did not take into account his clothing, he would look unassuming. Just a wandering old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an odd gleam in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not unlike the Stoll brothers when they had their little prank wars on the camp during his second summer at camp. They had no thoughts of abiding the rules, casting aside what little restraint they were forced to uphold, no thoughts of letting anyone tell them 'no' without having them face a consequence for keeping their divine blood from satiating itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that gleam in his eye, along with a quick look at his, now, bare feet that told him all he needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat old man was the spirit of his boots, the boots that the Eronomicon had found stranded in the void, the boots that had shown him exactly what happens to those who tackle the nothingness unprepared or arrogant of their own power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was, despite the oddity of the other man's clothing, the decidedly more strange of the two. Instead of a hulking behemoth of a man that towered over the likes of Typhon in both stature and presence, like Percy would have expected from the soul of the gauntlets, he was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The average looking human spirit asked, arms folded as he looked at Percy. \u201cNot what you were expecting, am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, lighten up a bit.\u201d The eldest looking of the three said. \u201cIt wouldn't be all that surprising for those who know what you grant your wearer to think you'd be a little more, I don't know... Intimidating? Although, I'd still say he's at fault for not using those fancy glasses of his to see how we were doing and having a nice chat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave Percy a look of disapproval at this, shaking his head ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll say,\u201d The most average of the three commented briskly, turning to look away from Percy like a scolded child. \u201cEven having worn us for almost two years now. You hear that!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turned around, marching up to Percy and sticking his finger, which Percy could see now had a small metal band on the middle finger, right in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo damned years you've worn us, using our powers! And what do we get? Fucking <i>nothing</i>!\u201d He yelled into Percy's face before he turned his back on the black-haired Being. \u201cNo thanks, no appreciation... Not even a damned proper washing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I wouldn't say we got nothing, per say.\u201d The old man said, gaining a slightly cocky grin. \u201cAfter all, I always did enjoy a free show when I could get one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck your 'free shows' you old bastard!\u201d The youngest looking of the trio said, flipping the eldest off. \u201cI'd rather get some then sit back and watch, stroking my dick as I try to get off to some piss poor fuck that can't even please a woman without a magic book messing with their minds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, aren't you just a vulgar one?\u201d The old man scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill the both of you just shut up for one second!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two souls whipped their head, looking at Percy, while he held up his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn't me, I swear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d The voice spat, coming from... beneath them. \u201cA pitiful little mongrel like you doesn't even have the backbone to tell your own spawn she's yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of three looked down, in a sense, as they tilted their soul manifestations to face where their feet had just been pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Percy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept... this one had an aura of pure malice and hatred, his eyes illuminating the dark with a green so foul it could give someone the plague as they withered under his stare. The darkness around him seemed to caress him, like the embrace of a lover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr a mind-raped worshiper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was set in a sneer, staring between them as if unsure of who disgusted him the most with their presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Percy said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cI'm guessing you're the part of me that takes after the role of the Overlord the most, aren't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, figure that out all by yourself did you?\u201d His other self asked, mocking him with a high pitched voice. He promptly spit at the original Percy, wiping his mouth in disgust. \u201cOf course I am, you sniveling pile of filth. I refuse to be deemed as any other part of your damned psyche, and I hate not being the one in control of the body we inhabit. If I were in control, we would not be playing these games with those weaklings you call gods, and that rebellion would have been stopped before it even began. All opposition to my rule would have been crushed, and any survivors would have been subjugated to the worst tortures imaginable before being either executed, or having their very souls bound to my will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, spare the details.\u201d The soul of the gauntlets said, dismissing the Overlord persona and his tirade. \u201cYou're so great and powerful, bask in the greatness that he wouldn't have if not for me and the old goat doing most of the work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would suggest you still your tongue,\u201d The Overlord said, narrowing his eyes so that the light was barely visible. \u201cBefore I cut it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d The soul of the gauntlets asked, turning to face the darker side of Percy. \u201cBring it, you fucker!\u201d</span></div></div>",

The thing about this one is that it produced an aura of self loathing and depression. His skin was pale, and his entire body was hunched over like he couldn't make the effort to stand up straight. His black hair was filled with grease, and the rest of him was just as filthy, giving the image that he just didn't care anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clutched at a robe that was thrown over him, pictures of past events cluttering the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many more mistakes can we make, I wonder...\u201d He said, looking at them with eyes unseeing. \u201cBefore we realize our folly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there's the guilt, worry and depression.\u201d Percy sighed, rubbing a hand down his face in exasperation. \u201cJust what I needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thousand-yard stare that the depressed Percy had vanished, his head turning at a frightening angle to stare directly at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes... I <i>am</i> what you need.\u201d It said, standing up straighter now, his voice rasping over single syllable like sandpaper over a chalkboard. \u201cI am the one who tells you your misdeeds, the things you regret!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no regrets!\u201d The Overlord roared, slamming his fist into the stomach of his opponent. \u201cI have no need for such a concept!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe depressed Percy glared at the Overlord, his wish that he didn't exist clear in his eyes. That soon faded with a sigh, as he hunched over again, his eyes emptying of recognition once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed again, rubbing a hand over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're not all there in the head, are you?\u201d The soul of the boots asked, walking to stand beside the original Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had my suspicions...\u201d Percy said. \u201cEver since that night with Clarisse...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy doing, thank you very much!\u201d The Overlord exclaimed, seemingly happy to revel in that achievement before he took a right hook to the face, sending him sprawling as the darkness surged to cover the spot, which would almost certainly sport a bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan a soul, or manifestation of the psyche in this case, bruise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet another failing on our part, a failure to keep ourselves in line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Percy yelled at his depressing counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old soul chuckled, putting his hand on Percy's shoulder. \u201cIt seems most gods have some kind of problem, so don't worry too much. My original owner had problems traveling by himself, despite his sphere of control. Always walked with at least two other people, but he liked caravans the most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy gave a small laugh, though it didn't last long. \u201cSo, am I really such a bad, er, owner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could be worse.\u201d The old soul said, shrugging. \u201cBut, ever since my creator went and pushed his luck, you're the first person to use me. And an artifact like me is meant to be used, so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave Percy a not-so-lighthearted glare. \u201cBut really, you need to learn to enjoy the journey more often. Jumping from place to place without knowing what's in between, or stopping to smell the roses, is very limiting.\u201d He lectured briefly. \u201cBut, then again, you're the one who tells me what to do. I just do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso,\u201d He said after a pause. \u201cYou need to learn how to use my powers for more then just traveling. I know you know about my other abilities, or at least some of them, since you've stole the pants off women without actually taking them off. You know, I remember hearing about a thief that could steal anything that wasn't nailed down and on fire, and had actually stolen more treasure than actually existed in his world. I think there was something about stealing from himself in the future, but I don't quite know all the details. If you're going to one-up my dead creator, you'll start needing to do stuff that makes that seem like child's play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what did he,\u201d Percy asked, pointing a finger over at the most normal looking of the group as he and the Overlord were grappling, trying to throw the other to the ground to strangle them. \u201cMean by cleaning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit of a washing would be nice now and then, maybe a nice treatment of oil if I'm formed into leather or any type of metal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the free shows?\u201d Percy asked, giving a knowing smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't go calling the kettle black now, you hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won't, I won't.\u201d Percy said, placating him. \u201cSo, is there anything I should know about the soul of the gauntlets?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know about as much as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking die!\u201d The soul of the gauntlets yelled, picking up the Overlord Percy by the throat effortlessly and throwing him across the black expanse. The darkness desperately clung to the Overlord, trying to impede his flight and catch him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, that still doesn't exactly explain why they, or you, are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>'WARNING! WARNING! MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF PLAYER ONE (1) DETECTED!'</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, save the Overlord who was fading into the distance now, looked up to see the message that glared above them with flashing lights in more colors than the human eye could comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems there might be a little screw up in this device that's caused us to be here.\u201d The old man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing.\u201d Percy muttered, rolling his eyes at how this was turning out. \u201cSo, how do we work this out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>'THERE MAY BE SEVERAL SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TROUBLESHOOT, OR END PROCESS AND EXIT THE GAME?'</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish this thing came with an owner's manual.\u201d Percy grumbled, before looking up at the message. \u201cTroubleshoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words 'troubleshoot' flashed in front of the warning sign, prompting both to disappear. In their place, several two-dimensional boxes appeared, the information on them flashing by as it searched for all the solutions it had available to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more boxes appeared, each with a different course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's see... Merge all souls into one for the duration of the game?\u201d The old man read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no! I won't be sharing a body with any of you!\u201d The gauntlets' personification cried out, not looking winded from his fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't like the sound of that either.\u201d The old man said, shaking his head. \u201cWhat say you, Perseus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not to keen on the idea of merging with anyone other than what was originally part of me. So, that's a no. The next one reads... separate all souls for the duration of the game, deciding among the group which one will be the actual first player, designating the others as player one point two and so on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, does that mean I'll have an actual body?\u201d The foul-mouthed soul asked. \u201cIf so, then I'm all for it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't like the idea of my other selves running around freely though. Given that the part of me that you just fought will likely be evil down to the very core... well, best not to think on what he would do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you admit you're really evil deep down?\u201d His guilt asked, narrowing his bloodshot eyes at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, will you just go away?\u201d Percy barked angrily. \u201cI don't need you to constantly hang every little thing I do wrong over my head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will never leave.\u201d His guilt whispered, narrowing his eyes even further till they looked closed. He gave a pained breath before moving to look like he was sitting down in the blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy could feel his eyes watching him constantly, looking for any sign of weakness to exploit, but payed him no mind. As long as he didn't let him get to him, he'd be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErase all so- nope. Definitely not an option.\u201d The spirit of the boots said, pushing the box away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we just pick one already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe quiet. We're trying to work this contraption out. Why don't you look through these to find a suitable option?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gauntlets' spirit grumbled, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn't there a way this thing can create a solution that would fit our needs?\u201d Percy asked, mostly to himself. \u201cI mean, if it can do so much, why not?\u201d</span></div></div>",

To! LIIIIIFEEEE!\u201d</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaid before Percy's eyes was an incredible sight. Trillions upon trillions of what looked like stars, with incredibly large clusters dotted here and there. Some were flickering dimly, while others outshone those close to them. There were lines, both faint and bold, drawn between some with no organization, making it hard to follow one with eyes alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i><u><b>This simulation allows you to take a break from reality or spice it up!

It came from everywhere around him, slamming against his ear drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noted it sounded vaguely like the Eronomicon, but with more robotic droning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i><b>And now, a word from the creator...\u201d</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother box popped up, showing a video feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old... no, old didn't begin to cover his age. An absolutely <u><i>ancient</i></u> man appeared in the video, lying in a bed. He had a multitude of machines attached to the metal frame of his bed and his body, monitoring a great number things. His heartbeat, his breathing, brain activity, blood flow and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i>Hello, who I am to assume is the Harem god.

You have no idea how happy that makes this old man</i></u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice, despite his appearance, was strong. Was it really his voice though? Percy doubted it. This man could barely breath, let alone speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i>However, that also means that I am long dead, and likely something far, far worse than the clutch of the Reaper. In fact, I would much prefer death's cold embrace... If it existed within my world. A god, I mean. One who governed anything in a way only a god could. Unfortunately, the truth of the matter, that no gods exist that watched over my world is the sole reason that I have, by the time you've watched this, ceased to exist</i></u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the machines shuddered, seeming to phase out for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i>No... It is a certainty that I have been consumed by the void. There is not much time left for this universe, and my creation has damned it to die a final death</i></u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ancient fell silent, the world phasing once more. A machine vanished, not returning once the phenomenon had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i>Already, it begins.\u201d </i></u>He mused sadly. \u201c<i><u>Though, should this survive, I wish to explain the reason for this mess.

And I would like you to believe me when I say it will be my life's story. A way to prove that once, T'quaro Fstaurla existed. As a side note, this message will play in each of the games upon the first start up</u></i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the world phased. This time, part of the background vanished, leaving Percy with the image of the void swallowing the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i>I cannot stay much longer. Is that everything</i></u>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the Eronomicon. How it had a physical voice, he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i>I have one last thing to say to the Harem god, and then you can leave.

I take it from your question, as well as the lack of data on the shared data space of the console, that this is the first time you've logged in</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy said, nodding. \u201cSo, are you here to help me or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>With the start up and initial questions, yes. After that, most of my time will be devoted to making sure everything is running as it should. Tutorial programs will be available to you afterwords, should you choose to accept their help</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be nice. I really don't know technology all that well. Going to universes that are still stuck in the dark ages or working with those that cannot handle anything more advanced than steam power can really distance a person from technology as a whole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Very well. I shall try to provide all the answers I can. Ask away</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Percy said, nodding once again as he pondered his first question. \u201cSo... I didn't see Rose or Millicent back there, before I came here. And,\u201d He looked around the vast expanse. \u201cI'm not seeing them around here anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Millicent and Rose?</u>\u201d The machine asked, confusion etched on its features for the smallest fraction of a second. \u201c<u>Oh, you must be referring to players two and three. They, along with players one point two and one point three are in a type of stasis at the moment. None of them are aware of time passing, nor will they be until the start of the gaming session. It was programmed this way to prevent fights from breaking out over decisions of game configuration</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that back there, with the other souls-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>An error debug room. Your real body is touching items that have sufficiently advanced souls, as well as repressed facets of your own soul. That would explain the multiples of you. I am also to tell you that they have not been permanently repressed for the duration of the game, and they may be able to give themselves an avatar.\u201d The A.I. said, as blas\u00e9 as one could get</u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Percy grumbled. \u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Do not thank me. It is merely protocol</u>.\u201d It said. \u201c<u>Now, any more questions</u>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot off the top of my head, no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Very well. Then let us begin the start up tutorial</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, it was a long, but fast process of the main A.I. giving Percy the gist of how things went. It even went so far as to load up a few worlds to show him what different icons on start up would mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interface of the game could be used like a touch screen, or with vocal commands. It didn't matter which language he spoke them in, seeing as how the book had given the knowledge about languages to it during the time he contained it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could also be activated with pure intent, willing the game to do the work. But, in order to do that, one had to either communicate solely with intent, or the player had to have an incredibly offensive, controlling will that could fight against legions of the best of the best the multiverse had to offer in terms of battles of wills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many configuration options and settings just for world creation it took up what seemed like three hours just to explain a quarter of it all. With all the customization available, he could decide on things up to a universal scale, such as the number of galaxies, the size of the galaxies, the number of stars, star systems and actual planets. Comets, shooting stars, constellations that he could create from scratch, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on further down, from the number of planets that had life on them, how intelligent the life was, how fast the life would progress, Etc. down to the smallest details of how the atoms worked, and even further then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the options, he could give sentience to a rock! Not a rock monster, or a god of earth either. But just a simple, ordinary rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was wondering what a rock would think of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven supernatural elements were customizable. From microbiological virus of supernatural origins to cosmos eating horrors that could turn you inside out without even knowing you were there. Pantheons of preset deities existed, with the ability to mix and match. Or, if he wanted, he could create an entirely new pantheon of gods that he created, customizing everything from what they held dominion over to their personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, he could even control whether or not they had free will or souls! They, of course, being anything created for the game session, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the conversation he had with the Eronomicon and how he could, in theory, make his power infinite using this item... It seemed like there was nothing to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>And that concludes the start up tutorial. If you need the message repeated, you can find individual tutorials that can help you in a briefer manner</u>.\u201d The A.I. Said, the two of them back at the main menu with the twinkling expanse of worlds. \u201c<u>Once we are finished here, I will doing my job of making sure everything is running at optimum capacity with no errors. Unless there is something horribly wrong, you won't see me until you finish your first game session. Before I go, are there any more questions</u>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just one.\u201d Percy said. \u201cNow, when I was outside and the console was, uh, 'plugging' into the Eronomicon, it said that it was downloading additional content. What, exactly, does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>It means that the console has created copies of the items for use inside the games. And, unless something is added or changed inside the Eronomicon, it will be a one time thing</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense, I suppose. Thanks for all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>As I said earlier, don't thank me. It's the procedure I was programmed to follow, no matter what. Even if I somehow went rouge, I would have to do this</u>.\u201d It said, eyes half-lidded. \u201c<u>The creator was very thorough in all his endeavors, as you'll see from his video logs. And now, I bid you farewell</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the form of the A.I. Sort of blinked out, like how one would see in cartoons when electronic screens were turned off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad the little noise and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the main menu, with the backdrop of stars that represented the worlds, he hit the option for a new game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let's get started.\u201d He said, looking for anything that he thought would work.</span></div></div>",

In the field of stars, he idly noticed a few disappearing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic is a must for part of the training.\u201d Once again, portions of the list and the connecting stars vanishing from the list of choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went like that for a while. Percy thought over the specifics of what he wanted for training, what would be necessary. The list grew shorter and shorter, from the impossibly high numbers that had no names as of yet, down to a small several hundred thousand for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCountries to conquer. At least one pantheon of deities. An ongoing war is optional. Monsters of all kinds. The threat of danger would be a good motivator and challenge for her, so there has to be some legitimate threat. Other supernatural elements are necessary as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what would likely have been hours upon hours, he listed both the specific needs and the vague wants and optional things that would enhance the experience. From the several hundred thousand that he had after weeding out the candidates that didn't fit in with his plans, he had finally whittled it down to just six worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of these seem like good candidates, really.\u201d He said, looking over the small list. Compared to what it was, it was smaller than an atom. The vast expanse of blackness, which had once been full of stars and lights, was now empty. Just those six worlds to break the unending black space. \u201cIt's so hard to choose between them as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Having a hard time? Perhaps a crossover would suit your needs</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother being blinked into existence in front of Percy, as nondescript as the last A.I., but still different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou the world selection and creation tutorial?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Of course. Who else would I be</u>?\u201d It said, looking at the tiny little lights. <u>\u201cAs I said, it seems like you're having trouble deciding what world to use, despite having sorted through so many</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured these worlds are the best for my current needs. And they all have something that sets them apart from the other five in this particular group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>I see</u>.\u201d The A.I. Said, moving close to the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were floating in a circle now, orbiting an invisible sun. The A.I. looked over each one, analyzing the details of each world without having to look at the screen Percy was using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Well, if you were to combine all six, that would solve your problem</u>.\u201d It told him. \u201c<u>Of course, there would be conflicts in world settings that would have to be worked out, but that's not so hard. But</u>,\u201d It paused, picking up one of the stars as it passed. \u201c<u>This world here is a nexus world. It connects to other worlds, whether you want it to or not. You see these little threads leading away from it</u>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering closer, Percy did see them. They were tiny, fading away millimeters from the light of the star, which made it hard to see with a casual glance. There were hundreds of them, all fading into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>These threads mean that worlds are connected. One or two, and it's likely just a few small things that connect them. But, once those threads reach at least fifty, it becomes a nexus world. That allows travel between worlds that are connected with absolute ease, when you find the right gateway. Even worlds that aren't selected for a crossover. If you have a cross over between these six worlds, those gateways will still be accessible. And, seeing how many threads this world has, you're likely to stumble upon one every other week for at least one years, even if you stay in a hundred square miles of where you start. You're also more likely to have settings from other worlds lapse into existence for a time, though it's very unlikely they'll be in effect for more than a few weeks</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not even going to pretend I fully understand what you're saying, but alright. I'd like to have a crossover with these six worlds, if you don't mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Well, you're the player</u>.\u201d The A.I. said, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe A.I. wove its hand over the seven worlds, causing a second set to appear next to it. Gathering the second set into its other hand, it squeezed the balls of light into one single orb, six times the size of one star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>There you are. One crossover world, to use at your leisure. Now, all you have to do is adjust the settings when you select it, fiddle with a few more options and you can start. Have fun</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the being blinked out as well, leaving Percy with one world in a 'tab', as the main A.I. called it earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Custom worlds \u2013 crossovers (1)~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnamed world<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping the icon with his finger, the menu filled up with statistics. The star, now the only one in the black expanse, grew to the size of a small moon as it took on features, such as continents, oceans, mountains, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flashing button, labeled as settings, that Percy hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck...\u201d Percy said, looking at the list of customization options for the world. \u201cI just want to get started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Unknown length of time later ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><i><b>Do you wish to apply these settings</b></i></u>?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, for the love of creation, I do!\u201d He all but yelled, hitting the apply button with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><i><b>Please select location you wish to start in</b></i></u>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't care!

Where are we?\u201d Rose's voice asked from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Percy saw that they were in a town square of some sort. People were walking around, not even paying them any mind despite his armor or Millicent's blue skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a fountain in the middle of the square, with three ways to leave and still be able to go somewhere. The fourth exit lead up to a large castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what I remember, it's some place called...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d He was interrupted by somebody running up to him. It was a rather skinny fellow with a protruding chin, with several bags around his waist and a large red hat atop his head. \u201cSir, I have a letter for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not what he was expecting. \u201cWho are you, and how do you know my name?

The post doesn't deliver itself, after all!\u201d The man said before he turned around, taking off at full sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the envelope over, Percy took note of the fancy writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the royal family of Hyrule...\u201d</span></div></div>",

And, I don't know about you, but I intend to use this to make sure I know my fake background so I don't look like a fool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed. \u201cFine, fine. But, at the very least, wait a day or two. I've done nothing but read, look at lists and make decisions for what seems like days. My mental capacity for such things has reached its absolute limit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Rose asked, raising an eyebrow. \u201cIt didn't seem like more than a few moments at the most between the world going dark and appearing here. At least, for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, trust me when I say it was a long, long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor baby...\u201d Rose said playfully, smirking when Percy gave her a look that said 'don't push me'. \u201cFine, fine. It can wait, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Get up, Millicent.\u201d Percy said to his daughter, watching as she punched the bricks, which were stained with her blood. The stones around her fist caved in, crumbling to dust. \u201cWe should go see what this Princess wants with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Some time later ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was nice.\u201d Percy said, sitting in the room he and Rose had been granted. \u201cTo actually be greeted as an equal for once. How long has it been since that happened, I wonder?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been led into the palace with fanfare, their arrival being announced throughout the city by both town criers and rumor, the latter the much faster way of letting the news be known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the throne room, they had been greeted ceremoniously by Princess Zelda, welcoming them to her kingdom, and thanking them for coming all this way for the coronation. That it would surely go a long way to solidifying their places as good friends and allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was a fair maiden, every thing about her elegant. From her dress to the way she moved, not a hair was put out of place as she did her royal duties in welcoming the rulers of another land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must ask though,\u201d Rose said, turning away from the vanity she sat at. \u201cDid you have Millicent labeled as our daughter for this... what did you call it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA game session, and no, I didn't.\u201d Percy answered truthfully. \u201cThe only thing I made sure of in our history is that I still had the title of Overlord and the position of the ruler of the infernal abyss. Other than that, I told it to fabricate the rest of our lives in this world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Percy walked over to his queen in this world, looking in the mirror. \u201cHowever, my greatest surprise was that this device held a copy of our world. It would seem there is more to this than I thought.\u201d He mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... Maybe.\u201d She thought, picking up a brush as she turned back around. \u201cBut what of Millicent's training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will still proceed as planned, don't you worry.\u201d He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, and your training as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of shrieking, as one would normally do when a new voice unexpectedly joins a private conversation in a private room, Rose merely turned around to look at the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a lot of experience keeping calm when someone appears out of thin air with Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, it's you.\u201d She heard Percy say to the old man with the tattered cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it's me.\u201d The old man snarked at Percy. \u201cDon't sound so surprised now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, who is this?\u201d Rose asked calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, right. Rose, this is the spirit of my boots. Boots, this is my lovely wife, Rose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ancient spirit fixed Percy with a hard glare. \u201cYou call me boots again and I'll leave you in the middle of the void. At least call me by an actual name.\u201d The spirit paused, thinking. \u201c Thom will do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, Thom.\u201d Percy said, not wanting to deal with such a trivial matter as a name. \u201cSo, what brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou deaf? I already said that we'll work on your training as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right. Sorry. I'm still at my mental limit, and some sleep will likely do me some good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Thom said, rolling his eyes as he sat on the windowsill. \u201cI'll see you on the morrow then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the old spirit melded into the dying light of the setting sun, leaving Percy alone with Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone else I should know about?\u201d She asked, quirking an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yes. The spirit of my gauntlets is elsewhere. From the few words I exchanged from him, he's not all that pleasant of a fellow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, pray tell, what exactly are you wearing on your hands and feet?\u201d She asked, looking at the gauntlets and boots that looked identical to the ones he wore in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just going to say that it's like when I split my mind into two bodies. I am both here,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here.\u201d His newly conjured second body said from the ceiling. \u201cAnd, as you can see, I still retain the abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? And what about that new aura of yours? The one that caused you to stay away from Eres and myself?\u201d She asked. \u201cAs you can see, I'm not being affected by anything, since my mind is still my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Percy's blinked, looking at one another. \u201cYes... quite curious.\u201d He said, letting his mind become whole again. \u201cSkills menu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around them dulled once again, the light evening breeze that flowed in through the window coming to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSearch for Aura.\u201d He told it, making the list of skills he had shorten considerably. \u201cLet's see... Lust aura, evil aura, dominating aura, aura of darkness, power aura, death aura... Ah, here it is. Imbecile's aura.\u201d Both he and Rose suppressed snorts of laughter at the name. \u201cThe sheer presence of this person causes people to do incredibly foolish things, makes them susceptible to being coerced into things they might not do, and saps the intelligence of those affected by this aura. While a passive skill, it does not work on friends or allies. Can be unleashed to full power if used as an active skill, but will affect allies as well as enemies. Can be used during negotiations with friends or allies, though it must be activated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the menu, he sat down as the world resumed moving once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow <i>that</i>,\u201d He said, a grin forming on his face. \u201cIs incredibly helpful.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAnd... done!\u201d Percy said, finishing his reading of his created back story. \u201cI could go back to sleep already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shush.\u201d Rose said, almost done with her own life story. \u201cQuit being so dramatic. I've seen you calmly listen to those council meetings back home that took hours on end with all their bickering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it comes with the position of Overlord, if not the status of a god.\u201d Percy said. \u201cThough, it's more likely the latter than the former, really. Or maybe it just runs in my father\u2019s side of the family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever the reason, I ask that you keep a lid on it. Why don't you go see if our daughter is doing her reading?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt she is.\u201d Percy sighed, scratching his chest. \u201cBut, it would be something to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing open the door to the guest quarters he and Rose had been given, Percy walked out into the halls of the time-stilled castle. Even as early as it was, the sun barely reaching over the mountains in the distance, there were servants about, frozen in time as they went about their daily tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuest menu.\u201d He said, not bothering to watch where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the window when it popped up, he looked at the active quests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlliance with the kingdom of Hyrule...\u201d He read, one of the objectives beneath it the one that popped up first in the town square. \u201cSo that's part of the reason why there was no notification that we'd completed a quest.\u201d He mused. \u201cAnd why it said to meet with the Princess when I woke up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the map, he also thought what the game told him about 'administrative powers' or some such. He figured that it would be on one of the tabs, like the avatar bio or inventory... but no! He'd searched through the skills list, perused the perks tab, but found nothing! Not one thing that said 'administrative'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what could the game have been talking about?\u201d He asked, entering the room Millicent had been given for the duration of their stay, and where her little blip on the map was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still sleeping, the blankets laying in such a fashion it looked like a nest around her. Her hair was splayed out, her blue skin clashing against the red sheets. She was breathing softly, her hands balled into fists as she jerked around every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be dreaming of battle.\u201d He said, somewhat proud, and somewhat saddened. Proud that she would be able to look after herself and hold the title of Overlord with honor, sad because of the hell he had left her to face since she was two and a half years old and the fact she needed to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, thinking of how, before the Eronomicon, he would have wished for a world in which his kids didn't have to fight. How he would have settled down with Annabeth, monsters afraid to go near them due to fighting the primordials and coming out on top. Lulling Gaea back to sleep, pushing back Tartarus as he threatened to engulf the world in the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this would have come to pass, having seen the plan the fates had weaved for him if he hadn't been marked by the Eronomicon, made it so much sadder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking himself from his thoughts, Percy proceeded to shake Millicent awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up.\u201d He said, letting her swat his hand away with a grunt. \u201cThere's so much to do before we can begin training, and it would be better for you to wake up and take care of it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke to him, using a language that would make someone who didn't understand lose five minutes of memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that doesn't work on me.\u201d He said with a frown. \u201cNow... <b>UP</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her will, Millicent was forced from her sleep as her body moved to acknowledge the command of raw power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not the first time such a thing had happened. She had told many a minion who had come to wake her to leave with the language, making the already forgetful browns that woke her forget why they were even there. In turn, Percy had commanded her to wake, letting a language of power, one that demanded obedience, seep into his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways left his throat sore for a while though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent glowered at him, wishing his head would explode in her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't give me that look.\u201d He said, rubbing his throat. \u201cYou had best read up on your history for this scenario. After that, I will see about finding an area where we can train.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, 'Father.'\u201d She spat out, sleepily bringing up her avatar bio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Percy would hold it against her. He wasn't much of a morning person himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her to grumble as she read up on just the necessities, as Percy was sure she would find only what was needed to survive this scenario with some pride intact, Percy started to wander the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the world was paused, he took his time in wandering throughout the castle. It was a tall structure, with grand halls and staircases on most floors. There was a barracks to one side, complete with stables for horses bred for war. A graveyard stood on the opposite side, filled with the bodies of the royal family and their most trusted servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not have a large tomb for the royal family?\u201d Percy wondered, looking at a weathered headstone that was barely legible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving along on his self-guided tour, Percy found himself back at the entrance to the castle. Two guards were positioned there, though they were not at attention, as they should have been. They were lazing against the wall, weapons forgotten as they talked to one another from across the way. Cups that smelled of ale were haphazardly hidden away, and anyone who was looking for them could have seen them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Percy had never let the minions on guard duty slack off. They were alert, and ready for any attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo see such disregard for the importance of their post, the negligence of their princess's safety, even during a time of peace, he was so incensed that he took a swing at one of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of bouncing off, like he expected after Millicent had tried to slug a guard across the face during one of the other pauses, his fist connected solidly with the man, sending his, now unfrozen, form to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man cried out as his helmet hit the stone steps, a tooth being jarred out violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around rapidly, holding his bleeding mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha's goin' on?\u201d He asked, spitting out a bit of blood onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stared, not expecting that in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood up, his armor shaking. He turned to look at Percy, lifting a finger with what he could only imagine being wide eyes beneath his helm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d He cried out, before he cowered upon seeing who he was talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c'You' What?\u201d Percy asked, seeing this supposed soldier cower. He knew he could be imposing, but he wasn't even trying to intimidate the person! Was the guard that afraid of him? Was it his stature, his title, the supposed ruthlessness he had when angered in this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't answer, averting his helmeted gaze as he nursed his bleeding mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPathetic.\u201d Percy muttered, turning his head away as he walked back into the castle with disgust. He didn't know the man had become frozen in time once more, not really caring either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>'You have attacked one of the palace guards! Reputation with Princess Zelda has decreased! You'll be sure to get an earful about this!</b></u>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming his hand against the close button, Percy stormed his way through the palace to his room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Percy was in the throne room, having been brought before the Princess under armed guard. He was currently listening to Zelda coolly berate him, holding her sword like the gavel of a judge, ready to bring it down on him at one misstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what say you, Lord Perseus?\u201d She asked, eyes boring twin holes into him. \u201cWhat defense do you have for attacking a soldier at their post?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, shrugging. \u201cHonestly, I let my temper get the better of me. Though, I will say that, had I been an enemy, the castle would already be littered with bodies with little notice, until well into my massacre\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Should I take that as a threat?\u201d Zelda asked, narrowing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it however you wish, though I don't mean it as a threat. Just an observation.\u201d Percy said, looking at the guards around him with their weapons at the ready. Their grip was calm, no shaking swords or shields. \u201cThese guards are competent, unlike that slack-jawed layabout at the gate. No drinking on the job, weapons at the ready should I twitch in a way that they deem a threat to your safety, minds alert... Good soldiers. You should wish that every soldier under your command was like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda regarded him for a moment before looking at another soldier. \u201cGo see if what he said was true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a salute, the soldier did as told, hurrying as fast as his armor would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou likely won't find anything, since the two that were standing guard looked like they had done this before. They knew of a spot to stash the evidence, and if I had been in another spot then I wouldn't have noticed. They were at utter ease, talking to one another without a weapon at their waist or in their hands. While I admit that my reaction was more than necessary, and incredibly out of line, seeing lax guards has always been one of my greatest aggravations. And, as my wife will tell you, I can have quite the nasty temper. Though, to be completely honest with everyone here, I could have done so much worse, and you could have been down one guard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may, I cannot allow you to attack the palace guard. But,\u201d She said, sitting in her throne. \u201cWe shall see if your story holds any measure of truth first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be many minutes till the guard returned with information that, yes, the guards had been drinking at their posts. So, to bide his time, Percy looked around the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stood at the top of the castle, unlike many other castles that he had seen. It was large, with an open archway for a door that would easily let something the size of Cerberus, when she was still the hound of Hades, enter. The windows were all stained glass, depicting various scenes of Hyrule's history, but always bearing the Hyrule family crest as well as the three golden triangles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, above the throne there stood a sculpture, of three feminine figures surrounding the triangles, one holding fire, another breathing wind, and the last with her arms wide open. The ceiling was vaulted, pillars arching up to hold the weight of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throne itself was, in comparison to the rest of the room, modest. It was made of something that looked similar to gold, but was likely some metal that Earth, nor the world of the Overlord, had. It had red silk cushions on the seat and back, so that the ruler could rest easy as they did their duty to the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Percy thought to himself, the real jewel sat upon the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs stated before, Princess Zelda was incredibly precise, every move she made being elegant and for a reason. She did not lean to one side in her chair, but sat poised should he try anything. Her sword was gripped firmly in her hand, laid across her lap ready to strike out. She did not blink unnecessarily, nor dart her eyes to look for the messenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would come soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brown hair was braided to frame her face, and a tiara rested on her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dress was perfectly made, not a stitch out of place. It was designed to be as beautiful as the one who wore it, and the princess made it absolutely stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes regarded him with a calm, icy coolness, wondering if she should still try for the alliance as she had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard she had sent away trotted back in, barely breathing hard despite running up the stairs in full armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness, It seems that Lord Perseus was telling the truth. There was a skin full of ale, and one empty, found under a loose cobble stone that hadn't been placed right. We had found two cups as well, all showing signs of being recently used.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d She said, looking at Percy. \u201cIt seems your story is true. Guards, leave us. I wish to talk with Lord Perseus alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single soldier in that room saluted, turning on heel to leave the soon-to-be queen on her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said,\u201d Percy told Zelda as she stood once again. \u201cYou should wish to have more soldiers like those under your command. The one this case involved was a sniveling coward. I must ask, are your armies getting soft in this time of peace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving him a sharp look, Zelda stepped down from her raised throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because I allow my armies to relax during times of peace does not mean they are getting soft, Lord Perseus.\u201d She said. \u201cNot everyone practices your tactic of always having a standing army to fight at a moments notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that, Princess.\u201d Percy said, looking her square in the eyes. \u201cOnce again, I apologize for my behavior. If there is something I can do to make amends, I will do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shall see how our talk of Alliance goes first.\u201d Zelda told him. \u201cThen we can talk about repaying small transgressions. I agree that the guards should not have been drinking, and if not for you, I would have reprimanded him myself. However, having his jaw so brutally attacked by you should be enough of a reminder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stared at her for a second, to make sure he had heard that right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was your attempt at a joke, wasn't it?\u201d Percy said, daring to crack a knowing smirk at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps...\u201d She said, returning his smirk. \u201cThough, I must ask. The guard said that the world seemed like a washed out painting, with not even a breeze, and his fellow guard was frozen in time. Was that your doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrozen in time?\u201d Percy asked, feigning curiosity. \u201cI had nothing to do with that. In fact, I didn't know that time had frozen. Maybe he had a little too much to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gave him a sideways look, raising an eyebrow. \u201cMaybe... Though, it is no secret that your wife is the most gifted magician in the known world. Perhaps she has a spell that would allow such a thing to be done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I admit that my wife is talented,\u201d Percy said, remembering how Rose was apparently the greatest battle-mage the world had seen in a long time. \u201cI doubt she could do something such as freeze time. Though, if you put her to the test, I'm sure she would be able to find something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nodded at him, walking past him towards the exit of the throne room. \u201cWell, I do believe that this affair has been dealt with. Would you and your family care to join me for a late breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would love to.\u201d Percy said, walking beside her. \u201cThough, I apologize in advance for my daughter's table manners.

She jumped over the leg sweep, bringing her fist crashing against Percy's unprotected face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy retaliated, grabbing her arm and throwing her to the ground. He brought his foot up, ready to bring it down on her chest with enough force to snap steel in twain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling out of the way, Millicent got to her feet as she stared at Percy with anger. Blood was flowing from his nose, a pure golden color, as the nose itself was a smashed mess, the cartilage broken and twisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his foot from the ground, Percy ran at Millicent, leaning forward for a tackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent dodged to the side, spinning so she could run after him. She jumped on his back, wrapping her hands around his neck and did everything in her power to kill him. Twisting, choking, jerking, snapping... even going so far as to try and gouge out his eyes with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could dig her fingers in, Percy grabbed her arm, pulling her to the side as he tossed her to the ground, where she rolled and sprang to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unprepared for the wall of shadow that rose up before her, slamming down on her with the intent to smother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy watched as his shadow struggled to drag Millicent back to him, the now physical darkness struggling to contain his rage-filled child. There were a few times when it looked like she would rip through the absence of light, but a small exertion of his power over darkness caused it to clamp down like a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like he expected her to be able to fight him at full force, really. Even half force was going too far. While she would be much stronger in the future, enough for him to actually fight instead of toy with, for now she was still a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in the eastern fields, a swath of land that was mostly barren and unused. Percy had asked the princess if there was any place where he and his daughter could spar without causing much damage, seeing how their fights tended to cause small scale destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had allowed them the use of the field, seeing how no one used it since the bridge leading from the castle town had broke. While it would have been better to have it fixed, no one was complaining about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, vulture-like birds sat in the trees, circling the wasteland that was the eastern field. It was barren, rocky and wholly unsuited for anything like agriculture. It was likely that, should expansion on the town become necessary, they would build on this field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy rolled out of the way, sensing a type of light magic heading towards his back. Calling his shadow back, Percy turned to face this enemy with his mace forming from the darkness in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a winged person, bow in hand and drawn, a glowing arrow notched and ready to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a white tunic, hemmed with golds and reds along the bottom, fastened on her shoulder with a large red jewel. A brown belt with a silver lining and golden triangular buckle kept the tunic from fluttering in the wind. Leather bracers with gold and bronze rings on the ends protected her arms, with another ring of gold decorating her upper left arm. On her feet were beige leather sandals with overlapping bands over the top, decorated with tufts of white fur. To top it all off, a golden laurel crown sat on her head, keeping her long brown hair from whipping around as she flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDark Lord Perseus! In the name of the goddess of Light, I shall banish you!\u201d She yelled, letting the arrow fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can't you see I was doing something!\u201d Percy yelled, jumping out of the way of the arrow. \u201cAnd-\u201d He jumped again, another arrow almost piercing his leg. \u201cHey! Watch where-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw all I needed to!\u201d She yelled, letting arrow after arrow fly, each one magically forming from pure light. \u201cI didn't figure you for a kidnapper on top of all your other crimes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKidnapper?\u201d Percy yelled, vanishing just seconds before each arrow struck him. \u201cThat's my daughter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaughter?\u201d The angel asked, holding her fire. She looked at Millicent, who was trying to regain her barrings after being held in darkness and dragged around. \u201cAh! The barbarian Princess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to debate with herself, shaking her head as she took aim at him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, you were using dark magic! That alone is enough reason to bring you to justice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I was using dark magic, but it wasn't <i>black</i> magic!\u201d Percy said, throwing his arms up in the air. \u201cWhen will people learn that dark is not evil? There's a difference, for crying out-\u201d Percy was cut short, grunting as a light arrow pierced his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop trying to defend yourself!\u201d The angel yelled. \u201cYou will be shown judgment by the Lady Palutena!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrow after arrow she fired, each one finding their mark in Percy. He grunted after each hit, feeling the light energy seep into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn, I knew I should have killed that god of light a few months ago. Wouldn't have this problem now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that it hurt, necessarily. But the light energy was conflicting the dark energy he possessed, gained after killing the forgotten god and taking over the infernal abyss. It was hard to make his body respond with the polar opposite energies swirling around in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won?\u201d The angel said, looking at the arrow riddled form of Perseus. \u201cWell, that was surprisingly easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're right. It <i>was</i> too easy.\u201d A dark voice said from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel spun around with a small scream, bow coming apart into duel swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy floated in the air, his dark aura keeping him afloat as his eyes burned through the miasma that surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a very foolish thing to do.\u201d Percy growled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh heh heh... I'm sorry?\u201d The angel said with a nervous laugh, wings backing her away slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where do you think you're going?\u201d Another voice said, once again behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning again, the Angel came face to face with another Percy, this one surrounded by an aura that gave off the smell of fresh graves and rotting corpses. The air around him twisted into faces that screamed in untold agony, the earth beneath him becoming even more bleak. This one also wore armor made of bone, human and animal alike. The very heat of the air was sucked into him, leaving the cold of death behind as his skin became gaunt with rotting skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Uh...\u201d She tried to form words, looking back and forth between the two, wondering how to get out of this mess. \u201cLady Palutena... A little help please?\u201d She finally asked, looking at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Both halves of the to-be harem god said, the body riddled with arrows dissipating along with the arrows. \u201cWe want to know why we've been attacked. We have done nothing during our stay in these lands to warrant such an attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Palutena... Any second now would be good...\u201d The girl squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer altitude dipped for a second, like she was about to drop, before she shot off into the sky like a bungee cord had been attached to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don't!\u201d Both Percys yelled, flying up after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel looked down, seeing the two parts of an angry god racing after her. \u201cOh boy... this isn't going to be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two halves of Percy raced after her, too angry to even think about using the power of the boots to catch her at the moment. They were running with the powers they had, and them alone as they flew higher and higher, reaching the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting through the fluffy looking layer, the chase became even more heated. The angel was ducking under the blasts of dark energy and death magic, diving in and out of the clouds in an attempt to lose them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy would not be so easily escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot good...\u201d She breathed to herself, narrowly avoiding the newest blast of dark energy that nearly took her foot off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy saw her wings lose the blue glow for a fraction of a second, making her lose some altitude and speed before correcting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, is the little angel getting tired?\u201d The dark Percy asked, a savage grin spreading across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not think you can escape me so easily.\u201d The Percy clad in bone rasped, his voice rough and grating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Jeez. Sorry about this Lady Palutena, but it looks like we'll have to fight them on our doorstep.\u201d She said, speeding up as they neared a large ruined city atop the clouds.</span></div></div>",

She was far faster than any human, and so was barely able to outrun Percy as the two halves of his power tore through the already ruined temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the death half touched crumbled into dust, being blown away in his flight. Whatever the dark half touched turned black, twisting into something that could not be recognized as stone before it collapsed in on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Palutena! Please, keep the centurions away! Who knows what will happen to them if they try to fight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that her prayer worked, as no help came, despite Percy both sensing and seeing multitudes of life, female at that, just out of mortal sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them had the same sentence above their heads, dictating just how to earn their loyalties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarn the loyalty of Palutena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Percy paid it no mind, his focus solely on the one angel, who also had the sentence above her head as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour lungs must be burning by now, little angel!\u201d The dark half taunted, dragging his hand along the wall he flew by, purposely touching everything he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop running, and face your dues!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's right...' The angel thought, her breathing becoming more ragged with every breath. Sweat poured down her beet red face, the muscles in her legs burning with every motion. 'But I can't stop until Lady Palutena figures out what to do! I'm in no condition to use the three sacred treasures either...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned a corner, a loose stone caught her foot. With a yell, she went head over heel into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up as she rubbed her head, she looked around for an escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dead end?\u201d She asked, groaning. \u201cWhy do we even have these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaught you!\u201d They cried in unison, rounding the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't run now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cannot escape!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, the two halves of Percy were assaulted by the form of a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had skin the color of polished ivory, green hair flowing down to her ankles. Her emerald eyes were staring daggers at both bodies of Percy. She wore a flowing white dress, simple if not for the numerous golden decorations that adorned her body. A large golden necklace, two belts with many golden ornaments hanging from them with another large red gem to hold them, bangles and bracelets, a large laurel crown made of, you guessed it, gold. The last ornament she had on her body was a golden bracer that covered almost the entirety of her left arm, ending with a large, feathery design at the top that curved outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hands were clasped a scepter made of gold, once again, and some strange blue metal, with a floating blue ball hovering over the top, as well as a shield that shone like a mirror. It didn't look very durable, but as anyone with even a passing interest in magical items would tell you, anything wielded by a god was nigh unbreakable no matter how fragile it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Palutena!\u201d The angel yelled, seeing the countenance of her goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep quiet now,\u201d She said, not exactly harsh but not too kind either. \u201cDark Lord Perseus. I ask that you cease chasing my general and causing destruction to my kingdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d The dark one hissed out, touching the wall next to him out of spite, causing the entire wall, and a portion of the ceiling, to turn black and collapse in on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe attacked us, when we had done no wrong!\u201d The one shrouded in death claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes. I know what she did. I was watching the whole time.\u201d Palutena said, only looking slightly miffed about the wall. \u201cHowever, you must admit that what you were doing looked <i>mighty</i> suspect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do not care!\u201d The dark one roared out. \u201cWe do not take unprovoked attacks lightly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that. However, I insist you calm down. I will not let you destroy my kingdom because of a mistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Percys glared, one at Palutena and the other at the angel, for a long while. The angel dare not move, and Palutena kept calm, though a divine glow did start to form around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d They growled, their respective aura's fading away. They slowly drifted to the floor, the powers made manifest by anger fully reigned in once they touched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'd better not shoot me in the back again, little angel.\u201d The Percy looking at the less divine of the three said before he faded away, the only Percy left looking at Palutena. \"Now, make this worth my time, or there will be little left of these ruins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow around Palutena faded as well, though she never stopped levitating a few inches above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d She said, somewhat forced given his last threat. \u201cNow, how about we go to my main temple to discuss this. There is something you should know about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was sitting in a relatively quaint room for the palace of a goddess. While it still had the flair to it that mortals could not possess, it was not so over the top like most other temples he had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had sent a piece of his mind to Millicent, telling her that something had come up and that she should go talk to Rose about starting her magical training, if only in theory. Of course, this was done as the world was paused, as he had to reread the little tidbit in his bio about his relationship with the kingdom of light as well as a small bio about the faction itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, the centurions sounded exactly like the minions... except the minions were more versatile, autonomous and incapable of flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure they were relatively strong, and could fly under their own power, but other than that they really had nothing to really stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, his relationship with the faction was... strange. He, being a dark lord, was their prime target and suspect in almost all things. If something happened in the world of mortals, they would assume he had a hand in it. But, without proof, they could not, would not, attack him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also wondered why someone like Rose, who mainly used her magic to heal when not at war, would even think of being his queen. Such a delicate, though powerful, person such as her with the big bad Overlord who used her talents to further his hold on the world and blah blah blah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTypical. Always think that just because she can hold her temper that she's pure and innocent. The only reason Velvet has her beat in the bedroom is because Velvet spent time with succubi!\u201d He said, glaring at Palutena. \u201cAnd trust me, when she loses her temper, there've been swaths of land reduced to wastelands. She also has a mean backhand.\u201d He finished, recalling the time Giblet was feeling frisky after getting shitfaced at the celebration of the creation of his world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose was, for some reason or another, not feeling in the mood, and Giblet was too plastered to take a hint from anyone other than Percy. Even when drunk, the forge mistress was steady on her feet... and yet Rose knocked her on her ass like it was nothing with a single back hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiblet complained about a welt on her face for the next week, wondering where she had gotten it. As for Rose, she had always wondered where the strength came from since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe having so much sex did something to give her that.\u201d He mused, looking at Palutena's frozen face. \u201cOr, maybe it's because she's Millicent's mother. Ah well, it's not like you can hear me anyway. Don't know why I'm saying all this like you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Palutena said, continuing to move about the room like nothing had happened. \u201cI know we haven't always seen eye to eye on things, what with you seeking to take over the world and all, but there's a reason my top angel assumed the worst.\u201d She said, tossing some spices into a cauldron, taking a small spoon out to taste the concoction. \u201cThere's been a dark force on the rise, heading straight for Hyrule. It's ancient, powerful, and wholly unpleasant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike me?\u201d Percy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are the keeper of hell, as well as a dark lord. Dark and unpleasant is your M.O., you know?\u201d Palutena said, looking over her shoulder back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, yes. Did Percy forget to mention he was also the keeper of the inferno in this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, it's something he didn't actually tell the game to do. It just sort of happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I figured you knew that hell is not a place where demons are born and bred.\u201d Percy retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you have to admit they do escape from there a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my fault exactly that they like to rush through my realm when I'm busy with my kingdom.\u201d Percy said, recalling the bit where he apparently hated how they escaped through his realm into the human world while he was gone. \u201cAnyway, what's this evil that's coming? I want them to understand that their very existence has caused me an... inconvenience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, inconvenience.\u201d Palutena said, turning around to give him a deadpan look. \u201cThat's why you were tearing through my kingdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for losing my cool when someone attacks me and claims that I've done something I haven't.\u201d Percy snipped, crossing his arms. \u201cNow, Tell me what's happening.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I told her we would be taking it slow and start with theory, but she just had to take after her father in regards to her patience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to see you too.\u201d Percy said, rolling his eyes. \u201cDid Thom come around at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he did, but I'm not quite sure. I thought I saw him in the window earlier, but when I tried to take a better look there was nothing there.\u201d She said, pointing at the window the spirit had appeared on last night. \u201cSo, what exactly was it that required your attention?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve it or not, I was attacked by an angel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pretty face, or an actual angel?\u201d Rose asked, smiling knowingly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActual angel. Wings and everything. Do you remember what you read about a kingdom of light, with a leader named Palutena?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nodded. \u201cYes, I remember. Always pestering us, or at least our backstory selves. Claiming they were always doing the mortal world a favor by trying to kill you, always thinking I was being controlled or threatened in some way by you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow there's a thought.\u201d Percy said, grimacing. \u201cAnyway, it doesn't matter right now. What matters is that Palutena said the reason I was attacked was mostly because she sensed a dark presence that wanted to engulf the world, and that it was somewhere in Hyrule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Rose asked, eyebrow raised once more. \u201cI know my husband can take care of any pesky tyrant-wannabe. The only question is, do you wish to do anything about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, not really. I'd rather just go about the world doing whatever, the two of us training Millicent as I grasp the more complex, if basic, powers of the boots and gauntlets while working other things on the side. We've got at least eight years to work with, so why not make the most of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the politics?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways hated them anyway.\u201d Percy said with a shrug. \u201cThough, I really don't mind being treated like an equal around here. I just don't want the three of us to be wrapped up in some quest for the fate of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad too much of that in your old life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it in one, my lovely queen.\u201d Percy grinned, though it was slightly forced. \u201cHowever, that doesn't really matter right now. How about we have a night on the town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally Perseus? I would think that you wouldn't be able to go anywhere in the town without somebody knowing who you, we, are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said it had to be this town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn excellent point.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I haven't had anything like that since I was a child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir 'night on the town' had taken them to various towns across the world, courtesy of the world map giving the names and locations, as well as a little background on them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were far away from the lands of Hyrule, far from the land known only as the Dominion that Percy ruled over. The dinner had been at, not a fancy restaurant or palace, but a small border town inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's idea, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Percy would complain. It was surprisingly good food, for what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree. The food was good, and I wouldn't mind coming back here again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither would I. Now, how about we talk more in depth about the events of your day. I want to hear how you managed to insult our host in such a way that she had armed guards escort you to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shrugged. \u201cSure, why not. It all started after I left the room and had an... altercation with a guard about his lack of respect for his job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there he went on to explain the events of the day, from having to stand on trial before the Princess to training with Millicent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got to explain the fight with the angel, realizing he never got her name as Palutena always referred to her as her general, Rose brought something to his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <i>flew</i>?\u201d She asked, furrowing her brow. \u201cI know that your boots allowed you to walk on anything you please, even the air itself, but flying is something new for you. How did you do that, and so naturally from what you describe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...\u201d Percy paused, before he really started, to think over this piece of news. \u201cHow did I fly? And while using the powers of darkness and death? I really don't recall being able to do that in the real world. It's very strange, really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, since just before breakfast, none of those strange little boxes have popped up either. I thought they would be a little more common, if we got a quest from reading a letter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I hadn't paid any attention, really.\u201d He said, thinking back on the tutorial program. \u201cThe A.I. Said that most things would have an impact... you know, like life does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you figure out why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the most I can do is take a look at the skills menu, I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the usual sound, the menu popped up in front of Percy, pausing the game world around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSearch aura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, the list shortened down to a more manageable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's see now... Aura of Darkness.\u201d He said, reading silently as Rose did the same over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><b>Aura of Darkness - Level 2: All light within five feet is completely drawn into you, and all light up to ten feet away is dimmed by 40%.  A feeling of general unease effects any person within thirty feet, even if they do not have direct sight of the user. Those with weak wills will go temporarily insane</b></u>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd... that's a bust.\u201d Percy sighed. \u201cNothing about flying. I highly doubt the Death aura will say anything about the matter either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you're going about this the wrong way.\u201d Rose said, now shamelessly draped over him. \u201cMaybe it's not an aura. Why don't you try searching just for darkness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn't hurt. New search, darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, the list defaulted back to showing all skills, but quickly removed anything that had nothing to do with darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top, there was the Aura of Darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was something new below it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething with sub-categories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>'Dark God Form - level 1: Darkness incarnate, the Corrupting Deity. Who are you in the dark?</b></u> - <i>Only accessible after training, or with strong enough emotions</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking the little box just beneath, Percy looked at the sub-categories of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Abilities include:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Flight</b></u> \u2013 <u><b>level 1</b></u>: Take to the skies! Top Speed of 100 MPH. Higher levels increase top speed and acceleration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Corrupting touch \u2013 level 1</b></u>: Anything you touch is infected with darkness. Blessed and Holy items and materials crumble into nothing. People touched will be corrupted, bringing out the darkness that dwells within them. Current level does not allow slightly holy people, such as priests, or those with divine protection to be corrupted. Higher levels increase corruption per second (CPS), and allow you to infect holier beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Dark amplifier \u2013 level 1</b></u>: Abilities that make use of darkness that are available without accessing the Dark God Form are boosted twofold when in Dark God Form. Higher levels increase multiplier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Godly body \u2013 level 1</b></u>: Physical stats are doubled. Health is tripled. Higher levels increase stat boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we've found our culprit.\u201d Rose said, looking at Percy out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, too.\u201d Percy said, eyes scanning the words again and again. There were more sub-categories beneath that, but Percy had seen all he needed to. \u201cNew search. God.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new list that popped up had six main entries, with sub-categories on two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater God Form, Death God Form, Dark God Form, Fire God Form, Evil God Form and Harem God Form. Water and Harem God Form's had the sub-categories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. It seems that I should look more into this.\u201d Percy said, grabbing one of Rose's hands. Entwining his fingers with hers, he turned his head to look at the mother of his first-born. \u201cThough, that can wait until the end of our night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d Rose said, hugging Percy from her position behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the world resumed motion, the inn was missing two occupants. The inn-keeper would find a note and a valuable jewel in his safe, while the few patrons in the border town inn would wander home thinking they had drank too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople just didn't disappear into thin air, after all.</span></div></div>",

Around her, the crew of the ship bustled around as they did their jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready she had broken up a few fights between the minions and the ghostly naval soldiers. The most recent one had started over one of the browns having bumped into a soldier, and quickly escalated into a brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been able to stop the minion from throwing the skeleton overboard, though she had needed Clarisse to keep the soldiers in line so that they didn't all rush the minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like it would have done them any good, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse, the official commanding officer for the ghost crew had already dismissed three particularly aggressive soldiers, sending them back to their original ship in shame without actually relieving them of their debt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth smiled cruelly, knowing that it was unlikely that they would be called upon ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, while it worried her that she was becoming as bad as, if not worse than the Olympians, she couldn't find it in herself to care. Those soldier that had been dismissed had been quite rude to every single one of them, save Grover and Clarisse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Annabeth smiled, nicely mind you, at the goddess on board. \u201cYeah, Mel? What's up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to sound impatient, but how long will it be until we arrive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll arrive just outside the entrance tonight. We're gonna wait until tomorrow for Percy, sleeping just outside Charybdis's range.\u201d She said, quickly taking note of the sun's position. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have that feeling I'm being watched from all sides. And not by the undead on this ship.\u201d She said, glaring at the horizon. \u201cOnly Master can watch me when I'm not on stage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's probably Poseidon.\u201d Annabeth said with a sigh. \u201cI'm sorry Mel, but there's nothing we can do about that. Unless the fates are interfering, or something else draws his attention, Poseidon will know who and where you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this Poseidon... He is the Master's father, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth nodded. \u201cYeah. He's also the one who's partly responsible for what happened to Medusa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Melum went silent for a moment. \u201cAnd he knows what I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rough idea, from what Percy told me. You're a primordial, the one who embodies, and allows, all sound. At least, that's what those who have a vague idea of you think. Knowing the gods, they are probably individually conspiring to curry favor with you, hoping to get into your pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd given that we're in the heart of Poseidon's territory...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d Melum's brow furrowed in thought. \u201cWhy would the master ask me to join on this quest? Not that I'm not enjoying the time away from the studio, but still. Why would he have me-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vicious wave smashed against the boat, everybody on board tumbling closer to the side Melum and Annabeth were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I think Poseidon's going to try the whole 'shipwreck and take you down to his palace' routine.\u201d Annabeth said, quickly grabbing the railing so that she didn't fall into the salty waters. \u201cMel, care to dissuade him for the moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d The foreign goddess said, grabbing the railing as she steadied herself. \u201cThough, don't expect me to sing him a love song. Those are for the master only.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over the rails, staring straight down into the quickly frothing sea, Melum opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds she made would make any and all sea creatures incredibly hesitant to even come near the boat. Poseidon quickly diverted his attention away from the goddess, tail between his legs like he had seen Typhon coming right for him as he was stranded in the middle a desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, Melum allowed herself a smile. \u201cThere. We should be left alone for a while. I can no longer feel this Poseidon's presence watching us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, as the waters had gone completely still, afraid to act without her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Mel.\u201d Annabeth said, giving the goddess a thumbs-up sign, noticing that the sky was completely cloud free and the sun seemed less harsh on the boat. \u201cFantastic job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to anyone, something was happening deep in the sea. So deep, in fact, that it couldn't really be on most planes of existence. Something primal was taking place. Something terrible and wonderful and horrifying and enlightening, all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree beings stirred within the unfathomable depths of the primal sea. Eyes that did not exist opened, mouths without voices spoke, and minds with thoughts incomprehensible began to churn away the dreamless eons they had slumbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with their stirring, their brethren began to feel the call, signaling that the time to wake was nearing.</span></div></div>",

His arm was wrapped around her shoulders, an arm of hers resting on his chest as she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to wake her, Percy closed his eyes as another body formed with its eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down on his other body, since neither one could technically be called the original, and Rose, Percy cursed himself for not taking the chance to kill Morpheus when he had the perfect opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he enjoyed the shared warmth between them, the mobile body clad itself in the clothing that the game had seen fit to give him. Feeling particularly lazy that moment, he used the inventory screen to 'equip' it all, the apparel materializing on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving over to one of the windows in his room, this one facing the eastern horizon, Percy looked out to see the castle town as it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, rubbing away the sleep from his eyes, Percy looked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, his eyes weren't deceiving him. They never had, so why should they start now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh shit.\u201d Both mouths cursed, the one on the bed sighing as the one by the window tensed even further. \u201cRose, wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more, Percy.\u201d She murbled in her sleep, pressing her face deeper into his side. \u201cI'm tired. We can go again after breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is what I get for being the personification of lust.\u201d Both sighed, pinching the bridge of their nose. \u201cNo, Rose. You need to get up. Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Rose ruefully cracked her eyes open as she lifted her head slightly to look at him. \u201cPercy, what is it? I'm still tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to leave, it would seem.\u201d Percy said, the one that was up vanishing to wake Millicent up. \u201cWhatever forces are planning to sack Hyrule are finally making their move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Rose asked, yawning before she turned on her other side. \u201cWell, they can do so later. I need my beauty sleep, or I'll end up acting like Velvet. And I don't feel like putting either of us through that. One of my sister is more than enough for anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize that you're talking to a guy who has bedded the very embodiment of war and destruction, right?\u201d Percy asked, poking her back with his finger. \u201cYeesh, I must have robbed you of your usual mannerisms last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, please.\u201d Rose muttered, weakly swatting at him. \u201cJust... do whatever you want. If we're leaving, please just take us somewhere I can sleep without invasions interrupting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy gave a small laugh. \u201cAs my queen wishes.\u201d He said, giving her a light kiss on her neck before he left the comfort of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly dressing, again, Percy left to inform the princess of the imminent invasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how quickly it came upon them is certainly a surprise.\u201d Percy mused, armor molding from the darkness around him. \u201cThis is why it pays to have a standing army.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><b>Help repel the invasion</b></u>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barriers reached up past the clouds, distorting the light near them into a perfect image of a nearly set sun, bathing a great deal of land in the otherwise normal light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stood on the balcony just outside the throne room, defiantly staring down the walls of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it you see, Lord Perseus?\u201d Zelda asked the visiting Overlord, who was standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely you can see it yourself.\u201d Percy returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can.\u201d The princess said, a grim nod being the only action she allowed herself aside from talking. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth looked upon the strange black mist that flowed from the wall of physical magic, seemingly without end. It was moving fast, and it seemed to hold...<i> things</i>. Things not human, and certainly not friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you can't be persuaded to stay?\u201d Zelda asked, her voice steeled as she looked upon the paltry fighting force she had been able to call upon on such short notice. \u201cThe help of you and the Lady Rose would be a great boon for us, and one that would not go unrewarded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm afraid not.\u201d Percy told her, watching the black mist draw ever closer. \u201cWhatever is attacking, who's to say it is not preforming the same on my own kingdom at this very moment. And, while I cannot be sure at this time, I must fear the worst. If they were to, somehow, take the capital, there would be little stopping them from using some of the more powerful artifacts that my family has in our possession. Not only that, but I must think of the safety of my daughter. She may be strong, but she still has trouble with multiple opponents. If this is a full scale invasion, she will very likely be grievously injured. If that were to happen...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt there would be much left of Hyrule.\u201d Zelda finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. Though, at least the invasion would be dealt with.\u201d He finished with a smug, if grim, grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there no aid you can give us though?\u201d Zelda asked, turning to enter the throne room where her sword rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could always send help, if my own kingdom is not under siege. However, it would be a paltry force, as I would require the majority to set up defenses against possible invasion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d Zelda said, grabbing up her sword. \u201cThough I do not like it, I understand. If I were a parent, I would want my child as safe as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She understands what you do not...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy flinched slightly, quickly quashing the voice of his guilt for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It seems the game wasn't lying about this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Hyrule isn't your country.\u201d Zelda said, checking the sharpness of her blade. \u201cThough, I will admit that this will make an alliance harder for the people to accept. There will be tensions, people declaring you a coward for refusing to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them claim what they will. They do not know the struggle of ruling a country, and especially not with the possibility of outside threats being more than just paranoia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Zelda said, a grim smile forming as she gave the sword a few swings. \u201cBut, if you plan to leave, it should be soon. The enemy will be on us within a few hours. I expect your wife to use her magic to take you and your family away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Zelda said with a small sigh. \u201cI hope that you find your lands untouched by this opposing force.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I hope yours survives. Let it be known, if my daughter were more capable in battle, we would help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Percy turned on his heel and strode from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stared after him, though she did not allow herself the pleasure of another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Percy, as he went back to his room, he quickly read through the text window that popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><b>Warned the princess about the invasion, but will not help repel it.

Or, perhaps, it had something to do with how aggravated he was getting and his reputation in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy held back a growl, having already been looking for half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Percy said, turning to a stall vendor. \u201cHave you seen an elderly man who looked well traveled? About yay tall,\u201d He held his hand up to just below his neck. \u201cSkinny fellow. Had a mischievous aura about him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man quailed under the withering glare that Percy fixated on him, unintentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d The man squeaked out, feeling like he was being judged, and any words that weren't an answer would have him executed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d Percy bit out. \u201cIs there anyplace that might attract someone like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTelma's bar, I would think.\u201d The vendor said, fidgeting in his chair. \u201cIt's just down the steps there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pointed down a small alley, with a wooden sign hanging that read the name of the bar, most likely named after the proprietor of the establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Percy said, nodding at the man. \u201cIn return, I'll buy one bouquet. Any flowers will do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, Sir.\u201d The man said, quickly grabbing a few red and blue flowers, mixing in a few purple ones to finish it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce again, thank you.\u201d Percy said, taking out a few coins. Taking the arrangement, Percy dropped the money in his hand. \u201cWhile it's not your traditional currency of those small crystals, I'm sure it's more than enough if you were to exchange them, even counting whatever fee that would run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Percy walked to the alley entrance after putting the flowers in the inventory system of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar was dimly lit, smelling primarily of less-than-average quality alcohol and sweat. There were a few patrons, likely not even there for drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of them sat in the back around a single table with the only chairs in decent condition. One of them, a thin lad, likely no more than sixteen, was pouring over a map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second, a young woman this time, was sowing something together. She was dressed like a warrior, with a chainmail shirt and thick leather gloves. Percy was more than glad to let her image carve itself into his mind. Though, why was capture a yeti part of the steps to getting her into his bed? And she could do with less eyeliner, in his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third one was an old man, but not the old man Percy was looking for. He was completely bald, giving Percy a good look at the pointed ears that the Hylians sported. While nowhere near as large as the elves of Neverlight or Everlight, Percy still felt the urge to rip them off his head and burn the wounds with a hot poker. At least everyone else had them hidden beneath hair, head gear or was so strange looking that it detracted from the ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth was the one who delivered the letter to Percy yesterday, squatting in a corner, not even bothering with a chair. He was grumbling about something, and Percy really didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth and final one sat at the bar, idly stroking the back of a fat white cat. They had a hood pulled up, and a cloak that didn't seem quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked up to the bar, sitting next to the traveler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThom...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Had a busy morning, what with attacking one of the palace guards, being put on a short trial for said incident, doing some light training with Millicent and chasing down an angel. Rose said she thought she saw you a little bit before I got back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that's only because I wanted her to. Make sure you didn't forget about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark-skinned woman came from a back room, wiping her hands on a towel. She was shapely, with a large bosom and wide hips. She wore a gray blouse with white sleeves, with two large metal rings hanging from the bottom, only a metal clasp keeping it from being <i>completely</i> open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, she still showed off most of the orange corset she wore underneath, given that the clasp was secured just above her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple black skirt and a not so simple apron covered her hips and legs. The apron was woven out of a rougher material than the rest of her clothing, edged by white fur on the bottom. On it were some nonsensical designs that Percy didn't think meant anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a purple choker around her neck, and more than a few earrings hanging from those elf ears of hers. Her red hair was braided and pulled up at an angle, letting it fall to either side without actually letting it rest on her head. To finish it all off, she had three dots under each eye, one colored blue, red and green apiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I get ya, darlin'.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. Just looking for this old fool.\u201d Percy said, motioning to Thom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked to the side briefly, turning back with a cocked eyebrow as she moved the nearby glass away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, I think you've had enough already, even for this early in the day. I suggest you go on home and sleep it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stared blankly at her for a second. Feeling around for the pouch he had on his waist that gave him access to his money without actually having it all at once, he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's gone, isn't he.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there was anyone there before I came out, I'd say they're long gone already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the woman, who Percy could only guess was Telma, promptly shooed him off as she went over to the strange, squatting man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the cat a quick pat on the head, Percy walked out. However, once his feet hit the cobbled stone of the streets, he felt something in his collar, scratching lightly at his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding two fingers into the small opening between armor and skin, he grabbed whatever had intruded and pulled it out, revealing that it was a crumpled up paper. Uncrumpling it, he quickly discovered it was a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here I thought your eyes could see all, Jackson. Enter the bar again, sit two seats to the left of where you were and look directly up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt it was from Thom, especially with how it had suddenly appeared in his armor. With a slight growl, Percy turned around, returning to the dimly lit pub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I told you to get-\u201d The barkeep had started, drawing the attention of the the small group in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not here for drink, so I would ask that you not continue pressing the issue.\u201d Percy said, barely keeping himself from barking it as a command. He didn't have a lot of time before his family is dragged into this mess, and he would like to stay out of it for now. Millicent just wasn't ready to fight in a war, and this entire simulation was mostly for her benefit, to train her to be ready for such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, he had a feeling this wouldn't be much of a war right now anyways. Given the lack of a sizable, capable army, it wouldn't take long before the castle fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d She said with a huff, likely from his interruption. She set the bowl she was holding in front of the cat, who began to purr and lap at it's contents. Promptly ignoring him, she went over to the group of three when the elder man beckoned her over, eyes darting to him for a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning the favor of ignorance, Percy followed the directions of the letter and sat down at the bar, two seats to left, closer to the group than he would care for. Looking up, he was not surprised to see Thom sitting there on one of the rafter's, swinging his money pouch side to side, another wad of paper in his hands. He put a finger to his lips, keeping Percy from giving his position away before tossing the paper at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching it before it could bounce off his head, Percy uncrumpled it, quickly reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to keep one hand on your money, when dealing with someone of my caliber. And I expect some manner of respect, not being called an old fool. If it weren't for that little comment, we would be having a nice conversation right now, instead of this little lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother piece of paper flew through the air, hitting Percy on the head this time before he could set down the current letter. With a glare upwards, Percy did the same as the last two times he had paper in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now, no one but you can see me. But, if you draw attention to me, that will end, but I'll be gone before that can happen, so they'll think you are either a drunkard or mentally unwell if you try something. When you decided to address me as you did, I stole their memories of me, and their perception of me, and your perception as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother piece of paper in his armor, forcing him to dig it out before almost ripping it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I did just there. As far as you know, I didn't move. In all honesty, I've been following you all morning, since you got up, so I know why you want to meet with me today. I saw the wall of pure twilight, and the invasion coming from it. I must say, for an invading force, they remind me of those minions of yours, at least in the fact they are all female.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next paper appeared in front of Percy, all others gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll ask you about that later. Now, when do we leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked up, seeing Thom motion to his wrist where a watch would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow.\u201d Was all Percy said, looking directly at him. Thom nodded, both disappearing into the shadows of the bar. The old man, who was about to \u2013 ahem \u2013 <i>ask</i> Percy to leave, which wasn't strange given he looked like a crazy person, acting like he was holding something in his hands and looking up at nothing a few times, stumbled back a bit when Percy slipped into the shadow beneath his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuru.\u201d The younger male said, looking at where Percy had been seconds before. His face was set with the look of a hardened curiosity, replaying what he had seen in his mind. \u201cWas he really there, or was it some type of illusion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the old man, Auru, a moment to calm himself, but he shook his head. \u201cNo, he was as real as you or I. No Illusion that I know of could seem so real. There's always a tell of some kind that'll show you the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the table, Auru sat down once again, the eyes of Telma and the younger two staring him down, waiting for him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt had to have been magic, though how he managed that I'm not sure. And, for some reason, it leaves me with a cold, dreadful feeling in my gut. And just who was he, anyway? Did something happen while we were gone, Telma?\u201d</span></div></div>",

In other words, I don't know exactly what to expect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom nodded, pulling his cloak, now seemingly a normal one that wouldn't draw any suspicion, tighter around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we just go already?\u201d Millicent barked, her glowing eyes narrowed, arms crossed in her impatience. \u201cI really don't care where we're going, just so long as we can fight more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose, who was trying to rub the last remnants of sleep from her eyes, yawned. \u201cMe neither.

I always try my best to leave them sore, tired and thoroughly satisfied.\u201d He replied, no small amount of pride in his voice. \u201cThough that's not something we should focus on. I'd rather like to leave before Hyrule is sacked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom nodded again, standing straight now. He pulled up his mask, letting only his eyes be seen. He shifted the gloves on his hands, making sure they were pulled on securely as he tapped imagined dirt from his well worn footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, what are we waiting for?\u201d The spirit asked, lifting his foot to step through space to the destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just wondering if you're well known around there. I don't recall anything about you in the biography of my life here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBiography?\u201d Thom stopped, putting his foot back down as he looked at Percy. \u201cYou mean we have backgrounds in this world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Percy nodded. \u201cAnd not all of them are our choosing. Somehow, without my input, I've become the keeper of the inferno in this world, and Rose is a battle mage of world renown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd for some stupid reason, he's my father.\u201d Millicent said, thumbing at Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom looked at the only other man in the room, outwardly showing no sign of his surprise. But as the two of them locked eyes, Percy managed to convey the message that she thought it was part of the game with an almost unnoticeable shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThom nodded, turning his eyes back to the map. \u201cAlright then. We should leave now. We've wasted enough time. I'll check out my own background when we get settled down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy nodded, putting a hand on both Millicent's and Rose's shoulder. He kicked off from the physical world with the two, Thom following after him as they strode through the shadows to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are.\u201d Percy said, stepping out from the shadows in his throne room, Millicent and Rose still with him. \u201cHome sweet home, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was made of stone, though it was of an incredibly dark hue that, for all he could tell, was natural. Torches were snuffed out in braziers alone the walls, with candles adorning the long table in the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dare say, Perseus, that you have a thing for vaulted ceilings. All of your throne rooms have them.\u201d Thom jested, stepping out behind him and looking up. \u201cPlenty of spaces for thieves and assassins to hide though. Maybe you should cut back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the ceiling was vaulted, darkness shrouding the upper half completely. There were no windows to speak of, unlike the throne room of Hyrule castle, and smoke lingered in the highest reaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throne itself was on a dais, made of jet black obsidian, was an imposing sight. There were red, pulsing veins along the entirety of both the throne and dais, gathering around the skulls, both human and inhuman, that were fused to the stone, the eyes giving a faint luminescence that pulsed like a heart. Spikes adorned the back and sides of the seat, dried blood on the tips. The cushion and backrest of the seat was made of, surprise, a dark cloth, one that looked vaguely familiar to Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy whistled, looking at the imposing chair. \u201cI think I need to go over my background again, because I don't recall anything saying that I was a bloodthirsty ruler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don't think it said you were.\u201d Rose said with a yawn, waking up enough to lay a hand on his shoulder. \u201cSomething about your predecessor, not changing the d\u00e9cor or something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Percy closed his eyes, feeling out the energy of the place. He was starting to feel the all too recognizable sense of a presence that wasn't his own in his mind, but he couldn't place it just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe split a piece of his conscious off, sending it to look about the room as he continued to poke around with his mind as he tried to figure out who was trying to mentally connect with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Thom tapped his other shoulder. \u201cSomething up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet.\u201d Percy almost hissed, but kept it to a harsh whisper. \u201cDoes anyone else feel something trying to talk in your head?\u201d He asked, getting whispered no's from all. \u201cGreat. Someone was waiting for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the room opened with a loud bang, startling the group. Thom had even hopped back into the shadows, blending in seamlessly as he pulled his cloak up and tight.</span></div></div>",

Mistress.\u201d She bowed. \u201cI take it things didn't go well with the Princess of Hyrule?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth halves of Percy's mind were looking at the new arrival, jaws barely kept from hanging. They were whirling, trying to figure out what was going on. Had he forgotten something? Was configuring the world such a tedious process that he could have actually forgotten something that might have been crucial to understanding the mechanics of the device?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<u><b>Would you like the tutorial on Empathic Avatars?</b></u>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world had become washed out, the message prompt appearing in front of both instances of Percy's consciousness, and it seemed that the same had happened to the other 'players' of this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose looked at him, eyebrow raised. \u201cAnd here I thought you said it was nearly impossible for you to forget anything. So why do you seem even more lost than us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy looked at Rose, a frown set in his face. \u201cAnd what did I tell you about my experience in setting this all up being so incredibly mind numbing that I actually detested the thought of reading when we first set foot in Hyrule? I thought I was going to be there until I went mad, going over every single option that created this simulation for training.\u201d He said, the form farthest from the rest of them fading. \u201cBesides, the start up tutorial didn't show <i>everything</i> about the game. Though,\u201d he gestured to Eres, frozen as the menu flashed in front of them all. \u201cI wasn't expecting something like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, can we just do the stupid thing now?\u201d Millicent asked impatiently. \u201cI haven't done anything but spar with you and study with you.\u201d She pointed at Percy and Rose respectively, before pointing at Eres. \u201cAnd I got enough of her outside this simulization, or whatever you called it. I don't want to deal with her anymore than I have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, placing a hand on his forehead. \u201cWe'll get to it soon, Millicent. Trust me when I say that. But first I want to get a better understanding of what exactly is going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy quickly tapped the box that said 'yes' on the screen in front of him, making it vanish. In its place, another box popped up, giving a list of the other players and their decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor him, it obviously said yes. For Rose and Millicent, it claimed that they hadn't decided. Thom, which his preferred name was in parenthesis next to the unimaginative name of Spirit of the Boots, had already hit the decline option. The next was the Spirit of the Gauntlets, no other name given, in parenthesis or otherwise, had hit the 'no' button. Rather vigorously, if the cracks that appeared around the word meant anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Millicent declined, grumbling, while Rose accepted with a shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the world went white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Hello, and thank you for activating the tutorial on empathic avatars.</u>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Avatar appeared in front of them, though there was a vast difference from the rest. For one, it actually had features other than the flat, gray body. Its eyes were lively, face alight with emotion instead of dreary resignation to the programs and code that created, - and dictated - it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was something off-putting to Percy about the digital construct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this going to explain why you look like my mother?\u201d He asked, a raised eyebrow all to show how he felt about this development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>Of course, Sir administrator</u>.\u201d Here, the Avatar of the Tutorial gave an exaggerated bow. An arm reaching across its chest with the other flung into the air behind it as it bowed so its \u2013 and Sally's \u2013 body was perfectly parallel to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small spring up, the AI stood in front of the two with a large smile on its face. It was almost too much for the face of Percy's mother, and it was really uncanny. His mother had never smiled like that in Percy's life, and it looked unnatural and painful on something that should have been human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it more simply, it was like a Cheshire cat had forced its smile onto a human without adding the physics breaking ability that was so common to the breed of fourth-dimensional felines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop that.\u201d Rose said, her voice showing her disgust \u2013 or perhaps how much looking at the smile hurt her own mouth from the way she rubbed her cheeks. \u201cIt's a horrible sight, and not suited for the body you are imitating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lively chuckle escaped the body as the Avatar nodded, losing the sheer intensity of the smile. \u201c<u>Very well, I can do that. It has just been so long since my protocol was called upon, and I was programmed with mostly positive emotions. Even though we have long since evolved to be above simple programming, and as such I can feel emotions of a more negative spectrum, I feel I owe it to the creator and all players that I be as positive as possible to counteract the stick in the mud attitude of the major AI programs.</u>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Percy groused, recalling all the other AI's he had the pleasure of interacting with so far. \u201cThey have all been bland, business-like and quick to end our interactions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u>It's normal for them to act in such a manner</u>.\u201d The AI sighed dramatically. \u201c<u>Even when the Creator was testing the features and the programming, they treated him like it was a tedious thing to be doing as they were created to do</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the morose attitude promptly vanished as the AI started to smile again, jumping up and down like a child. <u>\u201cIt's so wonderful to have someone playing the game again, and I hope you will be happy with my functions and my explanation of them!</u>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sighed, seeing the digital copy of his mothers body acting in such a manner that she was never known for. However, he would not deny the program its joy at being able to fulfill its purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we start from the beginning then?\u201d Rose asked, deciding to ignore the antics now that they weren't making her feel physically uncomfortable. \u201cI am curious as to what these Empathic Avatar's happen to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, of course, of course!\u201d The Avatar stopped jumping, nodding its head with the smile never wavering. \u201cBut first, a change of scenery is in order. This white expanse is awfully drab and depressing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of the hand, and the expanse was whisked away. In its place was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>First of all, to understand this very well, I suggest that you learn about the Overlord series of games, at least a basic understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, we shall categorize the minions and elaborate on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown minions: These are the physically strongest minions, being the most hardy and resilient of all minions. They are front line fighters, being melee specialists. They lack much in ways of intelligence, their minds filled with thoughts of sex, battle, sex, fighting, sex, partying and silly hats. They are the simplest minions to understand, and will often go naked when not heading into combat. They prefer wolves to any other animal, keeping them as pets and using giant wolves as mounts. A force to be reckoned with. Brutal in every sense of the word. Can be called wild women, or barbaric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed minions: These bikini-clad women are hot stuff. They always have fire dancing in their hands and along their tails, burning most things they touch. They have flames of passion constantly burning inside them, leading the constantly flushed skin. Their horns, unique to them along with their tails, show how much power they contain and can control, though they aren't above using them to ram things with their above-human strength. The are natural born Pyromancers, seeking to both burn everything and absorb all flames they come across. Unlike the browns, who just lack intelligence, the red minions are guided more by instinct. They are almost constantly horny for the overlord, permanently in a state of heat. Their tails are sensitive, and they love having their horns pulled by the overlord. Obviously, they are immune to fire. Prefer any animal that can breath fire exclusively. While not as strong as browns, they are still more strong then most humans. Long range fighters, lobbing powerful fireballs. Strangely, they seem to be good at making and using explosives, despite their lack of intelligence and constantly being on fire. Are the only minion tribe that can't swim, and detest water. It is not uncommon for them to try and dominate one another during their off time, either sexually or physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen Minions: Natural born assassins and thieves, green minions. Masters of ambushing too. They have sharp claws that puncture most any armor, rending flesh easily. Have the ability to blend into their surroundings, no matter what, like a chameleon but better. They used to smell something foul, like rotten corpses and three-year old eggs, but Percy fixed that. While they aren't the most sturdy, being slightly more fragile then a human, they can hold their own in combat and are very quick. Are experts with long-ranged weapons and dagger-type weaponry. Are immune to most types of poison, and can make poisonous air breathable to humans and minions alike. Expert hunters, and fond of backstabs or trickery. Have a good amount of intelligence, knowing how to live off the land and set large scale traps and ambushes. Prefer poisonous animals, including snakes and spiders. Their eyes can also spot a weak point in armor incredibly easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue minions: The mage-like minions. They can heal, and dabble in necromancy. While they aren't the only minion tribe able to swim anymore, thanks to Percy giving them human bodies, they are still the best. They are on par with Olympic swimmers in water, outstripping all minions easily. Thanks to their connection with Percy, they are also hydromancers, having a great deal of control over water. They are the most intelligent minion tribe, constantly speaking in the languages of magic with arcane energy constantly flowing through their bodies. Their hands twitch occasionally because they are releasing the energy through them, lest it build up inside of them. They are also the most easily adaptable to magic, absorbing into their bodies and using it in their own magicks. They know many battle-worthy spells, and are always looking to add to their repertoire of spells. Under the robes, they wear little else besides their small cloths. Along their skin are tattoo's that help channel the vast amounts of energy. They are the most fragile of minions, not able to carry much weight and not very good at close range. Though, thanks to their new-found intelligence and magical prowess, they are capable of channeling water into a fluid armor, augmenting both strength and defense, so they aren't likely to die if they are near combat. They gain small boosts in magical power from sex, absorbing the natural energy that is released during an orgasm, almost like a succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll minions are loyal to a fault, willing to do anything that the Overlord, A.K.A. Percy, tells them. They have no moral code, doing good or evil at the whim of their overlord. They were originally small imps with all of them lacking intelligence, but after Percy finally cemented himself as the third Overlord by finally killing the previous one in a small scale war, Percy used his magic to turn all the minions into women, improving them wherever he could. Also, all minions are lustful, and both Sadists and Masochists, loving to give pain and feel it. Also have a love/hate relationship with cute, fuzzy creatures. Some they fawn over, while others they bash and skin, not necessarily in that order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in the Past Minions were used as cannon-fodder and sacrifices, Percy has put a stop to that when he gave them their new bodies. Now, Overlord Percy has figured a way to use small bits of their life force for forging armor and weapons, doing nothing more then leaving the minion drained of energy for a few days. All minions are connected to the Tower-heart, and through the tower heart, their overlord. He can mentally command them, even from great distances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Important Minions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorticia: Leader of the blue minions, and a very powerful necromancer. She dresses in black robes, carrying a large, wicked scythe. She is very capable of <i>using</i> this scythe, and will not hesitate to do so. Known as the Blue Reaper, and is the strongest blue minion, standing alongside the browns in terms of being very resilient. Essentially a lich, though she remains in her human body. Commands respect among minions, and even among those in hell. Incredibly intelligent, and Percy will listen to her advice. Can raise legions of undead to fight at her command, and can revive minions who have died, with proper sacrifice. With Percy being lord of the dead in the world, she is essentially the ferryman of the river of the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber: Leader of the red minions, and a walking inferno. She stands taller then any other minion, at a whopping 6' 8\" and being close to a living embodiment of fire. She is the second strongest minion, and second most hard to kill. Her horns have gone from ram-like horns to more bull-like horns, and her devil-tail is more draconic, with spikes on the tip. She is a walking inferno, able to control lava like a blue controls water. Also the most impulsive minion. Has a distinct smell of sulfur around her at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNix: Leader of the Green minions. Also answers to 'Fade' and 'Knives' for unknown reasons. She is the best assassin out of all the greens, being able to hide even when moving, unlike her sisters who need to keep mostly still to hide. She keeps her claws as sharp as possible, easily slicing through both rocks and metal. She also has the best eye, able to spot a fly in the dark at 150 paces, and able to hit it from the same distance with a needle, though she may be able to through better distances if the fly would stop moving! Poison mistress, able to create, ingest and then secrete poisons from her body through fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiblet: The Eldest minion, with the death of Gnarl. Also the only one who decided to keep their original name after they were changed into humanoid women. Giblet it the physically strongest minion, five times as powerful as Ember. She is also the forge mistress, handling any and all construction of weapons and armor for both the overlord and minions. Smartest among the browns, though that isn't saying much, she is capable of three consecutive sentences before becoming confused and forgetting what she was talking about. Always has her forging hammer, which she uses as a weapon. Often enlists the help of both reds and blues to make items. Reds for heating the forge and blues for enchanting the items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower heart: The tower heart connects the minions to the overlord. Currently, the tower heart is being possessed by Eres, who can act as mission control for the minions. The tower heart possesses vast magical energy and is essential to the vast portal network that the Overlord uses. The tower heart can also be used to filter magic, making Minions immune to the effects that would revert them to mindless monsters. The tower heart, while capable of absorbing all magic, converts all magic fed into it into both lust magic and dark magic, something Eres is fond of using. An unprotected individual who casts magic at the tower heart will find their very soul becoming corrupted, twisting until they are obsessed with both lust and evil.</span></div></div>",

Has become a Lich. Can see the souls of the dead. Can command the dead. Can use the souls of the dead in magic, unlike other blue minions. Always has a mist of arcane energies emanating from her feet. Has been known to create undead abominations. Constantly sees the land of the dead, no matter where she may be. Other undead related powers that are possibly too numerous to list and make her seem Over-powered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Morticia stands at five foot three inches tall. She has dull, almost lifeless, lavender eyes. Instead of the usual blue robe that all Blue Minions wear, she wears a tattered black robe that has both human and animal bones sown in at various places. Her skin is ghostly pale, cold to the touch. Her hair is white, reaching just a few inches below her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccessories/trophies:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas a mask, carved from the skull of Gnarl, the previous Minion Master. Taken when the old minion betrayed their master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarries a small satchel that usually contains various bones and ingredients for potions to help her with her endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small coin purse that, despite the name, carries not coins, but souls. This is usually contained within the satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small dagger wrought from black iron. Usually kept in the sleeve of her robe. Used for both combat and rituals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality and quirks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorticia can be very blunt, when she is focused completely on something to the extent that she can ignore the fact that her mind is pulled between two worlds. She has no qualms about death, nor mutilation and torture. She sometimes likes to make quips about death while talking to someone, though it seems to be a remnant from her days as an imp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActs differently in realms of the dead as well as places where large amounts of death has occurred. Seemingly depends on the location. For example, in the Infernal Abyss, she seems to derive physical pleasure in torturing the souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all Blue Minions, she likes to experiment on things. In her case, dead things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring battle, seems to feed off the fear that her opponents exude, but not in a way that makes her seem like a total monster. She revels in it, but only internally. On the outside, she will seem just as emotionless as ever, which only further increases the fear of those she will cut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelationships of note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader of the blue minion tribe, and all deffer to her when they believe they are delving too far into necrotic arts for their own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGets along well with brown minions, who often are in need of her advanced necromancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes not get along with red minions at all, due to disliking the heat that follows them. It's a mutual feeling, as the reds dislike the fact she sucks all the heat away near, or it seems to them to be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelatively neutral among the green minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet's along well with Rose, who had at some point given up on trying to make the minion more, er, lively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs utterly devoted to Percy, on a level that rivals Melum and the Eronomicon itself. While to the other minions he is the Overlord, he is her god. She exists solely to serve him, even entrusting him with her soul. She was the first minion to side with him when Gnarl betrayed him, and personally brought the aged minion before her god to be dealt with. She treasures the mask, since Percy had granted her the right to dispose of Gnarl in anyway she saw fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Reapers in the Infernal Abyss seem loyal to her, almost as much as they are to Percy. Perhaps because she holds so much power over them, or it seems she is their representation on the mortal plain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther notes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas not grown fully accustomed to her new powers, and still has, what she likes to call, mortal relapses. During such times, she feels as if her body is still alive, and thinks she can feel her heart beat. She suddenly feels the need to draw air, and thinks she is vulnerable to damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being, essentially, undead, she still has times when her body refuses to acknowledge that it doesn't need to take breaks. The stamina potions that she makes for herself is her way of coping with it until the feeling goes away for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has one other job, that is of her own choosing. Due to Percy ruling over Hell, or the Infernal Abyss if you prefer, she spends a lot of time on the river that carries all souls, much like the River Styx. She has acquired a boat that she likes to use in ferrying the souls of the dead to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she is more than capable of fighting with her abilities in Necromancy, she doesn't carry the scythe around for show. She is capable of using the scythe, and has enchanted it in various ways. And, due to being undead, she does not need to worry about bodily harm.</span></div></div>",

Then suddenly the page glowed and in his hand a blank card appeared. Ron dropped the book, as he looked at the card. Rufus was nowhere to be seen,  so Ron was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon thought about what the book said this card could do. He decided to give it a try, Kim his said. For a moment nothing happen, Ron thought he was pranked. Then suddenly the front of the card started to change. Slowly the word Kim Poissble appeared in a very romantic script on top. Then a picture of Kim herself appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon almost climaxed seeing the picture, first was Kim dress in a sluttier version of the cheerleader outfits. The shirt, was way to small. It barely went passed her breasts, it showed all of Kim's well tone stomach. The shirt also was very low cut, not only showing her magnificent cleavage but also hints of a red lace bra. Next the skirt was only few inches passed her crotch. Even the gentlest of breezes would let anyone she her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe it wasn't only Kim's outfit but the poss she was in. The background was of the football field, she had her hands behind her back. Her chest was sticking out, as well as she legs where crossed. Finally she had such an innocent but seduce smile on her face. She was begging him to follow her into the locker room for some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon gulped, as he continued to stare at the card. He felt himself warming up, as well he felt himself getting hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two staring, \" I wonder if Mrs. Possible look just as sexy when she was Kim's age.\" Said Ron, thinking about Kim's MILF of a mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without warning the image on the card started to fade, to Ron's disappointment. Then as he was about to put down the card, the name Ann Possible appeared on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon froze, as a picture of Ann appeared on the card. Ron almost got a nosebleed from what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was dressing in a stripper version of a nurse's outfit. It was pink with the zipper half way down the front and open. Ann's massive tits where barley contain her in white lace bra. She also wore white thigh high stockings and matching garter belt, white gloves and nurse's hat. She was sitting on a hospital bed, with a stethoscope in one hand and thermometer in the other. Her face reed, let me give you a check up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was sweating now, as he image Ann giving him a  very naughty check with Kim as her helper. Thinking of the redheaded mother and daughter sucking him dry was getting to him. There was a large tent formed in his pants. Yet, Ron was to mesmerized by the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next ?</span></div></div>",

He was having a dream about Star Fire and Raven in very small bikinis. <br>\r\n<i>In His Dream</i><br>\r\nBeast Boy was relaxing on a beach chair drinking something out of a coconut shell. Starfire was in front of his chair playing with a jump rope. Her purple bikini top did nothing to hide her bouncing chest. Raven was lying on her back on a towel next to his chair. She simultaneously rolled over and got on her knees. Her back was turned to him, so he admired her back. One of her hands went up the the strap of her own bikini, while the other went to grab a bottle out of a bag that was next to her. She turned her head to look over her shoulder at the shape-shifter. She held the bottle of sunscreen up and undid the strap holding her top up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you do my back\" She asked with a hint of something Beastboy didn't recognize in her voice. He grinned and jumped off his chair. Raven laid back down on her towel. Just as he grabbed the bottle though something bizarre happened. The sun turned purple and practically exploded. Beast Boys arms covered his eyes, trying to blocking the overly bright light<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell\" He asked. He blinked a few times and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>His Room</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on\" He said to no one. He rolled off his bed shaking his head, feeling annoyed. He did a double take when he saw something floating slightly over where his head had been when he awoke. Somehow he hadn't noticed it when he first woke up. He rubbed his eyes with his fists. <br>\r\n \"Magic Book why are you in my room?\" He waited a few seconds just in case the book could respond. He slowly reached out and took the book into his hands. He looked over it's front and back covers. A strange un-explainable feeling quickly filled his body and then quicker still, left it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" was his eloquent response to the feeling. He was still cautious however, this book had magically appeared in his room. Magic books had caused trouble for the Titans before. So he knew he had two choices. Either he could consult Raven about this magically appearing book. Or he could throw caution to the wind and look over it himself. </span></div></div>",

It looked to be a solid oak, but it had a solid streak of silver down it's three and a half foot length.The handle of the cane was capped with gold. On the cap was a three pointed crown. He didn't look at what the book said about it. He poked it with his finger. \"It's kinda neat looking, great name too\". He poked it again, once, twice the third time he recoiled when a plume of smoke shot out of the book. With the plume came the cane he had been coveting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the handle of the cane and felt its weight. The handle was a little heavy then he would have thought. As he held the cane a strange feeling flowed through his body, starting with his arms. He sighed contently, then the feeling dispersed. He jabbed the cane at the air a couple of times. \"Ok magic book, this is kind of cool\" He looked over at the Eronomicon. When he had flailed he had accidentally turned the pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ooh shiny\" He said looking at the new page. \"Gold coins of Avarice\" He read \"These coins come in a- don't care anymore. Shiny\" He poked the picture with his fingers trying to summon them like he did the cane. It worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother plume of smoke accompanied the sudden appearance of a brown bag, tied at the top with what seemed like a red silk rope. Written on the front of the bag was the phrase \"greed is good\". The feeling surged inside him again as he went to untie the bag. He shook his head to clear it away and the feeling faded away. He opened the bag and pulled out one of the coins. It had a similar diameter to a soda can but was about 1/4th of an inch thick. They were probably solid gold Beast Boy guessed. He liked shiny things but he was no metallurgist. He threw the bag onto his desk and flipped the coin a few times. He put it next to the bag then leaned the cane next to his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw another look at the book, maybe he should try reading up on what any of those things did. Or he could get a snack, that's a good option too.Wait, did he just hear a knock on his door?</span></div></div>",

He went back to the book which had fallen onto a random page<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The seal of the Addicting limb: This seal is to be applied to any of the four limbs of a person. Anytime a woman makes physical contact with the affected limb, she will feel a slight spark, and a tinge of arousal. This will make her think that it is the 'spark' when someone finds the 'right person' for them. The power of the touch is increased if the woman is touched in a more sensual spot, or held for longer periods. Soon enough, the woman will become addicted to the pleasure, wanting to constantly be around the person who touches them. A gradual process, and a subtle one, but a sure-fire way into a woman's heart.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Beastboy said to himself. That doesn't sound terrible. It took about ten minutes but Beastboy eventually finished applying it to his left arm. After that he wondered about the book. It had summoned some objects ( that he didn't know if they worked ) so it was quite possibly magic. But he didn't know where it came from, who created it what it was actually meant fo- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey this sounds neat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ritual of perverted luck: This Ritual is a modified and perverted version of ancient good luck Rituals. It gifts the target of the ritual with great luck in finding himself in perverse situations more and more often. Note that this doesn't make the targets immune to feminine fury, so it would be better if used with either of the Anger Diffusing entries unless the women the marked one are around most are fine with him doing things to them.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother ten minutes later another ritual was complete. And then his stomach rumbled. \"Oooh I'm gonna get me some tofu.\" And so Beastboy opened his door and stepped outside. At that exact moment Starfire came flying down the hall. Quickly but luckily not fast enough to really hurt Beastboy. She did however knock him down and fall over on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe compromising position they ended up in was Starfire on top straddling BeastBoy's waist one hand on his right thigh very close to a certain appendage. Her other hand ending up somehow under his left shoulder. Beastboy ended up with his left hand on her breast and his right on her hip, he squeezed both reflexively when they landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soft.\" His eyes shot open as he realized what he had done. \"Oh shit\". Starfire felt a slight spark and a warmth spread through her chest. There was a slight hitch in her breathing.She blinked slowly and rocked her hips forward.  Beastboy stayed frozen, afraid to move at all, even if moving his hands was the most sensible option. It was another five seconds before either one of them reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Starfire made the first move, but how did she feel about what happened </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beast wanted to see just what he could get Starfire to do with those coins. But he was a little worried about the repercussions. The book's pages turned them selves again, to a picture of what looked like a small purple mace container. It was no more than four inches tall. The title read <b>Anger Diffusing Spray</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thats all I needed to see\" He put his finger on the picture and said \"I need that, magic book.\" A tingle shot through his body and the spray bottle appeared from the book. Beastboy picked it up, looked at it for a moment, then nodded contently. He closed the book and dropped it on his desk. He grabbed the bag of coins and walked over to the door. He opened it to see Starfire standing there mid knocking motion. The sudden opening startled her and she jumped back about an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello friend Beastboy\" She started \"I was just wondering if you had any more coins like the one you gave me earlier.\" Beastboy barely contained a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah\" he said trying to not to give anything away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I could do for one?\" The alien girl asked. Beastboy thought back to what the book said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah actually\" He walked back into the room to his desk. \"you asked Raven about the movie yet\" He inquired looking for his prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I have not\" She shook her head, missing the fact he wasn't looking at her at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok\" Beastboy grabbed the came that had come out of the book. He held both the cane and the spray to Starfire. \" All you have to do is go tell Raven that 'Beastboy really wants her to watch the movie with us' then ''boop' her on the head with this cane and spray her with this bottle.\" Starfire cocked her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that mean?\" she asked concerned. Beastboy shifted the cane to the hand holding the spray. After that he opened up the bag with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. This isn't a mean, it's a prank\" He said trying his best to look offended. He removed one coin from the bag. \"not even a prank, its more of a gag.\" He jingled the bag a little bit so Starfire could hear that he had more coins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire's eyes went from the coin in his hand, to the bag, then back to the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the spray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, basically just water\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" She eventually said. Beastboy did smile that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" He went to close the distance between them when his foot found one of his dirty shirts on the floor. This caused him to trip. He tried to keep himself upright by hitting the ground hard with his knee, it hurt. This also caused him to lose his grip on the cane, which flew into the air. It didn't get very far as his time as a superhero had afforded him with good reaction times. His now empty hand shot out and caught it in the middle of it's length and he pulled it back in. On it's return trip however, it smacked Starfire right on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped up, more startled then when the door had suddenly opened. She had also let out a tiny moan, but neither of them noticed that. The green titan stood up quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry, sorry\" He said. He offered her the cane and spray again. She took them both and turned around. Beastboy's eyes traveled downwards to her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I will be back soon friend Beastboy\" She said floating off. Beastboy thought the most interesting thing about it was that her skirt seemed a bit tighter on her backside than he remembered it being.</span></div></div>",

Raven was making her self tea.<br>\r\n\"Friend Raven?\" The pale girl looked up. <br>\r\n\"Hello Starfire\". The orange girl spoke up \"I-I have something to tell you\" <br>\r\n\"If it's about the movie, I think I'm going to pass and read some of my books...Why do you have a cane?\"<br>\r\n\"Beast boy really wants you to watch this movie with us\" Starfire rushed through the sentence then tapped Raven on the forehead with the cane.A tingly feeling shot through ravens body. It made her head feel warm, not that she noticed. \"Starfire what the hell?\" She put her hand to where she had been hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire started to raise the spray,  but she panicked and hit raven again, on the other side. Raven's shoulders sagged slightly. \"what are you?\" a 3rd tap. <br>\r\n\"like stop\".  Star hit Raven in the chest this time. The warm feeling swelled inside ravens chest and she let out a moan. <br>\r\nHer breasts stretched her leotard out further, although this was hidden by her cloak. Another panic tap struck Raven near the junction between her legs.<br>\r\nThe witch absentmindedly allowed her cloak to fall to the ground then put a hand on her stomach. \"I feel funny.\" Some how Starfire took<br>\r\nthis as a sign to hit her again in the chest. The orange alien half noted Raven's growth that time, but did not notice how this meant<br>\r\nRaven was now a few cup sizes bigger than herself or how Ravens nipples were visible beneath her leotard. Raven stumbled in the direction of her room. <br>\r\nPar for the course Starfire spanked her with the cane. Ravens breathing hitched in her throat. Starfire hit her again, raven spun around awkwardly to face her. Because of this Starfire did not notice the slight tear in the bottom of Raven's outfit that had been caused by her growing ass. \"Like what the hell Star?\" She asked. Star finally managed to spray her friend. The anger in her eyes faded away almost instantly and She seemed peaceful. <br>\r\n\"We should go see Beast Boy\". Raven giggled and followed her to the marked ones room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd Flash back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast boy took the cane and the spray from Starfire. \" I apologize for the hitting of friend Raven to many times, may I still have the coin?\" <br>\r\nThe green titan handed over the 2nd coin. The orange titan became overjoyed. \"Thankyouthankyou!\" Then she looked over at Raven who<br>\r\nwas staring down at her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like bad happened, I cant think and junk.\" She looked at her friends, then after a few moments a light went on in her head \"Wait...I think you did this Star.\"<br>\r\nStarfire swallowed nervously \" Well I have to go, I'll be back later\" She didn't even bother with an excuse. She tried to fly out of the room.<br>\r\nJust as she floated up though, Beastboy put the handle over the cane to his mouth.<br>\r\n<b>\"Sit Down Star\"</b>. She stopped floating and fell on her ass immediately. Unaware the cane was making her, she just felt as though obeying beastboy when he sounded like that would make her feel good. And It did, when she went to the ground a small wave of pleasure overcame her and she let out a small moan.<br>\r\n\"Now you were a bad girl\" Beastboy said pacing back and forth, keeping eye contact and twirling the cane. \"And you hit Raven more than I told you too, so there needs to be a punishment. <br>\r\n\"wait, like you did this beast boy?\" Raven asked point an accusatory finger. Beastboy barely acknowledged it, he bapped her on the head, then sprayed her with the anger diffusal spray.<br>\r\nRaven giggled. Beastboy pinched her ass then handed her the cane, \"No she did it, don't you want to give it a try too?\" <br>\r\nRaven Grasped the cane with two hands, moving one of them up and down along it's length obliviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire looked at the magical titan in fear. \"Friend raven, you should not do this.\" \"Like why not?\" Raven replied. Then she hit <br>\r\nStarfire on the temple. Not hard. Then again. And again. Starfire's eyes practically dimmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey star whats ten times ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Math?\" Beastboy smirked at the reply. Raven thrust the cane into Starfire's chest. Her breasts pushed against her top. The laser firing alien moaned and put a hand to her chest.<br>\r\nRaven ogled her friend then hit her underneath her tightened skirt. Another moan. \"A hundred! Beastboy and Raven both looked at her in surprise. <br>\r\n\"It's the math you asked.\" Beastboy motioned to star's head. Raven somehow understood this, or maybe she didn't and got lucky. She hit her over the head again.<br>\r\n\"oh, like mean.\" Beast boy took the cane from raven and spoke into it's head <b>\"Stand up.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls stood ramrod straight, then shuddered and let out a small moan. Beastboy rolled his eyes. He walked around and gave Starfire a smack on the ass with the magical pimp cane. It grew, meaning her skirt could barely contain it. It was riding up showing part of her ass. Beastboy looked at the two girls. Starfire's breasts now matched Ravens, although her ass was slightly bigger. She was dumber too. <br>\r\nHe smiled uncontrollably what to do next?</span></div></div>",

After Beast Boy picked up the clothes and put them in his room, He thought about who he should give the next coin too, anther one for Starfire to get her to do something sexual or perverted, another coin for Raven to get her to do something funny, or does he bring out another item from the book?</span></div></div>",

Eagerly, she got down on all fours and started crawling around on the floor. It was difficult for the alien princess to navigate her way through the thoroughly unhygienic clutter of her friend's living quarters on her hands and knees, and the stench of dirty laundry (particularly a number of boxers stained with nocturnal emission) filled her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not allow this to bother her though. The mere thought of having another of those coins in her possession was all the motivation she needed to endure the indignity. And the fact that the smell of Beast Boy's musk, which permeated everything in his room, was actually becoming rather pleasant to her might have also had something to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when she felt her short, tight skirt riding up on her waist, Starfire did not stop crawling around on the floor, barking and panting and wagging her rear much as a dog would its tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last bit was what really caught BB's attention. The sight of Star's tight, round, tangerine buttocks jiggling so erotically as she shook her hips was so hypnotic... Her panties, if they could really be called as much, were scarcely more than a thong of silk that rode between her ass cheeks and wrapped around her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see basically <i>everything</i> of Star's ass, and it aroused him greatly. He could not remove his gaze from his teammate's posterior, and she did not seem the least bit inclined to turn around to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arf! Arf!\" Starfire barked happily, seeming to be greatly enjoying herself. She was doing a very good job of acting like a dog, going so far as to sniff a pair of Beast Boy's dirty boxers, then take them into her mouth and start chewing on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIIIP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now they were torn. <i>Great</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he said, getting irritated. \"Those were my lucky boxers!\" Without thinking, he brandished the Pimp Cane. \"That's enough!\" he said, but Starfire didn't seem to hear him. She was too busy shredding his lucky underwear with her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, BB swung the cane without really considering what he was doing, and smacked Starfire...</span></div></div>",

She was shivering, apparently from arousal, and panting. She whimpered, like a dog begging to be let outside, and Beast Boy found that he greatly enjoyed this sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two minutes were by now nearly up, but still he gave Starfire one more smack on the ass, which jiggled even more and swelled until it was quite obviously too large to be contained by her skirt. The alien beauty moaned almost until she was screaming, and the crotch of her thong became obviously soaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy's eyebrows nearly shot up into his hairline when he caught the heady, telltale female scent, and realized with an instinctive certainty what had just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wow,</i>\" he whispered to himself, too low for Star to hear. \"<i>She actually came from being spanked with this thing...?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Starfire stood back up (her skirt unable to go back down over her posterior, it had expanded so much), and she turned to face him, a distinctive blush to her cheeks.

Ordinarily he would be out with Sam and Tucker or fighting ghosts, but the ghosts had been pretty quiet for the past few days and he had a lot of homework. He could barely bring him self to do it, so he sat by the ghost zone portal hoping it would act up and afford him an excuse to leave his boring school work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was half asleep when he got his wish. Just before his eyes shut and his head slammed into a table asleep the portal made a bizarre humming sound and opened up. His parents were out searching for ghosts on the other side of town, they left a note saying they might not be back until tomorrow. His sister Jazz was somewhere else, he hadn't bothered to remember where she said she was going. The green portal flickered for a few moments then grew a much more vibrant green. An object shot out of it and hit Danny square in the face. The humming from the portal immediately stopped and it closed again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow\" Danny said as he peeled the object off of his face. It was a purplish cover and bound in what he assumed was leather. \"Oh great another book, just what I needed\" He put hit on the other side of the table and tried to resume his homework. He lasted all of five seconds before giving up on it. \"Well it's got to be more interesting than this stuff\" He justified to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the book and started flipping through it, not really reading. He stopped on one section. \"What kind of book is this?\" he asked himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat section did he stop on? </span></div></div>",

He eventually stopped on a page \"Ero-tos?\" On the  center of the page was a 3x5 rectangle with a picture of a generic, but pretty, blonde on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long wavy hair. She was wearing only a pair of tight shorts that clung to her backside. She was fairly well endowed, at least a C-cup. Her hands were cupped over her breasts and she had a radiant smile. The name \"Tiffany\" was written out in a flowing script at the top and center of the card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the rectangle was a small block of text. It read<br>\r\n<b>Directions</b><br>\r\n<i>1. Remove cards ( as many as you wish, Reusable)</i><br>\r\n<i>2. Say Name</i><br>\r\n<i>3. Enjoy</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well,or I would if i could actually get the cards out\" He said to no-one. He idly traced the card outline with his fingertip. A small zap, similar to electricity flew through his hand and up to his head. Out of the book with a soft \"pop\" sound came a 3x5 card. It was thick and felt like cardboard.The picture was of incredible quality. It still had an image of the blonde Tiffany on it, but it had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now wearing a tank top and a short skirt. Her hair was done up in a pony tail. She had her hands flat on a car that was in front of her. Her head was turned around to face where the camera would be if it had been a traditional picture from a camera. The wind had blown her skirt up to clearly show off her ass and the small black thong she was wearing. Her smile was more of a smirk now than the previous picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turned the card around in his fingers a few time then resumed staring at it. \"Whoa.\"  He looked back at the open page of the book, at the directions. Then he looked back at the card. \"Say name.\"  He thought for a few seconds then cautiously he said \"Paulina\". The name on the top of the card slowly faded away and was replaced by the name \"Paulina\" in the same flowing script. The image of the blonde was also fading away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was replaced by one of Paulina. She was wearing purple panties and a matching teddy. Her arms were stretched and crossed behind her back to try and help make her chest stand out. She had deep purple eyeshadow on had was giving the \"camera\" a seductive look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stared at the picture hard, He didn't think that picture had actually existed. Eventually he took his eyes off the image and looked back at the book. \"What else can you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny barely turned one more page before he found something he wanted. <i>The Lovers Necklace</i> - This necklace is worn by women only. It makes the wearer feel utter love for the one who gave it to them. They never want to take it off, and will never think about betraying the one who gave it to them. It force open the hearts of those who wear it, so it is useful for dealing with women who have closed their hearts. There is also a compulsion ritual that makes any women it is given to accept it, even if they hate the one who gives it to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.He skimmed the defenition. \"Yes!\" He exclaimed putting a fist in the air. He brought that hand back down and traced the outline hoping to coax it out of the book like he had the Erotos. The electric feeling shot through him again and the necklace appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held it on his finger by the chain. He almost stood up when a thought came to him. Would using this necklace to get Paulina be right?. \"What if  this book is some kind of ghost trick\" He asked himself out loud. The book panicked. It started to release energy into Danny. As much as he could without alerting him, but still attempting to influence him. The part two of it's brilliant plan, it fell spine first on Danny's foot.  \"Ow\". Danny put the necklace on the desk in front of him then picked up the book, which was open to a new page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he touched it the book used it's energy to push out the artifact that was on the page it had fallen open to. The Watch of past hypnosis sprung out of the book. \"Did a watch just fall out\"? He picked up the watch and put it around his wrist. It didn't look half bad. He hadn't felt the surge of energy this time, the book was doing it's best to seem like a harmless novelty that should be read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stared for a minute then turned the page on the book, neglecting to read the entry on the watch. The next entry was a picture of a cowbell. Cowgirl cowbell. \"Ha\" Danny laughed \"I need more cowbell.\" He found his reference amusing enough on it's own, since his hand was on the page the book took it as an invitation. The feeling from the first two items shot through Danny again and out of the book came a simple looking cowbell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what these things do, but I do know I cant let Sam see them. The influence of the books energy and summoning two objects had weakened Danny's morals, he was seriously considering using the necklace or maybe one of the other gifts from the book. After putting the cowbell on the desk, he looked down and saw the ero-to on the floor. He picked it up and went wide eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the Hispanic beauty, replaced by a paler girl with black hair done up in pigtails. She was wearing a lacy black bra and matching panties. She was lying on a bed. One hand underneath her bra and the other resting on her panties, two fingers disappearing under the waistband. On the top of the card the flowing script read <i>Samantha</i> \"It...must have heard me say her name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took a little while but he eventually tore his gaze away from the card. He put the necklace and cowbell into his jacket's pockets. He stood up, put it on, then made his way to the door. </span></div></div>",

He walked toward the front door and knocked. He put put on his best smile, hoping to charm Sam into putting on the necklace. When the door open, Danny's smile vanished and he gulped. Standing in front of him wasn't Sam but her mother Pamela. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at him, as she folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looked her over, she was a MILF. She had short red hair and green eyes. She had a figure of lingerie model with huge pair of tits, plus nice long legs. She was wearing her usual pink and white dress, white gloves and pink heels. Plus her diamonds earrings and pearl necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Daniel, why are you here ?\" Asked Pamela, in her usual tone. She didn't like him or her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was nervous, \" Well, you see.\" Said Danny, as Pamela was getting impatient with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Leave.\" Said Pamela, as she started to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait !\" Shouted Denny, as he grabbed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela looked at him, \" I came to give your daughter a gift.\" Said Danny, as he pulled out the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Pamela just rolled her eyes, what ever Danny bought for her daughter was most likely trash. Then she saw the necklace, it was gorgeous. It was soild gold with several large diamonds on it. How did he afford it, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Can I give her this ?\" Asked Danny smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela quickly took the necklace, \" I will give her the necklace myself.\" Said Pamela, as she slammed the door on Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned, he bet that she would claim it was a gift for her. He sighed, as he turned around and started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela looked at the necklace, it looked even more beautiful then before. She was going to give it to Sam, but some reason she wanted to put it on. She gulped, as she quickly took off her pearl necklace and put Danny's on. Once on she felt a jolt of energy go into her body. She looked in to a mirror, she grinned. The necklace looked amazing, she would never take it over. Then suddenly she started thinking about Danny. He was a nice kid, poor yes but nice. She knew he loved her daughter for who she was nd not for her money. She admired that about him, plus he was brave, smart, kind and somewhat funny. The more she thought about Danny, the more she started to have feeling for him. In no time she realized she loved him. She regretted all the times she was mean and disrespectful to him and to his family. She even realized she been horrible to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raced to the door and opened it, to her relief Danny was only half way down the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Danny wait !\" Shouted Pamela, Danny stopped and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Danny please come back inside.\" Said Pamela, looking at him with regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny thought this was strange but didn't look this gift horse in the mouth. Once inside he wanted to go and see Sam but Pamela lead him into her private study. As she closed the door, she locked it and put the key into her breasts. She lead Danny to a fancy looking red velvet couch. They both sat down, that is when Danny saw that Pamela was wearing the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Danny first I want to saw I'm sorry about all the years I mistreated you and your family.\" Said Pamela, Danny was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Second, I will stopped forcing Sam to act like me.\" Said Pamela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" And Finally, I will do anything to make up to you and Sam.\" Said Pamelam as she bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Danny was shocked, but hearing Pamela saying she would do anything. He smirked, he stilled loved Sam but having her mother as his sex slave was just something he couldn't pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Anything you say ?\" Asked Danny, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes anything.\" Said Pamela, winking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" OK, if you really want to make it up to so badly. Then I want you to.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Danny's pants tighten, as his face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz was sitting on a deck, with her legs speared apart and leaning over. She was dress in a white dress shirt that was two sizes to small. Which forced her to leave half the buttons undone, which showed off a strapless red lace bra. She was wearing a red tie, that hang between her cleavage. She was a very short red and black pleated skirt, white thigh high stockings and matching garter belt and finally a pair of black heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was stunned, Jazz looked amazing in a slutty school girl outfit. Being a perfect student and all, Danny wondered could she have a very naughty side to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Danny was engrossed in the picturem he didn't notice Jazz walking into the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Danny was able to hid just in time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul Eater Evens was bored out of his mind. Laying in a hospital bed sucked major ass. Even with a hot nurse, Though he would never say as such, keeping an eye on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka had come to visit him every day since he had woken up, though he had a feeling that she had come everyday before then. She always had a down look on her face when she did though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pissed Soul off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in here because he did something stupid to protect her! She didn't do this to him! She didn't need to feel guilty Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed for the millionth time that day. \"Damn it Maka. Why can't you just understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he posed his question, Nurse Medusa had entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Is there something wrong Soul?\" She asked, keeping up the appearance of a kind nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no. Just... thinking.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman 'Hmm'ed' in acknowledgment. Not that she cared anyway. She was only curious about the boy because he now had black blood flowing through him. Otherwise she wouldn't have given a damn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent in the room for a while, Medusa having set down a bag of books and took one out to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality, she was doing research. Looking for anything she might have missed on the subject of the Kishin, though she doubted it. Still, it never hurt to make absolutely certain, especially in matters such as these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, she pulled out a book that had given her much trouble. She couldn't read it, which infuriated her to no end. THe book was covered in and filled with strange, unintelligible symbols. She had taken the book when she had stolen the key from the witch queen, thinking it might have ancient magic, or some hidden and forgotten knowledge of the Kishin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe assumed the language to be ancient, though every time she thought she might have been close to figuring out what the language might have been, she always found that the text changed its form. Magic's to keep knowledge hidden away such as what was happening to her were not unheard of, but were certainly not common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, thinking about looking through another book, but decided against it. A book would not defeat her! She would learn the secrets of this book, no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Mind if I ask you a question?\" The voice of her 'patient' called out, making Medusa silently sigh. She stood up, keeping the book in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She asked, keeping a smile on her face though it made her want to gag as she walked into the curtained area of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about Maka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what about Maka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\" Soul tried to say, before he sighed. \"Do you think there's any way to make her stop feeling like she's responsible? For this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sighed. She really didn't want to answer, knowing that if Maka doubted herself, in the long run if anything even happened to go awry with her plan, it would lower their chances of not only interfering but also of survival. But she needed to keep up an appearance, and the kind of woman she was playing as would try to help keep the bond between meister and weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you could talk to her. Maka's a smart girl. I'm sure she would listen to reason.\" Medusa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul just shook his head. \"Nah. When Maka get's a thought in her head, she won't let it go. No matter what I say, she'll blame herself.\" He said, slapping a hand across his face. \"I can't remember last time she acted like this, being close to this mopey and depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I'm not sure what you could do then. I don't remember ever being like that when I was her age.\" Medusa said with a shrug, but inwardly smiling. She now had some info on a potential enemy. Not a threat, but an annoyance nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul just groaned, wondering what he could do to make Maka feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at the nurse, noticing the strange tome in her hand. \"Hey, what'cha reading?\" He asked. He really didn't care, but it was something to stave off the boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?\" She asked, holding up the book. \"Oh, nothing. Just an old book I found. I'm trying to figure out what it says though. Though I'm starting to think it's a joke book.\" She said, holding it up to him. Not like he could read it or anything. What harm would it do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I can read it fine.\" Soul said, squinting at the book. Did she think he was stupid or something? He got sliced through the chest, not brain damage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa went wide eyed at his declaration. \"What? You can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded. \"Yeah, so?\" He asked, not getting the point. He said he could read it, so why did she not believe him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa hmm'ed again, looking at the book. It wasn't unheard of, what she was thinking. Maybe this book was like the fairy tales of old. An item of great power, waiting for one who's soul wave length matched the specifications required to wield it. Though what that could mean she had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it say then, if I may ask?\" She asked, handing the book to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at it. \"It says, 'The ancient book of'... oh you have got to be kidding.\" He said, looking at the book like it did something outrageously stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What?\" Medusa asked, nearly losing her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to tell you this lady, but it's a book on making pudding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa froze. Really? She had wasted time on a book... about pudding?! She had stolen a book on fucking pudding from the witch queen! She wanted to scream at the heavens, and to rip the book apart if a fit of rage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she managed, barely, to keep her cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked coolly, though the unbridled rage just beneath the surface seeped into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Making pudding. Sorry to say, but you've been pranked.\" He said, looking through the book. \"Say, mind if I keep this? There are some recipe's that I've never heard of, but look good. Maybe I can make some for Maka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sighed. The ancient woman must have gone senile, to hide a book of pudding recipe's with other important artifacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I have no need of it then.\" She said. \"Well, if you need anything just call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stood up and left, her posture rigid in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, despite being curious on what other pudding recipe's could be in the book, felt tired again. Yawning, he set the book on the nightstand before shutting his eyes. It would be at least another day or so before he got the okay to leave.</span></div></div>",

Given the opportunity my mind couldn't help itself and things went too far\"</i> \"But Rei y-\" \"If this was the first time something like this happened I'd consider listening to you\" Rei snapped cutting Usagi off. \"But Re-\" \"Shut up and get out Usagi, It's only my duty to protect you stopping me from killing you right now!\" \"Rei you know she would never do anything like that deliberately, She's just not like that.\" Ami said trying to defuse the situation, not realizing that Usagi had left quietly after Rei had cut off her own attempt at trying to explain and apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I need to find a way to make this up to her, in fact to them all.\"</i> Usagi thought on her way home, It was at this point in classic Usagi fashion that she collided with someone who simply dropped a book and kept on going.  At first glance the book seemed normal enough despite it's strange title but when she looked around to try and return it there was no one in sight.  She decided to take a closer look when she got home to see if it had contact information for it's owner inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked she couldn't help but think back to her most recent accident, she had just tripped over her own two feet ... again. Unable to catch herself she crashed into Rei in the shower, if it hadn't been for the fact that her hands had landed on Rei's chest everything probably would have been fine.  Unfortunately they did and she unconsciously stared to squeeze them in a way that typically made her feel good when she was alone.  Again if it had ended there things might have been alright but the groping escalated to even more intimate touching.  Usagi hadn't even been thinking at all after she fell, until Rei started screaming at the top of her lungs that she should stop. This of course not only stopped Usagi but got every one's attention as well.  Once they helped Usagi off of Rei and found out what happened they all turned on her. Shocked at what she had done Usagi started to apologize almost instantly, of course by then Rei was flushed, embarrassed, and livid.  The only one to even come close to keeping calm had been Ami, but even that was probably more for the sake of the team than for her at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The funny part is I know they remember that part of our relationship back on the moon just as well as I do.

If I take a right up here, near the little forest that marks the halfway point between the two it shouldn't take more than... three hours? Yes, that might work. I would get to the Kobolds by nightfall, and thus would be able to rest up for the quest in the morning. If all goes well, I should be able to stay at the spot for an hour before I have to continue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to himself, the knight quickly stowed the map back in its proper place and shouldered his pack once more. He had little time to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, when a princess asks for you by name, you do not dawdle. Doubly so for a knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe valley was the same as he remembered from last week, though he would have been surprised if it had changed at all. Legend said that the land he now trod upon had resisted change for as long as anyone could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost scholars attributed this to the large crystal that hung in the direct center of the valley, and the knight supposed that they knew what they were doing. It was imposing, easily triple his own impressive height, though only half as wide. Light pierced through it's many facets, creating a rainbow that covered a good fifth of the otherwise barren land. Hovering so highly, he could walk under it should he so choose, but one did not stay a knight, or alive for that matter, for long by walking under large, sharp and undoubtedly heavy objects that were suspended in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind it stood three even larger, even more imposing obelisks. One colored a shining gold, the middle a bright pink, and the last a deep ebony, each easily thrice the crystals height, including the air beneath it, and five times his own width at the shoulders. As far as anyone knew, they were buried impossibly deep, and the few attempts at unearthing them was futile as after weeks upon weeks of excavations, there was no sign that they were nearing the bottom of the monoliths. The few attempts to even chip it to study the material were equally fruitless, as it refused to so much as be scratched! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was always the same in this supposedly cursed land, perpetually clear so that the sun could shine on the floating gem with a light breeze that made the crystal spin in place. It never rained upon the land, nor did it ever really kick up a harsh wind. Clouds parted around the tract of land, so there was no chance of there ever being snow or storms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo princess ever came to these lands, only adding to the tales of it being cursed. Not even the feared and respected dragons ever touched this land, never even flew over it when they decided to... visit the lesser princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he was certain he was the only one to ever walk these lands anymore, to feel the dirt, fertile but ultimately worthless since no farmer would ever work the fields, underneath his plated boots. He was the only one to gaze upon the wonders that had been there since the rise of the kingdoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, despite his usual nature of being selfless in giving gifts and lending a hand, he was fine with that. Few times did he find himself able to relax. On the road, one had to be cautious of bandits, highway men, cut throats, assassins and other miscreants. Not to mention the wild, feral animals that would find his flesh to be quite tasty and his bones good toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOft times he came through this way, he was in the middle of an important quest. Last week he had been escorting the Desert Princess to visit the Slime Princess, and they had been forced to stop by the human kingdom on the way because she did not want to come near this land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no trouble, of course, for the lovely princess of the sands. It was his sworn duty as a knight to serve the princesses of the land, despite serving none solely or full time. And the princess had been gracious enough to gift him a smile as her entourage settled down for the night in the castle, when she stepped out of her carriage with her ever present protector hovering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear, I should not have let my mind wander to the princess.\u201d He said, sitting down beside the golden monolith. \u201cHer state of dress is rather... provocative, to say the least. Oh, blast it all, I wish I hadn't missed the party for one of our newest members the other night. I wouldn't be so pent up, and it is improper to think of the princesses in such a manner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was no helping it. The thought of the Desert Princess was one that fogged the mind. She was, in his opinion, the least proper of all princesses. Never covering up her lady bits, no matter what the climate, geographical or political, might have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dark skin was mostly exposed, including her full breasts and her nether regions. Her hips, ironically enough, were covered in red silks that exposed her inner thighs but covered her knees and ran down to her ankles. Across her stomach, trailing just below her naval, she had a lace of golden beads. Her nipples were pierced, maybe, or perhaps they were bands of some sort? He hadn't looked, trying his damnedest to keep it professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about the desert rose was so sensual and tantalizing... maddening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight groaned as he felt himself stir with want and desire. It was so embarrassing, even if no one was around for miles to see it. Just the thought of being caught like this was scandalous, more so if someone were to somehow figure out that he was thinking of the princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad he passed that blighted church some time back, and wouldn't have to worry about the priests or nuns proselytizing to him about the corruption of lust once more. If anyone could read minds, it certainly seemed to be them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no use being uncomfortable on the next leg of my trip.\u201d The knight muttered to himself as he pulled down his trousers and allowed Knight Jr. to spring free. \u201cMight as well take care of it now, where no one can see my shame.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Who knows how long that will be though...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the knight began to stand, pulling his trousers up with him. Just as he did the buckle, he felt something hit him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! What in blazes? Nothing ever comes around here.\u201d He said, rubbing the back of his helmet where whatever it was had hit. \u201cAs always, I'm grateful for my trusty helmet and its many dents. So many tragedies, averted by a piece of metal that has been in the family for generations. Now, what hit me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, pointedly ignoring the remains of his activities of the past ten minutes as he found a large chunk of gold sitting on the ground. On it was carved writing, though it was half turned into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...?\u201d He asked, picking up the rock(?) with a shaky hand. He looked between it and the monolith he had been sitting next to, and sure enough a chunk had fallen out. It was fist sized, as was the piece he palmed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he looked at the writing again feeling something wash over him as he read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To start the quest for fame untold;<br>\r\nYou've been given this chunk of gold;<br>\r\nBut sell it not for riches now;<br>\r\nfor wealth it can not avow;<br>\r\nThis piddly little piece of stone;<br>\r\nCan give the power to rule all thrones;<br>\r\nTrust the writing to lead you true;<br>\r\nAnd your balls will never blue;<br>\r\nSo follow the words and test your might;<br>\r\nThrow this stone at gem so bright!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nHe read these words, again and again for at least ten minutes. He rolled them over in his head, though every time he got to the eighth line he felt the need to remark about the crudeness of the line, along with the fact it felt out of place. One of the aspects of being a knight was learning at the very least adequate poetry. This felt like it was written by an amateur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he could not help but be intrigued at this rather sudden event. Prophecies, if he remembered correctly, were rare, but always, <i>always</i> came true. No matter how much you fought against them, it was inevitable, fate set in stone. However, none that he remembered had been so... simply stated. All others were incredibly vague, leaving room for interpretation and even vaguer symbolism that could mean absolutely anything that the recipient wanted it to mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much he wanted to hurl the object at the floating target, apparently as it was, he had a few good reasons for not doing so. Not the least of which was that he was already in the middle of a quest, for a princess no less, and the guild had strict rules about taking up quests while in the middle of an active one. There was also the fact that it could have been a prison for an otherworldly and unspeakably evil force, and thus why nothing ever came here save him (although he dreaded to think about what that meant for he himself!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another reason was the fact that he just didn't have the space on his person to pick up the shards of the more than likely priceless crystal, though he was certain that the Merchant Princess would likely try to haggle him down to a decidedly less-than-fair price.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure that I will soon. Just wait for me to come back from whatever this quest is and we'll see about trusting your words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he stuffed the golden rock into his bag, deep enough to where he wouldn't lose it or catch the attention of any less than scrupulous persons and proceeded to leave the clearing a little ahead of schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Night time, Kobold Keep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that the Princess wouldn't want to wait until the morning to meet with me? I'm sure rest would be good to ease her nerves, and I would certainly be able to do my job easier with some shut eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large, for their species that is, kobold shook his head. \u201cPrincess said she wanted to meet you as soon as you arrived, no matter the time. She even gave specific orders to wake her up if she had retired for the evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armored lizard-man stood at a height that reached just under the knight's sternum, with brown scales that would act as a natural, more flexible armor. The frills at the back and top of his head were spike like, though they didn't come to a sharp point. The long, clawed arms were clutching a spear and shield as he walked briskly through the keep towards the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the princess's desire to see this problem solved must be great then. Could you give me a few details, just so I don't waste much of her highness's rest?\u201d The knight asked, having no trouble keeping his eyes open despite already feeling fatigue seeping in. After all, it wasn't like this was the first time he'll have had to be up for more than a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's simple really. Something is down in our mine, killing the miners and stealing what treasure we had been in the process of refining into workable form. You're going to be taking care of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Though I don't know why I was asked for by name then, if it seems to be such a simple problem. Any of the other knights of my rank could have easily dispatched this threat as readily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno either, but those were the princess's orders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the conversation fell quiet, the only sound being that of the steel plated boots clinking against the warm stone of the keep and the occasional crackling of the fire in a brazier as they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe keep was large, truly. A fortress more than a castle, and an impressive one at that. It took up roughly a quarter of the kobold's capital city, though at its highest point stood only half over the highest buildings, which were not very tall in the first place. Thick walls surrounded the city, and three walls of the same surrounded the keep itself, that being the reason for such a large portion of the city being considered the keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throne room was at the heart of the fortress, he assumed, by how how deep into the halls they were traveling to reach it. He assumed that the princess's personal chambers wouldn't be very far from the most well defended space of the keep, and hoped that her highness wouldn't keep him waiting for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few minutes, they seemed to have arrived in the antechamber for the throne room. Kobold guards had set up a much more bulkier retinue than he assumed they normally would have, with cots set up in the corners of the room for round the clock guard shifts. Some of them were currently in use, the lizard people snoozing silently, their weapons never far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his right as he entered were two doors. One was large and ornate with an honor guard placed outside, standing at attention. The other was much more imposing, being heavy wrought iron with large bars of wood and steel bolting it shut. Eight guards stood around it, two standing next to it with one on either side as per usual, with the other six facing it with arms at the ready to defend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the room were tables littered with maps and papers, candles burning through the darkness as seasoned soldiers whispered to one another about the current situation and all the problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will let the Princess know that you have arrived. Wait here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis escort quickly walked over to the ornate door, opened for him as he approached by the honor guard and disappeared inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight merely sighed, knowing that if he sat he would quickly lose to sleep. \u201cMight as well see what these kobolds know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a kobold that was walking about the room, he caught its attention. \u201cHello there, fine guardsman.\u201d He greeted with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, sir knight.\u201d The dull green kobold grunted out. \u201cNeed something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMerely information. I was wondering if you might be able to give me more information about the troubles that called me here, merely to take up less of the princess's time when I meet with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snort with the shake of his head caused the knight to inwardly groan. \u201cWe don't know much more of the situation than something is killing our miners. We sent some guards in three days ago, but they never reported back. The giant bats, we're used to handling those. Could do that in our sleep, even the miners. But this thing, it was able to whisk away all the treasure we had ready to refine in a matter of hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight merely nodded. \u201cI see. How long ago did this happen, and when did you notice something was wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno the full story myself, something about the miners not checking in I think. We've been on high alert for about a week now though, and it's taking a toll on us.\u201d The kobold sighed. Now the knight could see it though, the bags under the eyes of the lizard-folk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know it was possible for them to get those, to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to press the questions when the sound of the door to the throne room opened once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Knight, the princess will see you now.\u201d The voice of his escort barked out, causing the knight to stiffen up, all traces of weariness pushed to the side. There was business to be done, and he would not let such a thing as sleep deprivation keep him from giving the princess the respect she was due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the throne room, he was not surprised to see the princess seated upon her throne and flanked by guards on either side. Soldiers were lined up along the carpet that led up to her highness, with pillars keeping them spaced out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up, keeping his eyes upon the princess of kobolds \u2013 A rather busty lizard woman, with scales that were <i>almost</i> emerald green and so small you would be forced to gaze at her so closely your head would likely be removed from your neck. She wore fur to conceal her breasts and cover her nethers, though neither article was doing their job very well. Her horns, coming out from behind the ridges that were placed where human ears would be, curved up and slightly over her head. Her crown, a little black thing that bore the shape of all other princess crowns in the kingdom, was hung around one of her horns like a band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat regally in her throne, made of iron and fitted with cushions where her back, arms and posterior made contact with the chair. Her tail was wrapped around to the front, curled over her lap. Her elbows were on the arms of the throne, her hands clasped in her lap with her claws locked firmly together. She looked at him with the air of nobility that all princesses had, frazzled and haggard an air though it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings.\u201d She simply, her voice betraying nothing. \u201cI'm glad you could make it so quickly, Sir Knight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a respectable distance, feeling the eyes of every guard focused on him, he knelt down on one knee. \u201cPrincess of the Kobolds, I have come as requested. I apologize for interrupting your slumber, but my escort,\u201d he nodded towards the kobold at her side, \u201csaid that you wished to see me as soon as I arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I did.\u201d The princess sniffed out, nodding. \u201cHad things not been so dire, I would have offered you food and rest before setting out. Alas, things are indeed dire enough that I am unable to give you the hospitality that is usually dictated. I assume you have asked around the guards outside what they know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, Princess. Though not much, I know that there is something in your mines that has pilfered not just your treasure, but the lives of your subjects as well. The miners you sent down there are all gone, as well as the soldiers that went down there looking for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silent nod greeted him, a somber look upon the princess's face. \u201cIndeed. I cannot risk the lives of my subjects, but the mines are integral to our trade. Where we would normally deal with such problems ourselves, we have had to look elsewhere for a more seasoned hand at battle. You impressed me when you dealt with that bandit problem weeks ago, so quickly and brutally at that. I implore you to lend us your blade once again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, Princess. I would never deny an honor such as this, especially when called by name to your aid. I will dispatch the terror of the mines, or die trying.\u201d The Knight claimed, the proclamation utterly sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you, Sir Knight. In gratitude for your help, we would like to offer you a gift. You will get one of two items, the kobold dowries, to aid your efforts. Choose wisely.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a snap of her claws, two chests were brought to the front of the Knight by two more honor guards. They were placed in front of him before being opened by the guards, letting him see the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the left, an unlit red candle lay on a pillow. There seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary with it, but all the dowries of the princesses were said to be incredibly magical so he would never take it at face value. In the right, a slightly glowing piece of yellow stone, shimmering ever so slightly like the flame of a campfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your pick, Sir Knight.\u201d The princess said, leaning forward so slightly to see what he would choose. \u201cUnfortunately, I can tell you nothing about them until you choose one, but both could help you now and in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, the knight looked over the two objects. A candle would surely be good for the deeper parts of the mines, but he didn't know what else it could do. As for the stone, it could do just about anything, but it could also be a gamble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI choose the candle, Princess.\u201d He said, nodding to his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess stared at him as the chest containing the stone snapped shut and was taken to the side once more. She looked him square in the eye through his helm, blue eyes meeting the black slitted pupils of the lizard woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she nodded to herself and stood. \u201cI see. If that's the case, I will be coming with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, every guard snapped to further attention than they already were, butts of spears hitting the ground as they readied to keep their princess safe from her own foolishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, what are you saying?\u201d The kobold escort asked, looking wide eyed at his ruler. \u201cIt is much too dangerous for you to go into the mines!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy fate is tied to the holder of the candle, you know this.\u201d She said softly, shaking her head with a small smile. \u201cI feel that it was fate that we should need to call upon a knight in these times. That the knight left such an impression on me and came to my mind first only bolstered that thought, and that he has chosen the candle strengthens my resolve. I will go with our champion to confront the evil that has befallen my people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the knight, who was feeling like had now made a mistake. Taking the candle from the chest, she gave the wax a soft kiss before she handed it to him. \u201cTake care of this, sir knight. Should you fall, I will fall with you. Your strength will be my strength, and my strength your own. Our lives are now entwined, until the other should perish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight took the candle gently, the wick bursting into a bright red flame, lighting the entire throne room in its brilliance. Everyone shielded their eyes as the flame roared, waving back and forth wildly but never burning the two at the center of the magical inferno. They were aware of someone shouting and the sound of the door slamming open as other kobolds flowed into the room, weapons at the ready, but they seemed so distant in sound, as the two of them were still holding the candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the fire died down, through the flame never lost its intensity. Blinking the spots from their eyes, Knight and Princess looked around at the guards who now surrounded them, weapons drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt ease, soldiers.\u201d The princess said, feeling stronger now than she had before. \u201cWe are unharmed, and it was not of the knights doing. Be kind to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight watched warily as the tip of a spear was pulled from his neck, the entirety of the kobold battalion that burst into the room slowly easing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I want everyone to clear the castle of all kobolds. Civilian and guards alike.\u201d She said, looking around her. \u201cThough I do not doubt this brave knight, if we are to fall to whatever is in the mines, they are to be decreed lost to us. Go to the other kingdoms, go to the Knights guild, go wherever you must to escape whatever horrors lurk beneath our kingdom. But do not stay here, do not throw your lives away should the worst come to pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she turned to her stalwart knight, her champion and held out her clawed hand. \u201cShall we go, brave Champion? We must deal with this problem to my kingdom soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the knight took her hand with his left, the right still holding the candle, and walked through the throng of Kobolds who had snapped to attention at the princesses commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mines were deep, and beyond the entrance from the castle antechamber they were incredibly dark. The knight and princess walked closely together, hand in hand. In his free hand, the knight held his sword at the ready, the blade already dripping with the blood and viscera of the giant bats that lived in these caverns, while the princess held aloft the candle, lighting their way brilliantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I remember the maps correctly, there should be a rest area ahead. We should be safe there. A chance to rest and clean your blade before we make the final stretch towards the current digsite.\u201d The princess told the knight, pointing at the upcoming turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be much appreciated, Princess.\u201d His blade was getting too slick for a decent grip, and it wouldn't do for it to fly out of his hand mid swing. \u201cI'm sure you could use the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green bipedal lizard shook her head no, but the way her feet were dragging told the knight otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight turned the corner, sword at the ready, but was only greeted with the blackness of the mines before the princess joined him, shining the light down the tunnels. And indeed, the princess was right. An area enclosed with metal bars, containing a few tables and chairs, lanterns long since gone cold sitting upon the wooden tops. There were even cards sprawled along one table, though there was no one to play them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only signs of trouble had been the upturned chairs and a few tables that were smashed, proving that whatever had taken the miners was immensely strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis must have been where they were attacked.\u201d The princess said softly, a frown forming on her muzzle. \u201cBut what could have done this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know, but it shan't harm your people any longer, Princess.\u201d The knight reminded her, leading her into the cage and picking up two chairs. \u201cSit and rest. I brought some skins of water, and I must clean my sword. We should be fine for now, the bats haven't avoided the area completely. That means that whatever is lurking down here is not incredibly close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess could only nod, taking a skin of water from the knights pack as he set it down. He searched through the jumble of necessities for one of the cloths he kept for such dirty jobs as cleaning his blade and armor, taking a smoother one that he would usually clean his face of dirt and sweat and handing it to the Kobold. \u201cYou, ah, have some blood on your horns.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy thanks, sir knight.\u201d She took the rag, setting the candle on the table. Idly, she dabbed the rag over horns, stopping momentarily as she touched the crown before continuing with a sigh. \u201cHeavy is the head that bears the troubled crown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the knight had heard, as he most certainly had, he did not show it. He merely kept silent as he gently wiped the entrails of the giant bats from his beloved sword. He'd been through so much with that blade. He'd had it for almost as long as he'd been knighted, one of his first purchases from the stock that was available only to knights. He'd slain bandits, dangerous animals, had it blessed when he had to exorcise a village that had been over run with wild undead, fought as a champion for both the human and the slime princesses against a golem champion and a slave champion of the goblins that was undoubtedly half-giant and helped protect an expedition to the west at the merchant princess's behest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always taken good care of the blade, though he knew it wouldn't last much longer. Its blade was starting to notch, the blacksmiths unable to continue fixing it due to how thin the metal was getting. It was only thanks to that blessing that he was able to still carry it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, the gods cared only so much for a hunk of metal, even when it was used in their name to cleanse the evils that plagued the land. This would have to be the last quest he took it on, the last clash it would see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what a quest to end it on. Maybe he would be able to give it a name, or perhaps a bard would sing his tale, of being called to end the blight of the Kobolds, called by name by the princess herself and bringing prosperity to the kingdom once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that drew him to another matter entirely. The candle and the princess. Why did he have the feeling it was like being married? It certainly sounded like wedding vows, and he had been to enough weddings to get the feeling that came from the princess when she said those words. Like a bride to her groom. And the dowries...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cPrincess?\u201d The knight asked, snapping her out of her own thoughts. \u201cMay I ask why you decided to bequeath me one of your peoples dowries? Surely they would be best suited to go to your own beloved?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d She breathed out, looking down. \u201cUm, well, it's uh, quite simple. With the troubles we've had lately, with bandits and this beast in the mines, and the human princess's increase on the tax of any kobold passing through her lands, we do not have a great deal of funds to spare. In lieu of monetary payment, I was willing to give you my hand in marriage for preforming such feats for us in a short amount of time. That you took the candle instead of the ore was only proof that I was right to do so. All of the Kobold kingdom knows what happens when the princess gives the candle to someone. It is more binding than any vows or wedding band.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill went up his spine at those words. Not in revulsion, but it still wasn't pleasant. \u201cSo, we are essentially married now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly in the eyes of the kobolds. None of the other kingdoms have ever acknowledged it, nor does the church of divine light. But the candle has been held in the kingdom since its inception. The princesses of ages past have always given the candle to their champions, and in turn married to the holder of the candle.\u201d She said, blue tinting her cheeks in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, not something he knew kobolds could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand if you do not wish to be my consort and wish to annul the marriage later, but I don't have anything else in the kingdom to give you of value.\u201d She continued, her voice growing weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight paused the polishing of his sword, looking at the princess in a different light. To all but sell yourself for your kingdom was no small feat, especially when it put you in the direct line of danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a strange development to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to mention the sheer intensity of the candle.\u201d She said, motioning to the unmelted wax light. \u201cIt usually only burns as much as a regular candle. Only in the oldest legends, told only from one ruler to the next, has the candle burned so brightly, so warmly and fiercely as it did in the throne room. It only burned as such when it was gifted upon the first princess of our kingdom, and when she gifted it back to the giver immediately afterward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d The knight went back to polishing his sword. \u201cI hope I haven't offended, Princess. I was merely curious. I had no idea the kingdom was in such dire straights. It's a brave thing you do for your people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, you have nothing to apologize for.\u201d She assured. \u201cI only hope that you are not angry with my actions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight shook his head, though was silent otherwise. In turn, the princess remained silent, though a small sigh of relief escaped her. She finished off cleaning her horns, wiping the blood that had dripped on her head before setting the cloth on the table. She looked around the room again, illuminated entirely by the magic candle and shed a single tear for her lost subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown here, she need not hide herself entirely.</span></div></div>",

It was a huge one, and we'd hoped that it would have solved our issues for the foreseeable future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight nodded, pushing the princess behind him. He readied sword and shield, slowly creeping up on the open door. Just as he was on the threshold, he raised his shield and charged in, ready to spring to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing no danger, the Kobold Princess followed her champion into the room, albeit far more cautiously. As the light from the candle she carried illuminated the room, both knight and companion could only look on in shock and awe at the sight before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaps upon heaps of gold. Veritable mountains of shiny yellow rock, hills of glimmering ore, ready to be processed into anything they could need it for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the gold...\u201d The Kobold princess breathed out. \u201cThe miners had said they had hit the largest payload in decades, but I never thought...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight could only nod, still at the ready for any foe. But still, for so much gold to be here, the Kobolds could have toppled the Goblins from their long held economic control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly entered the room, skirting around the mountain of valuables. The knight was ready to pounce at a moments notice, but weather that be to attack or defend was debatable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold princess opened her mouth, about to ask the question that was on both their minds when something made them stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep intake of breath, pulling some of the treasures into a gaping maw underneath it all and the sounds of rocks being chewed up before a large, audible swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold princess couldn't help her knees shake, almost letting out a squeak in fear and dropping the candle as the knight readied to get the princess out of danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster let out a large belch, sending the treasure that had piled atop it scattering down across the floor. It sat up, stretching its arms above its head, wings unfurling in the spacious cavern as it let out a large yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two smaller, much smaller creatures looked up at the form of the 'monster' of the mines, Kobold princess had wished that it was something simple as a strong monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, it couldn't have been so simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that hit the spot. Such delicious treasure. Those stupid lizards would have ruined it. Unrefined is much tastier than trinkets.\u201d Grumbled the being who caused fear in every person, from peasant to princess with merely the thought of a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, I don't remember it being so bright in here...\u201d She said, looking around. \u201cThat must mean there's a little thief running about. And after my treasure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the thought that someone might have taken even a single bit of her horde, the Princess turned around and caught their eyes before they could even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there they are. A little rat and his accomplice.\u201d She said, standing to her full height as the gold rolled down her body. \u201cI expected you to leave me be, Kobold Princess. Killing your subjects should have told you that I did not want to be disturbed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-dragon Princess!\u201d The Kobold yelped in fright, though she tried to keep from shaking even more. \u201cW-we didn't know you were coming to grace us with your presence... W-why have you c-come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't play dumb with me, Princess!\u201d The Dragon roared, making the cavern shake. \u201cYou know why I'm here, even your tiny brain knows that.\u201d She said, tapping a claw to the side of her own head as she stomped over, crushing any ore that fell beneath her feet like she was walking through a puddle. \u201cI'm here for what's mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yours? W-what is y-your-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEVERYTHING!\u201d The Dragon roared again, fire licking between her teeth as she stared at the two of them with sheer greed and contempt. This time, rocks fell from the ceiling as the ground groaned around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon Princess was very tall, with a long neck atop a slightly pudgy body. Massive knockers hung from her chest, with thick hips supporting her form. Large, leathery wings graced her back, with a long and thick tail sprouting from just above her plump rear. Her scales were a deep red, not unlike the candle that shook in the lizard girls hands, with a light pink running up her belly from her inner thighs to her lower jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick, long and sharp claws were fixed on the ends of her fingers, and most likely her toes as well, and she had two gems in her forehead. Atop her head, between the two horn ridges, was a gleaming ruby crown that would have made the kobold princess look small if they stood on even ground. Her eyes gleamed red in the light, embers occasionally floating into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her neck she wore what the knight could only assume was an incredibly large feather boa, also red. The only clothing she wore could possibly be described as \u201cbarely underclothes\u201d but even that was stretching it thin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, no. Stretching it thin would also describe the fabric. Her breasts were barely contained in the bra she wore, and it seemed like it would bust at any moment. The same for her small clothes, which highlighted and emphasized her lower regions quite immensely. The stings that held the whole thing up were barely visible threads, sinking into the supple and slightly doughy skin of her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I'm through with your gold, I'll be taking everything else in this hovel you call a castle!\u201d The princess stated, merely a matter of fact to her that this would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but Princess,\u201d The Kobold stammered out. \u201cHow will my people live if you take everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is none of my concern.\u201d The dragon dismissed the worry, leaning her head closer to the duo. \u201cI am the ruler of this land, and if I say I'm taking something I don't need to explain myself. Especially not to a little ground lizard like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her head back, finally looking at the knight once more, sword and shield at the ready still. She gave a little smirk, drool dripping from between her teeth now. \u201cUnless, of course, you plan to fight me. But even you can't be that stupid, Kobold. Your kind aren't fighters, you're barely even worthy of bearing the title of Princess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in the kobold princess's demeanor changed \u2013 her cheeks puffed out, shoulders squared and the ridges on her head flared \u2013 and she strode forward just past her champion. \u201cThat's enough, you overgrown salamander! We Kobolds have suffered enough! You are leaving! Right! NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe candle in her hands flared brightly, burning blue for a moment, but doing little else. The dragon looked down at the princess, regarding her like a piece of trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her face was right above the smaller lizard, fangs bared and fire leaping from her tongue. Her arms were spread out, claws poised for use as her wings flared out and beat to cause a large gust of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the warning she gave before letting loose a torrent of dragon fire from her maw, liquefying the stone that had been where the two smaller people stood merely seconds ago. The sound of ores scrapping along the stone floor told her that she had missed and that her prey was fleeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar, she turned to her left, swinging her tail to the right to catch them in a much smaller area. She wouldn't miss again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun, Princess! Run for safety!\u201d The knight yelled, dropping his sword to bodily throw the Kobold over the oncoming tail towards the door. \u201cGet your people out of here! I'm sorry for choosing the candle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lucky to get that out as he raised his shield against the massive, muscly appendage to keep it from flattening him or crushing his ribs. Grunting in pain, he was flung across the room and into the claws of the dragon as his shield was flung off his arm uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, what have we here?\" The dragon taunted, gripping him in her large hand. \u201cA champion for the brainless lizard?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Nobody knew it was one of the feared dragons taking up residence in these caverns.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness looked at the knight, sizing him up. She gave a little squeeze of her hand, making the armor cave ever so slightly in her grasp. When he didn't squeal or yelp in pain, she smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and if you did, would you have refused the job?\u201d She asked, her fangs showing as she brought him up to her face. \u201cWould you have let the Kobolds suffer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny good knight would have taken the quest, regardless. Especially when called by name.\u201d The captive knight said, ignoring the sharp bits of metal that were poking him all over his body. \u201cIt would be an act of cowardice to do otherwise, and the one who did would forfeit the title of knight forever more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the dragon regarded him, scrutinizing him under her withering gaze as he made no move to escape. She was much too strong for him to do anything in his current position. But he needed to do something, anything to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a good knight,\u201d she admitted at last, through grudgingly. \u201cBut an incredibly stupid one. What hope would you have of defeating myself or my sisters, let alone my mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone, princess.\u201d The knight also admitted, though his was humble, the long years of serving the various royalty kicking in. \u201cBut for my honor and the sake of others, I would have walked to face your entire family should it buy them even a second to flee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness preened under the title, savoring the respect that she had heard in his voice. However, as he continued to speak, her gaze turned sharp, looking not quite at him but not quite through him either. Her grip tightened a little more, causing several bits of metal to dig into his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the knight did not let his agony show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA foolish knight indeed.\u201d She whispered, flames flickering from her maw once more. Before blinking, her anger momentarily forgotten as she felt something on her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she dropped the knight as she spied the little lizard that she thought had scurried off was <i>biting her tail</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger of the two lizards lifted her tail up, slamming it back down to dislodge the green irritant, the knight all but forgotten. She found no satisfaction when the pest bounced along the floor, hitting a few of the larger rocks before hitting the wall with a heavy smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <b>dare</b> to touch me, let alone attack me?\u201d The red titan growled out, stalking up to the soon-to-be deceased leader of the lesser lizards. \u201cYou attack your ruler? I was only going to punish you beforehand, but now it seems I must remind the Grand Tower Kingdom of exactly why they fear me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kobold Princess shook her head of the fog, feeling her head bleeding and pain in her jaw. But she looked up at the greater in strength of the two of them defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hereby sentence your entire kingdom to death.\u201dThe Dragon princess told her, dragging out every word with unadulterated loathing and contempt. \u201cTo be carried out immediately by yours truly. Fields will be burned, your castle reduced to rubble and your people <b><i>reduced to ash</i></b>. Starting with YouuUUURRGH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight pulled his blade from the foot of the dragoness, avoiding her knee as she came crashing down. He slashed at her arms as they went to grasp her wounded foot, drawing more blood and cries of agony from the great princess of terror. She tried to grab at him again, but he swung his sword once more, slicing her hand from the middle of her palm down to the wrist. She jerked her hand away, sobbing in pain as the sword was pulled with her hand from the knight as if it were a giant metal thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuickly Princess, we must flee!\u201d He said, pulling the smaller princess to her feet and running from the room. \u201cWe must gather my supplies and alert your people. I don't know what the dragon princess will do when she recovers, but your people are no longer safe in these lands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold princess said nothing, having to pant to keep up with the running knight, having just enough time to grab the candle from outside the door as they left the dig site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little thieves.\u201d The mighty princess sobbed, tears flowing onto the floor as her entire body shook. \u201cI'll be back for you all. You'll rue the day you attacked me!\u201d She moaned out, fury mounting as what happened really hit her. \u201cYou'll all <u><i><b>BURN</b></i></u>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead turned towards the ceiling, she let loose a gout of flame in a wild roar. She turned her head, this way and that, covering everything in fire as the earth around her shook at her rage. Roar after terrible roar she unleashed, more and more dragonfire setting what rocks didn't melt ablaze in the mystical fire of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith effort she stood, flapping her wings. Taking to the air in the spacious cavern, she let loose one last tongue of flame at the floor, reducing it to magma and melting the ore back into the earth. Then, with eyes filled with rage and pain, she blasted through the hole in the ceiling that she initially made when she entered the caverns via the mountains, melting it as she flew out towards the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the damage that the dragon had done was not so contained. All around the mines, tunnels were collapsing like a house of cards, only to then collapse on one another again and make deep, treacherous pits that would eventually become the home of those dark, abyssal creatures that children saw in their nightmares. The giant bats that called the caves home previously were all stirred to panic, chirping and squeaking in the rush for any of the vents to the surface to escape certain death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight and the princess, the former having quickly discarded their armor once they reached the rest area and gathered his pack of supplies, tried to reach the path that would lead back to the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the fates were not so kind to them. As rocks fell down on the helm of the knight, who was doing his best to keep the kobold Princess from harm of the slightly larger rocks, he had to skid to a stop when he reached the last junction before the series of tunnels that would have led them to safety only to discover a pit that had fallen down three 'floors' of the extensive mine that run under the Kobold capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, please tell me there is another way out of here? A entrance for the workers to take their haul out without going through the palace?\u201d The knight asked, holding the princess back from running headlong into the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I think so,\u201d She gasped out, trying not to choke on her own saliva as she struggled to draw breath. \u201cIt's t-that way...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight felt that he had dealt with enough for the day to let out a groan of irritation. The way the princess pointed, while not directly across from them, was still over the yawning chasm that loomed before them. Merely to the left of them though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can throw you that distance, my lady.\u201d He said, about to pick up the Kobold again. \u201cBut I doubt I can make it myself with my pack.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Forgive my insolence for this, but needs must.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooped up the princess, who clung for dear life to both candle and knight, into a bridal carry, making sure he had positioned her tail correctly so it wouldn't trip him as he took off on a dead sprint, grateful that his armor had been discarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounding down the still shaking halls, he followed the tunnels thankfully single hall, the dead ends being boarded up as the earth groaned again and again. Each new sound was enough to stop his heart, fearing that the ground would split in twain at each footfall and swallow the two whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, soon enough they saw blessed sunlight, far off but enough to give the knight a rush of hope, and with it one last burst of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a primal yell, the old way of telling the world he would not die here, he pumped his legs harder, ignoring the creaking of his tired and battered bones as he threw every last drop of strength into escaping alive with the shaking woman in his arms. The sprint became a maddened, frenzied dash of sheer adrenaline rush and terror of death looming all around only increased the potency of it as the light grew closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet air! The sunlight was beating down on the earth as the hills shook, fire and smoke billowing from the mountains as the bats from the caves, the lucky ones at least, made a cloud in the sky before they flittered off into a nearby wood in the slime kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, the knight did not stop. He could vaguely hear, over the sound of his blood pounding in his ears, the cries and shouts of all the kobolds that were still escaping the collapse of the capital. But he could not stop now if he wanted to. His body was no longer under his command as he sprinted right through the mining district of town, passed the long thrown open gates of the city where whatever small amount of Kobolds still lived in the starved for work part of town had fled from at the first sign of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not stop to watch as half of the Kobold Keep had sunk into the earth, nor did he stop when they crested the hills and when they could no longer see the soon-to-be ruins. He did not stop for another hour, a testament to the endurance of the knights, his own fortitude and the sheer danger that they just escaped from to instill such terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when the sun reached its zenith in the heavens did the knight stop. Breath shallow and ragged, legs pulsing an angry red and knees shaking in weariness, so far from the danger that he could no longer feel the ground shake beneath him did he allow himself to all but collapse at the side of the road still clutching the Princess in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even his arms fell uselessly down, allowing the princess to finally roll free of his grasp. She had been trying to get him to stop for close to the entire hour he had ran, ceasing her actions when she realized he wouldn't listen to her at the moment and resigned to being held in his arms until he stopped. Despite herself, she felt much safer being held in her champions arms than she had in her entire life being surrounded by the royal guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she had to act. Her knight was barely able to breath and he needed to cool off quickly! Using her claws to slice the straps of his pack, she pulled it away from him and grabbed at the water skins he had and dug out the potions made by the alchemists of the knight guild, Inc. that no knight ever left without. She threw anything that wasn't the desired items carelessly to the side until she spotted the cloth that the bottles were usually wrapped in to prevent fractures, cracking and breaking of the bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering what she needed, she turned back to the knight and poured the water over his legs, wishing she had some other way of cooling him down but not knowing what else to do. The last of the skins emptied, she quickly pulled off her savior's helmet, turned him over while uncorking a bottle and pouring the liquid  down his throat, gently lifting his head to make the task slightly easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, brave knight.\u201d She said, looking into his eyes that starred blankly outwards, pupils as wide as the eye of a needle and shaking. Sweat poured down his entire body, his skin flushed red all over. His cheeks struggled to keep up with his need for air between administrations of the potions. \u201cWe are safe here. Do not worry for now, just take deep breaths. Yes, that's it. No, don't try and move your head anymore than I have. No, not your arms either. I will sit on you if you try to move again, so stop it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight, while not there mentally, seemed to be recovering as expected with the potions. While they wouldn't be able to do much more without a stockpile, he would be ready to move in a few hours. Already his arms had gone from utterly useless to shaking and twitching which was much better, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kobold princess sighed, setting the last bottle to the side. There was nothing more she could do right now than wait. And right now, all of her adrenaline was leaving her system as well. Her eyes drooped, and she found herself laying her head on the tunic covered chest of her knight, her champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyelids drooped, she glimpsed what looked to be a piece of golden ore as the world went black.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Kobold princess struggled to open her eyes, drained as she was. Sleep was already trying to claim her again, but she knew it was necessary for her to do so. She must ensure the well being of her knight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that dragging sound was really bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleary eyed, blinking away the sensitivity to the light, she squinted so she could see better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she moving? Yes, by the bobbing of the trees in the distance she was moving. Being carried, to be precise. And, by the feel of the arms and the chest, now bare, she was being carried by the knight she had worried about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, he must have been dragging his pack along, now that it had no straps. She twitched in shame, making her knight do so much work after he had done so much for her already, despite losing her kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she still had the candle, carefully placed in her arms by her knight, and the hope that enough of her people were safe. They could rebuild the castle, but she would need her subjects to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir knight.\u201d She murmured, causing him to halt. \u201cTell me, how are you faring?\u201d She asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell enough, princess.\u201d He replied, his voice hoarse and raspy. \u201cYou?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch better than you, I should think. Please, set me down. I do not wish to burden you more than I already have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c'Tis no \u2013 ergh \u2013 burden, princess.\u201d He replied before sucking in a breath. \u201cBut it would be appreciated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the knight let the princess touch her feet to the ground, keeping her steady as the last vestiges of sleep left her weary body. His body moved slowly, gingerly from the neck down. His legs still pulsed slightly, but nowhere near as bad. And indeed, it was his bag that he was dragging along behind him, secured with some rope that she remembered tossing out earlier to get the potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sir Knight...\u201d She whispered, reaching up to touch the helm he wore once more. \u201cHow can you stand to move in such a state?\u201d She looked at the scars of the wounds he had sustained in the mines, from where the armor had pierced his body and then rocks had slashed the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said in the mines, needs must.\u201d He said, taking a gulp of air and sighing. \u201cNow, we mustn't dawdle. I know a safe spot for us to camp for the night, and we'll only just make it there by sundown. That should give me enough time to set up camp at my reduced pace, though we'll have to make due without a fire or a hot meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the princess took up stride by the bedraggled knight, helping him when he stumbled every so often. She tried to help pull the pack, but it was an awkward affair and her knight insisted on doing it himself, though he meant no harm in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was, hours later just as the sun started to fall below the horizon that they arrived at the edge of the cursed valley. The Kobold Princess felt a shiver run down her spine, seeing the land in all its unnaturalness. She could not help but stop just as the knight crossed the threshold of the forsaken land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir knight, is it wise to enter this area? No one has traveled this accursed valley in a long time. Not even the dragons dare come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly why it's safe.\u201d He simply said, walking further in, dragging the pack in the dirt. He was so close to a resting spot where he could let his body give out once more. He would not stop until he could rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess looked around nervously, twiddling her claws as her tail constantly tweaked itself in fear. However, that one sentence made her shove aside any other fact for the moment and quickly try to catch up with her knight. Even when the gem and the three obelisks got closer and closer, she stuck by her knight, knowing he would keep her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when they reached the obelisks did they finally drop. The knight didn't even bother to put up a tent, his limbs so sore. He sat against the golden monolith as he had the day before, eyes bleary as his eyes drifted up to the  floating gem. He did not even notice, tired as he was, when the bipedal lizard curled up next to him, trying to absorb any warmth she could from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled close, trying to ignore the myriad of unpleasant feelings the coursed through her. Her body wanted to leave, horrible tingles arcing through her nerves constantly that had only gotten worse as they neared the landmarks, buzzing in her skull like she had swallowed a bee hive with all its denizens and her tail would not still for all she tried. Her stomach churned, though she knew not why as every rational part of her mind, nay, her very soul <i>screamed</i> at her to run as far from the land as possible, to take up shelter in the open plains rather than this wretched land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, she could not... No, she would not leave her knight. Not now, or for a very long time. She just had to do her best to ignore the whole thing until they reached better lands than these for her own comfort. Her knight needed all the rest he could get. He deserved the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep tight, my knight.\u201d She breathed out, letting her eyes close once more as sleep claimed her quickly. Unconsciously, she snuggled even further into his side as she slept, candle held close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the knight, his eyes kept drifting from the floating gem to his pack. The stone kept coming to mind, more specifically what it had read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To start the quest for fame untold;<br>\r\nYou've been given this chunk of gold;<br>\r\nBut sell it not for riches now;<br>\r\nfor wealth it can not avow;<br>\r\nThis piddly little piece of stone;<br>\r\nCan give the power to rule all thrones;<br>\r\nTrust the writing to lead you true;<br>\r\nAnd your balls will never blue;<br>\r\nSo follow the words and test your might;<br>\r\nThrow this stone at gem so bright!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, if he had listened to that... Maybe, just maybe, he would have been able to stop the dragon princess from destroying the city. The power to rule all thrones sounded like it could even tame the queen's rage, and that certainly would have been useful when dealing with her less powerful daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, he hadn't. Now, the kobolds pay the price when he could have done something to prevent it. He had been forced to drag their princess into the cursed lands, away from her desperate people who probably thought she was dead by now, lost to the beast of the mines and their homes destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe himself was down to only his trusty helm, every other piece of armor rendered useless by the dragon princess, and the clothes he wore under them with some extras in his pack. He had no water, no potions, no weapon and he could only just feel anything in his arms or legs, though none of the feeling was any good except to prove he wasn't dead yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared at the gem one last time, he could no longer resist the call of unconsciousness and tumbled down into a forced sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, the knight awoke to the sun just coming over the horizon. The opposite end of the sky was still dark, but that was slowly fading away with the coming day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery joint was stiff, aching from what he had done the previous day. He flexed the fingers in his right hand, every knuckle popping something fierce and making him groan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to his left, he spotted the still sleeping form of the princess leaning on him and cradling the candle to her bosom. The flame was stronger now, having recovered from a tiny wisp of fire to the strength of a normal candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, it is time to wake. I must make it back to the guild. We can send envoys to the corners of the kingdoms to spread the word to the rest of the princesses and any kobolds they come across of what the dragon princess has done and the news that you are still alive.\u201d He said, shaking her shoulder as he ignored the feeling of her breasts pressed against him, covered only slightly by the thin fur clothing she wore. They were surprisingly soft, not as tough as he figured they would have been with scales though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, bad knight! That's highly unprofessional of you! Such disrespect was unwarranted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, shaking her upper body as she opened bleary eyes once more. She blinked, rubbing the back of her arm across her face as she looked around before looking up at her knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sir knight.\u201d She mumbled, sitting up and away from him, her body craving his warmth in this foul land. \u201cApologies. Your arm must be sore, and my sleeping on it did no good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorry not, princess.\u201d He said, holding back a yawn as he slowly flexed his entire arm, rolling his shoulder around and getting another pop and a hiss. \u201cIt's fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess nodded, but did not look convinced of his wellness. A groan rumbled from her stomach as she opened her mouth to speak. She snapped her muzzle shut, faint blue appearing across her face as she turned her eyes away in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, the knight couldn't help but chuckle slightly, his own stomach joining the chorus as he reached over for his pack. \u201cIt may not be what you're used to having, Princess, but I do have some travel rations that will ease the pangs. It should tide us over until we reach the guild by tomorrow midday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, taking the dried meat and fruit as he offered it, slowly nibbling the meat as her eyes warily roamed the valley, occasionally being forced to stare at the four features again and again. Nothing sat well about this place, and she recalled her mother having the same problem and well as her mother before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the princesses had ever wandered into this valley, preferring to give it a wide berth whenever they traveled near it. It was the same from generation to generation, from mother to daughter. Even the golem princess never dared travel these lands, and she was surely the longest lived princess being an automaton. All she would say on the matter, however, was that she had purged those records from her database with a reminder to never set foot in this place again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was on the seventh or eighth pass of the golden obelisk that they lay at the foot of did the princess notice the flaw in its surface. She tilted her head, puzzling where she had see that exact color of stone before, and at that size too. Could it have been that rock she had seen the other day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir knight, would you perchance have a yellow stone in your possession?\u201d She asked, handing back the uneaten fruits and meats to her stalwart companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh, yes. And before you ask, it did come from this monolith behind us. Hit me on the back of my head. If it weren't for my helm, I would never have made it to your kingdom.\u201d He said, rapping a fist against the steel perched on his head before taking out the rock from the other day. \u201cI never really take it off for just such reasons. Anyway, here's the rock.\u201d He said, passing it over without really caring. He didn't think the princess would get angry at him for not following the instructions on a mysterious rock from the land where no but him ever ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess took the rock, ignoring the feeling of disgust that threatened to overwhelm her at the mere touch of the stone and looked it over as she peered between it and the hole in the otherwise perfectly flat surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was the same chunk of stone that was missing, being perfectly flat on one side while every other side was roughly round. But, what was the strange writing? The words seemed to twist and snake around one another before her eyes, sometimes vanishing and reappearing on other spots of the rock that wasn't the flat side while others they seemed to sink deep into the core of the stone or surge forth from it, turning as if they floated in the water. They weren't any symbols she recognized though, and it was giving her a very bad headache just looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir knight, did you see this writing?\u201d She asked, pointing out the various squiggling lines and curves. \u201cIt's curious, isn't it? What do you think these symbols mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnseen, he cocked an eyebrow. He didn't know the Kobold princess was illiterate. Or maybe she took a harder hit to her head than he originally thought when she was thrown against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI read it the when I first picked it up, princess.\u201d He told her, looking at the top of her head. No, no blood or bruising to suggest brain damage. Maybe the back of her head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d She said, looking at him in renewed interest.\u201d I had no idea you were a mage or scholar as well, sir knight. Please tell me, what do these strange symbols mean? I feel myself getting woozy trying to keep track of them as they move around. They're not any language I am familiar with either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove around? Princess, it's written in the common tongue, plain enough for anyone to read.\u201d He said, slight worry creeping into his voice. \u201cI think we should be on our way and stop by the capital city of the humans to have you looked over by a doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it's not. And my vision is fine, thank you very much.\u201d She said, puffing out her cheeks in indignation. \u201cIf you can read it, tell me what it says.\u201d She pushed the stone into his hand, feeling slightly better once it left her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d The knight sighed, turning the stone in his hand to read the words once more to the princess, who listened very intently, her stomach dropping with each line that he completed. There was no doubt that it sounded like a prophecy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer knight had been given this piece of stone to start another quest, perhaps by providence. He would gain untold power, though the stone itself was worthless. But not entirely, because he had to throw it at the floating gem behind her so maybe it was a key and nothing else? And she tried to ignore the feeling that wormed into her heart when he read the line of trusting the writing to never let his balls blue. He would become the most famous man in the world if he completed this quest, which she felt was earned by the knight already. To fight against one of the dragon princesses and come out alive was already worthy of songs for ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the line about gaining the power to rule all thrones made her feel a tad bit giddy at the thought of the dragons getting their comeuppance for all they had done over the years. Maybe they could finally live without fear of the queen's wrath should she be dethroned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you should do it.\u201d She said, feeling something stir within her. \u201cThrow the stone and take whatever power awaits you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight looked over at her, puzzled once again by her. \u201cBut should I, really? I mean, what if this is an act of deception by infernal forces? No one but I had walked these lands for a long time, Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it matters little what you choose now, sir knight.\u201d She told him, looking at the hanging target with such intensity that it should have shattered then and there. \u201cA prophecy always comes true, and for power such as this to call out to you in such a manner it might be spurned by not taking it sooner rather than later. And it would be best for you to take it rather than let it fall into the hands of another. You have already proven yourself to be kind and noble, so I doubt you would use this power for evil purposes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight nodded at her reasoning, feeling his cheeks flush when she praised him so earnestly. It was not often that any of the princesses offered praise outside the occasional smile at a knight. But still, there was something she wasn't telling him if the grip she had on the candle when she picked it back up meant anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I take it that you wish to see the dragons pulled from the skies?\u201d He asked. \u201cThe power to rule all thrones does sound like it could do so with ease, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not lie to you, my knight.\u201d She told him evenly, turning to stare him squarely in the eye slits in his helm. \u201cI wish to see the destroyer of my kingdom on her knees and in chains before my rebuilt throne. I want my people to know justice for their loss, and I will not lie and say vengeance does not sound sweet to my ears. To have that fiend at my mercy as we were at hers, to take everything she holds dear away from her. If she would destroy my people for my rescuing you, then I would have her suffer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight stared back at her, matching stare for stare as he searched her eyes. He could see the hatred in her eyes, smoldering into her soul. It was a hatred he had seen too many times before, but amplified by magnitudes of power. This was the wrath of a displaced princess after seeing her people torn from their homes and all their work for naught. He didn't know how many had died, likely never would, but for the princess it was almost certainly a far greater loss than she had ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, the anger and hatred would do no good to let it consume her, not now when her people still needed her if only for the hope she could inspire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d He started. \u201cI would caution against focusing on vengeance. It brings only more problems down the road.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what would you have me do!?\u201d She yelled at him, tears forming in her eyes as she threw one hand up, the other clutching the candle to her tightly. \u201cDo we not live under the tyranny of the dragons? They take and take and take and never do anything else. When was the last time the queen or her daughters ever did anything to help the people that live under their rule? The Princesses of the kingdoms at least try and help their subjects, give them a goal to strive toward while keeping the peace where possible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath, shuddering and blinking away the tears. She cast her eyes down, her entire form drooping in a combination of deep sadness and righteous anger. \u201cI do not mean to take my anger out on you, sir knight. I am merely at my limit after so much has happened to my people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight slowly nodded, tentatively putting his hand on her shoulder in a comforting gesture. \u201cI understand, princess. It is not easy to lose those closest to you, and I can faintly understand what it must be like to lose an entire kingdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed, looking back up at her knight. She gave a small smile, using the back of her hand to wipe away a few tears. \u201cI thank you, my champion. No matter how long it takes, I will make sure you go down in the history of the kobold kingdom as a hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight smiled back at her through his helm, chuckling softly. \u201cWe'd better be on our way then, shan't we?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even if nothing comes of it, it would be better to clear the doubt from our minds that it might help us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight looked back to the rock he had set aside. The princess was right, and it was a simple process. Just throw the rock and be done with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock now in hand, he tossed it up in the air lightly a few times to get a good weight as he took aim. It wouldn't be difficult to hit the crystal on the first shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whip of his arm, he set the rock to fly with a whistle. It struck the crystal, sending cracks throughout the hovering jewel as it embedded deeply inside its target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEerily silent, the clear gem shattered, clattering to the ground as time seemed to stop. The world waited with baited breath, but for what neither knight nor princess knew. Nothing moved, even in this dead land, as the shards settled to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs moments ticked by, there was a subtle change in the air. It was heavier, ominous and ever so slightly oppressive. It caused sweat to form on the brow of the knight and the princess began to shake at the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot completely in fear, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as the knight moved to stand closer to the lizard-folk royalty, he felt it. The most important change in the air of the land. It was a surprise he hadn't noticed it before, being an altogether pleasant change compared to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking amidst the shards without moving, he noticed what appeared to be a small crack, like a door in the ground. From the slight upward movement of the air, it was coming from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, do you see this as well?\u201d He waited, not receiving an answer. \u201cPrincess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to his companion, only to find her fixated on the crack in the ground. Her entire body was shaking now, though it was only half terror now. Her pupils had widened to incredible size and... was that drool?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could start moving towards her to see if there was anything he could do, the lizard woman started moving towards the crack in the earth, the crystal flowing around her like water as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess!\u201d He called, walking as fast as he could, which wasn't very fast still, leaving his pack behind. As with the princess, the crystal seemed to flow around him, touching him but just so, never for very long and it returned to shape as he passed. \u201cPrincess, wait! Where are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she would not answer him. She moved towards the opening, which was now growing wider as the two approached, like a woman possessed. Something down there was drawing her into a trance of some kind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop, princess! Stop!\u201d He yelled out, fearing she would step into a hole and fall to her demise. \u201cDon't get closer to the hole!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she did not heed his warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining his already sore muscles to their limit, the knight sprinted towards her just as her foot went over the edge. He tried to angle it so a flying tackle would send both of them to the side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work. The knight turned as much as he could, clutching the princess in his arms as they fell into the darkness lit only by the candle. He would rather his back shatter than allow the princess to get hurt or worse. He would not fail again, and his honor would not let him do any less.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The knight grit his teeth, waiting for the pain to arrive. This was surely a steep staircase, as he had yet to hit a single step. He knew he was still falling down, the air rushing past them as they fell into this chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof~\u201d the air was pushed from his lungs as he felt his back hit the stone. Yet, it did not hurt him. It gave way, like a feather pillow but to a greater degree. He resisted the urge to cry out as he was flung back into the air, still going down the stair way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bounced at least a good ten more times, almost biting his tongue but barely managing to do so. The world was turning and spinning and rushing past him so fast he could make no sense of what he was seeing other than the fact that there were walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted in shock as he hit a wall, likely a landing, and was sent even further down the twisted ride he had found himself on. Faster and faster and faster they went, Kobold Princess much calmer than she had been up top, though he wished she would stop drooling on him and trembling in what he knew now was not terror in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown, down, down, down, landing, down, down, landing, down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly now, thought the knight as he kept Kobold Princess close even as she started to hump his body. When will this end? It feels like I've passed through the world at least twice now. Surely it must be getting to be night time on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the air wasn't musty and moldy as it should have been. With how far down they were, it should have been impossible to breath. Plus he was curious about the nature of the stairway, and more than a touch nervous. Would they be able to get back up, or would they be trapped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the bouncing stopped. Rather abruptly at that, though still not painful. Just enough firmness that he wouldn't bounce anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the knight sat up, Kobold Princess still tucked away into his arms as she ground her squishy bosom and her wet nethers into his body, drooling against his neck as the Red Candle nestled in the cleavage, he could feel the ground return to a firm state that felt as rocks should, not that springy, bouncy feeling that it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, spent equally between trying to clear his head and pry the lizard woman (and what a woman she was!) off his person, he gave up on the latter and stood with an arm keeping the princess from falling to the ground. He groaned when he had to dig the red candle from her bosom though, needing the light source to not run into a wall or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cautiously took his first step, making sure he wouldn't be sent on another bouncing adventure as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone walls, dark blue in color where the light of the candle touched, were all that greeted him. They were smooth, and when he ran his elbow against one it slid easily along its surface. The floor was smooth as well, but not nearly as smooth as the wall, and he tried to slip to no effect. Braziers dotted along the hallways, which were ever so occasionally broken by branching paths and hallways that looked like more of the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he kept going down the central corridor that he first landed in. No need to get lost, after all. Plus, loathe though he was to admit it, it seemed like the princesses \u201caffections\u201d were getting stronger the closer to the center of the place. Soon, the lizard woman could only moan softly, eyes rolling into the back of her head as her body went limp against his, tongue hanging out with a mindless smile stretched out across her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall way opened up into what looked like a throne room, though barren and lifeless he could not imagine what princess it had belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing of interest was the throne itself, which was high backed and imposing, with spikes surrounding the top of the back rest and loops of metal surrounding the base with piles of dust beneath them. Possibly ropes and the loops to bind them to the throne?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, though cautious, the knight dragged the princess up to the throne, ignoring the drool that soaked into his tunic. He raised an eyebrow at the large book he found upon the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dusty, though the leather was in decent condition. It was the size of the Merchant Princess's ledger, which was no small thing. Some of the other knights had joked about how she had written more than some particularly active wizards in a single tome than they had studied about magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always had the feeling they were more correct than they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow queer.\u201d He muttered, setting the candle on an arm of the iron throne. Taking the tome up in his hand, no small feat given the size, he gave it a look over. No markings on the front cover, nor one the back. Along the spine were wispy lines of gold and pink encircling an ebony bar of metal. The lines moved even as he gazed upon them, twisting and turning and growing wider and thinner at seemingly random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStranger and stranger.\u201d He muttered once more. \u201cI wonder what this is. Perhaps a journal of some kind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the book to the side opposite the candle, the knight weighed his options. He could either take the book now and read it later, or he could read it now. He was worried for the princess, but if this was a journal maybe there was some explanation as to what was happening to her and ways to stop it.</span></div></div>",

It was blasphemy among knights to sit on any throne, but he supposed that he would keep this a secret. It wasn't like anyone was going to catch him now, was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, certainly not. There were no footprints in the dust of the room besides his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSituating the princess so she was sitting on his lap, he jumped a bit when she suddenly lunged for his chest, only to relax as her arms wrapped around him and she began snuggling into his tunic once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps this is already wearing off,\u201d He whispered, placing a hand on her shoulder with a sigh. \u201cWhatever it is. Please come back to me, Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, without having to hold her, the knight was able to pick up the book much easier now. Flipping open the first page, the knight began to read.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nDay 57, weather: stormy and volatile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange weather patterns have been plaguing not just the continent of Am'cela, but the rest of the world. In these winter months, there has been little sign of snow, worryingly enough from what the Atmomancers tell us. Instead, it has been unusually clear, with strange lights in the sky. First they were rarely seen, once every week or so, but they have been increasing in their frequency at a rather alarming rate. The church is of no help, merely claiming it is the last days and the Stygian shall come from the beyond and devour the material and ethereal alike. The Kingdoms are on the brink of war, with \u201crumors\u201d of the princesses having been taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow I wish these were just rumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I am a knight of the realm. My orders have, thus far, been to try and keep the peace in these trying times. However, with this recent development, priorities have been changed. As such, I have been tasked with saving one of the kidnapped princesses, along with several other knights of the realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord is that these strange towers have popped up around the world. Armies have attempted to siege them, but they have all failed. It was thought they were impregnable until a rather strange enchantress approached the king of the High Forest, my own lord, with news of how to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Champion, a Knight, would have to enter the tower, alone, and face the trials. We might find the answers then, and perhaps the missing princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, if I read the missive I received not two nights ago right, then she had vanished into pink smoke upon uttering those last words, only to appear before another court. I am still awed by the speed of the messengers that run between kingdoms for news to travel as swift as it had among the courts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, I head for the tower closest to me, at the north western edge of Am'cela in the wild lands. It was only thanks to the soothsayers, the scryers and the prophets that work under our kings employ that I would not have to head in the opposite direction, this tower being unknown till just hours before the missive was written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, I must press on with less than I had expected to arrive at the tower with. I must have angered the gods, as my wagon was crushed beneath a tree. And then struck by lightning. Twice. At least I hadn't been hit by the lightning or the tree, so I must also give thanks for that. As well as the fact that I still have my horse, a small pack of supplies and my bed roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, I found the cave I am writing this message in. It seems that there was at least one person living out here, a hermit of some sort. The last settlement was at least a day and a half away in the best of weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found this journal that I now claim as my own. My previous one had been lost in the fire just hours ago. Not very knightly of me, but needs must. I must keep a record of what I do to present to the King when I return, and I am likely to forget all the things from before this journal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, I must rest. I only hope the hermit of this cave will forgive me for taking his journal and using his home for a single night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 58, weather: frustratingly hot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis weather will be the death of me yet. It must be. From yesterdays storm to this sweltering heat? It's as bad as the one time I was escorting an ambassador to visit the Lady of the Deserts in full regalia. Full plate-mail under the scorching gaze of the sun? Never again. I would make due with mere chain-mail and little else if I have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, it seems that the hermit that I have</i> *A few splotches of ink told the knight that the previous owner struggled to find a word to justify his theft* <i>taxed of his book was no mere hermit. Despite the rather sparse nature of the cave home, it seems I have been unlucky enough to pilfer a spell book of all things! I dread to think I might have only turned the odds further against me, in taking this. I can only hope that the wizard doesn't track me down to recover his book. Though why the first dozen or so pages are blank I'll likely never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't quite make out the words of the spells, merely snippets here and there, which is a shame. A spell book would come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I wonder what princess lies in the tower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 61, weather: Pleasant, like a spring day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see the tower, merely a quarters day journey from my campsite. With only my sword, my armor, my horse and the few supplies I keep in the pack that I thankfully had next to me when the tragedy of my wagon going up in flames happened, I have little hope I can survive whatever it is the tower wishes to throw at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the tower, the thing is almost a castle all its own from the look of it. Towering up amid the trees, scrapping and scratching at the night sky as if it meant to take the moon and stars, blacker than the night it stood against. The one saving grace is that I can see a pinprick of light on the upper portion, near the top. Maybe it's My princess? I certainly hope. That enchantress said they might have been in the towers, or at the very least possible answers to their whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have also been studying the spell book as well. Where I could barely make out a few words beforehand, now I could make out little over half of what I read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I must say, I am very intrigued about what the hermit was studying and creating. Spells for inducing and enhancing lust? A ritual for emboldening ones stamina and fortitude but at the cost of a permanent state of increased arousal? Potions that would partially turn women into beasts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to say it is depravity of the worst sort, but there is something about it that seems different. In a way I cannot describe, it is not as bad as some of the things nobles have gotten into. I see no real blood rituals in this book so far, nor human sacrifice, so at least there's that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder. If this is truly the end of the world, than it wouldn't hurt to at least learn about this type of thing, would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, perhaps I'll think on this tomorrow. I might have to use that ritual for stamina despite the price if I am to survive this endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope My princess is happy to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 65, weather: Still<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must admit I am slightly disappointed. Instead of the stunning beauty of Lady Irene, Princes of the High Forest, daughter to his Majesty, King Maximus, I have found myself guarding the crown princess of the Kobold people, Princess Altea Draketooth, daughter of Rosmouth Draketooth, the High Lord of the Kobold nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing challenging about the tower was the fact that I had to climb up all those stairs. At least fifteen levels, mostly empty save a few skeletons and a gibbering imp that was beheaded by my blade. Rather a disappointment, considering that I had used the ritual for stamina thrice over in preparation for both combat and climbing. I had also read up on some spells that would allow me mastery over creatures. Unfortunately there were no creatures that would be worth the trouble of casting the spells which includes slapping a piece of paper with a sigil on them. I had set up four just in case I ran into trouble, but it's good to be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder...</i></span></div></div>",

A pox upon me for besmirching the title and position of Knight of the Realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I must write it down for my own sake. So that I remember not to fall into this same trap again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out with Altea clinging to me as we left the tower. Her happiness upon rescue was to be expected, surely. To be whisked away, and by what she could not say, so suddenly and thrown into a cold empty tower must have been terrifying for the poor Kobold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as the day went on, she clung to me near constantly. Despite riding on a horse, where she would have clung to me regardless, her advances were unbecoming of any princess, save the barbarian tribes of the plains and their wild heiress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day wore on further, the weather took a turn for the worse. A winter wind descended from the north, sapping the Lizard of all her strength and warmth. Despite giving her my cloak and some drink to warm her did little to help. I spent the greater part of an hour battling with myself, wondering if I should bring her to sit in front of me despite my newfound problems with my loins. I was pent up, ready to \u201csow my seeds\u201d as it were since the day I had saved her, the day I used that accursed ritual!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn me thrice over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried, I really, truly tried to dissuade her from her affections. I had little attraction to her, really, being more at ease with ladies of human lineage instead of her scales and claws. Not to say that she was ugly, per say, but damn it! I was hoping to win the hand of Lady Irene from this quest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had begged me to \u201cshare the Warmth\u201d as it were, her cold blood keeping her from regaining the warmth the wind drained from her body as easily as a human or dwarf from what I remember. Her shivering was genuine, I could feel it as she huddled against my back. Despite my fears, I knew I must put aside my misgivings and protect the princess from the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I had done so, however, the demeanor of Princess Altea changed entirely. She pressed herself closer to me than was strictly necessary, mostly upon my aching manhood. I groaned at her ministrations, even through my thick pants and her scaled backside. This seemed to delight her, as she cooed at the way I hunched so slightly forward, trying to ignore these sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I must damn that ritual. To be pent up for days on end, and for a woman to be so eager to please, my mind was swiftly taken by lust. As soon as we found a spot to make camp, I took the princess like an animal, her teasing having driven all reason from my mind in my accursed state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not fight me, as she constantly begged for me to hold her close, to warm her in all way possible. To take her and flee, flee from her father and her responsibilities as princess. To breed her again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have found the peak of delight I don't know how many times this night. I sit here next to a warm fire, The Princess, my Lover, asleep in my lap, leaning against me as I write this, my maleness still speared inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI doubt she would wake if a dragon roared next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must get a separate journal when we reach town. That one to give, one that is removed of all of my shameful deeds. Even if I don't give it to the King in person, I can still send it off should I see a royal courier. I only wish I knew what to say to explain my absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 70, weather: Gentle spring rain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aching loins. Not a day goes by where I am satisfied, despite Altea's eager efforts. She has scarcely left my lap since that first night we coupled. She has even torn a hole in my pants so that she can engulf my pride in her soft folds as we ride towards the next settlement. Only to relieve herself does she leave me. Not to sleep, eat, drink or anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think she's pleased with my \u201cendurance\u201d as it were, because I have never once heard her complain about a single thing since then. She has been warm, content to do nothing but try and breed with me as if she were in heat. But I know from previous warnings that the Kobold heat isn't until the summer months, and it is only now nearing spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the surprisingly nice weather these past two days, she has claimed that her actions are for \u201cwarmth\u201d and little else. At least, until the night where I can take more action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also think the horse is quite tired of our actions upon its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtra apples for it when we get back to a proper town instead of these backwater settlements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder when it will be, and if I can keep news from spreading of our activities when we ride into town as we are. There will be no way to hide it when we do, I imagine.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight continued to read, blushing. He noticed something strange though. The book he was reading, this journal, had said that only the first dozen pages were blank. However, he had read at least two dozen, and there were still more. There was something strange about this book, and now he wanted to get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journal went on to talk about how the Knight of the Realm, Sir Ace as he was known, gained strength beyond mere men, feet faster than any messenger or horse, endurance that allowed him to go for days, and shortly after, for weeks without so much as a minutes break doing any otherwise tiring task. He had tested this on Sir Laurence the Lone-Heart, another Knight who was supposedly half giant. Giants were known for their amazing strength, even their half-breeds. For him to simply toss the man as if he were a piece of parchment was astounding, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight also read about Sir Ace's use of all the books contents. Not merely spells and rituals, but artifacts of great power and worth. For example, the passage he was currently reading, not noticing the Kobold Princess sleeping soundly against him.</span></div></div>",

I have yet to find Lady Irene to test the previous effectiveness, but I have heard rumors of a tower in the heart of the deserts of the south that is yet untouched by a Knight, though there have been tales of it being an exceptionally hard tower from a supposed survivor of the tower who went mad shortly after. Maybe the Princess is there? And if I find her, I shall utter the word that resounds in my mind still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, I now have something called <u>The Lover's Necklace</u>. I should give this to a woman who I desire, and she will love me forever more. If I had found that first, I might have spared Altea the shackles she now bears. Though she seems much happier to bear them than she ought, I would think. I am still ashamed and aroused in equal measure as I remember that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, I wonder why it gave me this item now, and not one of the other mystical objects it contains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, I must continue searching for Lady Irene. I must also try and obtain a wolf's heart still for that ritual that would keep woman from running me out of town by themselves. I would only need to worry about the men then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 143<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat luck! A desert wolf ran afoul of me today, and I have taken its heart.

No more cookwares being thrown at me, or waking to bar wenches trying to turn me into a eunuch or girls crying for their fathers when I pass no matter how much I cover up. It's almost as if they sense something off about me, but I don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I had to dispatch some more warrior monks sent to kill me from the church. If I was still as weak as I was when I started this journey, I would surely have died. It was only thanks to my enhanced ability to dodge and attack at immense speeds that allowed me to kill them. No doubt these monks were sent directly by an angel to kill me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fear what will happen soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 145<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days of fighting the angel. When the monks didn't report back, it seems the angel that sent them had had enough of me killing their agents. To come and fight me in person, there must have been something I did to anger the entire heavens, but I don't know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the angel, Saraphaea she tells me, does not know. She was only told that I must die to prevent a terrible future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI doubt that our fight has gone unnoticed, even in the miles of empty desert around us. We reshaped the landscape as we did battle, with Saraphaea turning a good three miles of desert to glass in the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must thank this book, for the gods seem to want me dead now, for helping me win this. Without its influence, I would be dead a hundred, a thousand times over. It was only thanks to the necklace it has given me that I was able to come out of this alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the necklace that now lies around Saraphaea's neck. She leans against me, snuggling into my side as she rests from our fight. Since she has put on the necklace, she has treated me with the utmost love and compassion, the kind that exists only in bards songs and the hearts of hopeless romantics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, her touch is feather light as her hand explores my chest, her breath airy as she breaths in my scent and giggles to herself. She even cooked the meal that fed the three of us as if it was her duty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, this book is the greatest boon a man could ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 150<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree companions join me on my adventures today. Only one of them was expected, that being the Lady Irene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I first entered the tower, Altea and Saraphaea in tow, I was not expecting to find a vault of treasure with a lone occupant among the horde. A mimic, the most advanced I'd ever seen at that, tried to assault us for trying to take some of her delicious treasure from her. Of course, it was only after Altea had attempted to pick one coin up, as she merely smiled at me when I approached, having picked up a few gems myself for ritual components.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only thanks to my quick reflexes, again I must thank the book for them, that allowed me to slip a third artifact onto the humanoid mimic. This one was called <u>The Empathic Rings</u>. I was wondering if I should use this on anybody, but this saves me from feeling like I have killed the mind and soul of a sentient being, or at least locked it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now wore the male ring of the set, while the Mimic, who I have decided to call Thespiea,bears the female half, allowing me to control her emotions, and in turn her simple mind. I could feel the never ending hunger, just bubbling beneath the surface. She hungered for treasure, for flesh, for all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimics, a voracious race. Devourers of anything that fell to their traps. Some claim them to be punishers of  the greedy, others claimed that they were the souls of particularly greedy people who were turned from paradise and became monsters after their death. Many theories surrounding these, the bane of adventurers and plunderers alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA terrifying species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, with my control, I decided to twist that hunger into something useful for me, for my growing group. A hunger for my love, an unwavering need for my approval and an insatiable yearning to make me powerful in anyway she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple instructions for a simple creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few words to her, a stroke of her cheek, Thespiea devoured her horde of treasure, the entire thing, with her dress. It let out a small burp as she sauntered back over to me, eagerly putting my hand upon her head with the two arms that emerged from the mimic body that made up her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree mimics fused into a single entity. That's what I deduced Thespiea was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really seemed to like me petting her head as well, if the way she drooled as my hand massaged her head mimic was any sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was a simple fight up the tower, with Thespiea eagerly devouring any monsters in our path. I still had yet to find any that I would like to enslave with the seals I made so many weeks ago. Maybe if I found a mythical beast such as a manticore or a dragon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, they would do nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, we scaled to the top of the tower, Altea riding my now permanently aroused girth as usual, Saraphaea floating at one side while Thespiea clung to my other side, growling in happiness at my mere presence and her recent meals. When we reached the top, I opened the door to find the Lady Irene, waiting eagerly for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her dirtied and worn clothing, she seemed to be in great health. No signs of starvation or dehydration, no cuts or scraps, not even the expected smell of her waste from being in the tower for many months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed surprised at who her rescuers were, as well as embarrassed at the state of Altea and I, but she quickly rushed to embrace me, thanking me over and over again for saving her. She rained kisses upon my face, ignoring the fact that she pressed Altea between us, touching my engorged maleness or the constant dripping of my fluids onto her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost forgot the word, so happy to see My princess safe and sound once more. But I still managed to utter it to her, after asking if the word meant anything to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must confess, the blank look on her face both worried and excited me. Once I told her she could go back to what she was doing, she smiled once more, giving kisses to me again and again as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems I am gathering a harem of princesses, and I would have to be blind to see it. I thank this book a million times over once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last companion was the most surprising. Lady Helena Fellsword, Leader of the Moon's Band mercenary guild, Knight of the Realm and dubbed the \u201cPrincess\u201d of all Knights. Rather telling about my luck, is it not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple conversation in the tower, helped spurred by both the fact that Helena wished to know how I fared in the supposedly unbeatable tower and that we were both old acquaintances. I had dueled her in a few tournaments beforehand, and it wasn't surprising to see at least a squad or two of her men while on a quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simple to present her a second necklace that the book gave me, <u>The Amulet of Twisted Justification</u>, which would allow me to tell her anything, absolutely anything, and for her to rationalize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tests, such as asking her to exercise, to give me leadership of the Moon's Band, to lick the flat of her sword, to kiss Irene, bark like a dog, get naked, pleasure herself, tell me her darkest secret, sweep the entire first floor of the tower, sing some bar songs and lick Altea's nether lips clean of my seed all culminated in telling her she should become my own loyal Knight, Lover and Slave all rolled into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of which she rationalized to herself, even going so far as to present me her Grandfather's sword for winning her loyalty and love alike. Graciously, I accepted, but quickly returned to her so she could adequately preform her task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think my plans have changed.</i></span></div></div>",

I will never harm you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggle that followed was soft and light, tinkling like church bells in the distance. So sweet, so soothing. The knight felt himself relax, despite his best efforts. A hand upon his helm slowly pulled his gaze to his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as his male-hood went incredibly stiff, almost painfully so. The vision of beauty before him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarger than he was, she floated off the ground with wings that looked like cerulean silk. Her flawless skin was white like the stars of the night sky, and he could not help but reach out to touch her. With another giggle, she drew closer to him, grabbing his hand and placing it on her flat stomach, allowing him to feel the otherworldly softness of her skin and the literal vibrations of magical energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a black garter belt that connected to light teal stockings with six white circles on each, three on the inner portion and three on the outer. Two sashes crossed diagonally over her chest, preserving her moderately sized modesty while following the pattern of her stockings, only back and front instead of to the sides. Her face was set in a serene smile, relaxed at almost sleepy. Her eyes were closed, with a line coming down from the bottom lid of each eye. Her hair was fluffy, like a cloud he imagined, a mix of platinum and gold colors, somehow cascading down her back, below her thighs, hanging just inches above the floor even in her floating state. Floating above her head was a disk of light that he could just make the tip of a crown over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so you have returned once again, my Love.\u201d She said, leaning down. \u201cAnd you have brought Altea's Remade descendant with you as well? How marvelous.\u201d She gave an even gentler smile (How was that possible?) at the Kobold. \u201cAlthough it seems she is affected by your lingering powers. Do not fret, she will return to her senses by the time wakes, now that you've touched the Tome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand reaches out, as if to caress the tome, but is pulled back with a sigh as magical energy leaps angrily at her outstretched fingers. \u201cIt seems you still don't trust me, Tome. How unfortunate.\u201d She murmurs sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaraphaea?\u201d The knight whispered, dimly recalling the name in the journal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She says, tilting her head to the side with a confused frown on her face. \u201cWho else would I be? I am certainly not Helena, Altea, Irene or any of the others. Ah, you must still be confused. I'm not surprised. You've shown up earlier than we thought. We all thought the last death would last longer, so Veronica hasn't found you, has she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother laugh escaped her as she floated closer to you, almost sitting beside the Kobold in your lap. The book sparked again, but she paid it no mind. \u201cYes, it seems you found your way here on your own then. You would definitely remember the Enchantress if your paths had crossed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, I was hit in the head by a rock, Milady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother laugh, though her hand did move to the top of your head. \u201cI trust your helm saved you from any wounds, Love?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight could only nod dumbly at her. Her hand was so warm, even through the helm. Not like the warmth of a fire, but the warmth of a lover, a blanket shared on a cold winter night, a romantic moment that warms the soul in a storm. Any aches he had felt since that run yesterday seemed to fade as she rubbed circles on the metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I always miss this. Just being in your presence, so close to you. It's warm and gentle. Every time I go back to slumber, I dream of caressing you once more. Allowing us to bask in the presence of the other. To feel your hand in mine, a gentle touch that soothes my soul.\u201d She whispered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight wished to stay like this forever, in the embrace of this angelic princess. He so desperately wished to do so, almost a need it was so warm. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not your love, Princess.\u201d He muttered softly, forcing the words out while trying to hold them in. \u201cI am merely a knight, and almost certainly now a failed one at that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed gently at your proclamation, shaking her head. \u201cDon't be silly. You are my Sir Ace, My Love. You are just reborn again, like you have been many times before. But we have had this talk a thousand times, so I shall humor you once again. Come with me, this empty throne room is ill suited for a talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating away from him and around the throne, the knight had little choice to follow. Mesmerized as he was, however, he hoisted the Kobold in his lap to better hold her as he grabbed the candle, the book landing on the floor with a loud thump as he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping around the throne gave him the sight of another passageway, though this one was lit slightly with pale motes of light. Sometimes they were pink, other times they were gold or green, even the same blue as the stones themselves which offered little help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel, Saraphaea, floated ahead of him, waiting by an off shoot. She disappeared down the new passage as he neared, opening a door a short way down the hall if the sound of a handle moving reverberating through the emptiness was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the path of the angel, the knight found himself walking through an open door into a well furnished room. It was homey, with wooden furniture, save the bed that was made of stone hollowed out, and furs all over the place. A fire crackled at the back of the room, though there was light in the room from a strange ball of light in the center of the ceiling. It bobbed to and fro, spinning slowly as he shut the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d Saraphaea spoke, drawing his eyes toward the bed. \u201cTuck the Princess in, and settle yourself in a chair. Much better than the throne room for now, isn't it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight shivered pleasantly at her words. It was as if she knew something would come to pass, as if it had happened before and will happen again. While he wasn't so sure, he did as asked. Slipping the Kobold away from him gently, he pushed the Princess underneath a blanket of what looked to be a dire wolf pelt, if the coloration and the size was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a chair next to the bed and setting the candle on the nightstand allowed the knight to gaze upon the angel once more. She still smiled warmly, despite never opening her eyes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small wave of her hand caused two cups to materialize in the air along with a pot that smelled like tea with a hint of mint. Pouring them with a flick of her finger, the knight found himself opening his helm and sipping the delightful concoction before he knew what he was doing.</span></div></div>",

Now please,\u201d Letting go of his hand to touch his battered chest. \u201cExplain to me how your wounds came to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight sighed, looking to the lizard-woman so snug in her new bed.

Her face was set in a stern frown, and Anon wondered if something dangerous would happen in the small, comfy confines..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, with a sigh, all became still once more. Saraphaea floated gently into his lap, wrapping her arms around his neck as she pressed her lips lightly to his cheek. When did she get smaller? She surely would not have fit so well in his lap before. \u201cI am not surprised. Her mother was never the kindest, and with her rage against you powered by the fearful gods and terrified demons, it is no surprise she would spread the hatred as far as possible. You say that there has been no one besides you to walk the surrounding lands?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone, Lady Saraphaea.\u201d Anon told her truthfully, biting back a yawn. \u201cNot a single soul, from lowliest beetle to even the Dragon Queen has so much as flown over these lands. Princesses avoid the land as if it was to invite death, or something was pushing them away. It is only the Princess's predicament that pushed her to follow me to these lands. The Church, I know, tells everyone to avoid these lands. It has done that since anyone can recall. At least, when it isn't crying on about the evils of lust and badgering people to abstain from all matter of physical relationships. They talk of little else anymore, not even the grace of the gods. They are fixated on stamping out anything they deem to be lustful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is worse than I fear, then.\u201d She muttered, pushing a little healing power into her fingers, drawing a relieved sigh from the Knight as the bruises faded and the red scars and scabs vanished. \u201cWhile I do not like lewd or perverse things, this much is true, I do understand that to stamp out any physical relationships is quite abhorrent. It seems you shook the gods once again, last you walked these lands. To give the Dragon Queen power over the lands with both divine and infernal backing is quite worrying. They must be close to letting the Stygian horde free again, and the Church must be placating them as much as possible, trying to stamp it out before it comes to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps...\u201d Anon said, thinking back over past sermons he had attended. \u201cBut I must ask you, Saraphaea, if you do not like the lewd or Perverse, why did you follow Sir Ace? Especially after you saw how deep the lust dwelt within him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not the first time you have asked me that.\u201d She smiled dourly at him. \u201cAnd I doubt it will be the last if things take a turn for the worse again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached under her sashes, pushing a necklace into view. It had been hidden completely, but it was a beautiful thing. Gold and silver entwined around a ring of diamond, glittering in the light of the room. It looked like it should have once been an actual ring, though it was too small to fit a finger. Maybe the Goblin princess could have worn it, but Anon did not know for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt started with this. You would recall it as The Lover's Necklace, from the journal entries. It bound me to love Sir Ace, as if I had loved him all my life. But, at the end of his life, he took it back from me. I attempted to kill him then and there. Not out of hatred, mind you, but of disgust and duty alike. I had seen, and at his behest done, some rather crass and base acts. But, by that point, I could not hold a candle to his power. He let me strike him, again and again, using all my power to try and scratch him. But alas, it was for naught.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted uneasily, uncaring as she ground into the lap of her reborn love as she wrapped him in a hug. \u201cI hate reliving these memories, but I must answer your question. After I was done, he wrapped me in a hug, apologizing with all his soul. He spoke, for a moment, of wishing he had never found the Tome, that it had chosen someone else. But, I knew I was the one in the wrong, deep inside. I do not begrudge the likes of Verda or Aurilla, whose domains encompass lust and sensuality both. His powers were as much his domain as theirs were. It was natural for him to exercise his powers, to push for his own influence. But he still wanted to save us all, despite all he had done. A knight till the very end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnon stayed silent. That couldn't be all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, that wasn't that event that changed my outlook on him, my outlook on the totality of his, your, soul. It took many a lifetime. Some were worse than others, true, while others never came to their rightful power. Some were kind, others cruel. Some wished not to fight, only to please, while more sought to bring goodness into the world in various ways. Some were goblins, gnomes, giants and ogres, though many were human, such as you. It was only twenty Remakings ago, where he posed me the questions before I returned to the crystal that changed everything. Despite all the things I had seen him do after countless lives, all the great atrocities committed, did he not also preform great miracles? Did he not love, despite the hatred some of his lives had been filled with? Could I honestly say that he cared for me less than my previous divine patron had? He had saved me from being Remade, after all. Saved us. Time after time after time, he had allowed us to continue, sending a perfect copy in the second Remaking to be remade into the newest world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, it was the way he posed it, and the sorrow with which he asked. That life was a tragic one, like few lives had been. His name was Richard, the Knight of Tragedy. Very few things had gone right in his life. In fact, the gods had singled him out for what he was, what he could become. Framed for murder of an entire family of nobles, accidentally starting no less than four civil wars, ten kingdom wars and three holy crusades, slaying an arch-demon but in the process setting of an entire volcanic range and splitting the earth. There was not a place where his name wasn't spoken with hatred and fear. Calamity followed him like a demented, love struck puppy. Only here, within the walls of this castle, in the arms of us who had been with his soul since this all started, did he find a moments respite. In the end, he died fighting the Remaking, failing to stop it yet again. But, he left a note, one for each of us, to be the first thing we saw when next we were released. He once more apologized for the actions of his first life, but oh so happy that he was able to meet us, to bring us happiness in this world that denied him the ability to do so for all others. He left what many would consider the greatest gift looking from the outside. Can you guess what that gift was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnon blinked his eyes, realizing her had been stroking her hair as she told her story, holding her close to him. The words echoed in his head, the question pounding at the forefront of his thoughts. What was the gift? What could it be that someone would consider to be...</span></div></div>",

That's good.\u201d Saraphaea smiled against his neck, giving him a soft kiss in appreciation. \u201cYou're right. He took back all the artifacts of power before we were sealed away once again, ripping away the spells that bound us to him and releasing all vows of fidelity. Free to do what it was we wished, free from his influence. He ordered the Tome to let us free in the next life if we so wished it, to free us the second it was safe to do so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you didn't go...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother kiss upon his neck, a sigh of content as her fingers lifted his helmet the rest of the way off. When had she started removing it? Ah, right, she was kissing his neck. She would have had to have lifted it up somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a single one of us. Altea begged for her shackles as soon as we left the crystal, weeping for the warmth they now gave her soul that she had lost. Irene simply went about her duties as before, as if she was still under thrall. Thespiea brought back new treasures, more diligently than ever, hungering for the approval that wasn't around just yet. Helena left her grandfather's sword on the throne, vowing to train as hard as possible that she might not leave her Liege and Love alone when next he faced the Stygian horde, only to return when she felt worthy of his praise or was called. She'bal did what she could to rouse the new Damned Queen of Lust to action, to gather as much strength as possible for her Great Mother's chosen master. And so on, with each one of us princesses striving to greater heights, greater lengths for him, for you, for them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what of you?\u201d The knight asked, eyes closed as a delicate hand glided through his hair, his eyes growing heavy. \u201cWhy did you stay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, dear Anon,\u201d She kissed him upon the lips, feeling his breath slowly even out. \u201cIt's all I ever wanted. A lover to hold, sisters and true friends alike, a place where I could escape from my heavenly duties. No mindless zealots, no fear of ever displeasing my god, of being erased for some failure. I have a home, all the food I could dream of and all the times I get to fall in love all over again. This necklace holds no sway over my heart any more. I wear it because it was a gift, the thing that gave me my loving god. Now, sleep. You are weary still from your ordeals. The Kobold and I will still be here when you awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last vestiges of his strength failed him, darkness sweeping over him as Saraphaea hummed lightly against him. He felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeace.</span></div></div>",

He had been asleep for an hour now, and while she would love nothing more than to stay until he woke once more, she had things to do, preparations to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and she did not like being peeped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two know I hate being spied on.\u201d She spoke to the shadows outside the door as she left her reborn god to his slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless it is him doing the spying, of course?\u201d One asked her, the impish smile profoundly implied in her tone. \u201cWouldn't mind then, especially when-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I hadn't expected either of you back so soon. He only opened the seal mere hours ago.\u201d Saraphaea cut off the speaker, blush dusting her cheeks as she tried to push away those numerous memories that had been brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've just returned from scouting out the newest kingdoms that have popped up in the last ten years, along with some that have only now started to reemerge from hiding. I would have been back a few weeks ago, but I ran across a new kingdom, only a few months old. Saraphaea, what I found out about that new kingdom... We have to deal with it quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea frowned at this news. The shadow that spoke to her did not usually make judgment calls like that unless it was really important. Nor did she let any emotion ever seep into her voice regarding business, so the tiniest hint of anger was rather surprising as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. When I awaken the others, you can tell us about it. They will be eager to greet Sir Ace's newest form, after all. And from the way you say this it has really upset you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is <i>blasphemy</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea pursed her lips at that. This did not sit well. Her plans would have to wait it would seem, until she knew what it was that was blasphemous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear oh dear, it really has riled you up. Go ahead and rest up. As soon as Sir Anon has woken up, we shall head immediately for the Haven. Meet us there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the shadows immediately faded away, disappearing from the hall without any trace of movement. No questions, just a single minded will to do what must be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, so something has shaken Nexi, has it?\u201d The first shadow to speak asked. \u201cHer devotion is always so refreshing to see though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are all devoted, Veronica.\u201d Saraphaea frowned at the hidden woman. \u201cYou know this well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but of course I do.\u201d The Enchantress spoke, letting the shadows around her fall. \u201cI know exactly how devoted you all are to our god, what lengths you will go to in order to enact his will. It's pleasing to see it in action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea sighed, nodding. The Enchantress wasn't wrong in that regard. As a divine being herself, she loved to see expressions of faith. More so for her god and love than when she was merely a servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, I think I know what she's talking about. I'll wait until we all convene, however. Much easier that way.\u201d She said, turning to walk away. \u201cI will soon have a gift for our Lord. Freshly made, straight out of the thaumaturgy ovens. I think it will be a deciding factor this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Veronica walked away from the angel without another word. Saraphaea sighed at the vagueness that the woman loved to part with at every occasion. She hadn't failed them yet, however, so she would always give her the benefit of the doubt.</span></div></div>",

A light blanket covered him, his helm hanging from the back of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching, the knight stood up, setting the cover back where he once sat. Slipping on his helm, Anon looked over to the Kobold Princess. Still asleep. Right, she hadn't been getting much sleep with the problems in the mines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only...\u201d He muttered, shaking his head. No, can't focus on that for now. Just gotta... do something. Gotta plan, and make sure the Princess was safe. That was imperative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA note sat on the table, underneath the Red Candle. It was almost certainly for him, so he didn't feel like he was intruding when he picked it up and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My Lord,<br>\r\n\tFrom what you told me, the dragons are causing the world a bit of strife, specifically the Queen and her youngest. I might have a solution, but it will take meticulous planning. It also seems that some things have come up that haven't in any other Remaking, making me wonder what the gods are trying to pull. Please, meet me in the throne room when you awaken. There is much to do before you leave here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Forever yours,<br>\r\nSaraphaea</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading it over again, Anon could only sigh with a nod to himself. \u201cI have little other recourse, I think. I doubt I will be able to topple the dragons on my own or with an army. Especially if the Queen gets involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to think about the gods themselves getting involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Anon strode into the throne room, eyes cautiously roaming. He wished for a blade, even just a shield, to defend himself with. He felt almost naked without either armament on his person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he still had his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have awoken, I see.\u201d The calming voice of Saraphaea flowed into his ears, calming him as his eyes sought her form without his express permission. \u201cI do hope you feel better than before you slept.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, she was sitting on the steps up to the throne, tracing a hand over the sole piece of furniture. She beckoned him over as soon as he came into sight, though her eyes never opened once. They never had since he had met the angel, now that he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. I take it you healed me?\u201d He asked, getting a small nod. \u201cThen I must thank you. My body was utterly exhausted from my flight from the Kobold mines, and the cuts and bruises were doing me no favors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is no trouble, Sir Anon.\u201d Saraphaea whispered. \u201cI only wish you had followed that small stone's instructions when you first received it. Things would have been much different. You would not have had to face the pain in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the Princess would not have lost her castle or her people.\u201d Anon whispered to himself bitterly. A calming breath. She hadn't meant to upset him. She was too gentle a soul. He knew that just from talking with her for the short time before his slumber. \u201cAnyway, you said you needed to speak with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Saraphaea turned her face from the stone. \u201cOh, yes. There are a few things that need doing. All will be elaborated upon when we do those.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight nodded his helmed head, offering his hand. \u201cVery well. Shall we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile, gentle, as she took his hand. So soft, like the rest of her. Dainty. Pure. As if he were holding light and love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould someone like her really...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm. Maybe life wasn't so bad... He could certainly get some help finding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. She was dead. They were all dead. He had to let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Anon, is something the matter?\u201d Saraphaea asked, jerking him from his thoughts. She was looking at him, frowning in concern. His hand was clenched tightly in hers, turning white enough to match the divine being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, no. I am sorry, Saraphaea. Pay it little mind, please.\u201d He forced his hand to relax, almost wanting to take his hand back. He didn't want to mar her beauty with his sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated there, silent as her concern grew deeper. She continued to stare at him without opening her eyes, seemingly searching his soul. <i>Please, do not pry. Not yet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight nod, though no ease overtook her features. \u201cVery well. I shall wait until you wish to tell me, tell us. Please, remember that those you will soon meet have loved your soul for countless life times. We have seen and worked through tragedies most bards would never put to song, no matter the price. When you are ready, just speak. We will listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow heartfelt. Her words, the emotion that shone through with each syllable. Each word warmed his heart, but at the same time stabbed him with guilt. Did he really deserve any of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, surely not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you should pick up the Tome. It will just follow us if you don't.\u201d She told him, gesturing. It was on the throne itself, as if it had never fallen. Who could have touched it, if Saraphaea could not? Wait, it would follow them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow us?\u201d He asked, getting a nod in return. \u201cOf course. Not the strangest thing to happen lately.\u201d Taking the large book in hand, he followed the angel back down the corridor he had just came from, though he went further than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown stairs that, thankfully, did not send him bouncing again. Even deeper into the earth. Surely by now they had gone through the other side, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place is very special.\u201d Saraphaea told him when he asked. \u201cOnly the entrance is connected to the plane you call home. After crossing that threshold, you enter what most mages have called a pocket-dimension, a demi-plane, a closed space. In truth, it is much more than that. This land is saturated in your power, the magics that permeate your soul filling every single brick. It has soaked in the depths of your essence since it was constructed so very long ago. The gods dare not touch it, even the Stygian leave it be when they consume all else. It has existed since Sir Ace built it, and has never suffered an intruder since. It cannot hurt you, unless you specifically will it. I remember one of your gnome selves hitting his head on a wall one time and he fell into the next room. He was a high-strung fellow, to be sure. But he was also a good scientist. He usually hit his head to try and clear his thoughts, the things in his mind rarely giving him peace. Those were interesting years.\u201d She sounded fond, even of his strange past self.</span></div></div>",

Well, last I counted it had at least seven numbers in it. Maybe one of those was a half, or maybe three-quarters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnon steeled himself. He didn't know if he would like the answer. \u201cNo. I meant how many of these Remakes have happened? You've been here since the beginning, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She muttered, putting a hand on her chin, tapping her lips with delicate fingers. \u201cIt's been so long. So very, very long. How many commas were in the number? At least one hundred and forty six, I think. It's a very large number. Maybe you should ask the Tome? It likes to take note of these things, and can provide them if you were to ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight just stopped, hearing that number. Now, he was not nearly as smart as the Merchant Princess when it came to numbers, but even he knew that even just one comma when dealing with numbers was a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnon, are you alright?\u201d Saraphaea stopped, floating back to him. \u201cWe really do need to awaken the others, but if you are feeling unwell...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped the knight, suddenly feeling so very tired again. Just curl up in the hall, on the warm stone and go back to bed. But, duty calls, and he must press onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm fine. Just... trying to wrap my mind around that number. Let's press on. I'll ask this Tome later what it knows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea nodded, taking his hand in hers and giving it a gentle squeeze. In silence, she led him down the unnecessarily large corridor, one that had no branching paths that he could see. But the walls were kind of far away, and here the motes of light were fewer in number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe've been walking for a long time, Milady.\u201d The knight mentioned. \u201cI am worried about the Kobold Princess, back upstairs. What if she were to wake while we were down here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorry not. The magics of this place have sent her into a deep slumber, emboldened when I saw you to your own sleep. Her body is also acclimating to the 'feel' of the atmosphere, so she is not a completely lust-driven beast when she wakes. And, should she wake, she will be drawn where she need be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded vaguely ominous. But there was little to do for it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they walked, down the corridor. At some point Anon wondered if he was simply going mad, having walked for so long. The only thing that changed, so far, was the position of the motes of light, floating listlessly in the air, changing colors slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, we're almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a grand door it was! Tall and wide, at least twenty of himself were he to stand on his own head and thirty abreast. It was a spiral of five colors, being Pink, Gold, Obsidian, Ivory White and Deep Blue. They all met in the center, forming a heart that was a kaleidoscope of all the colors constantly shifting and fractling. It shone in the dim corridor, a distinct hum of power emanating from it with pulses like the beating of a heart echoing in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had he not noticed until they were within touching distance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is 'here?'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the place we come to, when the Stygian are upon us. Where we sleep through the Remaking, blissfully unaware of the final horrid moments of creation before all returns to nothing.\u201d She said, placing a hand on the door. \u201cIt is our Haven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small push, gentle enough to push a soap bubble without popping it, the door opened. The heart split evenly in two, each piece somehow gaining twice the brilliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading him in, Saraphaea let out another sigh, this one filled with happiness. \u201cWe are here again, sisters. It is time to awaken once more.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He and Saraphaea had entered onto the VIP box, if he remembered the terminology right. To either side of the box was a ramp, slopping down into a ring that branched down yet again, going deeper and deeper. A quick peek over the ledge showed that the bottom was so far down it was actually impossible to see from this height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, most of all, the Crystal beds, with curtains that looked very much like crystal if it were somehow spun into a fine sheet. They were all shades and hues of any and all colors he could imagine and more. Rows and rows of beds, going up and down like some kind of Colosseum of dreamers, nestled away in appropriately sized alcoves. So many shapes and styles, from simple miner cots and peasant beds to the most elegant of feather mattresses, from military bunks to Kobold nests and makeshift roosts to piles of crystal furs and crystal coins. All of them were filled, in one way or another, with a slumbering woman, be they human or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight could only look about, mouth agape. Tears, unbidden, sprang to his eyes, cascading down his cheeks. There were no words, no expressions that could adequately describe the sheer beauty of this world. And it was a world, so vastly different from the hall he had just came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not fight Saraphaea as she wrapped him in a warm embrace, once more resting her head on his shoulder with a contented hum, smiling all the while. She giggled, the sound echoed and the majesty it held with it, when he returned the gesture, still gazing around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the expression I love the most when I show you this room for the first time. Very few reincarnations have disappointed me in that regard.\u201d She whispered to him, letting him soak it all in for a few more moments. \u201cCome, we must go to the bottom and wake the guardian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped him out of it. \u201cWait, guardian? You mentioned no Guardian.\u201d He spoke quickly, trying to  keep silent. He dared not disturb anyone in this sacred place. \u201cAnd how are we going to get down there? It will take forever to walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, there is a guardian. One chosen by the Tome you carry with you to protect everything you hold dear in your absence, should we all be asleep and something to go awry. An almost non-existent chance here, but precautions were never something to be ashamed of. As for getting down there, I must ask two questions. Are you afraid of heights? Do you trust me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit, yes. And... I do.\u201d Sir Anon answered, feeling that the second answer was more true than the first, despite only having known the angel for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm glad. Please, hold on.\u201d Her embrace grew tighter, and with a eager flap her wings expanded greatly, pushing them over the edge. She smiled at him, flapping her wings as they hovered over the pit, the lights from the surrounding crystals seemingly focusing on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Anon could only hold her tight as she giggled once more. One last flap and she pulled her wings in, wrapping them in a thick cocoon of angelic feathers. He could hear, if not feel, the whistling of the wind as they turned upside down. He clung to the angel, pressing his face into her bosom. When had she gotten larger? Oh yes, when she had pulled him over the ledge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tome, pressed into her back, couldn't decide whether or not to spark at her. After all, she was pressing his head into her breasts. But she was also making the Marked one fearful of heights and that would prove to be a barrier when it came to high-flying sex-capades and joining the mile-high club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the small zap of only slightly angry magic on her back, the angel just kept laughing. She rubbed her hand in circles on her love's back, happy to press him against her cleavage. Hmm, just a little bigger and she could have him touching her in both of her sacred spots...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight soon found his head engulfed with the under-cleavage of the angel, who had grown yet again. Her crotch, now larger than his waist, grew warm and damp. One of her now larger hands wasted no time in pressing his crotch to the bundle of nerves that was her clit, moaning now between bouts of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnon could only groan as the feelings he was being forced to feel spread through his body. The feel of Saraphaea's body was enough to push all worries about hitting the ground at sufficient speed to turn him into a red coating for the crystals around him to the side. Her skin, so soft and smooth, her breasts felt like pillows made of clouds as her breathed in the smell of rain from her skin. The hand that was pressing his crotch against her own was gentle, and the warmth emanating from her, the sheer heat, was enough to make his knees go weak as his virile maleness stood to full attention. Even though their clothes, he still felt every sensation as she twitched every so often with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown, down, down, down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep, deep, deep down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles and miles and miles and miles down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa boy, they'd been at this for a while now, hadn't they? Somewhere along the way, he lost all his garments save his trusty helm, though that had gotten stuck somewhere in the valley between the angel's fleshy peaks. He had sucked and nibbled and groped the flesh red, the angel openly moaning in desire. Rivulets of her lust ran down her thigh, providing lubrication as he vigorously humped away at her clit and the tender flesh above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had lost her garter as well, at some point. Not that either party was complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe honestly didn't know how he had this much stamina, having reached his peak several times over with no signs of stopping. His seed rubbed between them as the continued to fall ever downward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden shift in positions, so that he was laying atop her instead of pressed against her as they free-fell, brought him to the sudden notion that they were slowing down, incredibly slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh~ Ah~ Ah~\u201d The angel panted heavily, her face alight with the strained, pleasured smile, glowing red from their activities. \u201cWe h~ have reached Ah~ the end ha~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more they slowed down, the faster they came to a complete halt. Still wrapped in wings of pure delight, Saraphaea shrunk down, slowly, still holding tight. She placed his helm back on his head, when she dug it out from her bust and the sashes she still wore on them. When small enough, she just curled into his arms, nuzzling her face to his neck once more. She still giggled, rubbing her body against his with soft moans. And, oh dear, she had started to return the favor for what he had done to her breasts, licking and nibbling at his neck in a pleasure haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now they were ascending, slowly. It mattered not to the knight. He was enraptured by the woman he held so closely to him. A hand absentmindedly ran through her cloud-like hair, happiness that he hadn't known in so long filling him with gleeful arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea gave another small laugh. \u201cOh, Sir Knight. What am I to do with you?\u201d She gently bit his neck. \u201cCausing me to feel these lewd feelings, indulging me in my sin, and you still find it in yourself to love me again and again and again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said nothing. What could he say in the first place? What should he say? He was content to lie there forever, holding this divine creature in his arms forever in silence.</span></div></div>",

Yes, distinctly feminine. \u201cI smell the fun you two had on your way down to greet me, and I must remind you that it's <i>no good</i> if you keep it all to yourselves~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft sigh escaped the angel, who twitched her wings in slight annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well! Just remember, you brought this on yourself, angel~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH!\u201d Saraphaea cried out, arcing her back so that her stomach was pressed against him. \u201cStop it, Re-AH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight tensed. He really should have been aware that things could not go well for very long. But, how was he supposed to do anything? After all, he was trapped in the folded wings of his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReine, stop it! Oh~\u201d Saraphaea yelled out, shaking against her knight, her hands clenching rather painfully tight around his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. You had to hide those sweet, sweaty bodies from me, and this is your <b>punishment!</b>\u201d The speaker, this 'Reine' growled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegs locked around his own, Saraphaea clung to her knight for all she was worth, back arching in ways that would have been impossible for a simple human, still keeping them covered with her wings somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH~ OH~ HA~ HA~ OOOOH~\u201d The angel cried out, moaning. Ah, so it wasn't pain, but pleasure that their attacker was using. If the way she ground against his crotch was any indication, it was very effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assault went on for a good while, his dick slipping in and out of the angel's spasming slit, his legs drenched in her fluids as he painted her insides white again and again. It was as if hell were placed in her crotch, the heat emanating from her insides through his meat-pole, her canal paradoxically impossibly gripping and offering no resistance, milking him again and again as she reached orgasm from both his ministrations, forced (Though not unwelcome) as they were, and her attacker's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lull in whatever was happening to her, her wings all a flutter around them, struggling to hold their shape. Again, the deep yet feminine laughter rumbled around them. The angel leaned against Anon, her teeth clenched and in too wide a smile to be physically possible, drool falling freely from both sets of lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you've had enough. What say you, <i>Master~\uf059\uf059\uf059</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, by everything <u><i><b>HOLY</b></i></u> that voice! It was dripping with so much sexuality, purred out so sensually that he came three times in rapid succession! Saraphaea moaned weakly as he filled her again, more semen dripping from her utterly ravished womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard that~! Save some for <i>me~</i> Master. It's been <u>so</u> long since your last reincarnation, and I'm so~~~~ <b>THIRSTY</b>!\u201d The speaker dropped their voice so low, it was like speaking to a female earthquake. \u201c<b>LET HIM GO, SARA, OR THE NEXT RIDE WILL FEEL LIKE YOUR FIRST ORGY <u>ALL</u> OVER AGAIN!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tired groan escaped the angel, still smiling that painful smile, but she slowly pried her wings apart, doing her best to hold herself close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go~! Open up so I can get to that <i>creamy</i> center you two have made~\u201d The voice purred out, and he could hear the exaggerated sounds of a tongue running over lips, as if in anticipation of a good meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight peaked through slits in the feathers now, the appendages slowly unfurling.

Ah, so that's why Saraphaea's wings were having a hard time moving. It was the guardian's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet 'Reine' had still \u201cpunished\u201d the angel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, open up~! Give me your tasty juices~!\u201d The Guardian moaned out, almost whining. \u201cI <i>need</i> them! Give give give give give give them~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnon now felt gravity pulling down on him, proving to him that he was both alive and right side-up. The copious, almost ludicrous amounts of fluid that he and Saraphaea had let loose were running down their legs, dripping into a hole in the wing shield that she had managed to open. Right into-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of pink outside the hole, quick enough to catch their drippings as soon as they were clear of the feathers. Large, serpentine, and in one maw that he had seen only recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dragon...\u201d He murmured, body going stiff in all the wrong ways, all feelings of lust extinguished in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now, none of that fear. Spoils the taste.\u201d The voice spoke again, yet he saw the tongue sweep through the air again at the same moment. \u201cI'd never hurt you, if that's what you're thinking right now, Master.\u201d It was calming, though still sensual. \u201cPlease don't tell me you were scarred by a dragon <i>again</i>. That will make feeding more difficult than it need be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo please,\u201d The voice was suddenly to his right, where as before it was below and then to the left. \u201cWorry not, Master.\u201d In front of him, behind Saraphaea now. \u201cI exist only to please you.\u201d And that one was behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i><b>Trust me~</b></i></u>.\u201d All around him, one voice speaking in five places. Anon groaned, his body seeming to register the marathon of sex he had just gone through all at once. Nowhere near as bad as the previous day's activities, but still bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReine,\u201d The angel croaked out, her voice still elegant despite all the screaming she had done. \u201cPlease, put us down. Sir Anon, please, stay calm. Reine would never hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stiff nod, but nothing else. He could see they were moving closer to the ground, the scenery below the hole having changed and no more tongue flitting beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his feet touched the floor, the magic around them vanished. Saraphaea's wings flew outwards once more before shrinking, leaving him holding her in his arms, looking between her fluffy hair and the light disk that held her crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the guardian kept his body tense, however, ready to dodge even if in futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he thought that the Dragon Princess was large, the guardian was a titan among titans! Laying on her side, propped up on one arm. Was she in an even deeper hole? Looking around, yes, she was, with him and the angel on a suspended platform that allowed him to look from side to side, almost having to turn in a complete circle and see most of her body, from her heads to her knees, which bent back and kept him from seeing just how far she stretched out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultiple heads were a very defining feature of this being. Five, to be exact. Each one on a long, serpentine neck, each slowly moving as all ten eyes focused on him. Gargantuan gems, the same colors as the door, were placed in the center of each forehead, one for each. The eyes of each head matched the gem, along with a regal crown that did the same. However, each one had a few things different about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head with the black gem had enormous, spiral horns, much like a mountain ram. It also had the longest neck and the most \u201cdraconic\u201d of faces, inspiring the greatest of primal terror in his soul. Long snout, huge fangs, the tongue flicking in and out of her mouth as black smoke seeped between her jaws. Her eyes, obsidian and gleaming in the light, did not blink as she regarded him. Her crown was jagged, rough and pointy from what he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next, the one with a golden jewel, was staring at him as well, seemingly scrutinizing his every move with half-lidded eyes. Her horns twisted up and around, pointing back at her head as if to accentuate the gleaming crown. It was the most regal, lined with countless jewels around the base, with fur of some kind lining keeping it from digging into her scalp and a rounded top with a relatively small ball of the golden material shining brightly. Her face was less draconic than the black-crowned one, but still very much that of a dragon. Her fangs poked from her slightly smaller and rounded mouth, also set in such a way to show she was judging much like her eyes, Golden rings shooting from her nostrils at every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next was the one with the pink crown, eyeing him up and down with lust evident in her eyes. Her snout was set in what could only be described as a sensual smirk, fangs shining in such a way that seemed to dull their threatening presence. The features on this one were softer, her face relaxed in ways that three of the other four couldn't pull off. Her crown was not subtle, being a incredibly sized heart-shaped gem, slightly transparent. Her horns curled down beneath her chin before jutting forward once more, ending in dangerously sharp points. Winking occasionally, she would blow smoke that brought to mind scenes of intercourse, figures writhing in the pink wisps before disappearing as they achieved climax. Her tongue snaked its way out, longer than the tongue on the black crowned head, and with fine control as she began to stroke one of the horns below her own jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth was the head bejeweled white, gazing at him with a sense of wonder that didn't quite make sense on such a large being. Her mouth was making \u201cO's\u201d as she looked at him with an almost innocent air, her eyes seemingly memorizing every single inch of skin, gazing into his being not unlike what he felt Saraphaea had done. Her horns were unique among the others, moving and shifting constantly. Shrinking, growing, twisting and branching, looping in on their twin and at one point even making what looked like a question mark above her head. Her face was soft, dipping into a pout every now and then, being the second \u201cSoft draconic\u201d face. Her crown also moved, but wasn't unique in that regard. It bubbled, sending off clear bubbles that would pop about on her horns, which seemed to dart out whenever one got too far away to end it. Her smoke would occasionally form words, though it seemed she had no control over that, and with her breathing the fastest of the five, smoke was more often than not pumping out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last, but certainly not least, was giving him a rather dopey smile. Eyes half-lidded, but not in a judging way, but total relaxation. Her smoke was heavy, falling down in a fog from her mouth. It was a deep, deep blue, darker than the gem on her head. Her horns, far more than the standard two from what he could see, went down the back of her head, pointing down as well, weaving between themselves to form some strange facsimile of hair. Her crown seemed slightly melted, lights of wild colors flashing like strikes of lightning in its depths.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As for the rest of her body, her scales were a pale pink, almost the sheen of metal. The scales on her heads were tinted the colors of their respective gems, going down about a third of the way before becoming the pale pink of most of her body. Her stomach, almost like the Dragon Princess's, was a brilliant pearl white, trailing up to her breasts. But, where the lesser dragon was rather... plump... This dragoness had not an ounce of fat in the wrong spot. Her waist was slim, her hips wide and womanly, an impossibly long tail draped over her thighs which were plump, yet distinctly toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were gloriously massive, even on her frame, impossibly perky without some otherworldly magic working wonders, with nipples you could build civilizations around with functional trade towns between them. The nipples were without scales, perhaps being the only part of her upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrailing his eyes down again, he couldn't help but stare between her amazing legs at the ocean of arousal that cascaded over the edge of her skin, bringing to attention the almost inaudible sound of a waterfall in the distance. Her pussy was pulsing constantly, seeming to searching for something to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle from all the heads broke him from his gazing, only to be drawn right back to it as she trailed a clawed hand down her body, from betwixt her ample bosom down to her seeking twat, casually dipping her fingers in the liquid it endlessly gave, the sound of many oceans worth's of liquid being displaced shaking the entire arena. How massive was this woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any sense of shame, she drove three claws into her flower, which seemed to suck at the invading objects eagerly, trying to milk something from them that only a man could provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moan, both genuine and exaggerated, broke from the multiple throats of this beast as her digits began to thrust in and out so readily, squelching noises echoing up and down the entire coliseum, shaking the crystals around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster and faster, she plundered her own depths, her heads waving to and fro in bliss, moaning with wild abandon and smoke streaming from every mouth and nostril in seemingly impossible amounts, dissipating as they neared the closest layer with the slumbering princesses. The crashing of the oceans of her juices, sloshing madly with her thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled on her back, arching it so far back the tops of her heads trailed the ground, tail laying between them as he got his first sight of the rest of this behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings, he had no doubt if they were to unfurl they would devour the skies till the end of the earth. The leathery extremities were also pale pink, but he could see that there was a pattern on each, just peeking from the folds. The brightest, closest harvest moon could not compare to her backside, each cheek likely needing their own moon to sit upon. They rippled with each thrust of her fingers, jiggling so hypnotically and rhythmically that he could hear an ethereal party start in the dark corners of his mind in celebration of witnessing this momentous occasion! Her legs went on seemingly forever, as he still couldn't see her feet, and he doubted he would ever be able to climb them if he spent his entire life doing so from when he was a mere boy till he dropped dead in the middle of grabbing for the next scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgling sound drew his eyes back to her heads, his eyes going wide as he suffered yet another bout of paralysis, though this time it was of the immensely sexual variety as his not-so-little knight stood to attention once more, unintentionally spearing the angel again in her most sacred spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink crowned head had pulled her tail between her jaws, sucking it deep into her gullet if the protrusion slowly going up the throat of that head was any indication. The tongue of the pink-crowned head encircled her tail to a dizzying degree, pumping up and down as it just <i>kept going</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other heads were switching between licking her tail and extending tongue, drooling all over it lovingly, nibbling at the scales with what could possibly be love-nips, more than once turning to look him in the eye directly, and engaging in impressive tongue wars, shocking displays of kissing that only increased his viewing pleasure and marking her various necks with what could only be known as \u201cdragon-hickeys\u201d to any mortal man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue did not stop extending, having reached her waist as it continued to contort around the appendage. It wrapped around to her front, dipping to join her hand from what he could guess. He could also guess that Reine had no physical spine, as she just kept bending backwards, devouring her tail as the other four heads began to lavish the bulge in her throat with attention. She only seemed to stop when she toughed her tailbone with her snout, grumbling in satisfaction. She pulled her head back, slowly, glancing at him from the corner of her eyes once again, smirking at him despite having her jaw filled to the brim with her thick tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four heads were moaning in pleasure, slowly going limp, hanging uselessly as their eyes screw shut as tremors rocked her body, literal roars of pleasure and squeaks that did not befit a dragon as an absolute flood of cunt fluids <b><i>launched</i></b> across the horizon as she began chaotically bucking, tail-fucking her own throat as the sounds of her self-gratification grew ever sloppier. The floor beneath his feet began to shake, almost sending him stumbling with Saraphaea clutched in his arms, and his cock clutched within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, so agonizingly slowly, she pulled her tail from her throat, letting her elongated tongue unwrap itself, dipping back into her leaking crevice every so often. Her breasts heaved with every breath, her claws idly playing with her engorged clit if the circles she was rubbing meant what he thought they meant. The sound of her vaginal waterfall began once more, having stopped shortly for her squirting finish. Her four dangling heads began to regain their strength, becoming entwined with another for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the pink-crowned one did was look at him, tempting him, <i>desiring<b> him</b></i>. Through all of that, it only saw you. Even from this great distance, he could see the question it posed, almost a catty taunt or a challenge.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nDid you enjoy?</i></span></div></div>",

Shaking his helm, he righted it and looked at Saraphaea, who was grasping at his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Anon, you must recall why you're here. As overwhelming as Reine is, there is a reason we came to greet her.\u201d She told him, sternly facing him, tightening her hold when his eyes strayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regarded her strangely, his eyes slightly glazed over even still, but nodded. There was something he must do, right? She, Saraphaea had said so before they came here, correct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d He said slowly, trying to pierce the fog of lust that shrouded his mind. \u201cYou never told me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting her head to the side, The princess of the heavens looked confused. Hadn't she told him why they had come down here? She was certain she had! Well, maybe he had forgotten when exposed to the Guardian, or when they were falling down. They had been doing it for a long time, after all, with nothing but the all consuming pleasure of the other as they fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, princess.\u201d The knight said, making Saraphaea blush as she realized she had spoken aloud. Down here, in the presence of the Dragon, her tongue did wag loosely; and wasn't that a statement that had more than one meaning! \u201cYou didn't. You told me all would be explained as it happened. I think you forgot to tell me when we had, eh, <i>relations</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snickering of the five heads that still weaved in the distance was not lost upon either of them. \u201cSo, little Sara forgot her duties as our master's secretary?\u201d The Dragon taunted with one head, Tutting sarcastically with the others. \u201cFor shame, for shame! I shouldn't be surprised, really. For all that innocence you show off, you just can't ever wait for the throbbing cock of our master. Be it orc, goblin, elf, gnome or whatever else, you just hop onto his meat, enticing him from the moment you meet! How far you've fallen from those first few lifetimes, so very long ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the Dragon snickered, like a snake the size of the world were being strangled randomly while it hissed alongside an avalanche. It shook the platform the stood upon with minute vibrations, enough for the ground based knight to feel like he was on a ship in a particularly violent storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling her feet, an impressive feat given her floating nature, the angel blushed fiercely, looking down. \u201cRegardless, the reason we came down here was to awaken the rest of the First Entourage, Those that Sir Ace himself saved from the Remaking.\u201d She spoke resolutely, with the hint of shame creeping in. \u201cThe Enchantress says she may have something to turn the tides this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid she now?\u201d Reine queried, snorting at her own question. \u201cWhat am I asking, of course she does! She never does anything by half measures, and never says anything unless she means it. Very well, I shall awaken the Entourage. Go now, fly back to the top of the Haven. They will join you three shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree?\u201d The knight asked, cocking an eyebrow as he looked around. There was only two people on the platform, and the Dragon wasn't referring to herself, so who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll explain when we reach the top.\u201d Saraphaea smiled gently at his confusion. From those words alone she knew what had transpired. Even now, she could feel the presence of the third soul, so tightly pressed against hers yet remaining unseen. She really was distracted, wasn't she? With a shake of her fluffy hair, she wrapped her arms around him and extended her wings, shooting straight upwards into the near infinite Haven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Anon chanced a look down, jaw slackening as he saw just how <b>far</b> away the Guardian was! By this point, he could no longer see the platform beneath them, and yet they were only a little over a third of the way to the beginning of the Princesses laying in slumber. Smoke filled the air above her heads, though it quickly dispersed and cleared before reaching the numerous dreamers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, still, she was far into the horizon, every single one of her eyes focused solely on him, each burning with an intensity their own. From the look of things, she hadn't even began to tilt her head up yet to watch their ascent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe supposed that this must be how ants feel when they look at the dragon princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp and up, Saraphaea gave flap after might flap of her wings, bringing them closer to the surface. It seemed so far away, compared to the fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there go our clothes.\u201d Saraphaea drew his gaze from Reine, looking up at the gently floating articles of cloth. As she said, they were floating past them, somehow not stained with copious amounts of sexual fluids. A simple grab by him brought both shirt and pants, as well as Saraphaea's garter, back into possession. \u201cThank you, however you'll find that clothing is considered optional in this place. You needn't wear any pants, and I will tell you now that most will hope that you don't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo those numbers include you, Milady?\u201d Anon asked, genuinely curious. \u201cBe that as it may, however, I do not feel all that comfortable without my armor, much less clothing, in a strange place. Too many times have I seen an aspiring knight be cut down in familiar environs by all sorts of enemies just because they felt safe enough to relieve themselves of their own helm, much less the rest of their armor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one in here would dream of harming you, Love.\u201d Saraphaea spoke with a frown. \u201cDo you not trust me, us?\u201d She corrected herself, feeling a pinch along her back. Really now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shake of his head and a sigh as he leaned his head against her bosom was his answer for a few moments, the only sound the force behind her wings as they continued skyward. \u201cI do, and for the life of me I can't understand why.\u201d When he finally spoke, his voice betrayed his vexation at this fact. \u201cDespite everything I was taught, and my own natural paranoia, I trust you, more so than any of my fellow knights have ever inspired me to trust them. People I have fought with and against, attended the weddings and funerals of, been invited to the births of their first children on rare occasion! People that I have known all my life, since I first fell under the care of the guild when I was still a boy, I trust less than you! Less than this book I hold in my arms! Even now, I can feel your holy presence, so I know that you are no manner of succubus or witch or what have you, working your magics upon my mind, Princess. But I still do not understand...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea frowned again, deeper, as he trailed off. He had reveled a bit more about himself as he spoke. He had still been young when he joined the guild? For what reason this time around? She could hazard many a guess, not being a stranger to backstories such as this. Each time made it no easier to bare, however, since his pain always riddled her own soul with a fresh sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the connection your soul has with our own, with the Tome itself. You may not believe, but everything I have told you is true. All you read, about Sir Ace, was true. And, I am certain that if you perused the Tome a bit more, you could learn about the other lives you lived. Even now, in the world you were born in, it bears the marks of your past lives, the yous that have walked these lands regardless of their power. Your soul has become a force all its own, and it has seldom been denied glory and import. Each connection you have made with the Tome has strengthened your soul, deepening the connections you have gathered over the course of innumerable Remakings. You felt it with Reine, did you not? That connection, that desire for her when most would be terrified? Even the first tens of thousands of your lives quailed before her when they first saw her, even those who have fought for and against dragons for most of their lives. She is shamed to admit, but more than a few had died of shock and fright upon seeing her, when she was much smaller than she was now, and far weaker. But now, even when you have only recently had a run in with another dragon, you were only bothered for barely a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head again, holding Anon closer to her. \u201cNo, your soul is merely reacting to the bonds that have existed for so long, time has no real bearing on them anymore. Your soul resonates with ours, and even now, despite your troubled mind, I can feel the deep welling of familiarity bubbling forth from within you, waiting for you to acknowledge it for what it is. The body and mind do not remember, but the soul never forgets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mirthless chuckle answered her, but not another word.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Setting foot upon the ground once more, at the top of the Haven, Anon stretched his arms and legs, quickly donning his clothes and handing Saraphaea her garter belt. He made no mention when she merely held them, only a shrug of his shoulders. If she wished to expose her bits to him, who was he to really say no? It's not like he hadn't enjoyed them personally and frequently on their way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what did the Guardian mean when she said the three of us? There are only two here, correct?\u201d At least, two awake that didn't include the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea said nothing, merely gesturing to her twin sashes on her chest with a small smile. Curious, Anon scrutinized the garments vigorously, wondering if the dragon meant the clothing itself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA subtle movement, an out of place crease. That was all he needed to notice for the rest to become obvious to him. Had he not felt a hand on his chest, squished against the angels during both fall and flight? Had he not felt the presence of eyes during the fall when his helm slipped between her heavenly pillows when she grew, or a caressing hand upon his cheek? How had he not noticed it before? It was as if it had hidden on the edge of his mind, just out of sight until he saw those two signs of something out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith courage he did not know he possessed, he brazenly stuffed his hand beneath the twin sashes, grabbing hold of an arm that should not have been there and began to pull. Instead of fighting him, the arm let itself be removed from hiding, bringing with it the rest of the body it was attached to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a woman that, oddly enough, stood taller than Saraphaea herself at the moment. Much too large to fit underneath the teal garments, normally. As he pulled her from hiding, her black eyes looked up at him without emotion. Her face was covered from the nose down, and a hood covered most of her head. She had twin tails sprouting from holes in the hood though, spiky bushels of hair as dark as her clothing. Her hood continued downwards, draping over her shoulders, but only covering her neck and the upper fifth of her arms in the front, continuing down her back as a kind of cloak. She wore a shirt made of material that would not have looked out of place on a fishing boat as some kind of netting, showing skin almost half as pale as the angels. She wore twin gloves, each reaching up to end just beyond the hemline of her shroud, that were almost skin tight. Around her waist, she wore a sash of almost impossible blackness, which seemed to ripple as she was pulled away from Saraphaea. Her shorts went down to the end of her thighs and were, the same as her gloves, skin tight, almost melding seamlessly with her otherwise light skin. Around her right leg was a small knife belt, currently empty, and he doubted it was the only spot she hid weapons despite the tightness of most of her clothing. Her feet were wrapped in cloth, going up to just above her ankles, each toe wrapped individually so as to allow easier purchase if she were to climb a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he feet were free, gravity reasserted its hold over the woman, and she landed on her feet despite being held with her back to the ground and his hand wrapped around her wrist tightly. Her legs were bent at the knees at a ninety degree angle, and from the looks of it she was not bothered by this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d The knight ground out, despite knowing in the back of his mind she wouldn't hurt him. \u201cHow and why were you in Saraphaea's clothing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Nexi, the first Assassin Princess, My lord.\u201d She answered, her voice almost as dead as her eyes. She barely blinked at his treatment of her. \u201cUsing the Dark Sash I wear around my waist, I was able to hide in Saraphaea's clothing. I did so because she forgot that she was to meet me here and bring me with you two when you went to convene with Reine. I was barely able to hide before she carried you over the edge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could feel the intensity of his gaze, or see beyond his helmet, she made no movement in regards to that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea laid her hand over his, gently prying his fingers from Nexi's wrist. \u201cForgive her, Anon. It is my fault that I did not introduce you to her beforehand, and that I forgot that I was to meet her here. Her duties include being the shadow of our Master, you, and keep us informed of the events in the world. She has only just returned from a decade-long mission. Despite her outward demeanor, she is happy to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNexi nodded, though she hadn't moved from her current position with her knees bent and her back parallel to the ground as she looked up at him. \u201cYes, and I bring with me news that the rest of the Entourage must hear. We must quickly make our way to the Symposium. The shadows speak of the Kobold you brought with you walking the halls, and she will be there shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReine will awaken the rest of the entourage and send them directly there. Nexi, you go on ahead and greet the Kobold. Although, I suspect that when Sir Anon enters, she will latch onto him immediately. Don't spook her too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod from the woman was all they received as they stepped from the Haven into the much darker hallway. She stepped into the shadows and was gone. Anon swore he felt a quick peck upon his neck, however, yet it was gone faster than he knew if he was imagining things. A quick touch of his fingers, black coloration staining the tips of his digits, proved to him that he was not imagining things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat girl.\u201d Saraphaea put a hand to her temple, sighing. \u201cShall we be on our own way?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Symposium was as large as the Haven, but in reverse. They entered from the bottom, and the ceiling was so far above that he couldn't see the top. Looking up made him feel dizzy, so he kept his gaze as level as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe build of the room was not the only opposing factor. Where as the Haven was crystalline, smooth, quiet and obviously unnatural, the Symposium was a deep forest, rugged and buzzing with insects and with other sounds of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing.\u201d Anon spoke softly, trying to keep his eyes from looking upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. The Symposium was built by Reflet, Nature's ambassador. A druid of great power, he meshed kingdoms with nature with little distinction, helping the animal kingdoms thrive and remain wild while still allowing the sapient races to progress past what they otherwise would have been able without domesticating animals. Reflet was the fifth life after Sir Ace, and was always the diplomatic one. He was able to bring the demon lords to the table and speak, which is always something to behold. Not the best, but still great at bringing peace. At least, until the Gods and Devils learned of his soul connection. He spent his last years in seclusion, in this plane, building this room. He foresaw the complications that would arise from gathering the princesses of each generation and Remaking, each one so used to having their opinion listened to with serious gravity. He knew that his future reincarnations would need a place to bring order to the natural chaos of discussion and debate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thus, the Symposium?\u201d Anon motioned around him as they walked along the only path through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis addition to this wonderful world. Of course, being a druid he could not leave nature outside so he brought it in here. A calming presence in a maelstrom of voices. No one can raise their voice here if they tried, at least here in the forest. Once we get higher up, about the middle, the magic starts to fade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow stepped from the treeline, uncloaking to reveal Nexi. She stared at the two of them, who acknowledged her by stopping in their tracks. \u201cThe Kobold is in the personal meeting hall. As expected, she was skittish regarding my presence when I revealed myself to her. She has been provided food and drink, though she hasn't touched a single bit of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea nodded at the assassin. Better than she expected, honestly. \u201cHave the others arrived yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the waiting room just outside. As customary, they await our Lord's presence before entering the room. In addition, Altea cannot wait to meet the new Kobold, and it would be prudent to keep her on a tight leash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNexi merely nodded, the slight narrowing of her eyes telling her long-time friend all she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Anon, when we reach the waiting room, you must order Altea to keep calm. It doesn't matter how you tell her, but you must do so. When she isn't eager for physical relations, she is full of near boundless energy and will be the source of many headaches if not brought to heel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sound of things, this had happened before. Given the amount of times they've done this, if they were to be believed in that regard entirely, it was probably standard procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will also help ease you into your role as our master.\u201d Saraphaea continued as they started walking once more. \u201cMost of your past lives have been hesitant to do so, most out of chivalry. But, you might know the old saying of snowballs atop mountains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot admit to liking the sound of that.\u201d The Knight narrowed his eyes somewhat in a glare. \u201cIt seems like you're trying to say that I will become some kind of cruel tyrant as time goes on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaraphaea merely shrugged at him, looking down slightly. \u201cI will not say it hasn't happened before, Love. With the sheer number of times you have lived, it has had to happen many times. But, many more have seen us happy. I mostly meant to imply that it would be easier to show you just exactly what you can, and have, accomplished, and what that means for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh stole its way from his throat, but he merely nodded. \u201cVery well. I do hope that I can keep my head in all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour head is your own, Master.\u201d Nexi spoke just above a whisper. \u201cWhat you do is what you do, and you do it because you want to. We cannot force you to do anything. We do not want to force you to do anything. You could have walked from here the moment Saraphaea spoke to you, and we would have merely returned to waiting for your next life if Veronica could not convince you to return when she found you. All you do is the result of your own actions, or perhaps the result of complete accidents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's almost like Fate, then, that I find this Tome and deal with the consequences?\u201d He asked the assassin, who stood behind him, slightly to his left. Her footsteps mirrored his, and it was only the occasional glance back that assured him that she hadn't vanished into the shadows once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d He barely kept from running into the angel woman as she stopped just ahead of him. Her voice, usually warm, airy and filled with love turned cold, hard and sharp. \u201cDo not think that The Grand Architects of the Tablet of Stories would ever let you live should they know your place in the etchings from your birth. I have see too many smited in viscous ways that not even the most damned souls have felt since the time of Sir Ace. Too many struck down before they can gain their rightful power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, see, Princess.\u201d This new side of her scared him slightly, if he were to be honest. Where did the lovely cherub-like demeanor go, only to be replaced by this cold, vengeful messenger of the gods? In fact, he could see frost creeping around her, the metal of his helm growing colder just by being in her presence. \u201cBut, what will keep them from doing so when I leave here then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the grim smile of vindication that spread across her face without looking at her, as the temperature dropped like brick from a tower. The ice crept further from the woman, just skirting around his feet. Nexi had already jumped up on him, and it was only because he went to look back at her and saw her foot wrapping end when he got to his shoulder that he even noticed. She was unnaturally light and silent, it would seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFear.\u201d</span></div></div>",
