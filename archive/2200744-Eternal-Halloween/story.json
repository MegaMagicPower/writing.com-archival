            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gallows Spire was the oddly foreboding name to what was a pleasant, quaint town. It was tucked away from the big cities as a sprawling suburb with a rich history. The town was almost a century old and had gorgeous countryside, once heavily farmed. Autumn was its busiest season, tourists flocked to the colorful fall foliage that surrounded Gallows Spire and stayed for their festivities. Spring was nice, summer was hot, and winter was nearly picturesque, but for the locals the autumn season was their favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGallows Spire prided itself on having one of the biggest and bestest Halloween celebrations around. From a fully decorated town, to a big parade, to parties the whole month long and the entire community out on All Hallows Eve to go from house to house for treats, Gallows Spire was a fantastic place to go to for Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor four friends who loved Halloween the most, Gallows Spire was the best place Yllana Moongleam, Bernice Dunn, Emerson Webb and Rupert Fleming could ever ask to live. Each of them were around ten years old and each of them loved Halloween for their own reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana Moongleam loved Halloween for the mystique. She was something of a strange child, willowy thin, snarling blond-brown hair, a pale complexion and brilliant green eyes. Her family lived off the beaten path in an old house. Although she attended public school her family, mainly a matriarchal one, had different beliefs and practices. They would worship nature, look for signs and portents, and had a wealth of occult lore that Yllana found fascinating. They weren't really wiccan but their reputation about town was that the Moongleam family were witches. Nothing was to show for this, and they weren't shunned for it, but the rumors surrounding the family could be off-putting for some, so Yllana had been slow to make friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernice Dunn loved Halloween for the treats. She had a hearty appetite and every year had ambitions of making her candy haul bigger than last year's. There were so many tasty foods offered in the fall, from pie to cider season and anything that used pumpkins or marshmallows were her favorites. Bernice was rather chubby and burly, with ruddy skin, long black hair and dark eyes. Although rather pudgy for her age she walked the whole town when trick or treating and had the most stamina of her friends. She liked the outdoors in general, she'd been in her scout troop for 3 years now and they always did something big for Halloween, and for the precious outspoken kid she always found a way to have fun one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerson Webb loved Halloween for the costumes. He liked dressing up, or cosplay, thanks to a healthy diet of fantasy and sci-fi stories. Emerson was a black boy with curly hair and chocolate eyes. He had several older sisters who used to use him as a living doll when he was younger, so he inherited some fashion sense suited for his geeky and Halloween interests. As he got older, Emerson began organizing most of his costumes and made them rather elaborate, such as for a comic convention or for D&amp;D, and he went all out for Halloween. Last time he had been a zombie and everyone had thought he was actually dead just by looking at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert Fleming loved Halloween for the pranks. You wouldn't think it, given he was a thin, somewhat sickly looking boy with sharp features and muted red hair. Rupert made a show of being brave and tougher than he looked. While he loved Halloween, he had to be careful because of his weak health as he actually had some allergies to some foods that his friends took for granted. This left his mind sharp, as Rupert had a devious intellect. It was a source of pride for him to come up with spectacular pranks and use his wits to their fullest. He liked watching horror, pulp, and spy movies and often had marathons of them in October. He was a curious lad that read up on several conspiracy theories and had a penchant for investigating local mysteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to their shared interests, these adventurous youth found Halloween and Gallows Spire to be their favorite hangout. Even when they found an activity liked by one, soon each of the friends would try to get the others involved. Given that they would be 10 this year, each of them wanted this to be the biggest Halloween yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you want to focus on one of the kids first? Or follow them all together?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Moongleam house was an old house with strange architecture, half-Colonial and half-Victorian in design. Sitting at the end of Stepes Rod, it was one of the oldest houses in Gallows Spire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor young Yllana, and many others in town, the house carried with it an air of mystery. What nobody else realized was how unusual and difficult life was in the old house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld as it was, the house was in a constant state of disrepair. Yllana was used to nights of sleep to the sound of rainwater catching in pots from the leaky roof, of how the shutters creaked in the wind. The dining room room had warped boards jutting out like a mound and the old attached greenhouse was constantly overgrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLongtime residents of Gallows Spire called the Moongleam house the town's yearly tribute to Halloween. Which was somewhat fitting given the family's unusual practices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana had learned about the plants and herbs of nature from her grandmother. Her father had taught her about the stars, and her mother unusual trinkets. Her aunts and cousins would come visit at the house at least four times a year for great gatherings, and when the house was so filled with people there was the unsaid risk of the house toppling over if too many people were on the upper floor at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Yllana's life had been an unusual one, but that came it its own benefits. She had never feared the dark, and knew the backwoods and quiet, hidden places of Gallows Spire even more than her wayward roaming friends. She had read a great many old books and was an avid reader, most of the library dedicated to occult history and dark romances. If anything, her family encouraged her to find the unknown and Yllana always kept her mind open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after dawn, Yllana crept up to the attic tower in her nightdress. The highest point of the house, the floors buckled heavily in warning against too many climbing this high, but Yllana loved seeing the morning from here given the tower's immense stained glass window. It was a spiraling, exquisite piece that looked something like a broken clock or the orbits of the planets, only the glass was cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, from up here Yllana could see all of Gallows Spire over the tops of the trees in the woods surrounding the house. As she watched the sun rise in the east, over the rolling hills of fall foliage and grand bluff, the span of the southern neighborhood could be seen. Towards the center of town more regulated, square and larger buildings could be seen, such as the town hall, library, and the church spire could be seen. Towards the north, the sprawl went up one of the hills, and where the distant treelike broke the fields opened to some of Gallows Spire's old farms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana had lived here all her life, and the town of Gallows Spire was more than a living town for her. It had its own secrets, especially around Halloween, and this holiday more than ever Yllana vowed to discover them</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As day turned to dusk, Yllana went out into town the Tuesday before Halloween. She held a ticket to the planetarium tight in her clutches as she made her way to a special event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a Moongleam, Yllana had been fascinated by the heavenly bodies like many in her family. It was tradition that everyone had a name from the stars, and Yllana had 'Delphinus' for a middle name and it wasn't to her taste, as it meant dolphin and she didn't take to sea creatures. One of her aunts, who always went by her middle name of Cassiopeia only addressed others in the family by their astrological middle names, and her moniker of 'Delphine' for little Yllana was more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't to say that Yllana disliked the names of stars, only her own. She would have rather had a more interesting middle name such as Lyra, Gemini, Bootes, or Astoria. Although when she had shared the latter with her friends Rupert had told her that her initials would have been 'YAM' and both Bernice and Emerson found that hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of town, Yllana lined up for the shuttle driving from town square to the planetarium up on the bluff. Those with tickets for the event got to be shuttled, as the road to the planetarium was otherwise closed. Not only was a rick, orange harvest moon in the sky but another rare astrological event would be visible tonight in the pre-midnight hours. The planetarium staff had asked the town to reduce as much light around the planetarium as possible, so cars were not permitted up on the bluff to decrease light pollution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana took a seat in the middle of the bus after having her ticket checked, and after a few moments her friend Bernice plopped down on the seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*munch* hey 'Llana,\" Bernice said with her mouth full, offering a bag. \"Wan'na toffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" Yllana said, surprised that one of her friends was also attending the private planetarium event. Last time it had been brought up in conversation everyone else had found it too boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" Bernice said, keeping her mouth sticky with toffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you come?\" Yllana asked, bemused by the sudden companionship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernice swallowed. \"It hadn't sounded that interesting before, but then I found out I could apply the event towards my Astronomy badge. You're coming to our Jamboree, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am available,\" Yllana said. Bernice had tried to invite her to scouting events in the past but oddly the young Moongleam girl did not mesh with the camping environment. Yllana knew as much if not more about the environs of the woods and its flora and fauna as other scouts, although they didn't take to some of her more esoteric beliefs, and the system of discipline at the scouts was different than the values taught in the Moongleam household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Bernice joined Yllana, the shuttle departed for the planetarium. The girls found themselves to be the youngest of the unsupervised children, although Gallows Spire had something of a small town community where everyone knew of each other. After leaving the edge of town the bus lights became the only lights on the street as the road up to the planetarium was completely blacked out. Yllana and Bernice could see their warped reflections in the bus windows as it drove to the bluff overlooking the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUshers were on hand with flashlights to guide guests indoors, as most of the house lights in the planetarium would turn off once the presentation was underway. The forecast proved to be a chilly, cloud free night so it would be perfect to see the stars. The lobby filled with guests to the event, as everyone checked their coats, used the bathroom, and made use of the facilities before the events would begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want something from the concessions?\" Bernice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" Yllana said, as she had dinner before she departed. She suspected Bernice might have at well, although the girl was always hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get us some good seats, Yllana,\" Bernice said as she dug out her pocket change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana could oblige that task, as the tickets were exclusive enough that seats were not assigned for this viewing. Yllana selected a pair of center seats the second row back from the projector, where the seat reclined to look up at the dome of the auditorium. A few other eager astronomy buffs had already selected their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs people milled into their seats Bernice sat down next to Yllana, giving her a soda and a bag of popcorn. \"It was cheaper to do the combo deal so there's some for you too!\" Bernice smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana hid her disdain for the popcorn and soda, as Bernice laid out a tray of cheesy nachos and two boxes of candy on her lap, along with her own popcorn and soda. It was Bernice's way of sharing, although her close friends knew that if there were any leftovers from their lunches Bernice would offer to eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chew quietly, please,\" Yllana asked as Bernice tucked into her snack, reclining her seat all the way and stretching out her neck. The dome of the auditorium was shuttered, so the planetarium would be able to project and presentation on the inside and then open the roof to reveal the actual night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her bulk snacks, Bernice also reclined back with her bag of popcorn. \"So which one is leprosy?\" Bernice asked, pointing to some of the engravings on the dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you mean Lepus? Or Lupus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana corrected her friend on the proper constellations, and then the auditorium lights dimmed as the presentation started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe projector cast an image of space overhead, as the planet earth came into view. The narrator went over a brief explanation on how societies had used the stars to track the passage of time for eons, and the planet zoomed into different parts of the globe to show their viewpoint of constellations seen after the harvest season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe projection was nearly 30 minutes long, and for the final part of the presentation the roof split open. From her vantage point, Yllana could see the auburn moon slightly to the right, and she heard Bernice gasp as a shadow covered part of the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Bernice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the planet's shadow,\" Yllana whispered, as the narrator continued to explain the phenomena of a luna eclipse. This was the event Yllana wanted to see the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it had become chillier in the auditorium, Yllana was pleased to have come to the planetarium event, and the surprise of being able to share it with the friend. The satisfaction soon shifted to something concerning, as she saw something downright strange in the sky...</span></div></div>",

Flapjacks are ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Bernice bounded out of bed in her spotted jammies, the smell of cinnamon and maple syrup greeting her nostrils as she bounced down the stairs towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Saturday and the Dunn house usually had a big breakfast on the weekends. Her mother, a plump stout woman, had a plate of flapjacks each for Bernice and her brother, Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's dad?\" Bernice asked as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power line dropped over in Northwoods Park, dad got called in,\" her mother said. Bernice's dad worked for the town's utilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Bernice said, shaking her bag of mixed cereals. One of Bernice's favorite brand of cereals was released only in the fall, and she would convince her parents to buy all the flavors so the spooky berry, chocolate, and cinnamon shapes could be mixed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom smiled as she poured milk in Bernice's bowl. \"But he did manage to round up the leaves in the backyard before he had to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Bernice said before she dug into breakfast, eating all the more eagerly with the promise of freshly raked piles of leaves for her. The Dunn's doted on their kids in various ways and one of Bernice's favorite fall activities was jumping into the mounds of leaves. They even left the trampoline up until it got too frosty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to jump in the biggess' mound o' leaves,\" Marcus said with his mouth full. He was over three years younger than Bernice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh!\" Bernice challenged. \"I call dibs on the biggest leaf pile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AFTER breakfast,\" their mom chided, \"and not in your sleeping clothes. You'll need to get changed before you go outside. Now eat up, I can tell someone is excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Bernice needed any excuse to eat faster. Their backyard was shadowed by some gigantic maple and elm trees, so plenty of the colored leaves filled the yard every autumn. Most of their neighbors hated dealing with the leaves but the Dunns loved it. Her father often left the leaves around to be piled up for a few days so the kids to could play before he hauled off the leaves to compost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernice ate all her pancakes, cereal, eggs and bacon and skipped begging her mother for pop-tarts as she rushed back upstairs to get dressed, her brother rushing after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me first!\" Bernice called out before entering her room to get dressed. She quickly dressed in some thick tights, long shirt and zippered pullover as she oogled the big piles of leaves in the backyard. Adjusting the last of her clothes as she hopped out of her room, Bernice made a beeline to the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three big piles almost four feet high, perfect for jumping and romping in. Bernice huffed from her quickened paced as she climbed up the trampoline to line up her jump. She bounced once, twice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAHOOOO!\" she shrieked, belly-flopping into the leaves with a satisfying, well-padded crunch. \"This is awesome!\" she cheered, trying to swim through the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for me!\" Marcus, coming up late, launched himself from the trampoline, with Bernice ducking out of the way just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch where you're landing!\" Bernice flung some leaves his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spat grew into a full-blown leaf war, Bernice and Marcus giggling as they thrust leaves at each other. The mound was destroyed in minutes. Winded, both siblings fell back onto the smaller pile in a fit of hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall days are the best!\" Bernice said, and with Halloween coming up it could only get better. Besides a morning of leaf jumping, Bernice had big plans for the day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a mid-morning romp in the backyard leaves, Bernice's mother called her back inside to get cleaned up for her Scout Jamboree. Bernice whooped with excitement, the annual Halloween Jamboree being one of her favorite pastimes since she joined her scouting troop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGallows Spire was surrounded by prime woodland and nature parks, so the country troops were able to host the two night campout out at the campgrounds. Besides roughing it in their tents and having the chance to earn their outdoor activity merit badges, the scouts would have plenty of Halloween related activities as well, along with running a fall fair for friends and families the second night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up Bernice adjusted the beret of her dull orange and forest green scout uniform. Her sash had over a dozen badges by now for the skills Bernice had shown expertise in. Her uniform was somewhat snug, as she tended to grow out before growing up, but next year she would be old enough to get her Advanced Scout's uniform for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Bernice said as she made her way out to her parents van with her camping gear and supplies. She was stoked for the Jamboree and could smell the cheesecake and fudge brownies her mom had baked for the fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I just have one before we get there?\" Bernice pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are for the Jamboree only,\" her mom chided, noting the state of Bernice's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Bernice moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer excitement for the two nights kept Bernice chatty as her mom drove her out to the camp. The drive passed by in a blur, and soon Bernice could see the other scouts being dropped off by their families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok honey, I'll see you tomorrow,\" Bernice's mother kissed her after check in, leaving Bernice to her own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bernice!\" called one of the other scouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Susie! Amelia! Zoey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernice was part of a co-ed scouting organization, although the girls and boys still tended to form cliques with their own gender, after all they would set up their tents in different areas. Three of Bernice's closest scout friends had already assembled themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was a short, spunky girl with green eyes, fizzy red hair and numerous freckles along her face and limbs. Amelia had dark brown hair, dusty skin and almond shaped eyes, having southeast Asian heritage, with a stocky build like Bernice but with less puppy fat. Zoey was black, tall and willowy, her her long black hair bleached at the tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna have our tents next to each other?\" Amelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Bernice said. Zoey hadn't been able to make the previous pow-wow two weeks ago, so Bernice, Susie and Amelia filled her in on what she missed. A boy named Travers had disrupted a beehive on his orienteering test, luckily he wasn't allergic, but the rest of the gathering he was covered in swollen red lumps and ointment after being attended by the scout medic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile chatting the four friends got their twin tents set up efficiently, each of them becoming proficient young scouts. After swapping stories each of them went into great length about what they were looking forward to the most of the Jamboree, and Halloween in general. Susie was the only one of the scout girls to also live in Gallows Spire like Bernice, with Amelia and Zoey living in different towns in the county. Although the four friends were quickly sorting out plans to have a camp out sleepover in either Susie or Bernice's family yards before the big night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gather in the commons after your tent inspection!\" one of the scout leaders said. Bernice and company passed inspection without a hitch, eagerly jogging off towards the center of camp for the first evening of activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both sides of the camp came together, there were several activities available. All four girls had to pick what they wanted to do first.</span></div></div>",

It didn't matter the source, from monster movies to video games he liked to play with his buddy, Rupert, there were images of strange creatures and epic heroes everywhere. His ceiling was pitched from the yaw of the house's roof, so many of these posters were tacked at an angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the chaos, Emerson was quite orderly and neat. Everything had a place in his room, from a made bed to his toys and desk and a shelf filled with board games and music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, if there was one messy place in his room it was the dresser around Halloween. The cabinets were covered by the bit pieces, articles of clothing, and props he had accumulated from his costuming interests over the years. His mom had made him a photo album of each cosplay or outfit he had come up with, an archive of the efforts Emerson put in every year made that side of the room messier than average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerson was happy to get his own room when the Webbs had moved into Gallows Spire four-odd years ago, they could afford a bigger house as his dad was a dentist and his mother worked for the local chamber of commerce. Emerson was the youngest with three sisters all older than him, and while they liked to dote on their baby brother he was glad to get some distance from them so he could explore his own interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends had been messaging frequently over the last few days as each looked forward to Halloween in their own way. Emerson had turned off the notification ping as he was focused on finishing his homework so he could get to what he really wanted to do, getting ready for his favorite holiday<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerson's dark, dexterous fingers were putting the finishing touches on a history diorama he had to finish for a presentation at school. Each of the students had been tasked with outlining a geographical process and Emerson has to demonstrate the rain shadow effect. Having raided the house of stryofaom and supplies, Emerson was working on getting small stubby 'trees' stuck into the rainy side of his mountain, as the other side was dry and filled with sand. He enjoyed the crafting element more than the written report, as Emerson was quite inventive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" he exclaimed, as he put the finishing touches on the model. The paint of a fake river had long since dried, so decorating the diorama landscape with foliage was the final step. Emerson breathed a deep sigh of relief with his project finished so he could finally focus on other things.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With his homework out of the way, Emerson was keen to get back to a pressing matter in the Webb household. Namely, why his sisters were trying to get him out of the house Halloween night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the family had moved to Gallows Spire, and a few years after, Emerson had always gone trick or treating with his older sisters. But now that he was 10, that made Nia 14, Tinashe 15, and Zola 17.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Emerson, trick or treating with his friends on Halloween, showing off his costume, was the best part of the holiday. He didn't know why his sisters would get tired of it as they got older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the precious younger brother that he was, Emerson crept to the wall shared with Nia's bedroom, where the sisters had been squirreling away for the past few days. He placed a cone up to the wall so he could listen through the thin wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--that sugar free stuff dad and the other dentists hand out each year, so he and mom are gone all night--\" Tinashe was saying. Emerson moved to a different area of the wall so he could hear more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We keep it on the down low for our party here,\" Zola continued. \"Julia said we can move to her house for when the wild stuff 'appens\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Emerson will be with his peewee friends so the house is ours!\" Mia giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerson stood back after hearing him and his friends mentioned. His sisters had been acting funny all week. Although most of the family had gotten their costumes at the start of the month, he had seen Zola sneaking into the house with shopping bags for each of the sisters. Mia had earnestly asked about their parents plans on Halloween night, and all three of them had been on their best behavior and did their chores, leaving dishes, rugs, and the car spotless and nearly a leaf left in the front yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was up. His sisters claimed they they wanted to have some of their high school friends over for Halloween, as they had all outgrown trick or treating they would just had out candy to the kids that came around the house. But Emerson knew their had to be more than that. Tinashe was keeping books of their collective allowance and part time pay for an 'important purchase.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they were planning a big party that required the rest of the family being out of the house, Emerson wanted to know what was going on. He'd been creeping behind their backs long enough to gather clues those far, now he was going to confront them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerson walked to Nia's door, knocking loudly. \"Hey sis! Have you seen the hot glue gun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerson could hear his name spoken sourly as a flurry of activity happened behind the door, before Nia opened it a crack. \"No, and you were the last one to use it so find it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tinashe! Zola!\" Emerson said after catching a glimpse of the older sisters sat awkwardly on the bed. \"Whatcha'll talking about in here all secret like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuthin'--\" Zola began, before Tinashe said \"Just what we're doing for Halloween, now go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going out?\" Emerson asked, pretending to not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZola sighed. \"We're having a party at the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool!\" Emerson said. \"What time should me and my friends come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia moved to wedge the door closed. \"You and your friends AREN'T invited, it's not a party for kiddies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair, I want to come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTinashe moved to join Nia. \"You kids have more fun trawling the 'hood for candy anyways, and our parents already know about it so stop stickin' your nose in our business! You're so going to get it if you interfere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slammed the door in his face. Although put off Emerson snickered, going back to his room to mull over this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes he and Rupert had watched age inappropriate movies, PG-13 and such, so he was starting to get an idea of what his sisters might be up to with their party, the ones teenagers had in movies when they didn't want their parents to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure, Emerson always went trick or treating with friends every Halloween, but NOW he had to know what his sisters were up to. And maybe bust them in the process.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rupert Fleming had to be tough from a young age, given his chronic health problems. He wasn't too active of a kid, had numerous food allergies to avoid and medication he had to keep on hand, but this made him a self-sufficient young man with a calculating mind. And he really came alive around Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a boy that lived daily with certain medical fears, the time of year where everyone reveled in scaring the pants off each other was a great equalizer, and the frights resonated with Rupert who already had to face several of his own fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being as active as other kids had left Rupert with an impressive collection of movies, video games, and other literature amongst his chief interests. Horror and spy fiction, for starters, about anything where the protagonist had to survive and navigate via their wits and guile. It was a lifestyle Rupert aspired to, to live beyond his condition, and while he wasn't strongest or most popular of the other kids at school, he had his area of expertise. And quite the shrewd, scheming mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis current obsession was unraveling conspiracy theories. Rupert, true to form, had gone the full cork board and string approach to tracking unusual events he read about online, with ties to where unexplained or horrifying phenomena tied in with his favorite movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert prided himself for prepping for any eventuality, both ones he caused or experienced. He wasn't a delinquent troublemaker, however, although he relished the chances to let loose with deceptions and pranks, and Halloween naturally allotted these kinds of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wisely considered that his scheme to pull off his own disappearance wasn't the most practical use for his schemes this year, and logistically it would be hard to maintain his health without leaving traces. But there were surprises in store for his friends even they didn't know about. yes indeed, all of Rupert's planning would come to fruition during Halloween, as he would eagerly think of next year once the calendar turned the page to November. He would challenge his limits, even if that skirted the line to pushing the envelope. And Rupert would be ready to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Halloween only a few days away and plenty of pocket change to burn, Rupert went to his favorite after-school hangout: Gallows Spire's town arcade, Pins 'n' Blips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arcade sported various new and retro arcade machines run as a family owned business. Rupert had learned to drive race cars, shoot alien menaces and munch strings of dots at Pins 'n' Blips. Rupert's favorites were the pinball machines. Owing to the arcade's name an entire wall of the arcade was nothing but pinball machines. The arcade had acquired quite the collection and would seasonal rotate the more popular machines with other classics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for Halloween, they had just completed the installation of some of the more spooky arcade games. When Rupert got to the arcade there were some teenagers shooting their way through the House Of The Dead, various beeps from the other machines in attract mode, and the sounds of bumpers and pinballs being hit in the back hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert grinned as he looked along the pinball machines he was looking to get top scores on. Holiday favorites like The Addams Family and The Twilight Zone were back in rotation, and there were several other fitting them like Werewolf Attack, Pirate Siege, and Crypt of Horrors. The Jensen Twins, 20-something brothers looking to continue on the family business, would customize some of the older pinball tables or create new ones outright that they only brought out this time of year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrypt of Horrors was such an example, as Rupert inserted his quarters into the machine. The play field was a derelict graveyard where the player had to fight zombies, vampires and liches. Bone spires formed the supports of the ramps and in multi ball mode, three sections of the field would spin to cause the balls to veer wildly. It used an old dot matrix display and the sounds were very atmospheric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving played the game twice this year already, Rupert got into a familiar groove of jostling the ball with the main play flippers and the two upper side ones for skill shots. His score climbed higher as he cracked gravestones, sunk balls Six Feet Under, and completed the U-N-D-E-A-D spell bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rupert!\" It was his best friend, Emerson, who appeared in Rupert's peripheral vision as he was deep in his gameplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Rupert replied curtly, solely focused on the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, you're killing it out there,\" Emerson cheered as he watched Rupert play. Already eight minutes into play, Rupert had set himself for the most difficult completion challenge. Ghouls 'n' Ghosts caused all of the undead targets to become active again with several twists. Lightning would flash across the display screen and lights would flicker in the cabinet with ghostly apparitions to make it difficult to track the ball. Plus, the upper flippers would move sporadically on their own. There was only one lost ball save if it drained from the bottom of the board, and Rupert had already used all of his session's bonus balls to get to this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot stop the undead!\" said a gravely voice from the machine as Rupert strained his eyes to keep track of the ball. The vampire target lit up after a hit, and if he could get the ball up towards the glory ghost bumpers he could rack up an impressive score multiplier. The ghostly paddles had other plans, rocketing the ball across the play field and the spinning zone changing its directory down the side Rupert didn't anticipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" His ball had drained, the cabinet flashed its lights a final time as the necromancer laughed evilly at the defat of the player. \"I was so close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you got the special ending?\" Emerson said, trying to lift Rupert's spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert sighed, turning to catch a full view of Emerson. His friend prided himself on making the best homemade costumes. He was wearing a green plaid tweed jacket, a deerstalker cap, brown trousers and a bubble pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you Sherlock Holmes two years ago?\" Rupert asked, as Emerson had already pulled off the black, youthful Holmes costume before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerson grinned. \"Yeah, but this is a pre-Trick or Treat costume. We've got a bonafide mystery on our hands, Spade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert sighed, although this one carried some merriment. Last year he had dressed as detective much like Emerson was currently doing, having made a Sam Spade costume. Rupert had an eye for mysteries throughout the year, especially ones with friends, and Halloween at Gallows Spire could have quite the kooky mysteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bite,\" Rupert said, his brain curious for what Emerson could have discovered. \"What's the mystery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerson thoughtfully blew a large bubble from his pipe before replying.</span></div></div>",

An overload of various flavors of baked pie, from pecan to caramel apple, and supposedly no one could stomach a slice from each selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Yllana looked off towards the woods that could be seen past the neighborhood street. \"The moon isn't right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernice furrowed her brow. \"Don't you mean the stars aren't right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the phrasing Yllana should probably be using, yes. Although she tried and tried it was hard to recognize constellations in the night sky, even when she had her star guide for reference. Phases of the moon, waxing or waning, were much easier for her to track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls were already in costume. Yllana's hair was woven with flowers and green twigs, with some splotches of green makeup across her face. Her costume was brown with a tree bark texture to match a wood nymph. Bernice had a far simpler costume, as her long hair was bound with linens, the same linens circling her sweat clothes in a mummy costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rewrapping one of her trailing arm bandages for the umpteenth time, Bernice tried again to invite her friend. \"Well, Rupert and Emerson will be there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana was confused. \"How will Rupert be there? When he was at 'Pie-fest Lite' he didn't eat a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I haven't asked them yet,\" Bernice admitted, scratching the bandages tied around her stomach. \"There's one pie Rupert can have. Custard, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana shook her head. \"I don't think it's custard. Raspberry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think he can handle the seeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey 'Llana! Bernie! Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from where they were pondering what pie Rupert could actually digest, the girls noticed Emerson waved towards them at their meeting place. It would really be hard to miss Emerson given how much he sparkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't disco supposed to have died?\" Yllana asked and she and Bernice joined the two boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw,\" Emerson smiled, his suit lined with sparkly silver and gold sequins, refracting even the faintest of lights like a runaway disco ball. \"Besides, I've always wanted to have a bigger 'fro than may cousin for once.\" Hair that big was obviously a wig, although Emerson teased it into place with a purple comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you'd choose that for Halloween this year,\" Rupert said. \"Nothing scary? Not even your elf paladin character?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've got the moves!\" Emerson said, beginning to spin in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'd get sick watching you spin,\" Rupert said, tipping his fedora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you supposed to be?\" Bernice asked. \"It looks like you're in your sunday best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, can't you tell?\" Rupert asked, gesturing to the full effect of his costume. He had a dark maroon suit, a scarf, gloves, and a hat with a white band. For some reason he was carrying his violin case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A misplaced blues fiddler?\" Yllana guessed. Emerson laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bubgsy Malark!\" Rupert exclaimed, disappointed his friends didn't catch the reference. \"The gangster! From my favorite gangster movie I showed you last month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so why the violin case?\" Bernice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what they would hide their guns in, see?\" Rupert clicked open his case and with one fluid motion drew his tommy-gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Bernice said, startled, and before she could react Rupert pulled the trigger. A large flag embossed with the word \"BANG!\" poked out of the barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gees, man!\" Emerson said. \"That thing looks real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a prop,\" Rupert replied, repacking the toy gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Bernice said, regaining her composure. \"We're here now, so let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat event has them going out in costume?</span></div></div>",

Each neighborhood didn't disappoint when it came to Halloween displays and the group were joined by a gaggle of other kids all looking for treats. Every house with its lights on had a big display, from inflatable monsters to creepy music, thousands of carved pumpkins and skeletal props and flickering lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes in and each friend already supported an impressive haul. There would be time to trade candy latter. Like osmosis, although exchanges would be made from each friend it would be inevitable Rupert would give away most of the things he couldn't eat and Bernice would wind up with the most that the others wouldn't eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the streets were quite chaotic. Parents were out with little kids, gangs of middle schoolers went in waves, and costumed children were everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nuts!\" Emerson said, having to dodge a trio of monster kids as they walked the brick walled streets of elevated house lots. \"Everybody is out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's turning into a line for candy!\" Bernice complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYllana was walking slowly, trying to make sure the bark and limbs of her wood nymph outfit weren't lost in the jostling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he knew the town by heart, Rupert pulled out his map of Gallows Spire. \"It'll be this crowded on the inner ring of houses around the center of town. Everyone starts in the center, where there's the most activity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Bernice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head out across Rat Creek,\" Emerson said, \"Few start with the neighborhood over there, and the town center will clear out as the night goes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk that far?\" Yllana asked Rupert, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I packed my inhaler,\" Rupert replied. At his heading the four altered their route to follow the streets out of the neighborhood and across the bridge over Rat Creek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call, my man,\" Emerson said another twenty minutes later, as they moved to the less popular neighborhoods. Lines at the door were nonexistent at this point, and the friends were getting the first choice of some prime candies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert took a puff of his medication. \"I can go another hour, hour and a half. We'll make a wide tour this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnergized by the easier trick or treating pickings, the friends continued onwards to avoid the crowds. Fellow kids out for Halloween became infrequent and sparse. Until the four found themselves out on the edge of town alone as the fog rolled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting pretty thick,\" Yllana said, as their flashlights did little to help the obscured street lights penetrate the gloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there even anybody with candy down this street?\" Bernice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth a shot,\" Emerson said. \"Then we can come back down Twilight Avenue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was markably different this far out in town. Gone was the din of screaming kids and Halloween music. It was rather quiet, with only vague lights in the mist to navigate by, and the friends were the only kids around. The only people around, it looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eerie,\" Yllana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" Bernice said, huffing as she pushed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we take a break?\" Emerson said, \"My feet are starting to get sore and Rupert could use a break too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to stop in the creepiest part of town?\" Bernice exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that creepy,\" Rupert said, shrugging. \"It's only the fog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the mood had become muted among the four friends. It was odd to have not come across anybody else for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not too long,\" Bernice gave in as she and Yllana joined the boys where they were sitting. \"There's candy to be had out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a breather, Rupert was the one to keep them going forward. \"We haven't seen porch-lights of anyone else on this road, so everybody must be elsewhere in town. Best to get a move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest nodded silently, although they weren't going to find another house giving out candy just yet. They found something much more alarming.</span></div></div>",
