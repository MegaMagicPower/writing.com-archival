When you got to the store you were surprised to see that it was the size of a mega department store. However when you walked in it was only a plain room with a few doors a clerk behind a desk. no animals in sight.<br>\r\n\"First time here?\" the clerk smiled.<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. I got this letter in the mail and...\"<br>\r\n\"I gotcha. Lemme explain something real quick. Our 'pets' are really anthropomorphic creatures, half human and half animal. So you're not just here for a pet you are also getting a real companion and a friend. Possibly even more if you wish, and it's not as weird as it sounds. Honestly I can't count how many times I've seen love at first sight working here.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay we have several areas, designed to imitate the various habitats the animals the 'pets' would come from. So how about you pick one and we can start looking around?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sara didn't talk during the car ride, but I didn't care I was just happy to have a anthro. Anthro pets were rare. Anthros had a lot more rights then normal pets. It was illegal to kill anthro, anthro can request to be go back at anytime. They can also call the police on people for abuse. Anthros die with out human love, thats why they are pets. We got to my small apartment around 5. I helped sara with her bags and we walked to the apartment. \u2018Maybe we can have some fun tonight in bed.\u2019 Sara said putting my free hand on her butt. I would be lying if I said wouldn't want that. She may be short but shes not tiny just 5 foot with a fit body. It was fine with anthro older then 18 if they said yes. When we got home it was dark. I put sara's bags in my room and she sits in on the couch while I make a steak dinner for me and sara. When we got ready to eat I gave her the biggst one for her pills. When I got done cleaning I called her to get her pills. Sara ran from my room. I was about to give her the pills, but she stole then from me and locked herself in my kitchen. \u2018Iam so sorry partner I don't want to be made fun of anymore.\u2019 She says as she eats everything she can in my kitchen, then shoves all the pills down in her mouth.

In the past few minutes you had seen a savanna with several lions and a female gazelle anthro, then a forest habitat with several fox anthros, both male and female trod along as you passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, one more thing. It might be best if you adopt both tigresses. They're sisters and are always with each other. They would do nicely if you owned both rather than just one of them.\" You regarded his statement well, after all you wanted your pet or possibly pets to like you. Not long after you and the man finally reached a large grassy forest area of sorts. The man stops by the door and blows several sharp whistles. The forest seemed to go quiet for the moment. Before long several soft steps where heard before two tigers came out. Make that tigresses. You blush slightly but couldn't help but stare with lust. \"All right then take your pick. But keep in mind what I said earlier,\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both towered over you to a ridiculous extent, the alpha in particular. \"The alpha's Skylar, and her uh... 'little' sister is Amber. Guess why they have those names,\" he smirked. Skylar was quite unique. Her stripes were a sky blue color and black instead of orange and black, which was quite beautiful. Her eyes too were also sky blue and beautiful. Her hair was also a wonderful mix of midnight blue and black. She easily stood at 8 foot tall, and you nearly got a creek in your neck looking up so high. Her 'little' sister was not at all little, being around 7 foot 6 inches but was clearly shorter than her sister. Her fur was orange and black with jet black hair. But her distinguishing feature was that while Skylar's eyes shined, Amber's eyes also glowed beneath her fringe, and were gorgeous. Apart from that they looked the same physically; full supermodel figures with E-cup breasts and ridiculously long legs. You were only just above Skylar's in length. Despite the hourglass figures they also had bodybuilder physiques, with steely abs and biceps. They had perfect behinds as well and frankly were desirable in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk briefly put you out of your trance and asked who you wanted. \"I'll take...</span></div></div>",

Thank fuck, it would have been pretty unnerving if they didn't. Skylar however continued holding you as she followed the clerk to the reception. Her striped fur was just about the softest thing you ever felt, and you could assume the same with her sister. It was strange though considering their abs, although you weren't complaining. She let you down though once you reached the reception and you realized that you were pretty high up while she was holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk showed you the paperwork and all you had to do was sign at the bottom to be the owner of the two gorgeous felines who towered behind you, their shadow filling some length. Eagerly you signed the paperwork. \"Alright then, now all you have to do is put these collars on them.\" The clerk handed you two specially made collars with Skylar emblazoned on one and Amber on the other. Skylar had to kneel down for this but it was still quite a stretch while you only just managed to put Amber's on as she bent over. They had to put on hoodies as they left as the shop didn't like too much publicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home they straight away took off their going out clothes, again revealing their incredible figures and wagging tails. They then looked and you and finally spoke. \"So Master, where will we sleep?\" Skylar asked you in a deep, sexy but feminine voice. \"I assume on the sofa or on the floor Master?\" Amber then asked in a slightly less deep voice, but still quite deep. Instead you simply replied by opening the door to your bedroom, with a quite massive sized bed and room for about ten. \"How about in my bed with me?\" you asked only to receive approving nods and a warm hug from each of them. \"Well it's getting late now, I'm gonna go to sleep now.\" You got into your bed in your underwear while Skylar and Amber got in on either side of you wearing nothing but their fur, holding you in place between their warm, luscious bodies. \"Thank you for taking me in Master. I love you, goodnight,\" they said to you in unison before wrapping their arms around you. \"I love you too girls. Goodnight.\" And so you fell asleep in their warm, furry embrace</span></div></div>",

Feeling you looking at her she turns catching your eye with her huge brown ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile appears across her face and she walks over clearing the distance in a few steps. \"Howdy there partner.\" She greets her voice holding a country twang that you are not sure is natural or forced. \"Names Daisy. Pleasure ta meet ya.\" She says smiling and extending hand. On instinct you extend your own, and try not to yelp in pain as she shakes your hand. Girl had a grip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was closer you got a good look at her. The first thing you notice was, again, just how big she is, everywhere. She easily has a foot, maybe two feet in height on you and is wider as well with broad shoulders. That also includes her muscles which you can now see are clearly defined. From toned legs and defined arms this mare didn't seem to have an inch of excess fat on her. \"She must work out a lot.\" You realize \"Or is just naturally strong.\" She wore a, fittingly enough, \"Daisy Duke\" outfit that disn't seem to do much. The faded blue checkered shirt barely held in her bountiful chest, easily a F cup if not bigger, and her wide toned hips and seemed like they would split her \"skirt\" open at the first misstep. In all a amazon beauty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes you blush and you turn away realizing that you've been staring. Instead of being angry though the mare just chuckles. \"Like what ya see sugar?\" She asks in a teasing tone. You nod slowly making her laugh again and give you a friendly pat on the back, which almost makes you fall over. \"I think I like you sugar. So you thinking of taking me home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked with a teasing tone and a confident smile, but you could hear the desperate hope in her voice and the worry in her eyes.

A blue one in the water in a swimsuit, and a white one under a tree nearby, (There are a couple of plants here and there) in causal clothing and glasses reading a book. They look nice. the black one looks like she has more beauty though<br>\r\n\"Night is the one on the rock, Spark, is in the water Snow is reading and...\" The Clerk starts pointing out the women then stops \"Huh, Scarlet is not here... She must be hiding, don't blame her. Night and Spark give her hell, Snow is nice though... I think I know where Scarlet is. Unless you would rather pick from one of these.\"<br>\r\n\"No thank you.\" Well that ruined your chances of picking Night or Spark, Snow looks nice but you want to see this Scarlet.<br>\r\nThe Clerk leads you a bit along the path. Night and Spark wave to get your attention. You wave back as to not be rude. Snow looks up, smiles, then goes back to her book. as you go along the path. you come across a cave here and there. one has a few bookcases. The last one is warm...<br>\r\n\"Scarlet, You have someone who wants to see you!'<br>\r\nNothing...<br>\r\n\"Well,\" You mumble. \"Guess if she doesn't want to come out. I will go in.\"<br>\r\nThe clerk nods then, begins to go back. \"You might want this.\" He gives you a little map of the store and a flashlight \"We don't want anyone lost. That would be bad for business \"<br>\r\nThanking the clerk, you walk in, flashlight on and enter. It's not huge. nearby, you see a table and chair, along with some cabinets.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you yell. \"Scarlet was it? I want to meet you.\"<br>\r\nThere is still silence till you hear a sneeze and see a burst of flame.<br>\r\n\"drat...\"<br>\r\n\"Hey. um.. why won't you come out?\"<br>\r\nNothing, you step closer.<br>\r\n\"I would like m\to meet you.\"<br>\r\n\"Why? The others are more pretty. pick one of them.\" She whispers.<br>\r\n\"Come on I highly doubt it. Plus Night and Spark sound like jerks.\"<br>\r\nYou hear a chuckle then a sigh \"I guess you're right about that.<br>\r\nand with that, she comes out of her hiding place behind a boulder and you see she's</span></div></div>",

Scarlet was plump! She wasn\u2019t fat, or even necessary overweight, she was just big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other three looked slim and toned Scarlet was heavyset and curvy. She was wearing a simple white shirt which billowed loosely around her, hiding most of her figure but doing nothing to hide the bounce of her large breasts, or the way her body curved in all the right ways. And you realize, your heart sinking, Scarlets large figure was probably the perfect target for Night and Spark. Scarlet also lives up to her name, her scales being a rich crimson, with two horns on her head that were a light gold, almost the same color as her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragoness gripped her shirt nervously looking at you with golden eyes filled with hesitation as her tail swings back and forth nervously as you continue to look her over. \u201cUm, hi.\u201d She finally manages after a moment snapping you out of your trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d You manage smiling warmly up at her, a gesture her hesitantly returns. A silence descends on you and Scarlet after that: Scarlet seemingly unwilling to speak up as she continues to fidget nervously and you trying to get over the shock that you are speaking to a real live dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a pretty looking one at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence continues to go on as the seconds tick by then <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With her book under one arm her outfit and body gave her a \"hot librarian\" look, intentional or not. She also certainty lives up to her name with crystal white scales, blue grey horns and ice like eyes behind her glasses. Eyes that are currently locked onto Scarlet making the red dragoness wince and take a step back. Seeing this Snow snorts, sending out a puff of frost in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, this is to painful.\" She says marching over to jab a finger into Scarlets chest. \"Scarlet. This is your big chance! This guy came all this way just to see you, not me and not those other two! He's interested. You have a chance to finally get away from Spark and Night, and here you are wasting it.\" Scarlet hangs her head and starts wringing her tail nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I'm not pretty like everyone else.\" Snow facepalms and suddenly whirls on you. \"You! Do you think Scarlet is pretty?\" The fire in the ice dragons voice freezes you for a second you take a minute to collect your thoughts before nodding and saying that Scarlet is a beautiful dragoness and that you did come all this way because you wanted to meet her and maybe pick her. She seems like a sweet kind girl and you would be honored if she would come with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know you are smooched deep into a dragonesses chest as Scarlet squeezes the life out of you alternating between broken sentences and sobs of joy. Meanwhile you are trying desperately trying to get her attention before you are snapped in two or run out of air. \"Uh Scarlet. You might want to let him go before you kill him.\" Snow said. Soon after you are lying on the ground gasping for air as Scarlet fusses over you stammering apologies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow shakes her head. \"You two are adorable.\" She mutters. As you sit there, wondering what you had just gotten into, you realize that you had basically picked Scarlet. She was coming home with you. Realizing that you would be living with a dragon gave you a bit of giddy excitement. Calming down Scarlet had started to gather some things to take with her while Snow spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment you</span></div></div>",

Once you got to the back of the shop and here you notice a humongous valley, full of green hill\u2019s, a lake in the middle and some caves and ruins on the sides you gaped at the place and asked<br>\r\n<b>- How is that possible? From the outside it seems smaller?!<br>\r\n- I worked before as an interior decorator I know what, I am doing. Ok the girls should be here somewhere take a look and take your time. If you are lost just follow the exit signs I marked.</b><br>\r\nWith these words he left you in that environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed a little breather all of this seemed unreal. Yet beautiful. Before you set of to see the girls here you decided to express your feelings to this place <br>\r\n<i><b>Valley on the west, where you could rest<br>\r\nDay shining warm like emerald, at night cold... -</b></i> you stopped you could not make a good word to fit it. Then you heard a voice that startled you<br>\r\n<i><b>- ... Night cold, won\u2019t leave my heart</b></i><br>\r\nYou quickly looked at the source of the voice. There you met your eyes with another stunning view. There was a dragon or rather dragoness standing few feet away from you. When she was approaching, you noticed her \"assets\" in more detail. Her whole body was covered in black shiny scales with a white underbelly and lower part of her jaw. She was tall and had an athlete built with the right amount of muscles and fat in the right places. Define muscles on her biceps and legs. D cups breast chest puffed out her well define sic-pack. She had wide enough hips to maintain an hourglass figure. Like all dragons she had 2 pair of white horns, sticking out of her black, long and wavy hair and of course 2 pair of wings that acted like a cape behind her. The thing that struck you the most were her eyes, draconic and brown coloured. When she finally approached you noticed how big she was you eye level was at her breast. Not to be rude you focused (with difficulties) on her eyes and tried very hard to say something. The only thing that came out of your mouth was<br>\r\n<b>- Wow.</b><br>\r\n<b>- Likewise -</b> she replied with a chuckle <b>- Well, well a romantic soul quite fit. I think I hit a jackpot.</b><br>\r\n- What do you mean?<br>\r\n<b>- Well it may sound silly, but when you said that poem and made an eye contact <i>I felt a spark in my heart, a spark<br>\r\n- That may shine even in the blackest dark. I know that on</i></b><br>\r\n-<b> See that must be destiny that brought you here<br>\r\n- B-but I don\u2019t even know you<br>\r\n- Let's change that shall we - my name is Nocta -</b> she made light bow that make her boobs jiggle a bit.<b> - and you are?<br>\r\n- I.. I\u2019m Carl.<br>\r\n- Now then Carl we know each other a little better now -</b> she suddenly grabbed your arm and started to drag you <br>\r\n<b>- Um what are, were are you taking me<br>\r\n- Someplace more comfortable to talk.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged you to what appeared was her Cave. It had a den with leaves some rock like shelfs filled with books and some rocks in various sizes that she referred to it as her dumbbells You both sat on some sort of rocks that resembled chairs in it. There you started to talk a bit. During that talk you noticed that you and Nocta had a lot in common. You both read the same poetry and liked it. Both liked sports, although she had a little more experience in that regard. You started to feel affection to her. And the standing soldier at attention you could not deny it. <br>\r\n<b>- You feel that too don\u2019t you?</b><br>\r\n<b>- You mean the spark, well kinda<br>\r\n- See this is actually destiny, please don\u2019t let pour souls venture alone in this world we ares destined to venture together. Please take me away from this place and let our sparks enlighten even the blackest abyss.<br>\r\n- You know how to craft your words.<br>\r\n- I have my moments - she said whith a smirk<br>\r\n- It would be foolish of me not to listen to my heart at this point. Yes I am picking you I really want to know you better.<br>\r\n- Ow thank you! -</b> she said and started to hug you to her massive chest, moving you from side to side<b> - now let's\u2026<br>\r\n- Nocta youre here? -</b> another feminine voice echoed though the cave.<br>\r\n<b>- Oh no! It's Stella -</b> she said and let you go <b>- quick you need to hide, she can\u2019t see you<br>\r\n- Why, she evil? - you asked<br>\r\n- No it's just... -</b> she started<br>\r\n<b>- Noooooctaaaa! - </b>the female voice yelled<b> - I know you\u2019re in there!<br>\r\n- Quickly, hide</b><br>\r\nYou did as she ordered and hid behind one of the huge boulders<br>\r\n-<b> Hey Stella. What is it? <br>\r\n- Finally! Did you forgot? You suppose to help me move some of the rocks I need you to move them. Becouse of course Skye and Ember are not helping.<br>\r\n- Ah yeah I just needed to finish one book here, Sure will help you it will take 10 min tops to do that. Be back to you my book.<br>\r\n-  You are weird.</b><br>\r\nBehind that cryptic words you understood that you need to wait here for at least 10 minutes for Nocta to return. Well at least you have thing to do you decided to check the shelfs.<br>\r\nThen another voice echoed through the cave<br>\r\n<b>- Hiiii! Nocta! Sorry to bother you i just wanted to return your book and...</b><br>\r\nYou wanted to hide but it was too late that creature entered the cave very swiftly once she noticed you and said<br>\r\n<b>- OH MY!

After a couple minutes you narrowed it down to a pair of twin brothers but you couldn't choose which one. Kiva is about six and a half foot with dark grey fur and with emerald green eyes Kiva is kind of protective of his family.  His brother Shadow  is also six and a half foot with more of a smokey color fur he also has emerald colored eyes he is shy so it may take a while before he opens up. The clerk told you the only reason why he is called shadow is because he is quiet so he may spook you accidentally so be wear. The clerk told you that the certificate was good for one adopt one of them but since they are always together so he told you that if you want you can adopt both of them.

There are foxes, lions, squirrels, raccoons, bears...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBears?!\u201d <br>\r\nThe clerk simply hummed in agreement. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019re very friendly once you get to know them.\u201d<br>\r\nSure, the idea of a big fluffy bear sounded appealing, but the idea of something being that dangerous left you feeling unnerved. What if someone like a bear was too much? So instead, you decided to play it safe. But at the same time, you wanted someone exotic, uncommon. With that mind, you put your best foot forward, and politely asked...\u201cGot any skunk girls?\u201d<br>\r\nThe clerk gave you a look. \u201cYou sure sir? A skunk?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, why not? Is there something wrong with them?\u201d<br>\r\nThe clerk waved his hands. \u201cNo, no! It\u2019s not the girls that I\u2019m concerned about. It\u2019s just, you know, they\u2019re skunk girls. They\u2019re not exactly most people\u2019s first choice if you know what I\u2019m saying,\u201d<br>\r\nYou gave the clerk an un-amused look. \u201cWhy? Do they smell? Do they even spray?\u201d <br>\r\nThe clerk titled his head uneasily. \u201cNot really, no. I mean, they can, but it\u2019s actually a really small amount of spray and the smell barely lasts. Normal human body odor is probably worse...\u201d<br>\r\nYou gave the clerk a smile. \u201cWell that solves the problem then! So who do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a bit of a problem sir, since skunk\u2019s aren\u2019t requested often, there aren\u2019t many of them on the premises.\u201d<br>\r\nYour heart sank a little. \u201cAre there any skunk\u2019s here then?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one skunk girl off the top of my head, but she\u2019s a bit, you know...\u201d The clerk made a circle gesture with his hands around his stomach, a rather LARGE circle.<br>\r\n\u201cFat you mean?\u201d you said bluntly \u201cI don\u2019t mind if that\u2019s the case, I prefer heavy girls as a matter of fact.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCalling this skunk girl \u2018Fat\u2019, is putting it politely sir...\u201d The clerk said plainly. \u201cBut if you insist, wait right here sir, she normally hangs out just around the hill, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you could even reply, the clerk pulled away and hurriedly sprinted across the field before disappearing out of sight. Footsteps to your left soon caught your attention. Calling her \u201cheavy\u201d was an understatement. The clerk was right, she was HUGE. Standing at about your height, but easily three times that in width, was a skunk girl whose belly was bigger than an exercise ball that reached several feet out in front and a little down below her waistline as it poked out from underneath her shirt. Her breasts wer watermelon size, while her arms were thick and flabby underneath jet black fur with a snow white stripes that trailed down her back. But the most impressive part of her was her lower region, her hips and thighs were wide, sharp, and thick as any strong oak tree. And with an ass that easily stretched several feet outwards behind her that jiggled and wobbled with each step she took. You had a feeling no matter how hard you tried, there was no way you would be able to wrap both of your arms around a pair of hips and ass that big. Behind that, she possessed a large, bushy black tail with white stripes that when raised to its full height, towered above her head. Dressed in a dark green shirt with a pair of faded, light blue jeans that were in danger of ripping, you couldn\u2019t help but notice how beautiful she was. Eyes that were a stunning blue that spoke of intelligence; long perfectly combed and pampered chocolate brown hair that flowed down to her shoulders showed she put care into herself. Even her face, which was round, soft and padded with fat, seemed cute and gentle to your eyes. So enraptured were you by her looks you hadn\u2019t noticed when she had finished walking, (mostly waddling), up to you with the clerk alongside. <br>\r\n\"Here she is, may I introduce Penelope\" said the clerk.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the one asking about me?\u201d the beautiful skunk girl asked..<br>\r\n\u201cI..umm, well...I...\u201d you stuttered.<br>\r\n\u201cA bit tongue tied are you?\u201d her eyes scanning over you with a look that was unmistakably unimpressed. <br>\r\n\u201cBe nice Penelope,\u201d the clerk warned, \u201cGive the guy a chance,\u201d<br>\r\nThe skunk sighed, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath salesman, there are far better choices here than me...\"<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I get to be the judge of that?\u201d you quickly replied.<br>\r\nThe skunk girl gave a look of surprise. <br>\r\n\"And why would you want me?\" she asked you hotly.<br>\r\n\u201cAlways liked skunks actually, I think they\u2019re quite adorable,\u201d<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but I doubt you came here to choose a tub of lard like myself...\"<br>\r\n\u201cAnd perhaps I like that sort of thing....\u201d<br>\r\nThis caught the skunk by surprise, but her wide eyed expression gave way to a devious one, one that sent shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you,\u201d she began, patting her large, soft stomach, \u201cEnjoy this?\u201d<br>\r\nYou swallowed again and nodded slowly, your brain suffering too big of a short circuit to form a proper response. This seemed to please Penelope even more, as she started sauntering her way over to you ever so slowly. Stopping only when her massive belly was but a few inches from touching you<br>\r\n\u201cYou prefer your girls big huh?\u201d she asked huskily, drawing closer to your face as she raised herself up on her tip toes.<br>\r\n\u201cBigger the better,\u201d you said with a squeak. <br>\r\nHer breath was warm and soothing on your skin. Your hands clenched tightly with sweat and shaky nerves, itching desperately to reach out and try to wrap your arms around her thick waist and pull her up against yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u201d she hummed in thought.<br>\r\nPenelope said nothing else as she turned to walk a few paces away. Giving you another look at her wide ass as it jiggled with every step in her too tight jeans.<br>\r\n\u201cSooooo......\u201d you began<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d she replied, looking over her shoulder. Her large, bushy tail swishing back and forth, seemingly awaiting your answer.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, would you like to come with me?\u201d<br>\r\nPenelope tapped her pudgy chin in thought, cocking one thick hip out to the side<br>\r\n\u201cSure, this probably won\u2019t work out, but at least I might have some fun while I can,\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, oh, well that\u2019s great!\u201d<br>\r\nPenelope crossed her thick arms and gave you a firm look. \u201cEasy tiger, I just said I\u2019ve decided to try living with you. Not to warm your bed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, right, of course, I wasn\u2019t expecting anything else. Other than perhaps we can become...friends?\u201d you asked carefully, holding out your hand.<br>\r\nThe beautiful, hefty skunk girl glanced at your hand once before rolling her eyes. But to your inner delight, she gave you a small smile as she took your hand in hers. \u201cFriends, at least, or die trying.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully it won\u2019t have to come to that,\u201d you quipped.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that. I might be too much \u2018fun\u2019 for you to handle,\u201d she said cheekily.<br>\r\nA warm feeling of happiness bloomed inside your heart as Penelope took your hand to shake it. Her fur felt so soft, so gentle, it made your skin tingle with excitement. As if on cue, a familiar voice piped up to ruin the touching scene the two of you were having.<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! Seems you two are getting along quite well, come with me to the front office and we\u2019ll sort out Penny\u2019s paper work.\u201d The clerk declared. <br>\r\nTen minutes later, you were back in the front entrance bent over the main desk signing away ownership papers. Penelope had left moments before to pack a small bag filled with a few clothes, toiletries, and a few personal keepsakes. You wee almost done with the paperwork when something caught your eye.<br>\r\n\u201cIncome enhancement?\u201d <br>\r\nThe clerk nodded. \u201cFor taking ownership of Penelope, the store will provide a living budget for you while she is in your care,\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d you asked innocently. <br>\r\n\u201cYou will need that with Penelope, the girl has an appetite fit for a whale, unless you prefer to go grocery shopping every evening. She also bursts through clothes pretty quickly, so you unless you want to...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll take all the help I can get,\u201d You laughed uneasily<br>\r\n\u201cSir, can I just say, thank you for this,\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Y<br>\r\n\u201cPenelope has been here awhile, and mostly because previous owners have returned her before.\u201d The clerk explained sadly. \u201cCustomers would bring her back for whatever lame ass excuse they could conceive: Too expensive, overeating, no good with strangers, no longer tolerate the smell and so on. She was always on the large side, but some of the caretakers believe the hurt of being brought back has only worsened her eating habits, the poor girl, she can\u2019t win no matter what she does,\u201d<br>\r\nPutting the final touch on the last document, you handed the clerk the thick pile of papers with a confident smile on your face.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will care and look after her like the queen I know she is,\"<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear that sir,\u201d the clerk said with a grin.<br>\r\nA door opening from behind revealed a sight that made your heart flutter. The large skunk was dressed in a reddish pink blouse with white pants that were once again, both straining to contain all of her girth. By her side were two medium sized suitcases on wheels.<br>\r\n \u201cAlright, paperwork is all done, and the store will bring your stuff around in about a week or so. Have a nice day and good luck to the two of you!\"<br>\r\nThanking the clerk for all he did, you quickly packed the bags away into the trunk before helping Penelope to literally squeeze herself into the back of your car. Even with the seats rolled all the way back, she still seemed cramped.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are we going first?\u201d she asked you with a hint of eagerness to her voice.<br>\r\n \u201cHow about...\u201d You began to say<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A story inspired by Anthro Pet Shop, and a spiritual successor to my previous story Macro Furry Pets, but more size appropriated. You have an invitation to a new and unique pet store, but these are not your normal pets. These 'pets' are anthropomorphic creatures that want you to take them home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome small rules:<br>\r\n- They are part human, which means they have the general form and behavior of humans, therefore they are capable of speech, as well as animal characteristics; these are people, not freaks or monsters.<br>\r\n- The pets will be scaled according to their animal counterpart, so a mouse anthro will be small and petite, but still human sized, while a dinosaur anthro (those are allowed) will be closer to ten feet tall or taller.<br>\r\n- No graphic violence.<br>\r\n- Sex and other explicit content is permitted.<br>\r\n- NO killing anyone or anything.<br>\r\n- Please have the chapters make sense.<br>\r\n- The pet will age in human years so to keep it all tidy.<br>\r\n- All animals, extinct or mythological, are allowed.<br>\r\n- No Digimon/Pokemon<br>\r\n- Pets in the shop are divided by habitat, i.e. domestic, swamp, forest, farm, prehistoric<br>\r\n- No scat or watersports.<br>\r\n- Since giant anthros will occur, this does not mean there will be vore/unbirth/anal vore. Stick to relativly normal physiology<br>\r\n- If you choose a male character, the animals will be female. If you choose a female character, the animals will be male.<br>\r\n- Please keep the anatomical structure the same as a human's i.e female dogs should NOT have eight breasts. Frankly it's just not right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add and have fun!</td>",
