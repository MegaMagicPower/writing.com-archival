She hadn't known of this for some time, still really doesn't, but has noted that some boys act really weird around her, like the time last month when some man tried to swallow her up at the bottom of a slide at the playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was another fun morning, she was preparing for school, which she had been enjoying a lot, even with all the weird looks the boys give her. She lived with her aunt Vivian and her 10 year old cousin Leon, taken in by them after her mother's 'disappeared' during a visit. She loved Aunt Viv and Leon was so funny to her, joking about how he ate her mom and wants to gobble her up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and slipped on her backpack as she walked outside with Aunt Viv, watching the school bus turn the corner and travel down her street and pull up next to her house. She walked off towards it and waved back at Vivian. \"Have a good day sweetie!\" \"I will Auntie!\" As she stepped onto the bus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did notice more than a few boys looking at her and licking their lips as well as a few empty seats with extra chubby boys beside them. After watching some cartoons Suzy had learned that the cool kids sat at the back of the bus and she was pretty sure that she was cool, at least hear Aunt said so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long back seat was empty except for one boy. His blonde hair was dirty and unkempt and he had a disinterested look on his face. His shirt was black with a skull on it and looked just like what a bully would wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy paused at the second to last row of seats. Sure the boy looked pretty scary but plenty of stories she heard said he probably just needed a friend and she did want to be cool.</span></div></div>",

The teacher freaked out and rushed over to open the windows before getting all the students outside, you were the last one, coughing up bits of blue smoke as you sat in the hallway, the goth boy looking at you with a smirk. \"Nice one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah not like I planned that or anything.\" She coughed, feeling the eyes of her fellow students on her, it was obviously both their faults, but she felt more of the eyes on her then him. She just rolled her eyes and waited for the teacher to give the all clear. She walked back in, and just as she sat down the bell rang, standing right back up and grabbing her bag she made her way to the door...</span></div></div>",

First the coffee machine broke, then the shower only produced cold water, which of course the landlord isn't gonna do anything about. And now she's sitting on her couch, lazily flicking through the channels and finishing off some left over pizza, as she till it's time to head to work, though something was stirring in her chest, some weird...feeling, that something was going to go wrong today, but she wasn't quite sure what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off the last slice and tossing the hardened crusts away, she got dressed and left out the front door, walking over to the elevator and taking it down.

Between the whiny customers, the low pay, and the uncaring attitude of her boss, this was far and away her least favorite place in the world. Still, though, at least she had <i>some</i> money coming in. If she was unemployed and on the streets, she'd end up filling some guy's gut really quick. When she arrived, she groaned as she saw a lot of cars in the parking lot. \"Oh fuck me... Why couldn't today be slow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hat on and headed inside to clock in. \"Pulsby!\", yelled a harsh-sounding voice, belonging to Diana's manager, Bill. \"You're twenty minutes late! We're already shortstaffed as it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\", Diana asked. \"But I'm not scheduled until 12:30! I should be ten minutes early\", she argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I texted you this morning telling you I needed you a half-hour early\", Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana checked her phone, and sure enough, the message was right there. \"But... this was only sent fifteen minutes ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me excuses, Pulsby\", Bill snapped. \"We're extremely busy today, so I'm gonna let your tardiness slide for now. But I can't allow for any more screw-ups, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana closed her eyes and sighed. \"Yes, sir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now get to your station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill walked back to his office, Diana groaned as she put on an apron. \"Why does he gotta be such a hardass?\" She noticed that she had forgotten her nametag, so she just grabbed an extra from one of the other aprons hanging up. \"Oh well... i'm only working til 5 anyway. Today shouldn't be too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the first thing Diana does?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Diana clocked in, she had to take the order of an older woman who looked like she was going to bitch to the manager and her son, barely paying attention as she pressed the screen and went onto the next order. She didn't get paid enough to provide <i>good</i> customer service, after all. As luck would have it, Diana happened to clock in right at the start of the lunch rush. She struggled to get the orders out on time and man the cash register, as well as take care of the drive through, all while her lazy coworkers were either chatting in the back or messing around with their phones. Finally, it seemed like all of the orders were taken care of... that is, until she noticed that the Karen from earlier was standing right in front of the register, her highlighted bangs framing the scowl on her face. Forcing a smile, Diana approached the register.<br>\r\n\"Um, hello, miss\", the young fast food worker said meekly. \"Is there something I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How hard is your job?\", she asked, raising her voice and seemingly trying to make sure that everyone heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Oh wonderful], Diana groaned in her head. [I wonder what she could be bitching about.] Diana continued to force her smile and decided to be nice and ask the Karen what crawled up her ass. \"I'm sorry, ma'am, was there something wrong with your order? I'll be happy to make it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son didn't get the kids meal he asked for\", snapped Karen. \"I was the first order you took, and I explained it crystal clear for you, so there's no reason why it should be this messed up. This is just un-acceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize, miss\", the overworked fast food worker said. \"I'll make sure you're given the right order immediately. What was supposed to be in your son's kids meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana's eyes widened as the bitchy mother stood there, completely serious about her request. \"I'm... I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son wants you in his kids meal\", Karen said without skipping a beat. \"Now get out from behind that register and start feeding my boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-! I'm not going to do that!\", Diana cried, breaking her customer service voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why. Not?\", the mother inquired with clear anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Why do you think?! I'm not feeding myself to some little kid!\" Diana demeaned herself in various ways in order to earn her minimum wage, but she was at her limit. Sure, she was at the bottom rung of society, but she refused to be bullied into the belly of the spoiled brat of some bitchy mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the Karen uttered the words feared by all minimum wage employees. \"I want to talk to your manager!\", she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Diana's boss, Bill, immediately rushed up. \"I'm so sorry, ma'am, is there a problem?\", Bill asked, giving Diana a look that gave her the idea that she weren't going to be coming to work tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My son was supposed to get that cashier girl with his kids meal. And she just stood there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill groaned as he looked at his employee before turning back to the customer. \"I apologize, miss, I'll make sure to resolve this personally.\" Diana yelped as Bill lifted her up by the shirt collar and took her to the kitchen while the Karen stood there with a smug look of satisfaction on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bill! What the hell are you doing?!\", Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing what you're <i>supposed</i> to be doing and taking care of the customer's complaint\", the manager explained as calmly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complaint? Her little brat wants to eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he wants you in his kids' meal, then it's your job as an employee to fill his order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to get eaten!\", Diana said. \"Why is everyone acting like that's weird?!\" Her boss, however, didn't seem to care, as he took her to the kitchen, where she was quickly stripped of her uniform by the cooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Diana was destined to end up in a boy's belly. The question was, how would she be going out?</span></div></div>",

One of the cooks grabbed a chunk of the meat and shaped it into a patty before getting the griddle ready. Diana would still be alive for all of this, as evidenced by a pair of blinking eyes popping out of the front of the patty. Once the griddle was heated up, the cook grabbed the Diana-patty and tossed it on the hot surface, with Di silently screaming from the heat as she sizzled. After a couple of minutes, she was flipped and grilled on the other side until she was ready to be served. The cook slid a spatula underneath her and placed the steaming hot girl-patty on top of bed of lettuce, and draping her with a slice of cheddar cheese. She blinked once more before the top bun was pressed on top of her, her eyes bulging out as she was squeezed between the two buns. Once she was prepared, the girl-burger was placed in a basket alongside a helping of fries and served on a tray. Bill handed the girl-burger out to the woman and her son, a pale, pudgy kid with red hair and freckles. \"I'm very sorry for your inconvenience, ma'am. I'm hope our cashier makes an appetizing meal for your boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana blinked her eyes as she looked up at the chubby boy, who simply licked his lips as he looked down at his girl-burger. \"Mmm, she looks yummy!\", he said as he grabbed his lunch. Diana let out a squeak as the hungry boy squeezed her. \"Thanks, mister.\" If she wasn't a cheeseburger, she would have gulped as the boy's mouth opened wide. Unfortunately, the Diana-burger wasn't able to do anything as the hungry boy sunk her teeth into her side, biting a chunk out of her. She looked up as he chewed up the part of her and swallowed, licking the bits of sauce off of his lips. \"Mmmm, this girl made a really tasty burger. I wanna eat here every day, Mommy\", the boy said as he ate another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sweetie\", the Karen said as she patted her boy's head. \"Whatever you want. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Just please don't get a taste for mommy...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl burger sobbed as the boy continued taking bites out of her, seeming to want to save her face for last. She had such big plans and aspirations. She wanted to finish college and become a doctor, but now all of her hopes and dreams were going to end in this hungry boy's tummy. Finally, the boy stuffed the last of his girl burger into his maw and chewed her up. She was sickened as she was immediately greeted with his foul breath right before his teeth began mashing her up into a meaty paste, moaning as he savored her taste before swallowing. After he had enjoyed her flavor enough, he swallowed Diana up in one last gulp, patting his tummy as he licked his sauce-coated lips. \"She was soooo yummy\", he giggled. \"Guess you don't have to worry about working anymore, burger lady. You don't gotta pay to live in my tummy!\" The boy patted his belly, causing the contents to slosh around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, what remained of Diana whimpered as she sat at the bottom of the stomach. What was once a young woman with the world ahead of her had been reduced to a glob of mush inside a hungry young boy's stomach, soon to be greeted by his dinner, dessert, and whatever snacks he had. The boy let out one last belch, the final sound to come out of the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Diana Pulsby would get to see the world after all, but only as a layer of fat on the boy's tummy, along with many other tasty-looking girls.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she thought about what to do, Mary\u2019s son approached her with a smile. The woman flinched, wondering what he wanted. Her son\u2019s belly grumbled, making her a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, can you make me some French toast sticks for breakfast?\u201d He asked. Mary sighed and nodded. She believed he wasn\u2019t aware of her new \u201ccondition\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course sweetie. Just give me a few minutes.\u201d Mary replied. She moved into the kitchen and pulled out a box of French toast sticks. She put a few on a plate and put them into the microwave. As David waited patiently, he soon noticed a new smell in the kitchen. He wasn\u2019t sure what it was (he could tell it wasn\u2019t the French toast sticks) but it smelled pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe microwave soon finished, allowing Mary to pull out the plate. She set it down on the table and smiled. David sat down and started to eat. He continued to look around, trying to identify the new smell. His mother smiled and gave him a kiss on the forehead. As she did, the boy flinched, realizing the smell was coming from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, you smell good.\u201d He said. Mary giggled, not thinking much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you, you smell pretty good yourself.\u201d David took a bite from his breakfast and turned towards his mother, soon staring at her. He didn\u2019t understand why, but he felt hungry when specifically looking at her. The small boy got up and walked over to her. Before Mary could react, her son grabbed her hand and licked it. She shuddered, realizing what was going through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, why do you taste so good?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh um, there was an issue at work.\u201d She explained, though wasn\u2019t sure how to put it into words for him. The woman didn\u2019t fight back as her child pulled her over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you become part of my breakfast?\u201d David asked. He thought about her being tied up on his plate. He liked the thought of her going down his throat and into his stomach. His belly grumbled as if to agree with him. His mother stared at him, unsure of how to react. He couldn\u2019t believe he actually asked her to become his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t.\u201d She said. David became frustrated and stomped his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to eat you!\u201d He said bluntly. The boy grabbed the bottle of syrup and opened it up, tossing it on her. Mary yelped before taking the bottle away. Before she could react, her son grabbed her hand and pulled it into his mouth. He tasted her, loving the syrup along with her. Mary yanked her hand out and backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, if you eat me, you won\u2019t have a mommy anymore. I\u2019m sorry but I won\u2019t become part of your breakfast.\u201d She told him. David gave her a sad look before he started to cry. She felt bad for him but stood her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is said that the world of Malara was once populated only by women, created in the image of the Goddess of Beauty, Ghadea. However, Ghadea had an arch-nemesis, the celestial titan Roxaldir. Roxaldir was the embodiment of gluttony, and therefore aims to devour all that is good and pure in the universe; this means that Ghadea, in all her beauty, is his most desired meal. For all time, Roxaldir and Ghadea have been locked in an endless game of cat-and-mouse, with the goddess always narrowly evading Roxaldir\u2019s attempts to devour her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when Roxaldir found Ghadea\u2019s planet, he got petty revenge on her by populating it with his own children; men, who he designed to be as strong and gluttonous as he was, frequently devouring the beautiful women of Malara. They could do this in all sorts of ways, from cooking them up, to swallowing them whole, to even stuffing them up their butts or enveloping them with their cocks. As time has passed, however, men and women have formed an uneasy fellowship in society, largely because both sexes are required for reproduction; but for girls and women, Malara is a world where they could always be on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such girl was a young girl named Anna, who lived in a little town called Celosia. She was 4\u20197\u201d and had fair skin, with shiny, well-groomed, golden blond hair, with two pigtails that went down her back. She usually dressed in cheap dresses that went down to her ankles, with simple patterns along them; today, it was a cute green dress with white around the middle, and a big ribbon over her bottom. However, she had one problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid bottom was quite huge! With two plump cheeks that were clearly visible against the back of her dress when she was sitting down, and soft hips that were wider than her shoulders. It seemed to remain no matter how she changed her diet; it seemed to be a trait she inherited from her mother. Her mother was devoured, however, for if there was one thing that got men\u2019s mouths drooling, it was softness and curves like that! And it seemed Anna might meet the same fate one day, if she wasn\u2019t careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that\u2019s what her big brother always told her. He was in his late teens, with greyish-brown hair and standing much taller than her, and was always very protective, a bit too much so. He always held her hand when they went outside and made sure she could never leave his side, even for a moment. They even had to sleep together, with him hugging her close the whole night like she was some kind of teddy bear. She stood before him, pouting with her arms crossed, in their humble little home as she aired her grievances. \u201cC\u2019mon, Jacob! I\u2019m not a little kid anymore! I can start doin\u2019 my own stuff! You don\u2019t always gotta be there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother sighed, shrugging awkwardly. \u201cYou\u2019re still little. Any man who\u2019s hungry enough could just snap you up with ease, in a second!\u201d He said. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready to go out on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut my friends go out by themselves all the time, and they\u2019re just fine!\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all of them,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember Jessica? Poor girl wandered out into the forest last year and never came back. Probably got roasted over the fire of some bandits\u2026 or worse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t gotta go out into the forest! Just the village!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour friends are one thing, but you? You\u2019re especially\u2026 vulnerable!\u201d He argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, knowing what he meant. \u201cIs this about my bottom again?\u201d She asked, frustrated. She turned, shaking her hips a bit at him. \u201cI think you\u2019re totally worried over nothing. Who wants to eat somebody just because of their rump? Butts aren\u2019t tasty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flinched. Even he had to admit that her rear looked scrumptious, so he had to make himself look away. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. Plenty of men wouldn\u2019t be able to resist devouring you on the spot..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed indignantly. \u201cWell, then I need to learn to defend myself!\u201d She said, before pointing to the dagger on his hip. \u201cWhy not teach me to use that? Then I\u2019ll be able to go out on my own!\u201d</span></div></div>",
