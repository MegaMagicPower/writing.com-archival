It was midday and you found yourself face to face with one of the Eleven Supernovas, Capone Bege. As he always did, he was smoking a cigar. He continued to look you over as he nodded to a couple of his henchmen, who then hoisted you by the arms and brought you over to him. He then took the cigar out of his mouth and spoke, \"Well then, you're the rat we lent a couple million berries to three years ago, right? Well, it's time to pay up.\" You look nervous. You needed that money to help your family, but there was no way you could earn all that money back, so you ended up bounty hunting and, because of your lack of fighting skills, you failed constantly. However, on your most recent expedition, you were caught by Capone Bege before you got the money. As this was the case, you started to tear up, \"I'm sorry, but I couldn't get your money, sir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCapone nodded to his henchmen, who then proceeded to start beating him up. Capone looked on, slightly amused before calling his henchmen off. \"Well, if that's the case, you're going to be punished in the way only I know how. Hey Vinni, grab one of those small crates.\" As he said this, one of the larger henchmen left into the ship and brought back a wooden crate only about the size of someone's head. You noticed this and figured that you were going to be decapitated right on the deck. To your surprise, the henchmen let you go. However, it wasn't long before you started feeling weird as your entire world started growing. Before long, you were only a couple inches tall! Capone looks down at you before grabbing you in his hand, \"As I said, only I can do this. I have eaten the devil fruit that controls sizes. That being the case, I have no use for one such as yourself. Therefore, I'll send you somewhere. What happens after that is up to the recipient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCapone opens up the crate before chucking you inside. You try to get out, but the top closes and you can hear nails hammering down on the crate. After a minute or so, you hear the flapping of wings. It seems a mailbird has picked you up and is taking you somewhere! But where?</span></div></div>",

You must be hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything he grabbed you roughly (not intentionally, just in a fit of excitement) knocking the wind from you and taking away any chance of protest you might have had. As Luffy pumped his fists up and down in a running stance you found yourself pistoning up and down, only able to catch glimpses of the ship's interior. Judging by the time it took for Luffy to get to the kitchen from the deck, the ship was quite large. The second Luffy crashed into the kitchen Sanji turned from what he was doing and shouted, \"Out Luffy! There's no way I'm letting you get within one inch of the food in here after what happened yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy grinned at Sanji and said, \"Sanji! I have something to show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji sighed and said, \"You never listen do you? Whatever it is just show it to me so you can get out of here and let me get back to cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy held you up and opened his palm. You would have stood up and tried to face the giant cook but you were still dizzy from your wild ride. The best you could do was sit up and stare groggily into Sanji's visible eye. Said eye widened as he saw you. Luffy let you down on the counter and Sanji bent down examined you. You tried to scoot back so his face wouldn't be so close to you, but he stopped you with one finger pressing down on the coat you were wearing. After looking over you for a few minutes he straightened up and said, \"What exactly is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy explained how he had found you in a box that had fallen onto the deck of the ship. Sanji bent down again and said, \"So what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling less dizzy you stand up and explain what happened to you from your borrowing money from Bege Capone, to being a failed bounty hunter, and finally about how he had shrunk you and put you in the box. When you were finished Luffy said, \"Don't worry little guy! You'll be safe with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Sanji and said, \"So anyway Sanji can you get something to eat for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji sighed and said, \"Fine. But I'm not going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish Luffy shouted, \"Thanks!\" and ran off. Sanji growled in frustration and turned to you. The fierceness in his gaze was enough to make you want to curl up in a ball. He grabbed a knife off the counter and went back to making lunch. Without looking at you he said, \"I don't have time to entertain some guy so just stay put until I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded out of habit and stood up. You walked down the counter past various giant food items and implements until you came to the end of the counter. It was a long way to the ground so you wouldn't be going anywhere anytime soon. You look back at Sanji and see he's moved to the stove. He doesn't seem too friendly. You remember from the Wanted posters that Sanji was worth 77,000,000 berries though there was something strange about him. You walk as close to the hot stove as you can get and shout, \"Hey Sanji?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji looks over at you and says, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at his face and say, \"Your face is a lot different from your poster. Why isn't your picture that goofy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji glared down at you and you quail slightly under his burning gaze.</span></div></div>",

As you looked up at the reindeer in fear it surprised you when his expression turned from curiosity to worry. \"Hey it's okay I won't hurt you do you need any medicine?\" Chopper asked you. You were a bit shocked that he seemed to be worried about you though. By the time you realized it though he had already put his hoofed hand near you, which caused you to flinch making Chopper pull his hand back. \"I'm going to turn the box on its side so you can walk out on your own.\" Chopper told you obviously a little worried for the small human in the box. Nodding to let him know you understood Chopper started to turn the box. Now that you were able to walk out you decided to get out of the box.

As you turn your attention back to him you feel you could probably trust him a bit since he seems to be willing to give you your space. Taking a deep breath you walk up to the gigantic reindeer to you and extend your hand for a handshake, while introducing yourself. Chopper who seems excited that you opened up to him a bit lightly taps your hand with his and introduces himself as well confirming that he was Chopper of the Straw Hat pirates. \"You mentioned something about medicine, do you have one that gets rid of a devil fruits power?\" You ask Chopper remembering his earlier off of medicine. \"No sorry I don't have a medicine like that yet, but as a doctor I'll try to make one for my patient if they need one.\" Chopper answered you. What he said though took you by surprised as you weren't expecting him to be the doctor but you didn't say anything so he wouldn't get mad. Glad that he offered to make you medicine you smile up at him. \"No it's fine it's my fault I'm like this I have to deal with the consequences myself.\" You tell him as you wonder if you're going to be living the rest of your life at your current size.

Female Interaction is no longer allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Any and all acts are allowed. But anything extreme (Toilet stuff, gore, etc.) should be marked with a warning in brackets, such as [Toilet Content Warning] or something. If this is not found, I'll edit the title of the chapter appropriately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2b. If any chapter has any extreme content and is not properly warned about, please Please PLEASE don't hesitate to let me know. I can't fix it if I don't know it's there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I want to keep this story neat and tidy, particularly with spelling and grammar. Don't be alarmed if you find your chapter has been edited for these reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. A single pet-peeve I usually have with stories is that characters often COMPLETELY take over a story in which another character was selected. Have as many characters as you want in a chapter, but make sure to have the selected giant be the one most prominent in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Have fun when writing! Don't feel obliged to write!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy the story!</td>",
