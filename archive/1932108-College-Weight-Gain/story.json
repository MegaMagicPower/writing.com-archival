            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy couldn't help but find the situation depression.  <i>I can't believe.  I outrgrew something.  In a week!</i>  She was exaggerating.  If she had sucked in, the buttons on her plaid shirt would have just made it, albeit uncomfortably snug.  And she was still thin, petite even, but she could see the writing on the wall.  She put on maybe ten, fifteen pounds in a week and she hadn't changed her diet at all.  Sure, right now it had given her previously stick-thin figure some curves, but any appreciation she might have had for her slightly more womanly hips and breasts were undone by how she was now slouching in the back of class, her buttoned shirt open, and her now dimpled belly button visible through her t-shirt she wore underneath, the small roll of flab digging into her tiny jeans.  She knew women in her family.  The first few pounds wouldn't look so bad, but if she didn't do something she would turn into a fat, shapeless lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't so much that Lucy was obsessed with being thin.  She wasn't a health nut.  She was just naturally so, and took some pleasure in being the small, thin, pretty science girl.  There was something else, though, and the iron made her squirm as uncomfortably as he tight bra did.  Since late in high school Lucy had developed a fascination with certain other girls.  She convinced herself at first that it was one of irrational aesthetic preferences that people develop, but soon came to accept that, although nominally straight and without much interest in in women, Lucy absolutely loved heavier women.  And when a thin woman--such as herself--started getting heavy, she loved it even more.  She accepted this strange quirk, and in her darker fantasies even wondered if she could ever put her chemistry and biology knowledge to use in maybe fattening someone up herself.  These were just drifting fantasies, though.  She did not them distract her from her ever important school work, although as many other students around her had immediately begun showing signs of plumping up ever since she had gotten to college, they did often momentarily distract her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even in her darkest fantasies the idea that <i>she</i> would be on the receiving end of the freshman fifteen never occurred to her.  Now, surrounded by girls who had over the months put on the same weight or more she had mysteriously gained in a week, she was hating it more and more.  When they lost control of their bodies and got fat it was sexy.  When it happened to Lucy, it was an inconvenience at best, and a horrible nightmare at worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lucy was getting into the opening of the lecture, to leave her weight troubles for after class, a girl arrived late.  She had always sat next to Lucy, who had found her name was Caitlin.  She was a beautiful young woman, in her sophomore year, with long, dark hair and who and dressed in tight, form fitting shirts and hip-hugger jeans that showed off her busty, toned physique.  She was, Lucy had noticed, in fantastic shape.  Lucy would not have noticed her at all if not for her occasionally insightful, sometimes downright strange, comments in class.  Lucy's questions were clinical, precise, but this Caitlin often went on long, rambling debates with the professor about the kind of esoteric scientific ideas that would have been more appropriate in an upper class.  If Lucy had cared about making friends, she would have befriended Caitlin.  And if she was a lesbian, she would have been hopelessly enthralled by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept today something was dramatically different.  She was wearing a flowing dress with a spandex waistband for one thing, far different from her usual tight jeans.  Secondly, she had on a zipped up hoodie.  Her exhausted, put-upon as she awkwardly walked to back of the class next to Lucy was enough to make her notice that something else had changed.  She sat down with a sigh, and, seeing her in profile, Lucy saw the unmistakable start of a double chin on her face, the more prominent curve of her ass.  But what really got Lucy's heart pounding, distracting her from the class, her recent gain, and all else around her, was that even Caitlin's loose clothing could not hide the potbelly and lovehandles which had sprung out from her figure.  She was already curvy, now she was both soft and curvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredible.  It made Lucy's mere gain seem like no big deal.  Caitlin had gone from having a fantastically fit figure to being, well, almost chubby.  When did this happen?  Certainly Lucy would have been watching her growth like she had other girls.  Was it over the weekend?  And how could she have gotten so big so fast?  Lucy stared, wide-eyed, her mouth open slightly in a look of awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching herself, Lucy's head darted up.  She had to focus.  She didn't want this stranger catching her eying her belly like that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy couldn't help her eyes from drifting back to Caitlin's new figure, her hidden, round belly, her puffy face, her obviously beefy thighs hidden under that loose skirt.  For the first time she was completely unable to focus on anything the professor was saying.  Her gave went from the front of the room, self-consciously down to her own stomach with its little bit of fat poking out over her jeans, and then over to Caitlin's magnificent round belly.  In her imagination, she imagined the frustrated grunts Caitlin made as her sexy jeans no longer fit, the look of defeat as she looked at herself in the mirror.  It made Lucy forget that she went through the exact same thing this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Lucy's eyes met Caitlin's.  She was discreetly going over her neighbor's figure, slowly going up to her breasts when she caught the tired, puffy stare.  Caitlin's eyes looked exhausted, her mouth half open--not in uncontrollably lust as Lucy, but pure exhaustion.  Lucy almost gasped.  She was caught.  Her mind raced through the embarrassing possibilities.  She quickly realized that noticing your formerly fit classmate had ballooned up overnight was something anyone would stare at, and her secret would be safe, but she still knew it was extremely rude to be staring like she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething odd happened, though.  As Lucy struggled to pull herself from Caitlin's eyes, her expression changed.  Caitlin went from a sort of indifference, to confusion.  Why was this girl staring at her so intensely? her thoughts seemed to be.  As Lucy failed to turn her head away in the ensuing seconds, some kind of realization came over Caitlin, as if she understood something.  Lucy thought her eyes glanced down to her own slim but soft stomach, and just as a smile spread of Caitlin's face Lucy turned away, her heart pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye Lucy could see Caitlin casually turn back to the front of her class.  Her expression had changed completely now.  That pudgy face wore a knowing smile, although what she knew Lucy could only guess.  Lucy was slouching in her seat, trying to disappear, forcing her shoulders forward to hide how her breasts and stomach had become more plush.  But Caitlin now looked almost confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end of glass, a low rumble erupted from Caitlin's stomach.  She rubbed it and blushed.  Lucy blushed, too, feeling embarrassingly, inconveniently aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, Lucy rushed out, no longer caring of her slight gain was on full display.  She had to get away from Caitlin.  She ran to a bathroom down a hall she saw nobody walking down to splash some water on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost shaking, unsure as to how to classify the mix of emotions she felt.  Aroused and embarrassed came to mind.  As an aside, she wished she had let herself gain a few pounds so quickly, as in her fantasy world the ultimate would be if she stayed perfectly thin and Caitlin had plumped up as she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy?\" Caitlin said while opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lucy said out loud, spinning around to face the music.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy tried to stay focused on Caitlin's face, but her eyes kept darting up and down her body.  Over her now meaty thighs and wide, blubbery hips, constantly returning to her once firm tummy, now a wobbling ball of fat, her much larger breasts which she as clearly trying to hide although she once displayed them proudly.  Lucy grabbed her books and held them over her own stomach, sucking in her miniscule bit of flab.  Caitlin didn't appear to notice how frantically Lucy was trying to stay focused.  She took a few awkward steps forward, her eyes aimed downward, a pursed smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, I . . . I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My help?  What for?  For chemistry?  I can do chemistry, so can you, though--\" Lucy was stammering, unintentionally backing away a few steps.  She had never before felt this way around a person, boy or girl, and wasn't sure if she was just extremely aroused or embarrassed.  She decided, obviously, both was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin brushed past Lucy's stammering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you're the smartest person in that class, and I think you know more about, well, sciency things, than anyone.  I know you don't know me, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Caitlin was talking, Lucy worked up a mix of courage and simmering internal pressure and blurted out the exact thing she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin blushed, her lips trembling as if at what had so dramatically changed about her formerly toned physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy bit her lip and held her books tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not intentionally.  I was worried,\" Caitlin looked like she was on the verge of tears as her hands pressed the sides of her belly.  \"Worried about getting f-fat.  So many girls here are gaining weight so quickly--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy gulped, making sure to keep sucking her stomach in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--that I was afraid it would happen to me.  But,\" she sniffed, pressing her hands into her belly again, \"I screwed up, Lucy.  I think you can help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy didn't have to be convinced that something very strange must have happened to turn Caitlin into such a blob overnight.  She calmed her nerves and tilted her head sympathetically.  She found herself, rather suddenly, with a colossal crush on her classmate who before now she never spoken to, and who had plumped up mysteriously as if in one of her nighttime fantasies.  And now this same classmate wanted her help, came to her practically begging for it.  Lucy was as flattered as she was excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin,\" Lucy said, looking her in the eyes and stepping forward, \"Of course I'll help you.  What do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin sniffed and smiled.  Her prayers had been answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much.  You don't know what it's like to, well, to go from what I was to this,\" she spread her arms to indicate her body.  \"Can you come by my dorm tonight around 9:00?  I'm at 501-C over in the Amsley Center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there,\" Lucy said, maybe a little too excitedly.  \"Don't worry, Caitlin.  We're two chemistry whizzes.  Whatever you did to, um, yourself, we'll fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin turned to go, smiling widely despite her sad eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again,\" she said.  \"I'll see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy felt they had a date.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ten pounds, TEN POUNDS, in a month. A month of salads and yoga and saying no to those sorority parties Amanda kept inviting her to. And yet, Lucy's flat midsection had risen like fresh dough. Dough, in fact, was what Lucy's stomach was starting to resemble. What was once firm and smooth was beginning to become soft and fleshy. Lucy couldn't say she was particularly bothered, though. Before, she could've almost passed for anorexic- at least now she looked a little healthier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHealthier. Judging from the smell wafting from the kitchen, Lucy knew she'd look even healthier soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning, Luce,\" said Amanda, gesturing to the kitchen table. \"Your breakfast is ready. It's a new waffle recipe, I'd like to hear your thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy pulled out her chair and sat down. The waffles were thick and as large as the plate, four of them stacked precariously on top of each other. They smelled heavenly, and best of all, they were covered in Lucy's favorite American fixings- at least a stick of butter, plenty of powdered sugar, and drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce in a cross-hatch pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Lucy moaned. \"These are incredible, Amanda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And they'll go straight to your thighs,</i> Amanda thought, hiding her grin with her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I packed your snacks for the day. They're in your bookbag,\" Amanda said, sipping the coffee she'd made for herself and handing Lucy her homemade milkshake. Filled with heavy cream and gaining powder, Amanda knew they were as addictive as they were delicious. And the snacks- Amanda filled Lucy's bookbag with chips, candy and junk food every day, insisting she ate them all, and was sure to fill her water bottle with leftover milkshake every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, are you free for lunch today? I thought we'd go to that buffet across campus,\" Amanda added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I only have AP biology today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid!\" Amanda grinned. \"Be sure to bring your appetite. And it's Friday, right? We can have some girl time! How does a movie night sound? I'll get the snacks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy blinked, but didn't say anything. She knew this platter of waffles could probably keep her satisfied for the day, but it's not like she had the willpower to say no to bubbly, outgoing Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n^^^^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunchtime came, and by the time Lucy arrived, Amanda had already found a large, private booth and was motioning for Lucy to sit next to her. \"I'll get you a plate,\" Amanda squealed, and came back to the table with several plates loaded with enough food to feed a family of four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think... that's... maybe too much...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! You said you were hungry, didn't you?\" Amanda said excitedly. \"Come on, open wide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I never said that,</i> Lucy thought, but too afraid to defy Amanda, she opened her mouth as Amanda stuffed a forkful of fried chicken into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it good?\" Amanda said, and Lucy struggled to nod as she chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I ordered you some burgers, too,\" Amanda said calmly, and pushed the plate of burgers toward Lucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy melted under Amanda's expectant glare. She picked up a burger with trembling hands and took a bite. The beef was juicy, the cheese was creamy, and the bun was soft. Lucy almost forgot how full she was, and finished all three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some cake, too?\" Amanda asked. Lucy shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... uh... really full, Amanda...\" Lucy muttered quietly, looking down at her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no problem! Just save some room for movie night tonight!\" Amanda said. \"I'll cover the bill, you go home and take a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nap?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It'll help you digest the food and feel less full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded, and drove back to the dorm and slept. Little did she know Amanda's plans for the so-called movie night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But be sure to enjoy the snacks I got for you!! - Amanda :)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed and dropped the note Amanda had left. Their shared bedroom was small, with just their two beds, a bedstand, mirror, and dresser to furnish it. Lucy turned to their mirror and looked at herself. Did she look... rounder? She pulled her shirt up and poked her stomach. It was barely noticeable, but it was there. A dimpled layer of fat that she could pinch and jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So what,</i> Lucy thought. <i>I've always been skinny. If it gets worse, I'll just lose it, no big deal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a few bags of Amanda's snacks and chose a movie to watch. A cheesy rom-com was just what she needed to push that slight pudge out of her mind. Lucy ripped open a bag of salt and vinegar chips and began munching. She wasn't even through the opening credits before the bag was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's nothing, the bag is just small,</i> Lucy sighed, and grabbed another, this time some cheesy popcorn. It wasn't long before this was gone, too, and her fullness from earlier in the day was practically gone. First the waffles, then the fried chicken and burgers, and now this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lucy couldn't bring herself to feel guilty for her binges. She was in college- it was about time she started enjoying herself, right? Amanda was just looking out for her, and keeping her healthy. She looked and felt much better after she ate a lot, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Lucy was about to fall asleep, a very large woman walked onto the movie screen. She didn't say anything, just walked across a street- an extra- but Lucy was entranced. What would it be like, being that big? She poked her slight paunch, glancing back and forth at the movie screen before shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I thinking?! That's so gross, and unhealthy, too. How could I even... I need to start losing this fat before I gain more...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy ducked out her door, deciding to go for a quick jog. She'd never been this big before, and she thought it would be fairly easy to lose the extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Lucy had failed to notice was the weather- it was pouring rain outside, and her t- shirt was already soaked through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoaked through... sticking to her slight chub and showcasing it to whoever was driving by. Lucy flushed pink in her embarrassment, but was also slightly enthralled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she really... gaining weight...?</span></div></div>",

I mean, I think it would be a great Psychology project.\" Molly smiled and received unhopeful glares from the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly was a tall girl, a bit of a tomboy too. She wore tight pants, but a;ways had on boyish shirts. Lucy couldn't help, but to be mesmerized by her staggering beauty and long hair. Tamika was somewhat of a tomboy too, even though she had good sized breasts and an ass to die for. Tiara was Tiara she is just as tall as Lucy accept she has a more body and a cuter face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we don't have much of a choice.\" Tiara sighed. Lucy nodded her head in agreement. \"So, what you're saying is you want us to get fat and lazy for a project?\" Molly nodded, \"It's a guaranteed A+, we all need one.\" Tiara huffed, \"Yup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy spoke, \"So, it's settled. We gain weight and see how our mindset changes and then we drop the weight right afterwards?\" The group agreed. The psychology final was upon them and all of the double experiments had been taken. Even though this project would potentially cause longterm health problems, it would be better than retaking Psych 156 all over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** **************************************<br>\r\nThat night Lucy laid in bed, wondering how the project would turn out. She had never gained a ounce in her life and always wondered what it would be like to live on the heavy side. \"Hm. I'll find out soon enough.\" Lucy set her glasses on the desk and fell into a deep slumber. She dreamt of a room, she could feel her head turn slightly to see 3 other people inside. \"What is my group doing here?\" Lucy saw something flash and then.......<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** **************************************<br>\r\nLucy arose at 8 AM. 30 minutes before class. \"Shoot I'm going to be late!\" she rushed out of bed quietly to avoid waking her roommate, changed, brushed, and took her bike to class. The whole ride there she tried to remember that dream she had. Something was odd about that dream, but there was a certain something she liked. \"I can only recall there being more.....of something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring class Molly handed each group member a few supplements to help speed up their weight gain. \"Wait we aren't trying to get fat fo' real are we?\" Tiara spoke in a nervous tone. \"The teacher really wants to see results, that's why we failed the Schizo project, and the Placebo project.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what I just passed to you guys are weight gain supplements that I've gathered from some sources. Just take two teaspoons of each before every meal along with the Girth-Pro and Appetite-Increaser and we'll have that A in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher had finished talking and dismissed class a bit early. Lucy stuffed the supplements into her bookbag and headed for the cafetera, \"This might be interesting...\"</span></div></div>",

Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner had steadily occupied more and more of her time. Although, she enjoyed every second of it. The food she ate tasted so much better than it use to. Anything, chocolate bars, muffins, steaks, oranges, and even celery sticks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her growing appetite came the growing waistband. Lucy hadn't anticipated putting on this much weight in such a short time. Sweatpants filled her closet and she was no longer a small, but a Medium-Large. Lucy noticed her roommate glancing at her a few times a day, she didn't know whether to feel insecure or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Lucy piled on uncooked ramen, frozen pizzas, and 3 bottles of mountain dew onto her midnight snack after spending hours studying for Calculus. Her meatier arms made it easy to grasp everything and her belly acted as a food hold for food. \"Oh, almost forgot.\" Lucy turned around and grabbed the supplements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************In the Social Lounge******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy set her ramen on the table, they were full of hot water and would take some time to soften. Lucy unwrapped the pizzas and set them inside the microwave. *GGGGUUURGLE* Lucy patted her belly, \"They'll be ready soon.\" She popped open the first soda to shortly satisfy her stomach. Looking down she had thought about how much she had gained. Her arms felt more plush and softer. With an unusual feeling with her breasts. She had always been an A-cup, but had quickly moved up to C-cups which made her feel slightly off balance when walking. Lucy's feet were blocked by her heavy stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beep* \"Oh, pizza's done!\" Lucy finished cooking her 'little' snack of ramen and such.

It started with the sad realization that her work khakis, which had always been flattering despite her prominent behind, were getting tighter in other areas.  A heavy college work load, less time at the gym, and constant snacking had quickly put some unwanted pounds on the already figure-conscious freshman.  She was not pleased to find her pants digging into her suddenly softer stomach.  Upon returning to her dorm a week before, she was aghast to find that in profile she now sported a rounded tummy that, at the rate she was going, would keep growing, and growing, and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Pasim hid her unsightly new flab underneath her work apron, hoping for the first time in her life that her ass would distract the eye from her growth up front.  She had enough to worry about, now she had to worry about her weight, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was empty as Pasim and her co-worker Ashley closed up.  Pasim took off her apron, narrowing her dark, beautiful eyes in distaste as she hastened to pull down the tight, black polo shirt that had ridden up just a tad over her belly.  She looked at the schedule for next week.  More of her hours had been cut.  That wouldn't do.  She needed money--at the very least, she would have to invest in some new jeans until she could work out a new gym schedule and get her body back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Ashley looked with concern between Pasim and the schedule.  \"Oh, yeah, they're cutting hours left and right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was the kind of tall, slim, blonde that Pasim would presumably be designing fashions for once she graduated, but right now felt pangs of jealousy at her figure that she hadn't felt since her ass first started ballooning out in middle school.  Pasim's ass exploded while all her friend's gained their breasts.  It didn't seem fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair,\" Pasim whined, her hands on her soft hips, \"What are we supposed to do?  We have bills to pay, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell me,\" Ashley said.  Then, after a moment, she spoke as if confiding a secret.  \"Hey, if you want to make some extra money, there's a research lab nearby, testing new drugs and stuff--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim was taken aback.  She held up her hand, intrigued by easy cash, but wanting some guarantee that it would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, what research lab?  What tests?\" <i>And more important,</i> she thought as she absentmindedly tugged her shirt down over her stomach again, <i>how much does it pay?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's totally safe,\" Ashley said.  \"But their test subjects fill up fast so you gotta' get in early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, intriguing.

Some girls just gain weight easily, there's nothing they can do,\" Ashley said it in her oblivious, airy voice, and Pasim knew there was no offense intended.  She just said things like that somethings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to get back to the gym more,\" Pasim said.  She used to spend so much time there.  She was never muscular, but she was toned.

I'll meet you there when you get off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Ashley beamed, making Pasim feel a little less offended.

There are signs.  It's a big officey building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice.  I'll see you there,\" Pasim said, as she waved and headed to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and later why don't we hit the mall? I'm really good at finding clothes that'll hide your belly,\" Ashley shouted loud enough for some customers to hear while acting like she was whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Pasim said, blushing, and rushing to the car.  And Pasim knew a bit about fashion and body shape herself, even if she wasn't used to the shape her body was getting, so the comment was doubly insulting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh well, that's just Ashley,</i> Pasim consented.</span></div></div>",

Maybe this herbal supplement might even be good for her, she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pharmacon building was a large, nondescript office building with few windows and a mostly empty parking lot, located down an empty road and surrounded by trees.

One, who appeared to be the senior of the group, was older, and looked around concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he said to Pasim and Ashley, smiling broadly, \"Are you two really the only ones who came by for the trial of our new herbal supplement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim stood up and shook the man's hand, and along with Ashley wound up shaking all six of the scientists' hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, follow me, ladies,\" the scientist, whose name turned out to be Dr. Mallory, lead them down one of the many halls as he spoke.  \"There is really not too much to tell.  This is an herbal supplement made from synthetic enzymes meant to replicate the effects of supplements already on the market.  But ours we believe will be more effective, since most of those are placebos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Placebos have their place but we like to make products that work,\" another scientist, a younger woman with King on her name tag, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others stayed back mostly while Dr. Mallory and Dr. King explained how it would work.  They would have to take one pill a day in the night, then one in the morning, and write down how they felt.  They would have to record how much they weighed, what they ate, and how they generally felt throughout the day.  They would be given a thousand dollars at the end of the two week trial, which both Ashley and Pasim gasped at.  It was far more than they would have expected for such an innocuous product testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir weight, blood pressure, and BMI were measured, and they both provided urine and blood samples.  As Pasim was weighed right next to Ashley, she saw Ashley's eyes widen at Pasim's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"153?  But you're so short,\" she said, meaning it more as an observation with no offense intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be 130.  Then I was one 140 . . .\" Pasim trailed off.  She'd be happy to get back to 140 again, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, with four inches on Pasim in height, was a mere 125.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. King brought them a bottle of the pills each.  They looked normal, except the containers were unmarked except for the Pharmacon logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we start taking them tonight?\" Pasim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take your first one right now,\" Dr. Mallory said.  Shrugging, they complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for participating in our study.  We do wish more people would have applied, but it's just a supplement.  It's not like we're testing the cure for cancer today,\" Dr. Mallory said with disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although we are also doing that,\" Dr. King corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving said their good byes with their experimental supplements in hand, Pasim and Ashley left the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still want to go shopping?\" Ashley asked.  Judging by her expression a \"yes\" would have made her day.  \"We are going to have a thousand dollars in two weeks, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not expecting that much,\" Pasim considered it.  She finished most of her homework earlier, so why not?  And maybe Ashley might be a fun friend to have, or at least somebody she could hang out with.  \"Yeah, sure, let's get the mall before it closes.  Let's get some food while we're at it.\"  Pasim hadn't eaten in hours, and her lightly growling tummy sounded like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, but nothing too greasy, or you'll be all bloated and nothing will fit right,\" Ashley said considerately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim sighed.  \"Ashley, you . . . you have to learn how to rephrase things sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley only looked confused.  Her stomach also growled, louder than Pasim's, which caused her to giggle as the two went to their cars to meet at the mall.</span></div></div>",

I was joking you're not fat, you're so sexy, you're beautiful and thick, if you were confident like me the guys would be all over you I swear!!\" Ash said enthusiastically, \"all I have are these big tits that guys can't stop looking at.\"  She said as she grabbed her breast not realizing how conceited she sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick? Isn't that what they say when you're fat? Pasim thought to herself, \"shut up before I have to slap you\" Passim joked, \"You're tall, have legs to kill for, a cute face, you're super fit, I'm just saying the guys have more to look at than your tits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot smart\" Ash replied while sticking out her tongue, \"but I mean it, you are so sexy, you have an ass to die for, beautiful eyes, you're a 10 too you know, but don't worry we're gonna eat and get you some sexy clothes to show off those sexy curves of yours after we eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about showing off my curves, but you know I'm always down to shop, but let's get some food I've only had one pastry today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, alright, ummmm, subway? It's the only place here that serves a reasonably priced salad, salad munchers cost way to much am I right, plus we're in a hurry to shop so it shouldn't take too long right? What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim wanted a juicy burger, with fries, and a milkshake, but she agreed with Ashley to avoid looking like a fatty in front of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya sounds good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 walked to the food court finally stopping at subway. Ashley ordered a salad, no meat all veggies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey P, I'm gonna get us a table, I'll meet up in a bit\" Ashley said as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim was starving so she ordered a footlong turkey sub. Turkey is healthier she thought to herself as she asked for double meat and double cheese on her order. She then made it a combo and got a bag of chips, cookie and a drink. She quickly paid and looked for Ashley. As she went to sit down Ashley spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to eat ALL THAT, I didn't know you were that hungry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim sat down feeling how tight her pants were and how much more of the seat her ass took now at 153. \"Ummmmm, I'm saving the other half for dinner\" she replied as she reluctantly only took one half of the sandwich out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duhhhhhh, Sorry, dumb blonde moment\" Ashley laughed as she took another bite of her salad. Pasim was glad she ate the cookie while walking  to the table now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they ate they talked about school, work and friends. Ashley only finished half her salad before she complained she was stuffed and rubbed her slim belly. Pasim had finished her food and still craved the 2nd half of her sandwich but to save face said she was full too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Time to shop!\" Ashley said as she walked back to subway to grab a to go bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait here\" P replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob, be back in a sec!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ashley left Pasim's belly growled yet again despite being filled up with enough food to usually leave her full for the day. What is wrong with me today she thought to herself as she rubbed her still hungry belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley returned from Subway with a bag for the Salad and the 2 coworkers and classmates got up to leave. As they were  leaving the food court Pasim realized she left the 2nd half of her sandwich at the table they were sitting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ashley! I left my dinner at our table, you mind waiting here while I go grab it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I need to go to the bathroom anyway, meet here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" And with that they split up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim quickly found her sandwich but the hunger pangs coming from her stomach were becoming more noticeable as she walked up to grab the 2nd half. If I eat it here really quickly I can just tell Ashley someone threw it away she thought greedily. She quickly unwrapped the other half of her sandwich and scarfed it down nearly choking on a few bites. Even she was impressed, she had to have finished that sandwich in less than a minute, maybe a minute 30 tops. She quickly cleaned herself up and walked back to the meet up spot where Ashley was already waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your sandwich\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone threw it away, it was supposed to be dinner Pasim said feigning disappointment, \"nothing some retail therapy can't help\" Pasim replied as she subconsciously rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl that sucks but hell ya! Let's go to Sephora 1st\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sephora happened to be next to a juice/smoothie shop so the ladies picked up something from there. Ashley going for the fresh pressed greens and Pasim ordering a \"healthy\" fruit smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they went to Forever 21 which was next to a Cinnabon. Ashley was still casually sipping on her juice but Pasim had already finished her smoothie and craved more. She tried on some clothes which were disappointingly a surprising amount of sizes larger than her previous clothes had been. But at least they still looked really cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was surprisingly full and since she had already bought her clothes she told Ash she was gonna go wait outside while Ashley tried on and bought her clothes. While waiting Pasim had to pass the time so naturally she bought and ate a Cinnabon while waiting. She could feel her pot belly sticking out further and further with every snack she got but she couldn't help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZara's was next to a pretzel shop, Nordstrom Rack had a cookie store right next to it, H&amp;M was next to a store that served a thick shake to die for. Every single one of the 7 stores they went to had something delicious next to them and Pasim was helpless to resist. She stopped at all of these places because Ashley was taking her sweet time. Which normally wouldn't be a problem but today wasn't a normal day. Pasim while normally relatively good at controlling what she ate couldn't stop stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Pasim was the friend everyone waited on but this time the tide had turned. Her surprising hunger made her want to rush but also she was surprisingly on point today. Everything she chose looked good so she finished shopping much faster than usual. So fast that she'd buy her clothes, eat her snacks and still come back in time to help Ashley make a decision regarding which top to pick and which dresses really showed off her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim's belly was so full of junk that her Starbucks shirt refused to cover the lower half of her overflowing pot belly no matter how hard she tried to pull it down. She put on a sweater she bought to cover up her surging belly. After nearly 3 hours the snack and shop fest had to come to an end. The mall was getting ready to close but not before Ashley suggested they go to Victoria secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Ashley, I have to study for a test and do some homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your mouth, we've been on a roll today, me and you have found so much cute clothes and makeup, best part everything we've gotten has been on sale so I have like 300$ to spend so I'm not taking no for an answer, we're going to Victoria Secret!\" With Ashley finishing up her speech she quickly grabbed Pasim's hand and dragged her to Victoria secret with surprising force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, you 300$ to spend? What does that mean?\" Passim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents give me 2000$ a month to spend on my credit cards and when I make A's on my tests I get another 250$. They pay it off every month and today's the last day of the month so I got a lot of spending to make up for\" she laughed as Pasim looked at her like she's crazy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n250 for a test? Damn she thought to herself. She couldn't say anything though, she had 1500$ in credit cards a month for expenses and only worked so she'd have her own money to spend. \"Damn girl, hook a sister up then\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am\" Ash replied as she pulled out some booty shorts. \"3 for the price of 1, I'm deff getting 3 for me and 3 for you sexy, compared to you I have no ass\" she said as she stuck out her toned and surprisingly round booty. \"I told you I was gonna make you show off your curves and no better way to do that then with some booty shorts that really emphasize them ASSetts\" Ash laughed as she slapped Pasims ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to, seriously\" Pasim said as her booty wobbled but it was too late. Ashley was already pushing the 2 into the dressing room to try on the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that's one hot piece of fat ass\" Ashley said as she put both hands on Pasims booty causing the latter to blush. Then the overhead speakers stated 10 minutes till closing time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, we gotta hurry, let's go Passim, put on your pants, I'll buy the shorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously you don't have too----\" Ash interrupted before P could finish her sentence, \"shut up, I have money, I love you, I'm buying you some sexy clothes so you can pick up some sexy men, no ifs ands or butts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\", P replied reluctantly \"but I'm going to wait outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley finished paying and met Pasim outside where she was standing next to a cupcake shop that was closing up. Pasim was proud that she resisted getting any cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also got some really cute and sexy yoga pants that I know will look good on you, since I'm not the only one with legs to die for and they were 2 for 1, we can totally match\" Ashley said with excitement as she handed pasim the VIctoria secret bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really didn't have to\" P replied slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, shut up I told you I wanted to already, plus me and Jake broke up so we can totally go pick up hot guys together\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slut, isn't that the 3rd guy this month\" Pasim said as the duo started heading towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley just stuck out he tongue, \"isn't college for experimentation and fun? Who knows maybe I'll get with a few girls too\" she said flirtatiously while winking at Pasim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the cupcake store employee that was closing shouted at the ladies. He offered each of them a dozen cupcakes they were gonna throw out and Ashley happily accepted the cupcakes for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they struggled to hold all the bags of clothes and boxes of cupcakes the duo finally made it to their respective cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, I hate sweets, I just took the cupcakes because I never turn down anything free\" Ashley said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, more food to stuff in my gut Pasim thought while rubbing her engorged but still hungry belly. She reluctantly accepted the cupcakes and put them in her car. \"Thanks she said but honestly I don't need them either\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, I live in an apartment by myself off campus anyway, you can share them with your roommate at your dorm, but I gotta go! See you at work Tuesday!\" Ashley said as she got in her BMW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Wednesday, they took me off the Tuesday shift\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitches, well I'll see you soon! Bye sexy!\" And with that Ashley drive away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, I had a roommate in my dorm but she left and I never got a replacement she thought to herself as she got in her car. Just wonderful Pasim thought sarcastically, I still feel like I can still eat. What the hell is wrong with me? With that she unbuttoned her way too tight pants, gave her pregnant looking belly room to breath and made sure the cupcakes were within grabbing distance and left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pasim sat in her car, idling in her parking spot. Her younger sister was texting her about some stupid prom stuff and some of her fashion friends were trying to get her to go out to a party. The whole time Pasim was texting she was eating. She was so concentrated on her various conversations she didn't even realize she was eating the cupcakes sitting within reaching distance of her slightly toned but still chubby arms. Her belly had been calling out for food and her subconscious was more than happy to oblige. She was so engrossed by her phone she only looked away when her hand couldn't find any more cupcakes in the 1st box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim- girl I would love to party, but I got a test and 2 homework assignments due Monday AND I have to meet up with some textiles girls in our group project, I don't think I can make it <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/frown.png\" alt=\"*Frown*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Frown\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess- GIRL GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT THE DORM AND INTO MY LIFE, I miss you &lt;/3 , just come out to the party tonight, there's some football players that I KNOW love the booty, plus my roommates cute brother is gonna be there, he's single and smart <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim was about to respond but realized the 1st dozen cupcakes were already gone. \"What the fuck\" she said as she tossed the empty box onto the ground. \"Did I really eat 12 fucking cupcakes already\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted up her sweater to look down at her food baby. She grabbed it angrily and shook it. \"Stop eating dammit\". She then pulled out the notebook she's had to carry and took note of the dozen cupcakes she'd eaten in a span of 10 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, get it together P, you got this, just drive to the dorm and go to bed, you can't eat while you sleep. She put her car in reverse and reversing she picked up a cupcake and took a bite without even thinking. As soon as she noticed she dropped the cupcake and something in her just snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped her belly making a loud SMACK sound which in turn caused her to yelp in pain and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it, if it's food you want it's food I'll give you\" clearly agitated about the whole situation. She finished the rest of the cupcake and greedily started stuffing whole cupcakes in her mouth and chewing messily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer university was a nationally recognized party school and all the restaurants around her had \"drunk munchie\" specials that started up at 9. Basically lots of greasy goodness that'd sober up even the drunkest frat boys. The special was designed to be shared by groups of 4 or more and be a cheap easy way to get everyone in the car food. This time around all the food was all for one slightly chubby bottom heavy Indian girl named Pasim Nashir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got to her 1st stop she'd finished the 2nd dozen cupcakes and pulled into the Charlie's Chicken drive through. Their special included a 4 piece chicken strip, 4 chicken legs and thighs and 4 sides of your choice (Pasim choice fries, mashed potatoes, Mac &amp; Cheese and fried okra)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was Big Burgers whose special included 4 quarter pounders with cheese, 4 fries, 4 fish sandwiches which unfortunately couldn't be substituted and 4 dessert items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have called it a night there but her mind was clouded with uncontrollable rage towards her belly and a refusal to listen to reason that perhaps eating all this food was counterproductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at 2 more places renowned for their drunk munchies, a Mexican restaurant called Taco Gordos and a pizza shop called Fat Sals. She finally pulled into her dorm parking and was ready to go all out on the food she purchased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready belly, to never eat again\" she spoke as she squeezed her belly as hard as she could and really started feasting. By the time she parked she'd already finished all the chicken, the fries from big burgers and Charlie's and the 4 burgers but still didn't feel anywhere near as stuffed as she should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd be embarrassed if anyone saw her feasting on food that could have fed at least a dozen people but at this point she didn't care, all she thought about was punishing her belly. She didn't care about enjoying her food either, in one hand was a taco and the other key lime pie. She didn't stop gorging until she heard her car horn go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's eaten so much that her belly was literally pushing into the car horn. This realization caused her to blush out of sheer embarrassment. 'Oh god' she thought as she stuffed the rest of her burrito in her mouth and moved her chair back. After her little binge she finally surveyed the damage she caused to the specials. All that was left was half a pizza (out of 3 that she ordered), a taquito, and a churro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At this point I mines as well finish the rest of it because I'm apparently destined to have the worlds fattest ass' Pasim thought as the anger went away replaced with a calm serenity that naturally comes after making horrible decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate at a much slower rate wondering what was wrong with her because while she felt full, she wasn't anywhere near as stuffed as she should have been after eating practically her body weight in junk. If anything she should have exploded from the sheer amount of food, but here she was getting ready to finish 4 drunk munchie specials by herself after snacking non stop at the mall. Her belly pushed out like she swallowed a massive beach ball. To the touch her belly was taut but still soft to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was throwing the last of the churro into her mouth when all of a sudden!</span></div></div>",

She felt the heat of embarrassment rise throughout her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, come on,\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry-uuuurp!\" Pasim said, gripping her tummy. Stuffed full of pounds and pounds of food, the most recent of it quite gassy, she would feel the skin of her belly ripping as the gas struggled to get out. \"Bwuuurp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coming to the party or not?\" Ashley said, pleading in her voice, \"Like half of everyone left so it's not a big huge crowd if that's what you scared of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not-urp!-scared of crowds, I just got a lot to do,\" Pasim said. \"Ooooh-urp!\" She winced in pain as her stomach gurgled and stretched. The weight of all she had eating was starting to hit her. Her stomach felt sore and taught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come ooooon, you gotta' meet Jason, he's my roommate's brother. He's so sweet and single!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I really don't know . . .\" Pasim leaned back and moaned. Her jeans had come unbuttoned long ago. Now when she leaned back her sweater freely exposed her swollen belly. She pulled it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, don't be like that, it's the weekend, come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim sighed. Her stomach gurgled and rumbled, causing her to wince in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Fine. But I'm not wearing those booty shorts, at least not tonight, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ass looks fine in those jeans already!\" Ashley said, enthusiastic that her friend was coming, \"I'll tell Jason, I'll bet that guy loves cute and smart Indian girls with fat asses and skinny wastes,\" Ashley laughed. \"See you here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim sighed again looking at her engorged stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, skinny wastes,\" she muttered to herself, furious at her insane binge to punish her stomach. <i>Well, who's laughing now?</i> she thought. As if to answer, her stomach gurgled out another belch. Resigned to a night of partying, Pasim took off to the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pasim wasn't sure what Ashley meant that half the people left, because there still must have been at least fifty people there. Some outside, some inside, all just drinking hanging out around the large rented house. She parked where she could. As she got out of her car she wobbled a little and had to lean back against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" she blurted out. She tugged her sweater and looked down. She gasped. She turned and looked at her reflection in the car door. She gasped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim had always had decent sized breasts to match her ass and hips, especially for her height, but now they had a new friend. Her stomach jutted out, huge and bloated, just as far as her breasts. It looked perfectly round, tugging on her loose sweater. She pulled it down and rubbed it. It was tight to the touch even with her usual tummy fat. All that food was now resting, churning, weighing her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whined loudly and started to get back in the car. Unfortunately, she was spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pasim!\" Ashley came stumbling over from the porch. She was clearly drunk. Pasim felt a lot of annoyance that the tall, slim girl looked even taller and slimmer than usual in her short skirt and tummy-baring tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girl! I'm so glad you came out!\" Ashley drunkenly hugged Pasim, forcing a little burp out as she pressed her flat stomach against Pasim's bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp-all right, all right, careful,\" Pasim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Ashley looked down and her eyes went wide. \"Girl, what have you been doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley placed both her hands on the side of Pasim's tummy, an act that would have been impossible before with her soft, but still only a little puffy, stomach. Pasim pushed her hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, and stop that,\" Pasim said. She already regretted coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry, P, it's not that noticeable if you, um, just don't stand so people can see you from the side,\" Ashley said, nodding emphatically as if just coming up with the perfect solution. \"And it's dark so, like, nobody will think you're pregnant or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Pasim said. The two started walking toward the house. As they came close, somebody ran up to meet them. He had a drink in one hand and one in the other. He was average height, moderately in shape, and pretty cute. He spoke in a nervous kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ashley, um, you must be Pasim?\" he said, \"I'm Jason. Ashley said you liked martinis,\" he handed the drink to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Pasim said said, glad to take the drink. She took a big gulp, surprised anything more would fit in her stomach. As she leaned her head back and forward, she had to tug her sweater down again. \"Thanks. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jason said, awkwardly. He couldn't have been nearly as drunk as everyone else there. \"This is my first drink. I have to drive home later,\" he said as if reading Pasim's thoughts. Pasim looked impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Ashley had run off. Pasim didn't know where she went but she saw the introduction from a mile away. She grinned, annoyed but, as often with today, resigned to the events at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're majoring in fashion, too?\" Jason said after an awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"too\" part piqued Pasim's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you too then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I graduated last year. Still looking for a steady job but I've done some freelance work. I'm thinking I might be more into fashion journalism than actual design but we'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Ashley should have mentioned that,\" Pasim said, smiling, \"Let's go have a seat.\" She downed the rest of her drink, shaking her head. \"And can I get another one of those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugging at her sweater self-consciously, Pasim and Jason slowly made their way to the back porch while he went to get her a drink. This was clearly the socializing porch that people could actually have real conversations at. It was quiet with only a dozen or so other people around. Ashley recognized a few from school. She was feeling a little better about the night even if her stomach still felt horribly stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse yet, the little bubbles and growls coming from her middle told her that, given half a chance, she'd keep eating and wouldn't be able to stop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was gone for a surprisingly long time leaving Pasim to her horror to burp non stop. While no one was looking or staring at her too caught up in their own conversations or too drunk to care or notice she still felt incredibly self conscious. Then finally the big one came out right before Jason came back with the supplies, her greatest fear in the world occurred and let out a massive OOOOOOOoooorp that actually caught everyone's attention and she was turning full on red before Jason came out with 2 boxes of pizza and 2 martinis on top. Jason moitioned for P to take one and everyone quickly forgot about what happened and went back to talking about whatever they were talking about before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long\" Jason replied as he sat down next to a mortified Pasim, \"the drink line took forever but the food line was empty, the parties been going for hours and the foods barely been touched, who thought it was a good idea to bring that much food for a fashion school party, these girls and guys don't eat\" he laughed as P joined in awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya... right\" she said as she started thinking about all the food that was still left then started getting angry at the fact she was thinking about food after eating her weight in carbs today. She was stuck in her own world when she was snapped back to reality when Jason asked if she was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um, totally, ya\" she said as she sipped her drink and to her surprise Jason handed her a pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome, i knew you weren't like these other fashion girls, you actually aren't afraid to eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya totally, definitely not afraid to eat\" she awkwardly laughed as she opened the pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 began talking with Jason doing most of the talking while P practically inhaled the pizza. By the time she was done to her surprise Jason had only eaten 2 slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go girl, I've never seen a girl demolish a pizza like that\" Jason said as Pas blushed and looked away in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sensing things were off reiterated, \"no no, it's a good thing you eat, guys like meat on them bones, as I heard a friend say once, meat are for men and bones are for the dogs\" he looked at P and realized it didn't make her feel any better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying I'm fat, is that it? Well I'll show you fat asshole\" P replied as she snatched Jason's pizza box and began eating as she tried to hold back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat in silence as he saw P inhale the other 8 slices of pizza just as fast as she finished the 1st box. Then he spoke up, \"look I think you're beautiful, you're smart, cute, have great breast, sorry I'm a little drunker than I thought, but idk I really liked talking to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim wiped her tears away, she knew this was only Jason's 3rd drink and he didn't drink any of it yet but it made her feel good and she smiled, \"I do have great breast don't\" she winked as she grabbed her boobs and bounced them up and down immediately regretting doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, can we pretend i didn't do that and just um, thanks, I like you too you're not like the other fashion students, you aren't pretentious or gay\" she joked as Jason laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope not gay but maybe a bit pretentious\" Jason quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP was feeling better about herself but still wondered how much food was actually left, \"how much food was there anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a shit ton, donyou have snap chat, I made it my story, here add me\" he said as he handed P his phone, \"and maybe put your number in it too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP giggled and put her number in his phone saying \"smooth move dork\" before looking at the snap and her jaw literally dropped. In the picture there was a feast of food left, a ton of cookies, boxes of pizza, 3 cakes with only 2 missing pieces from them, a cheese plate, prosciutto, the works and all of it looked like it's barely been touched. P's belly suddenly let out a loud roar which caused the patio people and Jason to look at her again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, indigestion, from the pizza\" she said as she chugged quickly finished her martini cursing her belly for betraying her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha no worries P, relax okay, it's such a shame it's all going to go to waste and get thrown away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya....\" she replied as she started trying to figure out how she could make sure it doesn't go to waste before snapping back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey want another drink?\" Jason asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya\" she said looking down at her empty glass, \"and maybe a slice of cake\" she smiled as Jason shook his head and walked back Into the party <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he shut the door, her stomach let out another growl. \"Dammit\" she said to herself as she shook her aching belly, \"shut up, I'm with a guy I like\" she said louder than she thought as the people outside for a 3rd time looked at her like she was a mad woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCringing hard she looked at the people and said \"sorry stomach problems\" and sat in awkwardness as she waited for Jason to come back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pasim's belly growled louder still as she sat waiting for Jason. She rubbed it self-consciously. She leaned back, tugged her sweater down, but realized that only made it look even bigger. She remembered the food log she had to keep for the herbal supplements she was testing and dreaded how long just the first day would be. It just didn't make sense. She knew she had been eating worse since her gym closed but even she never stuffed herself like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the word \"belly\" whispered between three very thin, very pretty girls on the other side of the patio while looking at her. Pasim fumed. She could get over herself drunkenly stuffing herself and grabbing her breasts as she knew Jason could get over his own fumbling attempts at sweet talk, but she always found it harder to stand open mockery. She stood up, once again tugging her sweater down, all too aware that her unbuttoned jeans must be very obvious, and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I feel heavier,</i> she thought with a groan as she gently rubbed her sorely bloated belly. She actually had to adjust her walk to account for the added weight. At least it was just a monumental food baby, though, she consoled herself. In her rather drunk state she temporarily forgot that such a huge caloric intake must have longer lasting effects than just a swollen stomach for a night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking Pasim found herself at the table in Jason's picture. The cake was there, the snacks, the cookies, everything. She took one cookie and began munching on it, then a second, then two at a time. She moved along the table, one hand tugging her sweater down in frustration. She could feel that rage building up in her again, that irrational anger that caused her to attempt to stuff her belly into submission. <i>Great, we saw how great that worked out,</i> she thought with annoyance as she calmed herself. When she got to the cheese she wound up stuffing most of the bite sized chunks in her mouth in a matter of minutes. Being just mildly lactose intolerant the effect on her already full stomach were immediately. It growled in protest as well as satisfaction. She hunched over and held her arms around her belly. It passed quickly the feeling of that hard, increasingly dome-like stomach did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But why am I still eating?</i> she thought, taking a bite out of the cake, completely forgetting Jason had gone to get her a piece. <i>What is wrong with me?</i> Her exposed lower belly grazed the table. She shuddered but still took took a few more huge bites of the cake, sticking the fork into the uncut cake without even bothering to cut herself a piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooorp!\" she belched oddly, staggered, and held her belly in both hands. She could still feel that soft layer of fat that she had been developing but now it felt like a bowling ball had been shoved behind it. She looked down the table and whimpered. Against all judgement regarding her self control, not to mention he figure, she knew she was going to keep eating unless something stopped her. The thought wasn't just depressing, it actually started to scare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Pasim jumped and belched again as she felt a hand on her shoulder, thankfully interrupting what was the third, fourth, or maybe fifth, feast of the day.</span></div></div>",

She was always the drunkest bitch at the party and 2 she really did care about her friends. She'd lost many a friend from getting drunk and giving her bff at the time bf a hand job or by being too blunt and honest wth a friend after a few brews. Pasim had been her longest lasting real friend and so when she saw her by the food she had to say hello leaving whatever boy she was with to go be with her. When the boy tried to follow her to P she just shoo'd him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe startled P by sneaking up on her while she was eating cake. She noticed her chubby friend's belly sticking out and the hoodie that now failed to quite completely cover her belly. Passim turned around quickly in fright which caused her belly to wobbly a bit when Ash spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitchhhhh, there you are\" she said as she opened her mouth and pointed at P's fork wth had a small bite of cake on it. Passim while confused at 1st noticed and oblidged her much drunker girlfriend, as soon as Ash took a bite she swiped the fork and got a much bigger bite and practically crammed it down P's throat. \"Girl I've been such a slut tonight\" she giggled as she put another bite to P's face getting half the cake on her friends face and the other half in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so? What have you been doing I haven't seen you since you paired me off with Jason and ran off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh now had the hick ups as she spoke, \"girl (hic) I gave the guy that drives the Lamborghini around campus a hand (hic) job, his dad is like the owner of some oil thing in some fucked up country or something, I think I have a (his) sugar daddy now\" she laughed as P stood there awkwardly with her taller blonde friend wrapping her arm around her shoulders feeding her cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am i letting her feed me cake thought Pasim embarrassed and worried about what anyone would think that was still left at the practicality dead party, where was Jason? \"Ummm cool, you're a bit drunk huh Ash are you good?\" She asked concerned about her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh leaned into Passims ear sensually and gave her a gently kiss, \"baby I'm always good when I'm with my sexy desi, take me home baby!\" She said as she leaped up into P's arm and nearly falling but P caught her just in time, \"I knew you'd catch me unlike these loser guys\" she winked. \"Now here's your reward\" with P still holding her she grabbed a handful of cake and took a small bite herself before forcefully cramming it in P's mouth which causes her to drop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP panicked as her drunk friend fell, \"oh my god Ash I'm so sorry I didn't mean to drop you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hit her head kind of hard but got up quickly and laughed, \"Bitch fuck you! No im just kidding I love ya, im just wasted tonight baby, how did Hanging with Jason go?\" She asked as she elbowed her friends newly developing muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, good he's actually cool, we got a long really well,  he studied fashion, he's not gay, everything went well but I can't find him anywhere\" as she finished she reached down for more cake and to her horror realized there wasn't any cake left! How did she let this happen, anything good with Jason is going to be ruined if he sees what a pig I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley noticed P reach for the cake and spoke up, \"girl we killed that cake\" she said as she grabbed P's hand and places it on her abs and she put her hand on P's very different 6 pack, \"girl I know you did good with Jason, I saw him with his drunk friend Michael, if you think I'm bad that boy can't handle his liquor\" she laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know we're good?\" Asked Passim inquisitively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you thick as hell bitch\" Ash replied as she shook P's belly and smacked her ass, \"he's a chubby chaser, he did his honors thesis on the history of plus sized fashion, used to work for a plus size fashion magazine before going freelance and if you think you're fat now you're tiny compared to his last gf, his last gf was a fat like porn model, she was like bigger than a bbw, like there's a whole term for it, I know he liked ya\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP was embarrassed her friend had indirectly called her fat and hooked her up with a guy specifically because he likes fat chicks, \"what the fuck I'm not that fat you bitch, you hooked me up with a chubby chaser because you think I'm fat, fuck you Ashley that was so mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's hot too, why do you care? You said things went well, who cares, ignore everything I just said\" Ash replied oblivious to how hurt P really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fuck you, you're an entitled bitch! Fuck you im out\" P had started tearing up as she walked away furious at her so called bff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was tearing up too as she called out, \"wait I'm sorry, please Passim don't go, I'm sorry, just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then Passim was out of ear shot trapped in her own head, 'fuck this party, fuck Jason and most of all fuck Ashley' she started to calm down and her thoughts shifted, 'idk, should I confront Jason if I see him or play it cool he really is cute, god im officially fat fuck, I need the gym especially after tonight, why do good nights always have to get ruined fuckkkkk' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassim was still feeling crummy and wanted to eat her feelings </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pasim was drunk, furious, and humiliated, but still responsible enough to not try to drive back to the dorm. She stumbled off the lawn to the sidewalk walking as fast as she could considering how tipsy and full she was. Her enormous belly jiggled and the tight contents sloshed with each step, so much so that she had to hold it with both hands partly just to keep her hoodie from riding up too much. It had been merely embarrassing before, now she was positively ashamed, horrified even, of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim's head cleared a little as she walked down the street. The sounds of the dying party faded into the night as she walked along the streets of the town square. It was starting to get chilly. The breeze tickled the exposed skin of her lower belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck me,</i> she thought as he pace slowed. Slowly she was feeling a little more sober. The tightness of her stomach returned. Even though it felt soft that little layer of fat covered a big, heavy bowling ball of food. It was heavy, weighing down her steps. She replayed parts of the night through her still drunk, although not was agitated mind, and was horrified at herself. The pleasant conversations with Jason . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He really is cute, and smart, and funny, it was so much fun . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer awkward attempt to draw attention from her belly and to her breasts, which even if they have grown slightly in recent weeks were still firm and sexy-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god, he was staring at my fat gut the whole time, wasn't he? I mean, I'm not chubby, right? Just a little thick like Ashley said, right? This is only temporary . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley fed her half a cake and she just let her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell was wrong with me? And her! And . . . it didn't feel bad or even good, it just . . . it just happened . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled. With a stomach was packed as Pasim's the feeling felt like it was constricting into itself with no room to go. She turned into a late night diner with a few patrons. She recognized two of the girls in one of the booths as being from the party. Thin and flirty, typical fashion students, Pasim thought. She hefted herself into a stool. As usual she had to tug her hoodie down constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuna melt and some eggs, please,\" she said, barely thinking. Her head was pounding. When the food came from the lethargic waiter she dug in slowly. She rubbed her stomach through her sweater gently as she eat. Each bite forced into her overfilled stomach felt like she was getting that much closer to bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I stop?\" she said to herself. She put her phone on the counter and opened a list app. Hamburgers, pizza, tacos, half a cake-no, an entire cake-some cookies . . . She shook her head at the list. She had never been more ashamed of herself. Months, no, years, of keeping her figure in check could be ruined. She couldn't let it happen. And yet, she finished her melt and eggs without difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back to her dorm. She was still angry with Ashley, but the more she thought about she was angrier with herself. Ashley couldn't help how she was. Pasim even doubted that Jason's chubby chasing ways were even a factor in her introducing them. Maybe even Jason saw her, mentioned it to Ashley, and Ashley thought \"Sure, why not?\" completely forgetting he connection. Maybe. But even if that was true Ashley had come dangerously close to outright calling Pasim fat many times, and that was before today's enormous, constant binging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Ashley wasn't back. Pasim, wobbling from drinking and the intense fullness and weight in her middle, Ashley put on a pair of sweats a t-shirt. She took off her bra, surprised by much tighter it was these days than before. The t-shirt rode up to her belly button and her stomach pushed her sweatpants down. Looking straight down, she could see that her belly was just sticking out past her breasts. Not to mention how much of her loose pajama bottoms had gotten tighter thanks to her hips and ass gaining an inch, or two, or three, in recent weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm still pretty cute,</i> she thought as she looked at her face in the mirror, then grimaced as she looked down, <i>For now. This is it. Tomorrow the diet starts. Ashley and Jason and anyone else will never think 'fat' when they see me again.</i></span></div></div>",

She may have fell nearly face first on the ground but she'd be damned if she dropped her drink and to the amazement of the few people still left at the dying party she kept her drink in tow. Normally the bubbly, happy blonde would be overwhelmed with joy and confidence but she was just sad. She started tearing up a little bit and some drunk fuckboy came over and tried to pick up an easy lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyyy\" he slurred, \"whatever's hic, wrong baby I can make ya feel better, let's find a place so I can listen to you talk better baby girl, anyone ever told you, you're a straight 10 baby doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley just stared at the drunk bastard coldly, the chills she was sending would send any man packing but this man was a heavily intoxicated gentleman who just couldn't get the hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so pretty with your stare baby\" the drunk guy reached over to touch her hair but Ashley threw her drink into his face before he could pull his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck bitch, I was trying to be nice\" the drunkard said angry at being drenched<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just ignored him and desperately sent Pasim dozens of drunk texts before looking up and acknowledging the guy, \"you're still here? Get me another drink you made me waste and then go crawl back into the hole you came from\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunk man just stares at Ash for a moment and tried to comprehend what had happened, he left and actually brought Ashley another drink. The drunk bastard thought he was being sly, he was going to spill it on her but despite her looks Ash was a lot smarter than she seemed, especially compared to this intoxicated fellow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even taking her eyes off her phone she got up and knocked the drink into the dude and walked off earning a few oooo's and awe's from the crowd as the drunk fella just stood there defeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to get a hold of P she ran into another man at the party, \"fuck off loser\" she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Ashley, what's wrong and where's Pasim? The man said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was taken aback, she looked up and saw it was Jason himself standing in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG I'm so sorry Jason, Pasim left, i umm... long story how did you guys like each other??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What she's gone? I had to take care of my drunk friend Allen and then ran into some old friends and by the time I'm back with pizza and drinks she's gone. I been looking all over for her and Allen, hey big disappeared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait drunk friend, that wouldn't happen to be the guy in the living room with alcohol all over him would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went to the room and saw Allen passed out on the couch covered in alcohol, \"Dammit, ya that's him, look he lives right up the street, this party is dead, let me walk him a few houses down and then let's go grab some food at the diner, my treat, that girl you flung at me was actually really cool\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley thought about it, she did need some food to soak up this alcohol, \"look Allen is kind of creepy when he's blackout so take him home 1st and then we can head to the diner. That cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure, I'll be back in 5-10 Ash\" Jason said before screaming at Allen, \"GET UP YA BITCH, gotta get your lightweight ass home\" and with that he held up Allen and began the 3 house down treck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this is my chance to work everything out thought Ash as she looked at her phone trying to get in contact with Pasim.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach churned and she rubbed the exposed lower belly. The less drunk she got the more the weight of it hit her. It didn't feel like being full anymore. It felt more like she was pregnant with some kind of horribly heavy grease baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwurp,\" she belched into her hand, continuing to slowly eat. <i>At least I'm slowing down,</i> she thought, as though her body was something she could no longer control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason almost walked right up to Pasim when they walked in.

He faced away from her but could see her reflection in the window. She really was quite lovely, and cool, and funny. Was it just him, or did her belly actually look more bloated? It was a good look for her, he thought with a nod to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, P,\" Ashley stepped up to Pasim sheepishly. \"I, like, was texting you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, okay?\" Pasim said. Her initial anger had faded. Not she was just very embarrassed and self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, I wasn't even thinking when I set you and Jason up. I just thought he was a hot guy who was cool and I know you don't go for crazy drunk assholes and he isn't one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Pasim said, \"Did you have to say all that stuff about him being a chubby chaser? You know how I am about my weight. That was humiliating. I felt like a prized pig in front of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, girl, it must be rough gaining weight and not being able to stop,\" Ashley said. Pasim glared at her, \"But, you haven't gained anything, you look thick and hot, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim sighed. She even smiled a little. \"Kind of but not tonight. Grrrr, what am I doing to myself?\" she held her belly in her hands. Her hoodie barely covered it. It was so full and round now that the little flab that had been growing there had been stretched thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason's a good guy, why don't you give him a chance?\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was off and Pasim had trouble figuring out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell him that you told me, did you?\" Pasim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I can keep a secret when it's important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good . . . but . . . . mm,\" Pasim stopped in mid sentence. She blushed and felt ashamed of herself. Even Ashley looked embarrassed now. For the last few minutes Ashley had been picking up pieces of bacon from the plate and, aside from a few bites to herself, had been feeding Pasim. And Pasim had been accepting them without question like it was complete normal. It was the cake incident all over again. No wonder Pasim was getting even fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is wrong with us?</i> Pasim thought, turning away from Ashley. The plate was empty, unlike her stomach, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was blushing, but otherwise didn't appear to notice. Pasim prayed nobody in the place noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get home,\" she said. Slowly she stood up. Her stomach was weighing her down more than over. She bumped it into the counter and belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, girl, let me help,\" the even drunker Ashley said. The two held each other up and headed to the door. Ashley remembered Jason was there. She looked back and shrugged, he shrugged back with an understanding glance. Tonight was not the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move you hand, Ash,\" Pasim said. Ashley's hand had found its way to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" Pasim had to push her hand away, they walked, shoulder to shoulder, back towards their dorm. Ever the gentleman, Jason followed behind to make sure they got there okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They arrived at their dorm dead tired and drunk. Ashley went to bed without even changing. Pasim, wobbling from drinking and the intense fullness and weight in her middle, and put on a pair of sweats a t-shirt. She took off her bra, surprised by much tighter it was these days than before. The t-shirt rode up to her belly button and her stomach pushed her sweatpants down. Looking straight down, she could see that her belly was just sticking out past her breasts. Not to mention how much of her loose pajama bottoms had gotten tighter thanks to her hips and ass gaining an inch, or two, or three, in recent weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm still pretty cute, she thought as she looked at her face in the mirror, then grimaced as she looked down, For now. This is it. Tomorrow the diet starts. Ashley and Jason and anyone else will never think 'fat' when they see me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning would catch her by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley awoke somewhat late for her, it being almost 10:00. She struggled to get out of bed. She knew right off that the horrible, gut-burstingly full feeling from the night before had gone down. Instead she felt intensely sluggish, not to mention a little jiggly. She stretched as she approached he bathroom mirror and got a perfect profile shot of her tight t-shirt lifting up to show her now pudgy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not more there too,\" she said seeing her ass looking somehow larger. <i>Is this all just from yesterday?</i> she wondered. Her ass and hips had always been her most prominent feature but now on her short figure they were getting ridiculous. Her sweatpants were not that loose before. And her tummy had been getting soft, but it wasn't actually pushing out like it was now. She even had rolls of fat on her back, small ones, but not the subtle hints of flab that were there before. She grabbed a handful of belly flab and sighed with dismay. She tugged her t-shirt down but it didn't fully cover her midriff. <i>I knew I was a pig yesterday but can you gain weight this fast?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale proved it. 159. Six pounds in a day. And it looks like most of it went to her ass and hips with a nice helping to her belly just in case it was feeling left out. Even her arms and breasts were more snug in her t-shirt than they should be. Pasim felt defeated and decidedly unattractive. She spent a few minutes staring at herself from different angles, wondering what would be the best way to hide her growing curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was nursing a hangover at the kitchen counter eating some bland, flavorless cereal. The herbal pills they were testing sat nearby. Ashley had already taken hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you doing?\" Pasim asked. Ashley grinned and grunted. \"Hung over, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take your pills?\" Pasim took out the designated two and popped them in her mouth, washing it down with some orange juice. When she looked back she noticed Ashley's eyes glued to her ass. Without meaning to, she wiggled it almost suggestively as she turned around blushing. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim could tell it took all of Ashley's will power to not say all that she was thinking, \"P, your ass is looking hotter than ever today . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim scowled. Ashley probably did mean it, even if she knew the unspoken thought was something along the lines of \"it's almost fat\" or \"shame you got that gut there to throw it off but from behind you are so sexy.\" <i>Whatever, let it go,</i> Pasim thought. She knew her friend had good intentions even ifs he could be flagrantly insensitive. The loud, low sound of a stomach growling caused them both to jump and look around.</span></div></div>",

Looks like someone needs some hangover breakfast\" Ashley laughed as Pasim doing her best to maintain some integrity thanked her skinny roomie for the bowl and slowly ate it despite wanting to devour it all in one go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chit chatted for a bit with the chubby Indians belly disrupting the conversation every now and then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim had finished her bowl and self-conscious about looking like a pig didn't ask for another one despite the pleas coming from her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley then took out her phone, \"Oh shit, I'm late, I can't believe I forgot I had to work on a group project.

She grabbed the 1st thing she could which was Ashley's unfinished bowl of cereal and gulped it all down in one go. The bland cereal was next to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much in the dorm but she took up her skinnys friend over of everything that's hers is yours and finished the pop tarts, 2 tostino pizzas, pizza rolls, cookies and the gallon of milk. Their dorm wasn't well stocked and to Pasim's surprise her belly was still growling for more despite causing her shirt to now ride up to her breast sticking out as if she were pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay tomorrow I'll start my diet, today is a cheat day.\" P said as she walked to her door to leave before she realized she couldn't be seen in public like this. She changed into a semi loose fitting sweater and wore her 'fat' pants which were getting uncomfortably tight for her liking. Now she had to ponder, to go off campus to a buffet to lower the chances of running into someone she knows or just go to the dorm cafeteria and hope for the best </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pasim knew it'd have to be the cafeteria. Her stomach might be crying out for a buffet, but she dreaded having to walk so far. She knew she needed the exercise more than ever, though. Her thighs were rubbing together more than ever before. Her belly, feeling even more full and and bloated from her breakfast feast, weighed her down, making each step seem like a struggle the previously soft-but-not-quite-chubby Pasim wouldn't have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the less she thought about her ass the better. Her loose jeans might be buttoned, but they were so snug in the back they were quickly negating the comfort she hoped they'd provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, as it was getting later in the morning, the cafeteria wasn't completely full. Pasim was glad for that. It meant she could get in line, get a tray piled high with waffles, bacon, sausages, extra butter, toast, and all covered in syrup, without having to stand on display for too long. She did feel \"on display,\" too. As a short, curvy girl Pasim always felt pretty but not like she stood out that much. With her roaring belly poking out nearly as far as her breasts, she felt exposed even if she did manage to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, she bumped her hips into a few tables as she went to find a spot away from anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god,</i> she thought rubbing her hip as she sat with her heavy tray of food, <i>Did I gain that much weight that fast I can't even tell where my fat ass is?</i> It was only, what, six pounds? A lot for a night, but surely not enough to make Pasim feel as ungainly and uncomfortable, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts took a backseat to eating, though. Soon, Pasim was engrossed a heavy helping of carbs and sugar. Her belly hummed gently as she filled it. She even found herself gently caressing it while she stuffed her face with her other hand. She soon started feeling stuffed again, and an alarm went off in her brain. Yet, she kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop it!</i> she thought. She felt her soft belly stretching with food, each mouthful making her feel heavier, more stuffed. <i>Damn it, Pasim! Look what you're doing to yourself!</i> Her inner self was getting frantic. It was getting harder to breath with all the food she was packing into herself. Her tray had been stacked higher, high enough for several people larger than her, and she was plowing through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm-urp!\" she growled in frustration, and finally with a loud bang, pounded her fork on the table and leaned back. <i>There! Will power!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim moaned and leaned back. She looked around and saw people she knew, strangers, everybody around her age and almost all thinner than her. Sure, a few might be gaining the freshman fifteen, but Pasim felt like she had packed that on in this one sitting alone. Certainly her full belly held pounds of food in it. It weighed her down, pushing in and out. She moaned and belched, running her hands along the curve of her stomach, and wincing at the the thought that her stomach had such a curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, hi Pasim,\" came a voice that Pasim didn't register right away. She was drifting into a food coma right there in public. Her jaw dropped. She tried sitting up and belched as her overstuffed belly pressed into the table, into her jeans, and she hurried to pull her sweater down to cover the crescent of skin visible where her painfully tight button was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim was mortified when she saw who it was, staring down at her and her obviously swollen gut.</span></div></div>",

Her hand jumped to her growling belly, and she eyed her cereal like a winter-starved wolf. She dug in with a new fervor, downing the rest of the bowl in seconds before scanning around the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was the last time we made a grocery run?\" she asked as she desperately dug through the fridge. She found the milk and started chugging straight from the carton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's been a while, but I can swing by Safeway or something later today,\" said Pasim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley wiped her lips and discarded the now empty carton. \"Great. Let's go now. I'm so<i> hungry</i>...\" She found some leftover chicken in the fridge and started munching as she bustled past Pasim to her room, not even bothering to warm it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim was taken aback by her friend's sudden gluttony. Up until now, she wasn't even sure \"hunger\" was in Ashley's vocabulary, let alone something she'd use to describe her own state. Yet here she was, chugging a gallon of milk like it was nothing and devouring chicken breast like it was popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is in these pills?\" she wondered. She examined her bottle--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--and found Ashley's name printed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim grabbed the other bottle from the counter where Ashley was sitting, and, sure enough, found her name printed on that one. It seemed in her hungover state, Ashley hadn't bothered to read the labels too closely, and was now dealing with the same insatiable appetite that had so plagued Pasim the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was up with the batch of pills meant for Pasim, that much was clear. What kind of diet supplement would cause someone to gain six pounds in a day? It just didn't happen. Then again, maybe this is precisely what the scientists were testing in the first place--trying to nail down the formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you gonna change?\" said Ashley. \"Because I'm about to head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim looked over her friend, now dressed in jeans and a stylish top. Her eyes drifted to her midsection, which looked ever-so-slightly rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gimme a minute,\" said Pasim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait in the car.\" And with that, Ashley was out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim felt up her own pudgy belly. One thing was certain: she wasn't gonna get fattened up for this trial.</span></div></div>",

The more-than-slightly rundown gym (others might have chosen the word \"decrepit\") and its antique equipment (\"heavily rusted\") had served generations of students as the campus' main health center. However, only 4 years prior, the school had added a Physical Education major, and an accompanying health center. The muscleheads who formerly frequented the PPG to stay fit had abandoned the place in droves, and the PPG was now undertaking massive renovations in order to gain at least some of its former clientele back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the health center was not an option for Pasim, for several different interrelated reasons. Pasim came from a relatively poor family and was attending the university on a combination of scholarships and a work-study program, wherein she had to contribute a certain number of hours at any university-approved outlet in order to subsidize her tuition cost. Although the Pouncing Puma gym was poorly equipped and more ramshackle hut than it was fitness center, it had a very low monthly membership cost. The health center was an expensive investment for those without interrelated majors. Pasim's financial struggles also meant she had no car of her own. Her main sources of transportation were any of the school-sponsored programs that included a fairly extensive bus network, trolley system, and short-range golf carts. Unfortunately, the university's drive to increase the school's size had resulted in the construction of the health center in an isolated part of the campus, several miles from the nearest bus station. For the musclebound frat boys, the distance was no problem. In Pasim's case, the walk to the health center was nearly as long as her workout run (though her exercise regimen also consisted of several other sorts of workouts, such as leg lifts and squats).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim's prominent posterior quivered slightly in the wind as she still tried to overcome her shock. Of course she had heard the rumors and rumblings of a possible renovation, but she had never taken them seriously, and now she was going to pay the iron price for it. She knew all about the curse of the Nashir family; the women were incredibly beautiful with shapely figures, but the second they fell behind on their diets and exercise, they blew up faster than a water balloon under a spigot. In most cases, this didn't happen until they got pregnant: her mother had been a shapely 145 before Pasim, but her weight only grew after giving birth, and she was now around 260. On the other hand, her aunt, who had never married, had maintained a comparatively lithe 150.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim had remained in the 130 to 140 range in high school, but college and the temptations that surrounded her had traded her mostly flat stomach for a noticeably convex roll of fat pooching over her waistband, and her already ample ass had lost much of its tone. Her exercise routine had already been incredibly inadequate, but eliminating it entirely was cause for disaster. She knew what she had to do: cut back on the junk food and sweets, drink more water and less sugary drinks, show some restraint, and begin a new regimen for exercise that she can complete inside her dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Pasim sticks to her goals and manages to lose weight?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pasim really did buckle down.  She went to her dorm and threw out most of her fatty snacks she had relied on during her late night cramming sessions.  A noisy stomach would be a small price to pay if it didn't get any bigger.  She took up jogging, although it winded her easily despite being used to working out.  She recalled all too well the last few months of eating mostly right, watching the scales, and exercising regularly.  She remembered the 138 on the scale during her feet week of college jump to 142 within two weeks, then 143, then 144, and that's when she began working out in earnest.  By the end of the her third month of the semester Pasim had leveled out.  She might not like the 147 lbs she had grown to, and she hated the new jiggling feeling her formerly flat stomach had developed, but she had at least staved off the family curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if meant a lot of work, being hungry all the time, and constantly being embarrassed that even with all her she was still easily the heaviest student there.  Being short didn't help.  Her womanly curves turned to round flab all too easily.  She knew.  She had seen her mother's wedding pictures and all the ones after.  She could have made those pictures into a flip book of her beautiful, curvy mother growing obese in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Pasim's source of keeping her figure somewhat intact was gone.  But she persevered, ate little, and remained diligent.  So it was with some confusion when she found, not much more than a week after the Pouncing Puma had closed, that the seats of her jeans were feeling even more snug than usual.  Buttoning them was becoming nearly impossible, creating a good sized muffin top that her shirts were too form fitting to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"151!\" she yelled out loud as she nervously stepped on the scale.  She had to peer past her good-sized breasts and puffy tummy to see it.  She grabbed a full two, three inches of flab around her waist in her hands with a yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim sat back in her room, depressed, concerned, tugging on her shirt to keep her belly covered.  How could this happen?  She must be working harder than ever and she had just crossed the 150 mark.  She had nightmares about this.  She could imagine her classmates' faces as they watched the lovely, compact young woman balloon out of control.  She shuddered at the mental image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim's eyes went to a picture of her and her sister, Kareena.  The two were definitely sisters, but Kareena had always been the taller, slimmer one, the one who took the least after the short, curvy women in their family.  She was beautiful as well, and looked like the least likely to gain weight in school.  At two years older then Pasim, she had a head start, and she took it.  She wasn't huge, yet, but she had put on enough weight to be legitimately bottom heavy.  She didn't seem to mind as far as Pasim knew, but then unlikely Pasim Kareena wasn't getting a gut or a double chin from her gain.  She wouldn't mind talking with her as it had been a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of her sister naturally made Pasim think of her aunt Amna.  She was somewhat famous in their family for beating the so-called \"Nashir curse\" and avoided getting fat.  Maybe she'd have some advice for Pasim?  Right now, Pasim would take any help she could get to not get any heavier.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took three months for Helen to finally flip her lid over her roommate.  Combined with the summer months, that was nearly half a year of stable, sane behavior for the new college freshman.  Helen had always had problems keeping her cool, was too quick to take offense were none was intend, too prone to fly into \"psychotic rampages of revenge,\" as her therapist put it.  She thought college would be different, and for a while, it was.  Being away from the high school that tormented her so was a huge weight off her back.  Being able to focus on her studies was another plus.  Certainly being away from her paranoid, controlling parents was probably the biggest contribution to her stability of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first personl Helen really talked to at college was her roommate Pasim.  She was polite enough, didn't do anything to annoy Helen, and so was all right in her eyes.  At first, the two girls were too wrapped up in their studies to really notice each other.  Helen had no interest in making new friends, having been burned by too many in the past, and Pasim was too focused on her fashion studies.  They did get along, though, since Pasim recognized Helen's distance and didn't force herself on her, and Helen grew to actually like Pasim despite not exchanging many words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo situations endured Pasim to Helen within weeks of the start of the semester.  The first happened when Helen happened to walk by Pasim's room while she was getting dressed.  She glanced over out of habit, not particularly curious as to what she was doing in her own room.  Helen saw Pasim standing straight up, profile to her mirror, sucking her soft but mostly flat stomach in while she lifted up her shirt.  Pasim sighed, letting her stomach out, it bulging just slightly over her pants.  Biting her lip with a look of concern, she looked back and felt her prominent ass.  She sighed again, a sound of such quiet, sad acceptance that to Helen, who herself never concerned herself with her weight and maintained an average, healthy weight, made Pasim suddenly seem a lot more human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding out that Pasim went to the gym at least three times a week, that she could never get herself below 150 pounds despite all this hard work, made Pasim extremely sympathetic to Helen.  Subconsciously Helen was associating Pasim's struggle with her figure to her own struggle with her self-identity in high school, but outwardly she only knew she felt bad for her roommate.  From then on, she took the time to make small talk with her.  She even introduced her childhood friend Adam to her, something she was loathe to do with any other classmates she began talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second endearing thing was more universal--Pasim worked at the campus Starbucks and brought home leftover pastries when she worked late.  Pasim may have bemoaned how hard it was to keep her weight down, but that didn't stop Helen from snacking every other night on high-calorie bread products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim was grateful, actually.  She hated throwing away food, an attitude drilled into her by her moth and, she was convinced, was responsible for her curvy, very un-model-like figure.  So for Pasim she avoided the mom-given guilt of wasting free food, and didn't have to take any of the caloric bullets for herself.  It was win/win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two both felt the same stresses of college life that all students do.  But whereas Pasim transferred this stress to worries for her figure, Helen let it build and build, until her fragile psych finally had had enough . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the last straw that makes Pasim a target for Helen's crazy wrath?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pasim finished her homework, munching on a Starbucks muffin.  Things were going well three months into her freshman year.  She was doing decently in her classes.  She was already networking with art majors, designers, even a few girls hoping to go into modeling.  Her part time job kept her social life to a minimum, though, as when she wasn't working, in class, or doing college-related things, she was at the gym.  Associating with some very slim and beautiful potential models did not help her body image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up to see what Helen was doing, her eyes going to the full-length mirror as always.  And as always, she sighed and grimaced at that soft tummy and much too large ass.  She examined her stomach.  Did it always pooch out over her slacks like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhg, I think I'm gaining weight again,\" she said, who was on the couch watching TV and trying to do her homework.  She too was eating one of the many pastries Pasim kept bringing back from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" she said through a mouthful of food, already prepared with her stock \"no you're not you look great\" response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think these pants are getting tighter,\" she said, walking into the kitchen.  \"I mean, I spent four hours at the gym every week at least.  When is all this baby fat going to go away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen rolled her eyes, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look the same as you did when we first met,\" Helen said.  \"Stop obsessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim leaned out to look at Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to--\" she stopped, squinting.  She was so conscious of every pound on her body that she hadn't noticed that college was taking its toll on her roommate's figure, too.  Helen had an average build to start with, but now she was looking softer.  Her shirt even rode up over her stomach, which was bulging out just slightly and merging into the start of lovehandles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim must have stared too long and given her a strange look, because Helen looked concerned suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasim was obviously staring at Helen's pouting stomach.  Helen looked down at it and back at Pasim, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" Pasim said.  It was just a few pounds anyways, she told herself.  No sense in offending Helen.  She was high strung enough as it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen turned back to her show slowly, paranoid thoughts going through her head as to what exactly her roommate was thinking just now.  Pasim might have been handling the strain of college well, but for Helen, each day was bringing new and more annoyances.  She was doing poorly in her classes.  She was starting to think the same paranoid thoughts she had in high school about teachers intentionally failing her, about classmates laughing at her behind her back for her stupid comments in class.  Adam told her to take it easy but that just made Helen more frustrated.  And to top it off, Pasim's increasing obsession with her weight was starting to really get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen fumed, not sure exactly what she was so mad about but knowing there must be a cause, and it was probably Pasim.  Without so much as a bye, she left to talk to Adam.  He could calm her down at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Helen, want any--Oh, um, bye?\" Pasim said to an empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\". . . and I swear he was looking at me when he said it, like he was so much smarter than me and the professor knew it.  College was supposed to be different from high school.  Why are people such assholes here?\" Helen snacked on some chips while Adam sat in a chair across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't take things so personally,\" Adam said, as he often did.  \"Maybe if you, you know, made nice with some of these people you'd wind up liking them.  Your roommate's nice, right?  I thought she was pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's another one,\" Helen said, feeling that strange, unexplained anger at Pasim that had been growing.  \"She won't shut up about her weight.  I know she's all into fashion and stuff but it's all she ever talks about.  She'll look exactly the same as always and be convinced that, I don't know, she's gained a hundred pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't like her body image thing?  When you first told me she had these issues you talked about it like it was some heroic struggle against society for her, or something.  Now it bugs you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems a lot more self-centered and petty when it's all she ever talks about,\" Helen snapped.  \"I know I gained a few pounds but it doesn't bother me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The price of all those delicious cupcakes and muffins and such,\" Adam nodded, himself often partaking of Pasim's work leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's--\" Helen stopped, her expression suddenly turning very thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Helen thought, the wheels obviously turning in her head.  She was making connections--paranoid, conspiratorial connections, like the kind she did during the four-year-long nervous breakdown that was high school.  Something wasn't right, she knew it, and now she had a handle on it.  Pasim's obsession with her own weight.  Bringing way too many fatty snacks back to the dorm nearly every night.  All that talk about her own weight, those queer looks she kept giving Helen, and the way she was staring at her stomach earlier . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.  No way,\" Helen said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's wait a second, Helen,\" Adam said, knowing that look.  \"I want you to really consider carefully everything you just thought through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen nodded firmly and squeezed some flab at her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was her, she did this,\" Helen said, her voice rising.  \"She's been doing it from the start.  All that food, all the talk about weight to distract me--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down,\" Adam said, holding his hands level and speaking in as soothing a voice as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen didn't speak again right away.  This was how it was with her.  Things would build up, phrases and looks would be blown out of proportion, and then something insignificant would happen and she would suddenly have the idea that she uncovered some vast conspiracy.  She growled, breathing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen, listen,\" Adam took a conversational tone.  He wasn't entirely sure what he was accusing Pasim of but he knew it was insane and he needed to talk her down from it.  \"Remember when Amber and Cody went to all that trouble for months to plan that surprise party for you but you eventually thought they were trying to get everyone to ignore you like you didn't exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what happened wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You blew up and tore them both a new one in front of the whole class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you always take everybody else's side but mine?  Look at this,\" Helen stood up and pushed her now soft stomach up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  People put on weight in college.  It happens.  What's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how come I barely even noticed until now?  How come Pasim keeps trying to distract me by talking about her weight, and feeding me all those treats--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't force you, and it's awesome of her to share.  Look, you still look great--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I look great, it's the principal of the thing.  I don't care about the weight.  I'm not some vanity-crazed sociopath who fattens her roommates up for her own amusement--\" Helen's voice was taking on a frantic, shrill tone now.  Adam was ready to bow out.  There was no talking sense to her now.  When she was this far gone in her delusions it was often best to leave her to her own devices and, usually, the next time you saw her she pretended it never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she do that, Helen?  She's a busy college student like you.  She has her own problems without making some for you for no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why she'd do it,\" Helen said.  \"Probably to make herself feel better, so that she wouldn't have to be the fat one.  Well, she's still got thirty pounds on me at least and I'll be damned if I put on any more weight for her pleasure.  If anyone's getting fat it's her, her and her stupid fashion major, I oughta' shove every muffin in that stupid coffee house until she's too fat to, to--gaaah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen clenched her fists and paced, becoming so wrapped up she could barely speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen, don't do--or say--anything you can't take back,\" Adam stood and said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I see how it is,</i> Helen thought, staring Adam down.  <i>You're too nice for your own good sometimes.  Anyone can see Pasim is a self-absorbed bitch who only acts nice so she can mess with you.  But you like her don't you, you always said so?  Oh, I see it now.  It's all right if mean old Helen gets fat but your plump little Indian princess has to stay just as she is, because you have eyes for her and you know that it wouldn't take much to turn a curvy, sexy girl like her into a fat, waddling pig . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen?  Helen, are you listening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Helen snapped back to reality.  That mental conversation calmed her down, but also made her more certain than before that Pasim's nice girl act was just a front to manipulate others.  She almost got Helen, too.  If she hadn't caught on now when she did she might have gotten so big she'd never be thin again.  And if she got her hands on Adam, she'd whip him into her personal slave and Helen would probably never see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  I'm calm.  I'm sorry,\" Helen said slowly, already walking to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where are you going?  Promise me, Helen, that you won't say anything, um, like that, to Pasim?  I thinks you're a good friend.  You don't want to blow another friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen sighed as she opened the door to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I won't say anything to her.  Promise.  Thanks for being here for me,\" she smiled faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are friends for?\" Adam smirked back, but Helen had already closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing to do, Helen thought, both for revenge and to protect herself and her one true friend.  She had to fatten up Pasim, by any means necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how does she go about this?</span></div></div>",

Jesse didn't reciprocate, just standing there as she watched the other girls hanging onto the guy's every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so you see. Guys like girls with a little more padding on them. It gives them more to love.\" He explained, his voice smooth like silk. The girls all sighed and Jesse groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious guy turned to her, his piercing grey eyes catching hers. \"Do you not agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse managed to detangle herself from Ashleigh's hug, squaring the guy off defiantly. \"No. I don't. Guys want girls with big boobs and a big ass, that doesn't mean they want 'extra padding', especially college guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious guy smiled. \"And how can you be so sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been around enough guys in college to know that as soon as their girlfriends gain the freshman 15, they've moved onto another girl who's dumber and skinnier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about I prove you wrong.\" He smiled. If Jesse didn't know any better, she'd say his eyes were practically glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words came out of her mouth before she could stop them. \"And how are you going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy gestured at Ashleigh and the two other girls she was with, and that's when Jesse noticed that Ashleigh had a little more padding than she'd had when Jesse last saw her. Sure, Jesse rarely went to class, but she was sure that the blonde had gained more than just the freshman fifteen since she'd seen her around campus just a few weeks ago. Ashleigh had a double chin growing to match her cherubic cheeks, and her tight clothes showed off each and every pound. Her pot belly strained against the tank top that showed off her meatier arms and overfilled bra, while her black leggings showed off her chunky thighs and wider hips. The other girls were also on the chubby side, their little bellies sticking out of their too-tight sweaters and mini skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse took a step back, wanting to get out of the situation she'd gotten herself in, but hit what seemed like a brick wall. She turned around to see three football jocks staring at the girls, a hunger in their eyes as they pushed past her, not seeming to realise she even existed. Each guy took a girl's hand and lead them away, no words even exchanged. While she was trying to process this, the well-dressed mystery man took her hand and pulled her into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you...I think we're going to have so much fun.\" He smiled. Jesse's heart was beating hard against her chest, here eyes wide as she stared into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse awoke to the smell of freshly baked goods. She stirred under the silk sheets, taking in the smell of sweet sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You're awake.\" A familiar voice said from beside her. Jesse slowly opened her eyes and realised she wasn't in her dorm. She had no idea where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing she recognised was the mysterious man at the side of the bed, shirtless in expensive looking pajama pants. She sat bolt upright, panic coming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sshhh. It's okay...\" He cooed, his voice like warm caramel. He set a stunning silver tray at the bottom of the large four poster bed and stroked a stray strand of hair from her face while the other. He looked in her eyes and felt the panic subside, although she didn't understand why. When her breathing got back under control, he set down on the bed beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? What am I doing here?\" She asked calmly, trying to keep her voice under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you're at my place of course. You had a little bit too much to drink last night so I thought I'd bring you back here to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I need to-\" she was gut off by a large growl coming from her stomach. Her hand went to cover it as her face went red. Mystery man smiled and pulled the tray from beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't go before having something to eat. You're starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse nodded slowly, settling herself down nicely as he placed the silver platter across her lap, taking the silver lid off and unveiling a mountain of pastries, fresh and steaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth watered at the smells of each pastry. There were a few croissants, chocolate twists, custard tarts, pain au chocolats and a number she didn't recognise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. Dig in.\" He commanded softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse couldn't stop herself. As soon as he spoke, she started devouring the platter of sweet pastries, finishing each and every one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" He purred, taking the tray away as Jesse licked her fingers clean, a stain of chocolate sauce, cream and custard framing her lips. The mystery man spied her bloated belly under the sheets, visible under the silk nightie he'd put her in the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice, wasn't it?\" Jesse nodded, smiling at him eagerly. \"Good, because I have a special present for girls who finish their meals.\" He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the platter and put it on the dresser, leaving the room for a second. Panic came over Jesse again, but this time she was uneasy because he'd left her. Only a few moments later, he came back in with a large pastry box and sat beside her, he opened the lid to show Jesse a dozen donut holes. He took one between his fingers and brought it to Jesse's lips. \"Open.\" He commanded, and she did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Nick, by the way.\" He murmured as he fed her. \"We're going to have so much fun. I think you're going to feel right at home here.\" He smiled as she took each and every small dome of pastry, unaware at how full and tight her tummy was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Nick had big plans for Jesse.</span></div></div>",

The guys in town wouldn't mind a little extra to stare at, would they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Morgan was guilt-free as she stuffed her face with leftover croissants and cookies after work each day.

That was strange- the bakery got fewer customers when the weather was bad, so why had Freya baked more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan shrugged. Freya probably hadn't checked the weather again, or had extra supplies or something. No use getting worried over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan pulled out a chair and sat down. Time to enjoy her daily pastry feast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything Freya baked was always so delicious. Morgan especially loved her chocolate croissants- filled to the brim with creamy, decadent chocolate layered with flaky crust and sweet powdered sugar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she sat down, she noticed something peculiar. An extra fold on her stomach. \"Where'd that come from?\" Morgan wondered aloud. She adjusted her position, sitting farther back in the chair than normal. She'd always had a little extra on her stomach, so she dismissed it as something to do with her posture and continued to enjoy her pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar \"ding!\" of the bell on the bakery door rung, and Morgan scrambled to wipe the powdered sugar off her pants so she could help the incoming customer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, it's just me,\" came someone even more familiar- Freya. She smiled at Morgan and pulled an extra chair from one of the tables to sit in front of her at the desk. \"It's pouring outside, I doubt we'll get any more customers in this kind of weather. Do you want to stay and chat a bit? I can give you a ride home afterwards,\" Freya offered, pulling her chair closer to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that sounds great,\" Morgan managed to mutter, trying to divert her attention from something else... how great Freya looked with her wet shirt tightly hugging her voluptuous frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Freya said. \"By the way, did you enjoy the pastries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I mean, I didn't eat any...\" Morgan sputtered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you silly. There's still crumbs on your lips,\" Freya said, and reached a slim finger over the desk to wipe them off the corner of Morgan's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan took a sharp, tiny breath and cleared her throat. \"Sorry about that... it was a long day and I was kind of hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it! It's good that they're not going to waste,\" Freya said, and stared at Morgan with a slight smile. \"I hate wasted food, especially when someone as pretty as you is here to eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan gasped, and Freya laughed. \"Here, I baked extras just for you. Help yourself to some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan let out an embarrassed laugh. \"I... I'm full, I could just... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya opened the pastry cabinet, pulled out a platter of assorted bonbons, and held it between her perfectly manicured nails. Morgan noticed the gorgeous shade of deep blue they were painted in. \"Say 'aah',\" Freya said, and placed the bonbon in Morgan's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan had never enjoyed a bonbon more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young woman's head suddenly became enraptured in electrifying visions of being fed the most decadent and tantalizing sweets \u2014 croissants, brownies, bear-claws, bonbons, the list went on \u2014 all at the hands of her kind-hearted and beautiful employer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't...\" she said, somewhat halfheartedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And why is that?\" Freya asked, tilting her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan wanted nothing more than to indulge her ever-growing appetite, especially if Freya would be the one doing the indulging. But there was another part of her that was more hesitant, a little voice in her head nagging her about how full she felt and how tight her clothes were and how she was getting really rather round in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been... gaining weight,\" she said. Her face burned red at her admission. \"I really need to cut down on the sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya's eyes drifted down to Morgan's belly. By this point, it had swollen up considerably, and now peeked out from behind her shirt. Her tummy looked more than a little taut with all the goodies stuffed inside, and perhaps a few weeks ago, Morgan would've been full by this point. But, as she herself had just admitted, the Morgan of today was thicker, heavier, hefting a little more than extra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And is that such a bad thing?\" Freya asked nonchalantly. She waved the croissant all the more tantalizingly in front of Morgan's mouth. \"Seems to me like you've got some room to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan bit her lip, the temptation building within.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was not mere happenstance that Morgan had found a job here, or at such an opportune time as to be hired almost instantly. Morgan was going to get fat no matter what. She was an already curvy girl with a big appetite and an unrepentant sweet tooth \u2014 a smaller, younger version of Freya, in a lot of ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor was it coincidence that Freya was losing the same amount of weight that Morgan was gaining. The bakery had a way of bringing in the most suitable candidates, and Freya had learned to trust its judgement over time, and her new employee did little to make her doubt in any case. All Morgan needed was a little push, and as \u2014 Freya knew from personal experience \u2014 the bakery was just such a place to unleash Morgan's potential for gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, Morgan wasn't the only one with a sweet tooth. Freya had become a baker in the first place precisely because of her own love affair with pastries. In her younger years, this had resulted in her blowing up like a balloon, and while it wouldn't be entirely honest to say Freya didn't find something alluring about larger women, she didn't really fancy that for herself. By the time she'd started the post-grad job hunt after culinary school, Freya was tipping the scales at well over 300 pounds, after years of failed diets and weight loss regiments that only led to her gaining the weight back and then some. Her bathroom scale had reached a point where it could only give her error messages. This had caused Freya to hit particularly low point, one that led her to drowning her sorrows in a tidal wave of beer and greasy fries at a local bar she'd frequented as a student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that Freya had met Ms. MacAdam, the barkeep. The two had seen each other in passing while Freya had been a student, so Ms. MacAdam was vaguely aware of who Freya was and where she was at in terms of work, but seeing the young woman \u2014 who'd never been all that slim while she knew her, but had ballooned considerably since graduation \u2014 miserably grazing on fries, Ms. MacAdam's walked over to her with a free beer and an offer: look after this bakery for a year, and if she was able to get her body back to a place she was happy with, the deed would be transferred fully over to Freya. Not wanting to look at gift horse in the mouth, Freya took the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something interesting happened. A month after hiring her first assistant \u2014 a young woman named Bridget \u2014 Freya woke up one morning and found her jeans didn't fit anymore. Not because she'd outgrown them, as was often the case. No, this time, they'd gotten significantly looser. For the first time in quite a bit, she stepped on the scale and found that, despite having made no significant changes to her diet and exercise regiment, Freya had an actual number she could read: 295.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, Bridget tendered her resignation after getting accepted into grad school. Bridget had been quite slender when Freya had first hired her, but over the course of her time at the bakery (a time filled with more than generous snacking), the young woman had plumped up just a tad. She wasn't fat by any means, but the prospective law student had grown a tubby, pillow-like middle where a flat stomach had once been, and her rear had rounded out with an extra plush layer. Bridget had gained maybe 25 pounds while working at Freya's bakery. Not 24 hours had passed after Bridget's last shift when a new girl, Jaimie, walked in looking for a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was mostly how things proceeded for the first year at the bakery. Freya would hire an assistant, they'd gain a little weight, and then they'd leave to pursue something elsewhere, only for a new candidate to show up the next day. It wasn't until Rachel, her third assistant, gained almost 60 pounds that Freya, having gone from 280 to 220 in that same period, started to put together what was happening. She didn't know how or why, but something about this bakery made it so any weight her employees gained while working there was with Freya herself would lose \u2014 the only catch being that Freya now had to up her own caloric intake significantly to keep herself stable (a lesson she learned from her fourth assistant) and that if her assistants lost any weight while at the bakery, she'd gain it back doubled (a lesson from her fifth).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya had been almost 10 pounds away from her personal goal of 135 when her last assistant unknowingly threw a wrench in the works. Now, with her weight at 187, Freya had Morgan, the sixth in a line of such employees, and while she had been fattening up quite nicely, she was gonna have to pick up the pace if Freya wanted to meet the one-year deadline by next month.</span></div></div>",

Usually, Kayla eats more than the average person. About 5,000 calories a day, but she usually burns most of those calories while warming up before wrestling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla dislocated her ankle during a semi-final match in late November and she hasn't around moved much since. She does most of her school work and studying online. While her roommate provides food and snacks for Kayla to munch on throughout the day. Usually Kayla eats veggie straws and wheat thins, but her roommate Mahreen lends her twinkies, loaded Ruffles, malt cups, candy, and such for her to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla did mind the junk food at first, but over the few weeks she's grown to want more and more. The first few days she grew concerned for her figure, but Kayla had accepted that weight gain was inevitable, but it would be rather easy for her to burn off. Bags of Doritos and soda cans littered her desk. The computer screen plays an episode of 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air' while she goes through her after dinner snack, consisting of fruit pies and chocolate bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh he-*BUUUURRRP* oh, Carlton.\" Kayla dusted a few glazed crumbs off of her belly. She noticed that is was, well softer, and bigger than normal. She used to have a very small paunch, but now it's more.... rotund and bigger. Not even Kayla's shirt covered her midsection, just barely half. Even her breasts had gone from large C cups to mid-sized D cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahreen gazed over at Kayla from the side of her eye and noticed her poking and prodding her own stomach, \"She's getting so big.\" Mahreen blushed. She had always wanted to see some girl gain weight in front of her eyes. \"And now that big ol' Kayla is getting bigger. I wonder what else I can do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whatever happened to exploration and \"letting them learn on their own\"? That's how I learned the campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica dressed in her official campus tour guide uniform. A yellow polo shirt and khaki shorts to beat the summer heat. She spun around and gave her best asset a quick slap. \"All the boys. And even a few girls would be doing takes. She definitely had a badonadonk. Well, to be fair it was somewhere between a small donk and a medium one. None of the less, the shorts showed her rear off to the world and Erica was proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica began to ride her bike from her dorm to the auditorium across campus. Suddenly, there was something in the grass that made a glint if sunlight directly into her eye, \"Wha-?\". Erica gripped the brakes and hopped of her bike. Walking closer to it she felt more and more drawn to it, \"Please let it be a diamond or something worth money. She picked up he relic to feel a metallic material. \"Oooh, shiny and all mine.\" The item was a relic of some sort. \"Hmm, I'll just pawn this tonight. Get a couple hundred bucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika stuffed the relic into her pocket and rode off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the SAC or Student Alliance Center. The college freshman came flooded in like herds of sheep. \"Poor noisy, clumsy, freshman. They have no idea what they're in for.\" The seminar began, it was the exact same seminar Erika had to suffer through when she was a freshman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Erika saw a few lit cellphone screens in the crowd, \"Good idea.\" Erika reached into her pockets and felt no cellphone. Only the relic. \"Damn, must've left it at the dorm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika pulled out the relic and marveled at it. It looked like something straight out of Indiana Jones. The jewels looked real, the gold had no chips in it, it certainly wasn't painted. \"You know what. This would make a great accessory\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika placed the relic around her neck and instantly felt an overwhelming sense of something flow through her. \"Okay, that was strange\". And just like that Erica returned to bored. All she wanted was for the ceremony to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with those closing statements we welcome all of our freshman! Enjoy the campus and don't forget to get a free t-shirt!\"<br>\r\n The crowd cheered. \"What! Don't we have like another 40 minutes?\" The nerdy tour guide giggled, \"Nope it's all over. You must have fallen unconscious.\" He snorted turning away to his group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika turned to see her group. A bunch of frumpy pasty guys who she had suspected of looking at her ass when her attention was away. She grumbled, \"I don't way to deal with guys\" she thought. \"Hey Erika, you wanna switch groups. I can't relate to these girls.\" \"Oh, sure. Thanks, Jared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of girls walked over. It consisted of 4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Han, a chunky, Asian, hipster girl who was wearing a hoodie to hide her obvious bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Kara, a proper, stout, African girl who stood as talk as Erika, but of course she had better assets on both sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was, Johanna. A touch shorter than Erika, but she did have wider hips and undoubtedly... Dat ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Caroline. A girl thinner, taller, and in Erika's view: hot. Although she was lacking in the breast and butt area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls. Let's explore the college.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lots and lots of food.<br>\r\nSomething about this relic made her want to put all of it together and the more she thought about it, the more she wanted.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Erika envisioned it. Food, the girls, eating, herself. \"Ugh, what the heck is happening?\" Erika's attention turned to the door when a knock was heard. She opened the door to see Johanna, Caroline, Kara, and Han. All standing there blankly. \"What are you guys doing? You should-\" suddenly the relic flashed, \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika realized what happened and then remembered what happened earlier today with the groups. \"Do I have control over you guys?\" They nodded. \"Yes, master Erika.\" Erika felt the relic, \"Hm. Alright guys. Let's head to the SAC cafeteria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walked in single file out of the dorm and straight to the Sac. Erika walked behind them and smiling widely. In her mind, she thought about the moments she had with the relic, when she realized what they meant. \"Does this thing want me to fatten them?\" she stopped in her tracks and watched the girls enter the SAC. \"Hrm, not a bad idea.\"<br>\r\nErika entered a saw the girls standing in the cafeteria, waiting for their next orders. The place was empty and closed down for the weekend. All of the food was put up and the Pizza hut, Chick-fil-A, and Taco bell were closed down. \"Great, now how do I-\" without hesitation that relic flashed. The lights turned on, the cafeteria gates lifted, and food appeared in their designated spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cafeteria was instantly filled with the aroma of food.<br>\r\nThe relic flashed again and brought another wave of feeling to her. \"Caroline, Kara, Han, Johanna.\"<br>\r\nThey spun around, \"Yes, master Erika?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So she followed her servants inside the cafeteria. They split into groups: Kara headed for the salad bar, Han headed for the grill, Johanna headed for the pastries, and Caroline headed for fast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach girl dug right into the food, eating everything the can get their hands on. Eggs, white/wheat bread, noodles, you name it. The relic prepared everything the college had in storage, including the connivence store, Starbucks, and Auntie Ann's upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika even wanted to a little pigging out on her own. She decided to leave them to do their job. She headed upstairs to the once closed Starbucks to eat whatever overpriced pastry they had in stock. Lucky for her, everything was stocked up. The bagels, jumbo chocolate cookies, cake pops, butter cakes, strawberry coffee cake, and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" Wait, why finally? She didn't know, for some reason all she wanted to do is enjoy this food. Erika ran behind the counter and helped herself to the delicious pastries. A several gallons of whole milk accompanied her feast. \"I should do this more often,\" Erika said nibbling on a cake pop. \"Oh, this frosting is amazing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika was glad that she had found the relic. In such a short time it has given her control over others and a fantasy for wanting them to gain weight, \"Well, the bigger, the better\". She chugged down an overly sweetened coffee then poured herself another cup. Her polo became heavily stained with icing, crumbs, and coffee, \"Damn. Should change shirts soon\". She noticed that her trim stomach stood out a little, then noticed the mess surrounding her, \"Maybe I went a little overboard\". Time passed as Erika finished off the rest of the Marble pound cake, \"I should check on the girls\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika grabbed a few slices of butter cake for the trip downstairs. When suddenly she saw Auntie Ann's in all of it's glory. All of the pretzels were cooked and ready to be enjoyed by however dared to eat it, \"Eh, even though Caroline is supposed to eat this. I'll just have a few,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore coming close to the store she felt pain in her stomach, \"Ugh, or maybe not.\" Erika slowly turned around and walked for the staircase leading to cafeteria when the relic yet again, flashed with light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the effect?</span></div></div>",

They make bras in that size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Tara answered. \"When your tits are as big as these you need that support.

As she stood up her belly made a slapping noise as it hit the tops on her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not going to be able to get the tape measure around my big belly to see how large it grown.\" Tara purred and she rubbed her extended belly right in front of Alvin's eyes. He couldn't resist not putting her hands on her soft squishy belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like the tape measure we have fits around you anymore anyways.\" Alvin taunted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's the principle of this thing that really matters.\" She said as she bent over lunging her ample back side into the air so she could pick her panties up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you know what that phrase means.\" Alvin rationalized as he stood there fully clothed while Tara had only been able to get on her bra and panties. \"Now love, just because I'm not going to school here doesn't mean I'm not going to come up every weekend for our all important stuffing sessions. From Friday night until Monday morning I'm all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't like change.\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like change huh?\" He turned her words back around on her, and she knew she was in for it. \"Isn't it change that brought us together? You at this new school, new challenges, new freedoms. Isn't it change that let you leave the idea of dieting back in high school? Allowed you to fully embrace your passion for eating? Allowed you to fill out into the beautiful woman that you now are, double the size you were when you arrived here. Isn't that a big change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had no response. The 300 lb busty beauty just looked at her lover with admiration. \"How can I stay mad to you?\" She finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially when I'm taking you to your favorite restaurant tonight, the buffet.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been two days since Nicole Ericson had broken her leg in two places, leaving her in bed for two weeks, on crutches for 4 months, and away from exercise for 14 months <i>(Please note that I am not an orthopedic surgeon and do not know if these times are realistic or not)</i>. She had a tutor coming to her dorm room every day to give her the lessons she missed in class and her roommate brought her meals three times a day. Her roommate's name was Aliya Jones, an African-American music major. She had some of the best hips and butt in North America, serving as excellent eye candy for Nicole. Aliya didn't exercise much and loved to eat, giving her a bit of a belly, but small enough that she had several male admirers. They were both self-centered and became fast friends because of their emotional similarities. Sadly for Nicole, they wouldn't go beyond that, for Aliya was about as much straight as Richard Simmons isn't. Aliya often brought Nicole chips, ice cream, and other fatty snacks so that Nicole at least had something nice. Nicole figured that since her fitness freak of a boyfriend was gone home, she could eat what she wanted and blame it on the inactivity slowing down her metabolism when he got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to train pretty hard,\" Aliya said bringing Nicole a meal and chocolate shake, \"if you want to get back on the team next year.\" She lied the tray on her lap and placed her hands on her hips, her classic sassy stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Nicole returned with a burst of self-confidence, \"It's all about skill and technique and once you learn it, you know it forever.\" She leaned forward, forcing her tiny bit of fat into little rolls, and dug into the not-so nutritious meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you think that just 'cause you never had your leg broken in two places!\" Aliya rebuked, \"A lot can change in 16 months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you wait!\" Nicole began, \"I'll carry my team to the championship next year for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to bet on that?\" Aliya responded, bumping up her sassiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn straight I do! What are you willing to bet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you lose, you have to enter the competitive eating contest that I signed up for in my place!\" Aliya recalled the contract she absent-mindedly signed when she close a pop-up on the internet. \"And if you win, I'll do your homework for a semester!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" They shook hands and the deal was struck, Nicole, by her prediction, would win the college soccer championship next year, else she enter a competitive eating contest in Aliya's place. She was confident that she could pull it off, not even thinking about having to build her body back up. Twelve days later, she was able to move around again, her body much softer for the wear, adding to her medium sized bust and butt. She had grown used to eating poorly and continued to do so when she could pick her own food. Every day, she had three slices of pizza from the food court for lunch and two cheeseburgers for dinner. She wanted to eat what she wanted while her boyfriend was gone, whom would surely force a diet on her when he got back. Her best friend and teammate, Kaley, often ate lunch with her. She made playful comments about her weight and diet that were repelled with semi-narcissistic remarks. Kaley truly was concerned about her friend, especially when Nicole told her that she was betting on it. For all Kaley knew about injuries like this, her soccer career was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nicole's boyfriend came back, he went immediately to her dorm room, having heard about her injury... and her gain. He swiftly opened her door and found her eating a bag of potato chips and watching internet videos. He kept her on a strict diet of kael, baked chicken, and tomato juice and saw defiance of the diet as a personal offense. He had even less love for any kind of belly or paunch and after four weeks of junk food and assisted movement, Nicole had a nice, round belly with bigger boobs to boot. Most of the weight went straight to her thighs, widening up her frame considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not dating a pig!\" He proclaimed, \"We're over!\" He slammed the door and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole yelled in response...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week after the breakup, Nicole was doing something she called \"anger eating.\" It's when someone binges on fatty foods when they're angry at someone or something. That person was her ex-boyfriend, for wasting a year and a half of her life with his strict diets and exercise regimens. She spent an increasing amount of time on her computer, watching videos, dissing her ex on social media, and gaming. She had recently gotten into World of Warcraft and spent all of her free time leveling and grinding online. This increased amount of sitting around and her recent spike in Mountain Dew consumption slowed her metabolism and helped her grow wider and wider. The only things that she left her room for were class and food, occasionally venturing out to Burger King for a weekly fast food fix. The cafeteria food was plenty fattening, though, adding to her curviness and laziness. One night, Nicole was raiding with her guild at 1:00 A.M., Shouting and strategizing for hours on end. Aliya was desperately trying to get some rest, for she had a test the following afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you get off that damn game and let me get some sleep!?\" Aliya shouted, fed up with Nicole's ranting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole muted her microphone and went off on Aliya, \"Quit whining and put in some earplugs dammit! All I'm doing is enjoying myself and helping my guild!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures you justify your bull, fat ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I said it! FAT ASS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole left the game and got up, leaning on the chair and table. \"And I suppose you're a twig then!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you askin' for it now, FAT ASS!\" She balled her fists and took off her earrings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, this is a fair fight! You really want to beat up a cripple!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I guess not. But this is getting out of control! I can't sleep with you screamin' at elves and wizards all damn night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I should cut back on the WOW a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now we're BOTH going to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Nicole cut back on how much she played WOW, but she still continued to eat like there was no tomorrow, even eating a fourth meal late at night. Since she didn't have that much money, she didn't have enough to buy new clothes when they stopped stretching. She ended up having to secretly borrow some clothes from Aliya since they were about the same pants size, but none of her tops fit her. What Nicole ended up doing was wearing only a hoodie, a lycra sports bra, and Aliya's pants when she went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole began to distance herself from her soccer friends and found companionship among the geeks, attending anime club and raiding with her new friends. Her best friend out of this group was Erin, a chubby, 5'8\" tall freshman who was had a study visa from Ireland. She had shoulder length black hair with red highlights that was parted so that it almost covered her right eye. Most of her weight was in her B cup breasts, but she had a decent-sized muffin top with some nice love handles to round her off. She wore tight jeans and patterned leggings that made her muffin top spill out ever farther. She had a passion for punk rock music, ramen noodles, and sugary sodas, leaving no time for exercise in her schedule. She was a music major, looking to get a recording contract at every possible opportunity, even trying out for The Voice and American Idol a few times. Every night, Nicole and Erin played together on Xbox, as Erin couldn't stand World of Warcraft or PC gaming in general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kaley became increasingly worried as she saw Nicole's descent into a lazy lifestyle. She knew that her injury would bar her from competitive soccer for life when the doctors saw the post-cast x-ray, but to her, an unhealthy lifestyle wasn't good for her anyway. She gathered the team, and they made a plan to get her out of laziness. That plan was...</span></div></div>",

Ask her to come with you,\" Kaley had said, not knowing that Erin--while a real sweetheart--was just as lazy as Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kaley had also not anticipated was that the party, thrown by this really cool goth girl who still clung to the style even when no one else did, would be so full of baked goods. \"I like baking,\" the goth girl--Sabrina--said, \"It's kind of one of my hobbies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Erin drinking hard lemonade at a slow pace. \"Aren't you from Ireland?\" Kaley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded, now a little shy, tucking her head inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you guys big drinkers up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an unfair stereotype,\" Erin replied, \"Not all of us are drunks or alcoholics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. Sorry about that, if I offended you or anything--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's cool.

I mean, they're so damn gooood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Sabrina said, carefully leaning the heavier girl along the wall, \"I'm glad you like them. Maybe when you're sober you could help me out making them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Nicole squeed in delight, while Kaley, in the distance, sadly drank her screwdriver.

She was wearing sweatpants and a tank top that Erin had loaned her. Aliya was in a sociology lecture at that time, so Nicole was alone in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around 5:30 P.M., Kaley and two other members of the soccer team, Samantha and Julie, came in the room with a laptop that had a video loaded up. \"Hey Nicole!\" Kaley said energetically, \"We found this video that we want you to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole closed her laptop and grabbed the other one. \"This better be good.\" She said slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video turned out to be <i>Supersize Me</i>, a documentary in which a man eats nothing but McDonald's for a month and becomes morbidly obese.

We don't want you to end up like the guy in the video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you calling me fat!?\" Nicole said with anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no.\" Kaley said, \"We just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why I don't hang out with you anymore!\" Nicole said furiously, \"You judge people on their weight and appearance! My new friends would never do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry.\" Julie said, \"But, getting fat isn't good for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess what Julie! You're tits are the smallest things I've ever seen, you flat chested twig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie stormed out of the room, crying and clutching what little cleavage she had. \"That was uncalled for!\" Samantha interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don you go shove that where the sun don't shine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, stop!\" Kaley yelled \"They didn't do anything to you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaley, I want the three of you to do something for me, OK.\" Nicole said, seeming to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Kaley returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never. Talk. To me. Again.\" Nicole said raising her tone at Kaley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's how it's going to be, fine.\" Kaley said, \"But don't expect to get back on the team after this.\" Samantha and her left, slamming the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole called Erin and told her what had happened. How they came in and scrutinized her about her weight. Erin told her that she was supposed to go to a concert with her friend, but said friend cancelled, so Erin offered the ticket to Nicole. Nicole accepted the offer and quickly got dressed in the least trashy clothes she could find, those being: a pair of Aliya's jeans, a t-shirt of the band they were going to see, a zip-up hoodie that no longer zipped up over her belly, and her favorite pair of red boots. Nicole, being the one that actually had a car and a driver's license, drove them to the concert, which was at a medium-sized arena that was a few miles away from the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got out of the car, Erin was jumping up and down and giggling with excitement, \"I've been listening to these guys for two years! I've always wanted to see them live, but they never toured in Ireland.\" She said. Her accent had receded slightly, but was still quite noticeable when she spoke. Her voice was melodic and medium pitched, angelic to those who heard it in person. She sounded even better when she sang, hitting every note like it was her birthright. She was squealing in addition to bouncing, which almost made her magnificent breasts pop out of her low-cut shirt. When they finally got to their seats, Nicole had grabbed three corn dogs for herself, Erin picking up nachos and a large soda. Their seats were perfect, with no obstructions and a perfect view of the stage. The band played three songs, then the concert was over and everyone cleared out, some going back to get autographs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have time to go backstage?\" She asked Nicole, bouncing some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we do.\" Nicole said, \"We can't stay for more than thirty minutes, I need to get some sleep tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaay!\" Erin squealed. She ran surprisingly fast for her weight, going far ahead of Nicole and managing to get a decent place in line. Nicole texted her that she was going to go and wait in the car while Erin got a picture and autographs. She got to the car 15 minutes later with pictures on her phone and the autographs of all four band members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to stop somewhere for dinner?\" Nicole asked, seeing that they still had time to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping that we could go to the mall, I need to pick a couple of things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine to me.\" Nicole said. She drove them to the mall and they stopped in a couple of stores. When Erin asked Nicole if she was going to buy anything, she responded with, \"I want to get new clothes, but I don't have much money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money?\" Erin said flabbergasted, \"You could've asked me for some money. My parents are rich and let me buy whatever I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to give me any money, but I'd like you to buy some things for me if you can.\" Nicole said, trying not to ask too much of her friend for the sake of her own pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Erin said. Nicole led her around the mall and picked out all of the clothes and makeup that she wanted. They got in the car and drove back to the university. Erin thanked Nicole for coming and Nicole thanked Erin for the clothes. They went to their separate rooms and Nicole made it to her dorm at around 10:30. She found Aliya studying and listening to music. They acknowledged each other and Nicole put her new clothes away, changed, and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aliya took her headphones off and closed her book, she saw the jeans that Nicole was wearing. She thought to herself, <i>Those my jeans?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and Erin were getting take-away lunch every day and ate together in Erin's dorm room. Erin's roommate, Maria, a 6 foot tall Latina Junior, was usually there doing sit-ups on her bed. She was an absolute fitness freak and ate like a small rabbit, only two measly meals a day. She was a fitness major and did some freelance modeling for extra cash. When it came to Erin and Nicole she was...</span></div></div>",

They both paid and left, heading straight back to their dorm rooms. However, before they could even get on their bikes, they felt compelled to visit the McDonalds next to the shop. They went in and spent all of the cash that they had on them, stuffing their faces with greasy goodness. When they finally got up to leave, they had small potbellies protruding from their figures. Hannah's button-down shirt had gotten significantly tighter and required her to un-do one button on the bottom. When they finally got back to the college, they went their separate ways to their separate rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about ten o'clock and Hannah was lying in her bed, examining the stone.

Her stuffed tummy growled softly as she casually undid her jeans, relieving some of the pressure.  She wasn't too concerned about appearances being alone at the moment.  As she stared into the stone she felt her mind going fuzzy, a dream-like calm descending on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't stop it now that it's begun,\" a voice spoke in her head, the stone flickering in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop what?\" Hannah said dully, her eyes half open and her hand gently rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your changing.  Your growing.  Your eating and eating and eating . . .\" the stone vibrated in Hannah's hand.  Hannah's calm began turning to concern.  Her stomach rumbled under her hand, and Hannah now did not like how stuffed she had let herself get that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't eat a lot.  And I never, er, grow,\" Hannah said.  She tried to snap herself out of this dream, or at the very least assert control.  She could tell this was veering into nightmare territory.  She rubbed her slightly exposed and bloated stomach cautiously.  She could see it just past the stone yet she was unable to take her eyes off the light that was glowing inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already started.  You will eat, and you will grow, and you won't stop while I belong to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone pulsed brightly for a moment.  Hannah felt a sudden pressure in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Hannah gasped, sitting up, her jeans pinching her despite being unbuttoned.  She dropped the stone and grabbed her stomach.  She was fully awake now, the stone's dreamy voice and eerie glow gone as though they were a dream.  She still felt bloated and uncomfortable, but did her tummy look softer than it was before?  She pinched a little bit of flab, just a tiny bit that could have been there before.  Had she not noticed a few pounds creeping up on her and this dream was a way of warning her?  Or was it not a dream at all?  Maybe Jenny had experienced something similar?  They both certainly had made pigs out of themselves that night, she thought regretfully.  <i>Poor Jenny</i>, thought Hannah.  <i>She's always worried about gaining weight, too.</i></span></div></div>",

She flipped it in her hand a few times  and then began to try and communicate with it again. Within a few seconds, the voice was back inside her head, whispering to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to eat.\" It says, \"You are hungry. You can't deny yourself a meal can you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to eat.\" Hannah said to herself under her breath. \"I am hungry. I can't deny myself a meal.\" She set the stone down and sat up from her bed. She took off her jeans and changed into a pair of black stretchy leggings. She picked the stone up and slid it into her hoodie pocket before leaving her room. She took the short walk to the on-campus Wendy's and ordered three Baconators, four large orders of fries and two frosties. Without the slightest feeling of shame, Hannah sat down and ate all of the food right where everybody could see her. For now, the stone had her in its grasp thanks to her keeping it on her person. The stone had her so enthralled in the food that she didn't notice that Jenny was sitting at the table across from her and vice versa. Their stones had led them into the same place to do the same thing at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes and two more burgers later, Hannah finished and regained partial control over her thoughts and senses. \"You want a soda to go.\" The stone whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah hauled herself out of her seat and told the cashier, \"I'd like a soda to go.\" She received her soda and unbeknownst to her, Jenny's stone had the same idea but, for whatever reason, the stones did not allow them to notice each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah returned to her room and immediately removed her pants to allow her lower body pressure to be let out. She exhaled heavily and retrieved the Biggenite from her front pocket and set it on her nightstand. She flopped her self onto her bed and only then did she become fully aware of herself. She remembered what she did while she was under the stone's control, but had no idea why she did it. Whilst pondering all that she had done, she had one hand behind her head and one hand absent-mindedly rubbing her food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, she had drifted into a semi-food induced sleep and a couple of hours into her slumber, she began dreaming. She was sitting out in a field somewhere alone. She had in her hand the stone, the sun shining against its glistening surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're beautiful aren't they?\" Hannah hears a voice say. She turned her head and she was no longer alone. Jenny was sitting there next to her, holding her stone at eye level. \"The stones I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are,\" Hannah says. \"Ever since we bought these things, it seems like we've been eating more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess we have,\" Jenny said and pulled up her shirt, revealing her own bulge. \"I'll have to get some new clothes at this rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Hannah said and faced forward once more. Now, there was a whole table filled with all kings of treats and sweets just for them. \"That wasn't there before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to eat.\" Jenny said and pushed herself off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to eat.\" The voice in Hannah's head whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not again.\" Hannah said anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to eat.\" It says, slightly louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't!\" Hannah yells holding her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in unison, the voice and Jenny said, \"YOU WILL EAT!\" Jenny grabbed hold of Hannah by the arms and forced her to the table. She threw her in  a chair and bound her to it by her wrists and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out!\" Hannah screams at the top of her lungs. \"Don't make me eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny takes a slice of cake, shoves it into Hannah's mouth and says, \"YOU WILL EAT!\" She continued stuffing her face with cake and candy for what seemed like hours and just before Hannah woke up, she looked down at her self and saw herself with an extra 200 pounds of girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHH!\" Hannah screamed as she sprung up in her bed. She looked down and she was still just as she was when she fell asleep. The clock on her nightstand read, <i>6:43 AM</i>, time to hit the showers. She grabbed her towel and went to Jenny's dorm room, since they went to the showers together every morning. She knocked on her door and said \"Jenny, time to shower.\" She heard no response. \"Jenny, get up!\" Still nothing. She turned the door handle and found that the door was unlocked. She stepped in and on the bed, she found...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Hannah vaguely remembered eating way too much the night before-and her bloated midsection backed up the memory-but she seemed to recall Jenny doing the same.  But hadn't they both left at the same time?  Hannah had gone back to her room, worrying about why she was eating so much, but Jenny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by a stomach so full, so round that it looked painful, Jenny had kept eating.  She was still in her clothes from the day before, her shirt riding up to reveal her belly.  The skin looked tight and uncomfortable.  Jenny lay with her head back, her mouth open, as if she had stuffed herself across town and then just passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny?  Jenny!\" Hannah walked to her side and shook her shoulder gently.  Jenny's stomach gurgled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jenny opened her eyes.  Her breathing was labored and it was obvious she was having trouble getting the air to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey . . . Hannah . . .\" she said.  She grunted and pressed her hands into her rounded belly.  She glanced slowly at it, a combination of confusion and concern crossing her tired face.  \"I . . . I overdid it . . .?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overdid it?\" Hannah said, \"Jenny, you almost look pregnant.  How much did you eat last night?  This can't be healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked deep in thought and then turned to Hannah with a slight frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're one to talk,\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked down to her always flat stomach and saw that, while the swelling had gone down from last night, it still looked far puffier than she liked.  She tugged her tank top down over it, blushing as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think something weird is going on.  Last night I was like on auto-pilot with the eating, then I had the craziest dream, and now you're like this.  Something is definitely wrong here.\" Hannah started saying but was interrupted by a pained expression from Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooow,\" Jenny winced, grabbing her stomach.  She leaned over on her side, rubbing her growling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Hannah put a hand on Jenny's shoulder.  Jenny belched softly and moaned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I . . .\" she paused, a look of fear crossing her face, \"er, it's impossible, but I think I'm . . . still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's stomach groaned as if in agreement.  She placed her hand on it, hating how full it was all he more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I,\" Hannah said, feeling dread set in.  \"What do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do?\" Jenny said, \"I don't know about you, but I'm too stuffed to even stand right now.  But the scary thing is . . . if I got up, and found food . . . I'd eat it.  And I'm not sure I'd stop.  I'm just getting so hungry . . .\"  She doubled over again as a wave of churning hunger overtook her.  This time, Hannah felt it, too.  She held her arms across her stomach, trying to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah saw it first.  The Biggenite stone, beautiful, tempting, glowing, sat on Jenny's dresser.  She suddenly reached for it as if obeying some silent order.  Hannah was unnerved to hear a sad whimper escape Jenny's lips as she reached, like she was helpless.</span></div></div>",

Her stuffed belly made it impossible for her to even attempt to button her jeans and her once loose t-shirt rode up on top of her stomach. There was chocolate all over her mouth, which only served to drive the point home. Jenny was a slave to food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Hannah, you can't deny yourself a meal, an you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if like a trigger, Hannah was gone and the Biggenite took over all cognitive function and thought in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't deny myself a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at a secret government laboratory in Nevada, a male scientist was studying an unknown element that had been excavated in northern Canada and passed on to the CIA for joint study. It had been given a name, Biggenite. The scientist reviewed his notes on the element, which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BG-104, also known as Biggenite, is a red crystal with a smooth texture. It appears to react only to human females between the ages of eighteen and thirty-six. Through recorded tests, it has been revealed that BG-104 exerts signals that can influence and in extreme cases, control impressionable young minds. While in contact with the stone, women in the aforementioned age group make demands for food, and if kept without it for too long, turn to violence and threats. In the case of some subjects, their appetite only seemed to end when they finally fell asleep or went for more than an hour without their stone. Though further testing is needed to fully prove this, some samples of BG-104 have shown the ability to control two or more minds at once. My final recommendation is to outlaw the sale and trading of this element in the United States until our tests prove that it is safe for the general public.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after the stone had taken control of Hannah, she had blacked out, and only came to her senses three hours later, where she was once again lying in her bed. She was bogged down by all of the food that she ate, how much, exactly, she didn't know. Her tank top had multi-colored stains all over it and her mouth tasted like a combination of pizza and diet coke. She felt absolutely disgusted with herself, and that was before she noticed her belly. It was so bloated, that her tank top only extended to the bottom of her ribcage, but that wasn't the worst of it. Yesterday's food was finally digested and it went straight to her thighs. Her waistline had probably grown about three inches, which forced the elastic waistband of her yoga pants  to stretch past it's limits, merely Twinkies away from snapping. She looked at the clock on her nightstand, <i>12:14</i>, it said. </span></div></div>",

She pinched a full inch of alien flab at her side, knowing full well she had never had an ounce of fat on her her whole life.  However, at the moment, she had to force the night's vague memories and whatever changes her body was going through to the back of her mind.  She had never been late to class, as always a model student, and was angry at herself for sleeping in like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, despite having a little bit of softness on it, was still somehow quite full, and she found it harder to bend at the middle than normal.  She threw off her disgusting tank top and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow,\" Hannah whispered to herself.  She placed both hands on her full stomach, hating the look and feel of it, how it seemed to jut out of her still mostly slender figure.  She shook her head.  Must get to class.  She found a long sleeve t-shirt to wear, one long enough to cover her stomach.  It might have covered her bloated belly but it didn't hide it.  It hugged her middle.  and even highlighted the start of lovehandles at her sides.  She grimaced.  She decided to not even try her jeans from yesterday and instead grabbed a pair of khakis that was always a little loose on her.  She got them on easily but there was no denying that they were snug around her hips and thighs.  They had become formfitting within the last two days, and even the tightness in her slightly padded rear wouldn't have looked bad if not for the bit of fat bulging over the sides.  Even then, her stomach still pressed into the zipper, and Hannah had to suck it in with difficulty to get it snapped.  A belt made her feel more secure, but she still thought she looked like an overfed pig, and so grabbed her hoodie.  There.  Her new weight was mostly hidden.  Grabbing her books, Hannah ran to class, trying her hardest to ignore her thighs just starting to rub together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had been able to enter a few upper level physics classes her freshman year due to her grades in high school, and this was one of them.  It was fortunately a lecture hall, so she was able to sneak in the back and take a seat in the back row.  If the professor noticed she was late, her didn't make any sign.  Almost a half hour late to class.  To Hannah, that was almost as bad as the ridiculous binges her and Jenny had gone on the last two days.  She would check on Jenny later.  No was the time to focus on-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grrrrrooooooorrrrl.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah shot up and placed a hand on her belly.  She could feel it pulsate even through the thick hoodie.  <i>No, not now,</i> she thought, fear springing to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wrrrrrrrrl</i>, her stomach started, louder this time, and ending in a little burp Hannah failed to stifle.  A few students nearby glanced over, and then back to work.  Hannah was now convinced they were all fully aware that skinny little Hannah Lee was now gaining weight.  She wanted to sink into her seat and disappear.  She stopped taking notes to take a hold of her stomach under the desk, trying to sooth it, when she felt something small, hard, and warm in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid!  I knew it was there!  What is wrong with me?</i>  It was the stone, still in Hannah's hoodie from the previous night.  Now it was there in her pocket, pressed up against her eager stomach, sending messages to her unwilling body.  She felt soft whispers creeping into her head.  Impressions of the previous night's stuffing sessions flooded her thoughts.  She breathed heavily, trying to keep focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to eat,\" the voices said, her stomach gurgling loudly in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Hannah whispered.  She gripped her head in her hands, the hunger growing by the send, the stone's power increasing the longer she denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't deny yourself a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I . . .\" Hannah whispered, quickly losing the battle.  Then, a classmate next to her placed a hand on her shoulder.  Hannah turned to see Emily, another physics major who had a few classes with her, with a look of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, are you okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much.  Hannah's expression went blank as the stone assumed total control.  Inside, Hannah screamed, but it was drowned out by her overriding hunger.  It was like a dream all over again, everything outside of her control and her only dimly aware of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to eat,\" she said, getting up.  A few students nearby who heard turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah held her bloated, growling tummy in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tummy is getting empty, and I can't deny myself a meal,\" Hannah left everything on the desk in front of her and stepped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay,\" Emily sensed something was not normal.  She pulled her hand slowly away, noting for the first time that even with the hoodie, Hannah definitely had a gut, something that had not been on the perfectly thin girl before.  A great sense of unease filled her, as she said-</span></div></div>",

What, no I don't.\" She said, her voice steadily increasing. \"I can't let all of that food go to waste, can I?\" She said, the stone finally having broken her will. She didn't notice the students in her immediate area staring. Thankfully, the professor was writing out an elaborate formula on the board and didn't notice her leave. She quickly caught up with Hannah, thanks to her top physical condition, however, she wouldn't remain in tip-top shape for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whispers in their heads led them to the food court, where they ate anything and everything they could afford with the cash they had on them. They had pizza, tacos, chips, ice cream, and much, much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had finished, the stone decided to finally release its hold of them, for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHH!\" They gasped in unison, their surroundings only now registering to them. \"What just happened?!\" Emily exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were mind controlled.\" Hannah said, still panting. \"It made us eat, a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily belched loudly. \"I'd say that.\" She looked down at her overly-stuffed belly. \"Oh my God...\" She gasped, then covered her mouth. \"I'm a slob...\" She began to whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, Emily.\" Hannah said and reached across the table, grabbing her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" She stopped and wiped the tears off of her eyes. \"Did you say mind control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the weird part.\" Hannah said and tried to sit up, only to wince and recline back once more. She reached into her hoodie pocket to retrieve the stone then set it on the table. \"One day, my friend Jenny and I bought this at a small store in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful.\" Emily said and reached out to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't touch it!\" Hannah said sharply. \"Not unless you want to stuff yourself again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulled her hand back. She brought it under the table and undid her belt with a loud groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying,\" Hannah continued. \"It entranced us to buy it, then it invaded our heads, made us eat. It triggers me, then I black out and wake up in pain from all of the food it makes me eat.\" She undid her belt as well. \"Every time it happens, my mind gets less resistant to the stone's power. I'm scared that, if this continues, I'll lose myself to the stone forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just get rid of it?\" Emily inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've honestly never thought of that.\"  Hannah said, rubbing the lower half of her belly under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, will you?\" Emily asked, pursing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get rid of it properly,\" Hannah said, beginning to haul herself up from her seat. \"I have to make sure that no one else finds it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily began to push herself up as well. As she wasn't used to having any additional weight other than muscle, she had to use all of her might to lift up the food baby that protruded from her once-muscular figure. \"Just make sure that you do it soon.' She said, finally standing up. \"I don't want to be fat, much less mind controlled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will.\" Hannah said, still sitting. \"Can you help me up, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Emily said and grabbed hold of Hannah's soft forearm to pull her up. She still retained much of her muscle mass in her biceps, so it only took one arm plus Hannah pushing herself up to get her on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Hannah said, dusting all of the crumbs and such off of her clothes. \"See you tomorrow.\" They said in unison and went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in her room, Hannah changed into her pajamas, an old, loose t-shirt and plaid pants with an elastic waistband. She retrieved the stone from her hoodie and sat at her desk, looking at it and examining it cautiously. She whispered to herself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She could feel the distant voices in her head, but she couldn't tell if they were talking back or gearing up to tell her to eat more.  It really was a beautiful stone . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Hannah went to bed.  Exhausted and full, she rubbed her rounded tummy as she quickly drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah awoke with a groan.  Slowly and deliberately, she sat up, and dreaded seeing what changes the night had brought.  She could feel her once slim stomach folding over a little around her belly button, and her supposedly loose shirt riding up slightly.  Her sweatpants chafed a bit around her behind and her hips, moreso than last night even.  At least, she thought, she didn't feel painfully full.  In fact, unlike the last two nights, her stomach felt completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon saw why.  With an audible gasp she surveyed her form in the mirror.  She didn't feel full at all because everything she had eaten had found a new home elsewhere on her figure.  Her hips, already the first to feel the bulge, had grown enough that she almost felt pear-shaped.  Her breasts were once virtually invisible in a loose shirt like she was wearing, but now puffed out, straining her bra.  Her t-shirt sleeves were snug, her arms having lost their slenderness.  And, of course, her stomach was pushing out further again, and would have passed her breasts had they not swollen themselves.  Another day of this, and she would be completely chubby, and then a day after that, fat, and then after that . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held back tears and, against her better judgement, checked her scale.  Her weight normally stood steady around 100 pounds, not that she checked it often, but the numbers read a different story after days of mindless binging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"115?\" she said out loud, \"I gained the freshman fifteen in just three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah saw the stone on her desk and remembered her resolve.  Her and Jenny would have to get rid of it today, or else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Oh no, Jenny!</u> Hannah thought.  She hadn't seen or heard from her at all yesterday.  Jenny was probably in the same boat she was in, and maybe even worse.  Hannah put on the jeans she had on yesterday and found they were no longer her loosest pair of pants.  In fact, they were too tight now, accentuating her flaring hips and ass.  She had to suck in her belly to get them buttoned, creating a slight muffin top that showed through her t-shirt.  Once again, she donned her hoodie and hoped it still hid her gain.  She could not, of course, hide how her cheeks were looking puffy, her beautiful features showing the first signs of being encased in fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some breakfast would be nice,\" she suddenly found herself saying, her stomach rumbling in agreement.  She shook her head violently.  \"No, no, not now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah went to her fridge and found it mostly bare.  There was half a gallon of milk, which she yanked up and chugged in seconds.  Her belly groaned in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" she moaned, holding her stomach.  It already felt more restrained in her jeans.  \"No, I have to . . . have to . . . eat these, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice had taken on the droning quality from when she was being controlled before, but this time Hannah could actually fight it, remaining aware while the stone tried to knock her out into a mindless stupor again.  She took a tub of cream cheese from the fridge and spread it over a dozen bagels.  The whole while she kept shaking her head, trembling, feeling her conscious go in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite, her stomach gurgling incessently, Hannah fought the stone unsuccessfully.  Her jeans snapped open after the third.  By the fifth, she reached up under her hoodie and gently rubbed her soft, round stomach to sooth the discomfort.  And then, like before, she snapped out of it.  The bagels were gone.  The cream cheese was empty, spots of it around her mouth where she had senselessly licked it dry.  She stood up, panting, knocking her stomach on the table and the wind out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not again,\" she groaned.  She lifted up her hoodie and saw that even with the added flab around her middle, she still had a noticeable food baby.  When covered, she even looked like she might be pregnant.  Try as she might, she could not button her jeans again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be now or never.  With her body wobbling, she stepped out her door to find Jenny.</span></div></div>",

They gave a quick looks, but got back to their work without any second thoughts. She was bogged down by the food, so she couldn't move too fast without feeling pain in her gut. Even though, they were in the same building, they weren't on the same floor. In fact, there was two flights of stairs between them, and the elevator was out of commission. Hannah had never had high physical endurance, but this was just embarrassing for her. By the time she actually reached her door, she was huffing and puffing like nobody's business, which a few people heard and stuck their heads out of their doors to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah knocks at the door and someone comes to unlock it, then opens it. Jenny stands there, with a box of doughnuts in arm. She was wearing highly stretchy sweatpants and only had her sports bra on top. her belly stuck out for what seemed like yards, and her waistline was noticeably wider. She had food all over her face and pants, looking like a disaster in human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, I need your stone, now!\" Hannah said, still panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Jenny?\" Jenny asked and raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Jenny, you are!\" Hannah throws her hands up in the air. \"We've been best friends for years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know a Jenny, but you're talking to Brittney, proud owner of a Biggenite fragment, like you, I see.\" She motions to the stone on her desk behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, it brainwashed you!

Then the powerful aroma of grease filled her nostrils, and she knew where she was.  Lying on the floor of her dorm room, surrounded by food, and a very concerned Emily was leaning over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah?  Wake up, Hannah.  Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah tried to ask what had happened, but it came out as a muffled whisper.  It took great effort to overcome her fullness and speak at an audible level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what happened?\"  she started to sit up and was stopped flat, her head falling back to the floor.  She gasped as the full extent of this recent binge had done to her.  \"Oh, god,\" she whispered seeing the taut dome of her stomach rising out of her midsection.  She rubbed it cautiously as though it would burst.  Actually, as hard and full as it was, sticking out nearly a foot in the air, well past her strangely swollen breasts now and fully free of her hoodie, there was still a layer of fat around it that was not stretched completely tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came looking for you earlier, because, well . . . it seems kind of silly looking at you like this,\" Emily briefly lifted her t-shirt to reveal a slightly puffiness where her abs had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm . . . sorry . . .\" Hannah puffed, pulling herself to a sitting position.  Her jeans creaked, the seams beginning to come undone.  They felt painted onto her obviously thicker legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy, you were-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember,\" Hannah said, holding her head in her hand, \"It's like I'm looking at someone else's memories, but I can see it all.  I was Jessica, not me, and all I wanted to do was eat.  I went to the diner, and to the store, and, and,\" Hannah grimaced as a gurgle rose from her belly, forcing her to rub it to soothe it.  \"I don't even want to think about what I ate.  Doughnuts, and cake-oh, cakes, muffins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, you were carrying back a load when I found you.  I called your name, but you looked at me like you didn't know who I was.  You told me to come and share with you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you fought it off,\" Hannah finished, smiling a little.  \"At least we have some will.  That means we can beat it, and without turning into mindless puppets or fat slobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah attempted to hoist herself with her arms but could barely move.  Emily looked too embarrassed to help.  Hannah grunted and was able to lift herself up enough to eat least sit on the couch.  She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mostly food,\" she said as if excusing herself to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it turns to fat pretty fast,\" Emily patted her stomach, making Hannah feel even worse despite her own greater predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Emily, we need to work fast-oooooh,\" Hannah grabbed her stomach and moaned, a loud, wet gurgling coming from deep within, \"The stones, they're trying to take control of us, forever.  And I don't know why.  When I was Jessica, all I knew was that I had to eat and didn't even care why.  Jenny's too far gone to help, I think, but we can probably save her.  First, we need to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry,\" Emily interrupted, holding her growling stomach.  Her voice cracked, fear and anticipation in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not now, Emily!  Stay with me!\" Hannah hadn't even gotten to that part yet, what the stone-possessed Jenny had told her.  The Biggenite only had to get your head once to be there forever, and it had already gotten to Emily.  Yet, she didn't own a piece or even carry one, so maybe she'd have more luck fighting it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm . . . hungry,\" Emily said, sounding terrified, unable to move, only clutching her stomach for dear life.  \"And I can't deny myself a meal, J-Jessica, you know that.\"  The words weren't hers, and her tone remained frightened, but the stone was winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Hannah, Emily!

At least in the morning she'd be less full and her center of gravity would be more normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah</i>, she thought, <i>except it'll probably go to my hips again</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, sleep would prove to be even less relaxing than her waking life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her dream, things started out normal enough, although everything seemed to have a reddish tint to it, like there was a red light ahead.  She was getting up for class, and then remembered that there was no class that day.  Pleased, she sat back in bed.  She found it to be hard, rock hard, and when she lifted up the sheets saw it was now made of a shiny, red crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah jumped up and decided to forget it, and go about her day.  She glanced in the mirror and saw her normal, slender self.  There was her pretty face and lovely cheekbones.  Her loose t-shirt hid her breasts, and when she lifted it with a delightful giggle was greeted with a flat, fatless tummy.  In the dream, she didn't know why this was making her so happy, but it was.  She had never been so delighted to see her reflection before.  She felt radiant and beautiful and ready to go out and face the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror suddenly had a fragmented, crystalized look to it.  She recognized it as the same Biggenite she had homed to escape if only in her dreams.  She scowled and tried to turn away, but couldn't.  Soon, it seemed the stone was taking up her entire vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Hannah,\" the red-tinted version of her in the mirror said.  \"You know who I am, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're me-no, you're . . .  Jessica, right?  You're not me at all,\" Hannah said, scared, and growing moreso by the second, but still sounding perfectly reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you will be me.  See, it's started already,\" Jessica lifted up her shirt to reveal a flabby potbelly oozing over her waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not me,\" Hannah said firmly, refusing to look down.  The red crystal was soon taking up all her vision.  It was just her pudgy reflection and a whole ruby universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is, Jessica,\" the reflection said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah couldn't help but look down and see exactly what she saw in Jessica--a protruding belly, forcing her shirt up and her sweatpants down.  Hannah quickly pulled her shirt down over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiding it won't change who you are now, Jessica,\" the crystal version of her said.  It was getting harder and harder to tell the reflection from the red surface it exited in.  \"Fighting it won't stop it.  You think you, a tiny human, can stop the Biggenite from reclaiming what we've lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo,\" Hannah tried to scream, but merely moaned as she felt her belly ooze forward as her ass did so behind.  She reached behind to grab it, as if that would stop it, but her hips flared open and threw her arms forward again.  Her breasts both spurted forward, causing her whole body to reel backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not me!\" Hannah screamed at the now fat reflection.  \"I will never be you!  I can fight you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection laughed, her cheeks bulging out with fat as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah grabbed her face and felt it expanding.  She wimpered helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I just want to eat!\" she yelled, \"I just want to stuff my stomach until it can't hold anymore!  I just want to become the fat, flabby, enormous pig I was meant to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah clapped her hands over her mouth as she realized what she was yelling.  Jessica's laughter rang in her ears, echoing off the crystal walls that surrounded her.  It didn't even need words now.  Its mocking laughter, that expanding, flabby reflection growing larger and larger than even Hannah in her dream was told her everything she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no fighting it.  There was no cure.  The Biggenite had Hannah and if she was going to to stop, she would have to . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut any further thought was forced out of Hannah's mind as her body exploded in fat.  She screamed, telling herself it was just a dream, trying to keep her mind clear enough that maybe, just maybe, she could find a solution while speaking with the Biggenite's 'Jessica' spokesperson in her dream.  With one final burst of will, Hannah cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We CAN fight you!  We can!\" but she wasn't sure if she even really believed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n . . . . . . . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah awoke with a start, panting and sweating.  It took a few minutes for the panic to wear off before she realized she was-</span></div></div>",

She was a ceramics prodigy in high school and got a lot of scholarship money from art shows and competitions. She was able to almost completely cover her tuition with said prize money. Her first class was Ceramics 1, a necessary course at the school to fully participate in their 3D art program. When she arrived at the class and took her seat, she noticed one of  the school's deans sitting in the corner with a clipboard. She had a long, gaunt face with cheekbones. She was stick thin as well, without an extra calorie in her system. Her snooty demeanor made Rachel nervous, as she appeared to be taking notes before the class had even started. Rachel had attempted to look her best, her red hair in a bun, a crisp pair of jeans, and a brand new zip hoodie. The jeans accentuated her rear quite a bit, something the dean did not approve of. One mark off. Her bun was loose with lazy side-bangs. Two marks off. The class began, and the teacher told them to make a simple mug at their wheel. Rachel began, the initial shape fairly consistent, however, once finished, the handle was far too tight for any normal hand. Three marks off, Rachel is out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dean left mid-class and went to her office. She locked the door behind her, letting any visitors know that she was not to be disturbed. She pulled a false book from her bookcase and the wall slid open, revealing a whole alchemists conjuration lab. She entered, grabbing a few potions from the shelf. She uncorked the bottles and emptied them into her cauldron. She raised her hands over it and began to chant an incantation, \"Upon ingesting sustenance into her mortal form, the second daughter of Roberts shall be forced to bear the weight of twice it's worth! And may all food filled with fat seem right for her appetite! May this spell last until she dies or I, myself get FAT!\" And just like that, the spell was cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sat alone in her dorm, typing up a message for another professor. She sat up and opened the mini-fridge, trying to decide what to have. Her gut told her to go with a large slice of chocolate cake, she devoured it, then she decided to have another, then another, and another, until the whole cake was gone. She lay on her bed with her top removed and her pants unbuttoned from all of the food she just ate. She looked at the clock and said,  </span></div></div>",

Leaning back in her chair, she took her glasses off and rubbed her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is ridiculous,\"</i> she thought. <i>\"Where is it!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Rhonda Anagnos, though her friends usually referred to her as Sally Rhonda or simply Sally (many were amazed that her last name wasn't actually Rhonda), was studying Comp Sci at M---- University. She'd always had a life long interest in science, and computers in particular, so it had seemed a natural fit. Moments like this, however, made her question some of her choices in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been playing CoH far, far later into the weekend then she'd initially planned, and now found herself scrambling to finish this bit of code before class on Monday. Four hours ago, she'd found a bug in her code, but a missing closed paren had put it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis somehow created two bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFixing those somehow created four bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was up to six bugs, and was really considering taking a fire axe to her computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding her reading glasses back on her face, she pushed a strand of her long, black hair behind her ear and kept looking. Feeling an unexpected hand on her shoulder, Sally nearly jumped out of her chair and let out a squeal in shock. She felt the figure behind her flinch and turned to see her room mate, Catherine, behind her. She took her ear buds out, filling the room with a steady bass beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy was blushing furiously as she said, \"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that. Um, there's a pizza guy here at the door, and I didn't order any...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yeah, that's mine. Thanks for telling me!\" Sally hopped out of her chair. Grabbing her wallet, she went to the door to pay for her food, Cathy's eyes locked on her behind the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women had been room mates their first year in the dorms, and having gotten along so well, decided to get an apartment together for their second year. Over the past year and a half that she'd known her, Cathy had watched Sally slowly but steadily put on some weight. <i>\"She's certainly filling out those sweat pants more then she used to, that's for sure,\"</i> Cathy thought as she watched how Sally's bottom stretched the material out to the sides and back more then they had even two weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really wasn't hard to figure out why. In the entire time she'd known her, she'd never seen Sally do any exercise more strenuous then walk to class. At the same time, she was a soft drink junkie who refused to touch water. Cathy had come to believe contact with vegetables or fruit would make her melt, and she seemed intent on eating greasy takeout for as many meals as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past six months, her snacking and pizza binges had become increasingly frequent. An entire box of Twinkies as a study snack was rapidly becoming the new norm, and she seemed to need pizza whenever she was working on a project. And at three projects a week, that basically translated to all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving paid for her pizza, Sally closed the door and turned around. Cathy had a good look at her friend's belly as she walked back to her desk. While it wasn't all that easy to tell under Sally's baggy t-shirt, she was pretty certain her gut was indeed larger then it had been not too long ago. Occasionally she could catch a glimpse of it as the material pinched just right. She could clearly make out two rolls, and she was positive that they were wider and hanging lower then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wasn't too worried yet, Cathy felt like she had to say something, as Sally would eventually blow up like a house if she held her current course. Trying her best to remain diplomatic, she said, \"Pizza again? We just ate supper a few hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this code is giving me a wicked head ache, and I don't think well on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"When was the last time your stomach was ever empty?\"</i> Cathy thought, though she didn't voice it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, meanwhile, had grabbed her first slice of pizza and took a big bite. She happily chewed, blissfully unaware of the changes to her body. She'd never watched what she ate or worried about her figure before. That, combined with her generally baggy wardrobe, left her totally in the dark regarding how her body had already grown, and what further changes were coming because of that.</span></div></div>",

Project after project meant hours upon hours of transcribing code, fixing bugs, and even scrapping entire days' worth of work to start anew. Sally was burned out regularly, being too exhausted during what little free time she had to do much more than veg out playing video games or streaming low-brow TV serials. This also meant that Sally spent quite a bit of time at her desk, with her physical activity being limited mostly to walking to and from class and occasionally getting up to go to the fridge or pick up her takeout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, combined with her generally poor diet, had a definite effect on Sally's waistline. The young woman had really ballooned, with thousands of calories worth of pizza, soda, and junk food accumulating as thick, blubbery fat on her figure, pushing her baggy wardrobe to the limit. Most of the weight collected around her middle and lower half, but if that bothered Sally, she didn't let on. The waistband of her sweats was certainly getting rather tight, and her shirts were starting to ride up if she stretched the exhaustion out of her torso, but she wasn't quite at the point where she needed to get new clothes. If she continued along this track, though, it was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy, meanwhile, was another story. She was an English major, so her academic life presented a different set of challenges. Keeping up with assignments and exams was easy enough, but the real struggle came with balancing those things out with her new internship at the local newspaper. Municipal elections brought with them a certain upheaval in the newsroom, and it took all Cathy had to get a grip on the needs of her fair but demanding editors, the ever-present backlog of coursework, and the day-to-day parts of living. Cathy spent much of her time away from home these days, and while she did note with concern how much Sally was blowing up, there wasn't a lot of time for her to do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, though, Cathy had a different concern: a pair of jeans that wouldn't button. She eventually gave up and opted for some stretch pants that day, but the experience had prompted her to step on a scale. With baited breath, she watched the numbers settle into place.</span></div></div>",

She could be generous and helpful when she needed to, but she mostly preferred to live alone in her apartment dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut deep down, she sometimes wished that she could become more noticeable, to be taller or have a more unique body. But as skinny and short as she was, it was very difficult to stand out, whether it be physically or emotionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ended her thoughts with a sigh, and went on to one of her favorite hobbies: cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer favorite class in the whole college was cooking, as she felt it could let her active mind pass to others without really even speaking. Plus, it just felt nice to make others happy by cooking them good food. She was currently working on a project that, for a change, she was incredibly excited about and willing to get done early... to cook an assortment of snacks and share them to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVouching for a batch of her special cookies, she went right to work. As she scurried about the kitchen, she constantly passed a counter next to the stove, where an assortment of ingredients began to materialize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I need is...sugar!\" she opened a pantry beneath the kitchen utensil drawer, and pulled out a massive bag of sugar the size of a shopping bag. With all her strength, she heaved it onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BLAM!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelped in shock as a massive clap of thunder shook the entire complex, leaving her stunned shaking. A massive snowstorm was raging outside, which intimidated her even more now that it was paired with lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think about it, Emma...you can do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ingredients went in, one by one. As she worked, the thunderstorm still raged on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to place the sugar in last ingredient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she opened the bag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BLAM!!!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n She shrieked in horror as the room quaked and the lights went out, leaving the room. Just as darkness appeared, a bursting noise came from above, and an array of blue sparks emanated from the sugar bag before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights came back on, but Emma was in shock when she saw that a wire had came loose from the light above and landed in the sugar. She instantly unplugged the light and withdrew the cord, relieved to find the sugar still intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she went ahead and added the sugar to the dough. As the shock from the sudden lightning burst wore off, the process went along without a hitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours of cooking, she was left with five large boxes filled with cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for my favorite part, the taste-test!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked a random cookie from the box, and chewed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her surprise, it was the single best cookie she had ever eaten...unlike her usual recipe, this seemed to have some sort of wonderful essence put into it!</span></div></div>",

Really get creative with these.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat doesn't matter:<br>\r\n-Name of the school<br>\r\n-Male WG (sorry women only)<br>\r\n-Toilet fetishes or anything else (Only Weight gain and slight water expansion is allowed)<br>\r\n-Sex (It can be implied, but not described. Sorry.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelp, that's about it. Let's get started shall we?</td>",
