Your parents made you come here because they wanted some alone time and wanted to have a second honeymoon in Hawaii. Unfortunately alone means without you, your cab pulled up to the small two story house as you could see your Aunt Olivia and your cousins outside waiting for you. You sigh as you get out and your Aunt greets you, \"Hey Kyle! How you been? hope the fligth was okay!\" In her cheerful chipper tone. You nod as you get your bags out and begin to walk inside. Olivia stops you and takes your bags \"Please let me get these you rest up and spend some time with your cousins, They've been dying to see you!\" She smiles and disappears with your bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to protest but you see a shadow coming over you, you immediately turn to see Andrea's standing over you smiling. She quickly jabs you in your chest causing you to fall over, you were only 5 foot 5 and you weren't exactly the strongest guy. You fell on your ass and went to get up but she pushed you back down, \"uh uh uh... say please.\" She smirked as she stood over you. You rolled your eyes and said \"Please can I get up?\" you ask as she took a step back. \"Sure!\" She leaned down picking you up and pulling you to your feet. You brushed yourself off and Andrea smiled as she looked over at Samantha, \"How about a game?\" She smiled evilly and Samantha giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you found yourself struggling as Andrea was carrying you and and Samantha was following snickering, you tried to yell but Andrea held your mouth closed. They opened up the basement door and tossed you down the stairs, you rolled and sprained your ankle and winced a bit. the girls giggled and slammed the door as you heard it lock. You got to your feet and ran up the stairs to make sure and surely enough.... they locked you in the basement. You tried to scream but you heard a car start outside and you looked out the basement window. Your Aunt was leaving! You banged on the glass but she couldn't hear you. You tried to open the window but it wouldn't move, there was no other way out and so you just stood there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour went by and you started to get hungry, you looked around and found a little cabinet which contained a jar that read Jelly. You shrugged and opened it eating a few finger fulls, surprisingly it was delicious! you ended up eating the whole jar and then sat on the floor, you rolled the jar away and leaned back as you felt a small tingling sensation. you felt dizzy and passed out on the floor, but after a while you awoke to the door opening. \"Kyle?\" You heard Andrea call as she started coming down the stairs.</span></div></div>",

You could hear her giant footsteps coming down towards you and in panic you run and hide behind a chair. You crouch down and peak over the arm and see her reach the bottom of the stairs, \"Kyle?\" she called out looking around for you. Thankfully she never had much of an attention span so she didn't bother to search to hard and she left running up the stairs. You sigh in relief as you feel a little light headed and you fall on your ass. You shake your head trying to get your mind straight as you stand. Surprisingly the chair was about as tall as you! You thought for a minute and realized that it must be one of those big and tall chairs and that's why it was in the basement. You shrug and then make your way upstairs being quiet as you did so. Andrea was sitting down on the floor watching T.V and smiling at her show. You crept to the staircase behind her and quietly went upstairs to you room. You quickly shut and locked the door and made your way to the bed where you sat down and rested. You could feel yourself getting light head and you passed out, you woke up the next day, sun shining in your face as you sat up and looked around.</span></div></div>",

What are you doing in here?\" You said as you slowly got off the bed and stood up stretching. Andrea walked towards you and tilted her head to the side popping her hip out a bit. \"You think you can just run away from me and hide?\" She said, standing face to face with you, though now it was weird because your face was at her chest, right at her boobs. You looked straight up at her and she had a look of confusion on her face as she put her hand on your face and pushed you back on the bed. \"Whoa, did you get smaller?\" She said grinning and then shaking her head. \"Hey would you knock it off!\" You said sitting up, \"It's impossible to get SMALLER Andrea! You must've gotten taller...\" she only dropped her jaw and turned her body to the side so you could see the outline of her body. \"Really? You think so!\" She said happily, she always took pride in her tall height and grinned at you. \"well shrimp, guess that means while you get weaker, I get stronger! But it's okay... \" she pulled you up holding you in the air by your arms and planted a huge wet kiss on your lips. \"You're still my favorite cousin!\" She dropped you to your feet and then walked out of your bedroom, heading to hers. So what are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

Although we got a whole jar of jelly in the cupboard.\" <br>\r\nYou were hardly listening in your half awake daze. Instead you were busy getting milk and cereal. To your dismay you were struggling to get the box of cereal down from one of the shelves. The same cereal your cousin was eating actually.... Maybe she used a chair.<br>\r\nWhile you were thinking that she noticed you struggling, \"Stop being dramatic, it's not that high up you shrimp. Even I could get it.\" You looked at her with a confused expression, to which she sighed got out of her seat and grabbed the box. She then pushed it into your chest, \"So lazy\".<br>\r\n\"I'm not lazy, I seriously couldn't reach it.\" You said exasperated. <br>\r\n\"Well unless you've shrunk that's not possi-\" it was then your cousin noticed she was two inches taller than you. \"What the hell?\" <br>\r\n\"Geez you're having a growth spurt too?\" with both cousins bigger than you this wasn't going to be a good summer.<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\" Samantha replied, \"All my clothes fit fine....\" It was at this point you realized that your clothes were baggier than usual. But shrinking wasn't possible. Was it?<br>\r\n\"Let me go measure myself, hopefully I'm catching up to my monster sized family\" Samantha was saying absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her growing was the only logical explanation but something didn't seem right, something you couldn't quite pick out. <br>\r\nYou decided against your better judgment to go see Andrea and see if you could figure this out. You went to her room and found the door open ajar. Through the gap you could see Andrea in the corner near an impressive looking weight set, but she wasn't using the set. She was marking her height on the wall and measuring the line. <br>\r\n\"I HAVEN'T GROWN AT ALL!\" she exclaimed, clearly very frustrated. You didn't know Andrea cared this much about getting bigger. \"I can't wait for my next growth spurt, I need to put grow mom at least.... Hopefully I can outgrow everyone.\" She said staring at her own body in a body-sized mirror. \"First I'm going to kick Kyle's ass for lying to me though.\" she said to herself. <br>\r\nHearing this you felt a chill run down your spine and quickly tiptoed away. You had to hide. You decided to go back to the basement. Maybe you could figure out if you had really shrunk while you were hiding. <br>\r\nAs you made it into the basement, quietly closing the door behind you, you started walking towards the huge chair.<br>\r\nIt seemed even bigger than it did yesterday. You sighed, trying to think about what was going on. You were knocked out of your thoughts however when you kicked the empty jelly jar you left down here. <br>\r\nYou'd skipped breakfast so this gave you an idea to keep looking for some more of the stuff. Looking through the shelves you noticed that there were a few of the jelly jars, and behind them there were two white boxes. Opening them you found two huge chocolate cakes! Cake for breakfast couldn't be a bad idea could it? But then again that jelly was delicious. While you were thinking about this you noticed you could hear Andrea moving about near the basement entrance.</span></div></div>",

Each step creaked under her impressive weight. \"So that means. You. Lied. To me.\" each word was a step. <br>\r\nBy now she was chest to face with you again, and you were frozen still holding a jar of jelly. She grabbed you by the shirt with both hands and in a spectacle of strength lifted you to her eye level. \"I don't like being lied to Kyle\" her eyes were burning into you. You raised your hands up, beginning to try and defend yourself for a beating when luckily Andrea noticed the jar of jelly.  <br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" She asked, snatching it from your hand and letting you drop to your butt. <br>\r\nSeeing this as a chance to change subject you stammered \"It's j-jelly.... It's really good, I ate a whole jar yesterday when you locked me in here. There's loads of it and even some cake\" you pointed to the shelf from the floor. Not daring to move.  <br>\r\n\"Cake? I love cake!\" she happily chortle. This was the best idea.  Andrea's sweet tooth had saved you.  She tore open one of the box to find a huge pre-sliced cake. She took s slice in each hand and started stuffing her face.  She'd always had a huge appetite  maybe your survival was going to be thanks to her stomach more than anything. <br>\r\nYou pulled yourself off the floor as she was reaching into the box for her third slice. You had plans to slowly sneak out of the basement when a few bites into her third slice Andrea let out a gasp and doubled over holding her stomach.</span></div></div>",

From your vantage point behind your cousin all you could see was her wide back and butt. She continued to moan for a few seconds more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think something was wrong with the cake.\" She finally rasped out. Worried you began to approach her and ask if you should call your aunt or maybe even an ambulance. However as you drew closer you noticed Andrea shivering in a strange way. She began to let out a deep throaty moan as you watched her pulse larger in size. It was as if she was flexing and breathing in at the same time but instead of eventually retracting she was maintaining the size. You took a step back, gasping at the strange sight before you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cousin's tight t shirt began to show stress lines as the fabric was stretching across her back, widening in bursts. Her bra dug into her visibly and by the third pulse there was a twang as her bra strap snapped. Alongside this stitches began popping along the seam of her track-suit pants, as her butt bubbled towards you as well as wider and her thighs claimed more room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the fifth pulse the shivering had stopped and Andrea rose to her new height of 6'3. Sweating and panting she turned to look at you, clearly exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence you finally asked \"Are you okay?....

She clutched her stomach with one chocolate covered hand while her other still held the third slice. <br>\r\n\"You know I'd kick your ass if this cake wasn't so damn good.\" she mumbled while finishing off the third slice.<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should keep eating that....\" You worriedly said. At this Andrea rose back to her full height, towering over you despite being a few feet away.<br>\r\n\"I'll eat whatever I want. I'll eat the whole damn cake if I want. Are you gonna stop me?\" Her switch in emotion freaked you out a little and you shrank back in fear. \"That's what I thought\" she smirked smugly, a ripple of pain flashed over her face again. She bent slightly at the waist, placing her hand back on her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Get out of here, I'm going to sleep of this stomach ache.\" You turned and stumbled up the stairs, you could hear her stomping behind you. <br>\r\nThe next time you see her is:</span></div></div>",

DINNERS READY!\" You rushed to the stairs hearing this, unfortunately you could hear Andrea rumbling around in her room. \"Kyle I've left more than enough lasagna for you and Andrea. Samantha has eaten and I'm going to take her to a friend's house for a slumber party. I'll probably be back late tonight because I'm going to see some friends as well.\" Descending the stairs you nodded to this. \"Okay, we're going to head off now. Make sure you eat enough, you look like you've lost weight\" Your aunt said waving. You looked down and saw how baggy your clothes looked now, maybe she had a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved at your aunt and cousin as they were pulling away, you could make out Samantha making a face at you. You sighed and closed the door. As you were walking to the kitchen you could hear Andrea stomping down the stairs. You found a huge tray of lasagna waiting for you in the kitchen, probably enough for five people even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't feel too hungry at your new height (5'2, Which you still hadn't noticed) and only scoped out a small piece. As you took a seat in the kitchen Andrea walked into the doorway, bleary eyed and half asleep. You gulped the mouthful of lasagna hard. Andrea looked huge. Bigger than usual. Bigger than this morning. All of her clothes were stretched on her door filling frame. Her top was riding up on her midriff, with a slither of her stomach showing and her trousers were showing part of her ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving,\" she began \"OOOHHHHH lasagna!\" Her eyes snapped open and she rushed over to the tray, basically ignoring you. You quietly picked away at your lasagna, not wanting to bring up her magnification. You watched as she devoured portion after portion of lasagna at amazing speeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally pushed her plate away and leaned back after finishing the entirety of the tray. You just stared at her wide eyed. She placed a hand on her visibly expanded stomach. You planned to stay seated until she left so that so that she wouldn't notice the height difference you knew would be there but she wasn't paying much attention to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were debating sneaking out Andrea suddenly stood up and walked over to the refrigerator. \"Where's the milk?\" She asked, her head obscured by the fridge door. You weren't sure if she was asking you or if that was rhetorical.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could sneak out now? Should you go for it?</span></div></div>",

You must be, all of your clothes are super tight and... And look you're taller than the fridge.\" You stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea had been looking down at her clothes and then up at the fridge that she could now see over. \"Maybe you're right this time,\" she said obviously suspicious \"this time you're measuring me and if you're lying, I'm kicking your ass on the spot.\" At this she loomed over you, smiling sinisterly. She then grabbed a half full gallon on milk and started ushering you upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room was messier than you thought it would be, clothes were scattered all over the place. So were a few dumbbells and the weight set including a rack and barbell you had noticed earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea put down the milk and threw a pencil from her desk at you and stood next to the height chart in the corner of the room. \"What are you standing around for shrimp? Come here and tell me if I've grown.\" She growled at you.  You ran over and stretched as much as you could to mark off her height, before you could even finish she jumped eagerly passed you to check her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>6'3!</b>\" Your eardrums hurt. \"YEEES! I'm finally taller than mom!\" Andrea shouted punching the air violently. She then turned to you smiling, \"Maybe you were right this morning.\" She wrapped her arm around your head and ruffled your hair.<br>\r\n\"I knew you were my favorite for a reason.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally released you she looked thoughtful. \" I've never had such a big spurt in one go though.... Maybe that's why I was so hungry earlier. I am a GROWING girl you know.\" You winced at this, \"Wait I better keep loading up the calories, I wanna grow as much as possible. Im going to go eat more of that cake!\" She grabbed the milk and ran out of the room cackling, leaving you alone with the height chart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the height chart,  at the mark Andrea had made this morning. It was 6' on the dot, the same as three or four other lines there. Something was telling you to measure yourself, so you decided to try it. To your dismay you found that you were 5'2! How had you shrunk three inches?  That's not normal. There's no way that's possible.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were standing there for a few minutes Andrea blasted back into the room, carrying the milk, a plate with two slices of cake, a packet of sandwich chicken slices and a huge bag of protein powder. \"Get out of here shrimp, I'm gonna work out, all my muscles feel weird. Like I need to stretch.\" You weren't going to argue with her and scuttled out of the room as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next: <br>\r\n1. The pieces come together in your mind and you figure out what's causing the size changing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Andrea measures herself in the morning (she's bigger and still has cake in her system) and notices your mark on the height chart. She \"tortures\" (not literally) the truth it off you </span></div></div>",

She'd wake up every now and then and swear she could feel her body creeping slowly bigger over her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she woke up in the morning she just assumed she could remember all the snippets of her dreams mashed together and that maybe she hadn't felt herself growing. That was until she got up out of bed and took in the view from a lofty 6'5. Her pajama shorts were wrapped around her like a second skin, straining at the seams while her vest had ridden up; leaving her taunt stomach showing just passed her bellybutton and displaying a huge amount of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea was happier than she'd been in a long while, going over to the body-length mirror she began laughing as she couldn't even see her face from the eyes up in the reflection anymore. She went to the height chart and measured herself at 6'5, she liked this new rounded off number and enjoyed the thought of looking down at her mother at breakfast. She looked down over all the height that had been marked off through her years of having the chart. 6'5, 6'3, 6'..... She trailed down the numbers until she stopped at 5'2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5'2? She'd never marked off her height at 5'2, she'd never even been 5'2 she went straight over it from 5' to 5'3 when she was younger. Samantha never cane into her room, she always complained that it was too messy and tomboyish. Had Kyle measured himself? But he always complained that he was 5'5 and not <i>\"that short\"</i> whenever you called him and shrimp or made fun of him..... Something he hadn't actually been doing recently..... The cogs in Andrea's brain were slowly turning....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE <i>IS</i> SMALLER!\" She blurted out loud. She thought he'd been acting weird but just chalked it up to giving in to her overpowering him every year. This changed everything. Why was he smaller? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea was set on going and getting answers when her stomach suddenly let out a roar of hunger. Should she find throw on some clothes, get breakfast and show off to her mother? Or is finding answers more important?</span></div></div>",

She quickly grabbed some clothes and started to get dressed. There was a slight problem that she was beginning to notice however, all of her clothes were tight. Even getting out of her pajamas had been a struggle, sliding her shorts over her thicker hips and trying to pry her vest off her wider chest and back was harder than she'd thought it'd be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite it being a struggle Andrea found great pleasure is seeing how her bigger body was taxing her clothes. She cracked a wide smile as she squeezed into a bra, grinning to herself in the mirror as she drank in the sight of her breasts spilling over the bra cups.  She decided to find baggy or stretchy clothes to clothe her new, larger frame. Eventually she found a pair of formerly long shorts which were now regular shorts and a vest, zip up hooded sweater combo on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to put on a pair of ankle socks and found that her feet had done a lot of growing through the night. The ankle socks just wouldn't stretch passed her heel; after hearing some stitches in the sock pop trying to force them on gave up with them. She instead wore some regular socks that now resembled ankle socks. She didn't bother putting on any shoes as she knew there wouldn't be any to fit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she bounced downstairs eager to show off her size and tower her mom and Kyle.</span></div></div>",

Andrea stepped in closer to her mother and giddily looked over the top of her head, she wasn't just a slightly taller, she was now half a head taller than her mother! Andrea felt like she was going to explode with happiness, until her stomach began cramping as it had done in the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her midriff and lent forward slightly, just missing her mother- and then something she never expected happened- she actually pulsed larger. It wasn't much but it was noticeable to her. She felt her back broaden, stretching the fabric and straining her bra, her breasts surged even more out of the cups attempting to hold them in and she felt the shorts inch up her thigh slightly more; with the cuff of the shorts filling with her thicker, muscular thigh. Andrea was momentarily shocked before she stretched up to her new stature and looked down her nose at the top of her mother's head. She began grinning manically until her stomach let out a rumble that shook her to her core. At this her mother jumped, startled by the noise and turned to take in the site of her amazonian daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Andrea... You shouldn't sneak up on me like tha-\" Her eyes slowly crawled up her daughters grinning face to her eyes. \"My God. When did you spurt up again?\". This only made Andrea grin even wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a growing girl mom, who said I ever stopped growing?\"Andrea stated proudly, straightening her back and raising her head. Olivia could hear her bra creaking, and noticed the strange combination of clothes her daughter was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you were done growing,\" she sighed, \"I'm guessing you're going to have to go clothes shopping again, like finding clothes at 6' wasn't hard enough. Well sit down, I was just making breakfast for you and Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom, can you make extra, I'm starving\" Andrea said as she took a seat. She hadn't forgotten about her sudden increase in size earlier but for now she needed to eat as much as possible to keep this going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure honey, but you better go grocery shopping for me when you go out to get clothes!\" Olivia replied cheerfully. She was taking Andrea's monstrous size better than she would have expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just see how happy she is when I'm even bigger\" Andrea thought, chuckling to herself.</span></div></div>",

It took a few seconds for Andrea to figure out why her cousin was acting so strangely. He didn't want his aunt to notice the size disparity between them. While thinking about this Andrea was staring holes into Kyle, thinking about getting answers out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand were trying to not make eye contact with your now even larger cousin, what was up with her? You'd never seen anyone grow so much in such a short amount of time. Maybe it was connected to your shrinking? Your thought were interrupted when your aunt turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kyle, when did you get here? And why is everyone sneaking around this morning?\" You shrugged and gave a half-hearted smile. \"I'll make you some breakfast.... maybe I'll make extra, if you keep losing weight your parents are going to blame me.\" She thought out loud while placing a huge plate in front of Andrea. It was only now that Andrea's eye averted from burning holes into you as she practically drooled while pulling the plate closer to her. Just as with last night you watched as Andrea tore into her food. It only took a few minutes for Andrea to demolish the giant plate of food but your aunt had speedily cooked another plate for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have seconds please!\" Andrea chimed happily to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sure honey. Just slow down and at least chew your food.\" Your aunt laughed. You looked down at your plate, piled high with sausage, bacon and eggs and wondered how you'd be able to eat even half of this. You slowly picked at it, eating pieces as Andrea was guzzling orange juice straight from the jug behind her mothers back. She'd finished all the juice by the time her mother had given her an even more overfilled plate of food, which Andrea began working on with just as much intensity as before. Your aunt shook her head, watching her inhale her food. \"Slow down, I'm not going to make you thirds. That was the last of the breakfast foods.\" At this Andrea stopped eating and looked up at her mother with genuine sadness in her eyes, you almost choked on your food stifling a laugh. \"Don't look at me like that! I told you you'd have to go grocery shopping, pick up some bigger clothes too. You look like you're going to explode out of what you're wearing... Actually, take Kyle with you, he can grab some clothes too.\" You almost choked on your food again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, I'm fine with what I've got. I don't need any clothes!\" You pleaded with your Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't want you left at home alone, being all lazy. And you two should spend more time together! You're cousins! I'll give you some money so you can buy yourself something nice.\" Your aunt smiled. At this she went to her purse and pulled out a wad of money, she gave Andrea a handful of it, \"Stock up well or you're going to be the one going hungry.\" She said sternly, giving her a peck on the forehead before turning to you and giving you three $20 notes and a peck on the forehead. \"Anyway I've got to go run some errands, so I'll see you both tonight.\" She added, while walking out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cousin looked grumpy about the decisions that had been reached but went back to inhaling her food at record speeds. You looked back to your own plate and carried on picking at yours. Before you could even finish a quarter of it Andrea reached across the table and yanked your plate over to her, shot you an intimidating look and proceeded to clean your plate off as well. You would have argued but you really had a small appetite after eating that jelly. Maybe it had messed with your stomach. Andrea stood from the table and dropped the dishes in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal with these.\" She demanded while walking passed you, \"I'm gonna go get some dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited until she left the room and put the dishes into the dish washer. As you were leaving to go upstairs you bumped into Andrea as she was leaving the basement, munching on a slice of the chocolate cake. \"Get ready to go shopping.\" She said through her stuffed mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You got ready to go shopping and met Andrea at her car. Andrea was already ahead of you, trying to squeeze her 6'6 frame into the tiny car. You thought she'd be furious struggling to get in, you were surprised to hear her deep laughter echoing from the car. You walked around to the passenger seat and got in, Andrea had pushed the seat all the way but and was still cramped into the seat, there were quiet creaks and strains coming from below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to her to get a new car soon,\" Andrea chuckled, \"Or I'll just tear out this seat and sit in the back.\" You looked at her muscles in her legs rippling as she maneuvered into a position she could drive. You'd never seen legs as thick as hers, she'd always had big legs but this growth spurt had caused them to thicken to even more. One of her legs probably outweighed both of yours at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to look at her through the drive to a huge shopping complex. You followed Andrea around grocery shopping, watching her stack the trolley of food higher and higher. The trolley was overflowing with food by the end of the grocery shopping trip with a heavy emphasis on meat, snacks and dairy products. You wondered how long this would last Andrea and her family, probably not for long you thought dejectedly. Once the food was paid for you helped Andrea carry it back to her car, well you say helped but you watch Andrea carry the bulk of the shopping while you only carried four of the lighter bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on shrimp! I want to hurry up and get some clothes!\" Andrea demanded, piling the food into the trunk of the car. Andrea slammed the trunk shut as you snatched your hands out of the way just in time. Andrea bounced off giddily, clearly excited to get some bigger clothes; you gloomily trudged behind her, thinking what size of clothes you'd have to get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the clothing store you were amazed by how large the store was. Maybe it was the inches you had lost but even the rails of clothes were over your head, increasing the dread you were feeling. Before you had a chance to look at clothes for yourself Andrea dragged you over to the women's section and started heaping clothes into your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just carry this stuff?\" You whined. Andrea shot you an angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't argue if I were you. I need to ask you some questions so I don't need you running off.\" This caused you to break out in a cold sweat. What did she have to ask you? Before you could think about it too much you had more clothes thrown at you, you paled when you noticed that you were heading towards the women's underwear section. You tried to look inconspicuous, looking in ever direction besides at Andrea as she was picking out underwear. Your eye did however catch one of the tag on the bras that Andrea added to the pile accumulating on your arms, <b>E!?</b> You could feel your face grow hotter as you tried not blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea grabbed you by the scruff of your neck causing you to jump, \"Come on, we're going to the changing rooms.\" Andrea stated while pushing you towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach felt knotted as you walked towards them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Andrea stopped at the changing rooms and snatched the bundle of clothes out of your hands before turning around and closing the changing room curtain. \"Wait there!\" She demanded. The changing room was quite small, basically a box with a mirror in it with a rail holding a thick red curtain in place of a door. The curtain stopped you from seeing into the changing room apart from about 4 inches at the bottom and a foot at the top; usually this would be enough to clear a persons head but due to Andrea's gargantuan proportions you could see her from her forehead up. A few days ago you probably wouldn't have been able to see her either, she was known to be a fast grower but wasn't this most recent growth a bit.... impossible? She'd sprouted up six inches in two or three days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lost in though, vaguely hearing Andrea grunting trying to peel out of her constricting clothes; it was only when you her clothes hit the floor with a thump that you realized Andrea was changing out of her clothes completely. You again turned red and tried not to think un-pure thoughts about your cousin. After a few minutes the curtain was roughly pulled to one side and you were greeted to a sight of Andrea in a new outfit. She cocked her hips to one side and placed a hand on her substantial hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" She asked. She was wearing a ludicrously tight pair of jeans and a thin sweater with horizontal stripes; her muscle definition was visible through the fabric and you were surprised she could even get into the jeans. It appeared that the growth spurt had had magnified her in the right places, her breasts pushed out the sweater greatly supported by slabs of muscle and pushed forward by her toned, wide back which flared out even when looking at her from the front.  Her breasts were jutting out , proportionally, even more than they had a few days ago. Her waist drew her silhouette in while her ample hips created an hour-glass figure.which flowed into her bulging quads and glutes. Even her calves popped out in these jeans and lead to her ankles and larger feet. You tried not to let your eyes linger on her frame for too long and blurted out a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good?\" You said unsure of yourself. You weren't unsure of the answer but instead of what she wanted to hear. Time ticked by and seconds felt like minutes as you struggled to look her in the eyes, fearful of her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Good.\" She finally replied, closing the curtain and getting ready to try on more clothes. You let out a sigh of relief, maybe surviving this was a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes passed as Andrea was battling to get in and out of clothes of varying sizes and you began to absentmindedly watch the top of her head over the curtain. Your breath caught in your throat as you heard Andrea groan in pain, you saw her place a hand on the changing room wall to steady herself as her head dipped slightly. However before you could ask if she was alright something strange happened, she stood dead straight suddenly and chuckled. You watched in confusion as Andrea's head slowly creeped more and more above the curtain until you could see her eye-brows and then slowly her eyes. Your jaw dropped open and you quickly looked down at her feet below the curtain. Sure enough they were still completely flat on the ground.... In fact they were slowly taking up more and more of the tiles Andrea was standing on. You looked back up to see Andrea's eyes completely above the curtain now; you didn't need to see her mouth to know she was grinning manically. Her head stopped moving towards the ceiling and you suddenly heard a series of pops in quick succession. Andrea began laughing, no, cackling and ripped the curtain open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been trying on a button down shirt when the spurt had hit and sadly (or happily for her) the buttons hadn't been able to hold. You could see her breasts, smooshed together by a too small bra, the cups cutting into them, and the top of her formidable abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since this is already ruined, might as well finish the job.\" She laughed. Andrea struck a crab pose like a body-builder, leaning forward and tensing. You heard some stitches start popping which gave way to tearing and a sudden pinging noise. Andrea turned to show you the back of the shirt had given away, while her even more immense back muscle had ballooned while she was flexing, you could only guess her bra strap couldn't handle this either and had snapped the hooks. You were lucky there were no staff here at this time of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea then threw some clothes at you and demanded \"Go get the biggest sizes of these you can find... And get me some men's converse sneakers, size 14 I guess.\" You obliged her and went scurrying off to find her some fitting clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned you handed her the clothes through a gap in the curtain and tried to appeal to her sanity. \"Andrea, this isn't normal. Whatever just happened shouldn't have. You need to see a doctor to see if you're alri-\" Mid-sentence a large hand had shot out of the changing room and grabbed you by the shirt. Your feet left the ground and you were twisted mid air and slammed into a wall, forcing the air out of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here pipsqueak. You don't give orders to me. I want to get bigger and I'm getting bigger. I get what I want and no one is going to stop me. Not you, not my mom, nobody. And on the note of impossible size changes, how about I ask you some questions, 'Mr. I didn't get smaller'. I saw the measurement on my chart, you weren't 5'2 last time you were here and I'm gambling you weren't when you got here. How are you getting smaller?\" Andrea growled, half-clad in her original too small clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Then I went back down to the basement....\" You let the words flow out of you, hoping your cousin wouldn't crush you thinking you were lying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea put even more pressure on your chest and brought her face closer to yours. \"You better not be lying.\" You could feel her not breath on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not! Please let me go!\" you pleaded. Andrea examined you through slitted eyes, staring at you, unblinking. Eventually she let you drop to the floor and you struggled to regain your breath. When you finally had you stood up straight in front of her. She was so huge compared to you.  Over a foot bigger than you, you were eye level with her breasts. You looked up at her face to find her looking straight at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it only started when you got to my house? And you only shrank that night....\"  She pondered for a few moments. \"First thing that happened was in threw you in the basement. Did anything happen before that?\" She asked.  You only shook your head no in response. \"What happened in the basement? How did you sneak out of there?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell asleep, ate some of that jelly and hid when you came back. Once you left I snuck out.\" You truthfully said. Wait.... The jelly? It must have been! \"The jelly shrunk me.\" You let out under your breath. An electric shock went up your spine. Had Andrea heard you thinking out loud? Your head snapped up to look at her. </span></div></div>",

You swung by a cashier who had just thanked the last person in her purchase line. \u201cExcuse me, but did a really tall girl just walk by?\u201d you asked breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally tall? Oh yeah, she just walked out. Looked really happy about something,\u201d the young woman said. \u201cDo you-hey!\u201d You didn\u2019t wait for her to finish, sprinting out the door into the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your complete lack of surprise, Andrea\u2019s car was gone. You scanned the street in front of the shopping center and were able to catch a glimpse of her little sedan sitting a red light. You started sprinting toward the car, vaguely wondering how you were going to stop your cousin from gorging on the size increasing cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you made it halfway across the parking lot, however, the light at the intersection turned green. Andrea, who was first in line, sped away, her squealing tires loudly announcing her haste. You slowed to a walk as Andrea\u2019s car disappeared from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d you yelled at no one in particularly, kicking an empty bottle across the parking lot as you quickly considered your options. Running back was a non-starter. It was less than a 10 minute drive to the house, but it would take you at least 3 times that to get back on foot. Andrea could be the size of a skyscraper by then. You shuddered, picturing it. Was that even possible, even with the weird cake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t risk it. You had no chance of beating Andrea back, but maybe you could limit the damage, stop her before she ate too much. You imagined confronting the Amazonian bully and shuddered. \u201cWell, maybe I can hide some of the cake\u2026\u201d you muttered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out your phone and opened the Oober app. You quickly arranged a ride back to your aunt\u2019s house. The driver was less than 5 minutes away, but that still meant Andrea would be almost 15 minutes ahead of you. You impatiently paced up and down the sidewalk in front of the parking lot, waiting for the Oober driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a maroon sedan that matched the app description pulled up to the sidewalk. You hopped in. \u201cAfternoon,\u201d you said to the driver as you fastened your belt, trying to meet the barest minimum called for by politeness while still hoping you projected an air of <i>I really don\u2019t want to talk right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d the driver, a twenty-something redhead responded. She evidently had picked up on whatever you were projecting, because she didn\u2019t say anything else as she pulled back out into the flow of traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fidgety on the drive back, constantly afraid that you\u2019d see Andrea\u2019s face rise above the trees and houses in the distance like an expanding hot air balloon. Your nervousness only grew worse as you got closer to the house and your heart and thoughts raced. Andrea had to have gotten home. How much cake had she eaten by now? You pictured her stuffing her face with chocolate cake even as her head tore through the ceiling. You imagined her crouching down, her body filling entire rooms and knocking down walls as she shoveled whole boxes of cake into her widening mouth. You tried to remember how many cake boxes had been in the basement. There had been two in the cabinet with the jelly, but as you thought about it you could recall seeing more boxes on a shelf in the corner. Had they been more of the cake? How big would they make Andrea? You were sweating by now, and your breath was getting shallower. You suddenly had the terrible thought of being crushed under a house-sized foot, flattening the Oober car like a piece of liter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver had become aware of your panicky breathing. She shot a worried look at you. \u201cHey, are you all- HOLY SHIT!\u201d You jerked against your seatbelt as she slammed on the brakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl\u2019s was locked straight ahead. You snapped out of your reverie and looked ahead out the windshield, where you saw your worst fear in the form of a huge, and naked, young woman rising higher and higher into the sky.</span></div></div>",

Andrea was outgrowing <i>everything</i>. She was at least 60 feet tall and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second\u2026 You actually focused on the expanding figure. The ass, enormous as it was, didn't look like Andrea\u2019s generous booty. The giant\u2019s curves weren\u2019t quite as notable as your cousin\u2019s, and while it looked like she had a certain spry strength, she didn\u2019t have Andrea\u2019s broad, muscular shoulders.

Your power hungry, growth obsessed, impulsive cousin had probably just figured out the key to becoming huge and she was acting like nothing had happened. Bewildered you paid for the new clothes you'd picked out and got back in the car with Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, watching her get into the car was a sight to behold. The car seat wouldn't be able to take much more and the seams on Andrea's shorts were stretched to their limit everytime her powerful legs flexed to use the pedals. The growth spurt in the changing rooms had only been small but her already taxed clothes were showing they couldn't hold out much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive continued in silence until you reached her home. On your arrival Andrea commanded you to help her take in the shopping, which she mainly did herself anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't take not knowing what Andrea was thinking much longer and finally asked \"Andrea, what are you planning?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you confused, \"About the cake and jelly? I'm going to find out where it's come from. You're gonna help me.\" She stated bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could voice an argument about this Andrea turned and made her way to the basement. You followed hoping she wasn't about to devour all the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both searched the cake boxes and the jelly jars but couldn't find any information about where it was made. The cakes were in plain white boxes and the jelly had suspicious labels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's is this stuff coming from!\" Andrea growled in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is buying them,\" You concluded out loud. \"Maybe we should ask her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. We should take it all and watch where she goes to get it. I'm not sure she knows what this stuff if but if she does I don't want her knowing we know. I'm gonna stash it all in my room and we're gonna follow her when she goes shopping.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea had really thought this through. Wait. Did she say she's taking it all? \"You can't do that Andrea! At least let Mr get back to my original height!\" you pleaded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea laughed and looked down again you. \"Why would I waste good cake on you?\" She punctuated this by pushing you to the floor easily, taking the cakes and jelly under one arm and stomping passed you. Her huge feet stomped within inches of you and again you remembered how dangerous it was to oppose your monstrous cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs she turned and said over her shoulder \"If you help me get more cake I may give you a little.\" Then walked off, carrying everything to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you give in? Or were you going to resist Andrea's tyrannical plans?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no way you were going to let Andrea hoard the cake, not only would you not get your size back but she'd end up being huge! She may be able to beat you senseless but she hadn't broken your spirit. You started thinking of a plan to somehow turn the tables against your cousin. You would have to wait until she had fallen asleep and then sneak into her room and steal some cake. Better yet you could lace the rest of the cake with the shrinking jelly! Then, hopefully, the next time she tries to eat a slice of cake the effects would be nullified; or possibly work the other way. Now all you had to do was wait until Andrea goes to sleep and hope your aunt doesn't go shopping for more of the cake tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, the rest of the night passed mostly uneventfully and your aunt hadn't even had a chance to go into the basement and see the missing cake. It was only at dinner that Andrea's new size caused some commotion. She flaunted her new size when she came down for dinner. Looming over your aunt with her hands on her hips, wearing some of the new clothes she had brought today. Which not surprisingly were taunt to her gargantuan body, even the largest sizes from the store were starting to pale in comparison to Andrea's expanding dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Olivia said upon seeing her daughter. \"This is the fastest growth spurt you've had yet Andrea! You're even taller than at breakfast this morning.\" Andrea didn't voice a reply, instead straightening her back to the maximum and beaming, drinking in the attention her size was getting. You were baffled that your aunt still thought this was a normal growth spurt, people don't just grow half a foot in a few days. Not only that but Andrea had also grown 3 inches in less than 24 hours. Although Olivia may not have seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez sis, I hope I inherited some of the family's height too.\" Samantha chimed in, craning her neck to look up at Andrea's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. You probably got the same genes as shrimpy over here.\" Andrea replied, thrusting her thumb in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I'm already almost his height as it is!\" Samantha said, walking over to you and trying to estimate the height difference. \"I think I've caught up already actually!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to panic but Andrea mercifully (although maybe not intentionally) came to your rescue. \"Either way, neither of you shrimps can catch up to this size!\" Andrea said, striking a double bicep pose and dangerously stretching the fabric of her top. \"You both don't eat enough anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, something we can agree on!\" Your aunt chimed in, sliding plates on dinner to their respective seats, \"Now site down and eat your dinner!\"<br>\r\nYour aunt, as usual had made a huge amount of dinner despite only four people eating; Andrea's plate had been piled high again while everyone else had more moderate sized meals. However that didn't stop her going for seconds again while your aunt began tidying things away. Once she was done with her seconds she again stole Samantha's left overs and before you could finish your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't argue with this but maintained the plan for later tonight in your head. Around midnight, when you were sure everyone was asleep you started putting your plan into motion. You got a knife to spread the jelly between the two layers of cake and made your way to Andrea's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door slowly you were greeted with a sight to behold. Andrea had outgrown her bed and you could see her absolutely dwarfing it. Her limbs hanging off of different edges while the covers only half covered her, leaving her volleyball sized stomach half in view. Her abs were still prominent but the dinner and the snacks that had evidently been eaten recently (due to the numerous wrappers around the bed) were pushing her belly out. Not only this but the cake crumbs all over her torso told you that she had eaten at least another slice. You had to work quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scanned the room looking for the white box but eventually deduced it was hidden in the wardrobe opposite the bed. You found the two cake boxes and found that she has indeed only eaten one slice. You took a jar of jelly in hand and pried one open. Unfortunately the jar made a noise as it opened and you froze in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you woken up Andrea? </span></div></div>",

I thought I could trust you, you were my favorite after all. I thought you'd want to see me get bigger, and bigger, <b>and bigger</b>, until no one could stop me.\" She chuckled quietly and spun you around to face the bed, your legs leaving the ground completely for a moment. She was so strong. She handled you like a rag doll. She pushed you face first down onto the bed and flipped you over. \"I didn't want to do this you know. I wanted to savor the growth, and watch as slowly everything dwindled smaller around me and bit by bit I became more powerful and any authority over me shrank away... But if you're going to try and stab me in the back, I think i need a power boost right now! Let's fast forward my plans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained terrified on the bed, frozen in fear. Not knowing what Andrea was talking about, you knew your cousin liked being tall but was she planning on taking over the country? The world?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Andrea do? Does she settle for force feeding you jelly instead? Or does she go forward with her plan and hope the cake makes her huge?</span></div></div>",

Each bite was bloating her stomach slightly more and you wondered how she was still eating more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhh, I filled up on food to try and slowly fuel my spurt tonight.\" Her stomach gurgled loudly. \"But I'm gonna have to sacrifice a stomach ache to get huge.\" She chuckled through another mouthful of cake. You were in awe of your cousin's determination to finish the cake. Slice by slice Andrea kept stuffing herself, covering her face in chocolate frosting and crumbs. Her stomach audibly protesting while she pushed it to the limit. Finally she had eaten the huge cake and a half that had been left; she greedily licked the frosting and remains from her hands. She didn't want to waste a crumb. She lent again the wardrobe, one hand rubbing her huge stomach. By now the fear that had frozen you had been replaced by numb shock, you had never seen one person eat that much cake before in your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hasn't it started yet?\" Andrea thought out loud, perspiration gave her a sheen that made it look like she was glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you ate too much and it isn't going to work.\" You said hesitantly, praying you were right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Andrea began, looking panicked. However it was at this moment that she doubled over holding her stomach. She let out a low moan. But through the pain she arched her back, still bent at the waist, and raised her head as much as she could. She let out a deep, throaty laugh. Her face showed clear signs of pain but through it all she locked eyes with you and her mouth stretched into a sadistic smile. \"It's... gonna be biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig.\" She mocked you between pants. Pain shot through her again and she lent forward, clutching her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wasn't right, so much of the cake eaten all at the same time was causing something crazy. You watched, again in awe, as her stomach began shrinking in spurts. Retracting into her in pulses. Before it returned to it's normal size however Andrea's back started expanding, widening, pulling the vest she wore; stressing the material like the shirt in the changing rooms. It began to slowly tear down the back showing skin when Andrea suddenly stood straight and arched her back. Taking the back of the vest out of view and replacing it with her huge, chest. Her breasts were almost popping out from the front and a canyon of sweat drenched cleavage was splitting the vest down the middle. Clearly Andrea was enjoying this as her nipples were also almost tearing through the fabric of the vest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her face to again, seeing the look of glee mixed with pain. Andrea was shaking and twitching. Moaning as her body pulsed bigger. Thicker. Wider. Longer. You could hear her bones creaking and clicking as they grew larger, pushing her up and out. Her muscles were bulging and twitching bigger as well, her arms gaining thickness while her already huge legs were growing at an astounding rate. She was raised onto her toes, flexing her meaty calves and thighs. Her tree trunks were transcending the metaphor and were literally thickening to the size of trees. One thigh was probably thicker around than your chest and yet they continued to bloat out unabated. Her shorts had torn around her prominent thighs and widening hips while around the back her swelling ass exploded out around the shorts, leaving only tatters. Her panties were slowly becoming a thong as her butt cheeks was hungrily taking up more and more room. Finally the waist band snapped around her hips and the panties fluttered to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea was now completely naked in front of you, illuminated only by the moon light streaming in through the curtains, reflecting off the sweat along the contours of Andrea's feminine curves and powerful muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat on Andrea had maintained her feminine look and you could practically hear the fat cells surging forward in her breasts, they plumped up bigger and bigger right in front of you. At nine feet tall Andrea cast a large shadow over you but from the look on her face you knew she was still not done yet. She fell to her knees with a loud thud as her head had pushed against the ceiling. The pain that previously showed on Andrea's face was now completely gone, it had been overwhelmed by the intense pleasure growing was giving her. Her body was no longer twitching and shaking as she smoothly spurted up larger. She was still panting, her chest puffing up wider and wider each time. She continued to spurt up and up; her head loomed slowly over your own even while on her knees. Her eyes were tightly shut as she drunk in the power and feeling of growing to immense proportions. You on the other hand were backing up on the bed, hoping that the growth would eventually slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your dismay this didn't happen; you pressed your back against the headboard of the bed. Andrea fell onto her hands as she expanded larger and larger, sucking the space out of the room. Her breasts crashed onto the end of the bed, pushing together and making a carnivorous line of cleavage. Her humongous face expanded over your head as it pressed against the wall behind the head of the bed. She slowly began to encompass all the space around you as you heard the wardrobe and other furniture in the room be crushed beneath her leviathan body. Her proximity to you was actually heating you up and her steamy breath washed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back pressed against the ceiling and her butt against the back wall; she was encroaching closer and closer to you. Your cousin's breasts, arms and face surrounded you as she continued growing, she filled your vision and you pulled your legs tight against your chest as her breasts continued swallowing the bed up ravenously below you. You had never been claustrophobic before but your giantess of a cousin was bringing out a new fear. The whole room creaked and beams in the ceiling began making cracking noises as they began splintering when suddenly your cousin's growth stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panting slowed and her warm breath bathed you less and less in humidity. You looked up from the maw of cleavage which threatened to swallow you, up at Andrea's face. Her hair fell around you and her sweat covered looked almost peaceful. Her eyes fluttered open and locked to yours, she smiled surprisingly warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun... way more than I had expected. But I wanna feel that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pounding at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on in there Andrea?\" Your aunt had been woken up by the noise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shouldn't have been eating that Andrea! What did you do?!\" You could hear the panic in your aunts voice. If the cake had been so important, she hadn't done a good job of hiding it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you show me mom?\" Andrea laughed. She planted a hand on either side of you and took a deep breath of air. Her gargantuan chest rose up around you, billowing up and swallowing you. You could feel her pectoral felx as she began pushing up. You were running out of air, suffocation by boobs was way more terrifying than you had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being surrounded by thick pillowy breast flesh you could hear the ceiling beams cracking as you were squeezed harder and harder by Andrea's pectorals. You were overheating and freaking out. You tried to move but the weight above you made it impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours to you, but was probably only seconds, you were released from the breast prison and sucked in as much fresh air as possible. You were drenched in sweat, mostly hers, and you could barley see through all the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea, with her amazing strength, had pushed herself up through the ceiling as well as partially through the floor. You watched as she stood to her full height. Pushing through the roof with her hands until she was out into the night sky. You stared in awe at your humongous, sweat covered behemoth of a cousin. Her muscles, above her waist, were picked out by the moonlight and you could see the breasts that had almost killed you seconds before moving up and down, far above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea looked back down through the hole she had created at you and chuckled. \"Seems everything is going to plan, I guess.\" Her voice had taken on a deeper quality and echoed into the night. You continued to stare in awe as she began tearing the roof off of the building. She suddenly violently punched through and snatched something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now mom. No running away. You need to help me find where that cake is from.\" Andrea spoke through a sinister grin.<br>\r\n\"And don't think I forgot about you.\" She turned her head towards you and much more gently than she had done earlier, picked you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we headed, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never going tell yo- AHHHHHHH!\" You watched as Andrea slowly applied more and more pressure to your aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't stop me at normal size mom. You're not gonna stop me now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Andrea finally let up and released Aunt Olivia. \"You gonna tell me now?\" Your aunt was like a rag doll in her hand. Andrea brought her up to her ear and listened for a few seconds. \"I knew you'd come around to my way of thinking.\" She sneered eventually. Lowering her mother back down. \"Well, let's get this party kicked up a notch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked her way out of what remained of the house and started walking to your unknown location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sink won't work for some reason!\" you yelled but there was no reply. \"Aunt Olivia?\" You poked your head out the door and then grabbed a towel to conceal yourself. \"Aunt Olivia! Andrea! Samantha!\" You called but there was no answer. \"Maybe they went somewhere...\" You thought to yourself and then made your way down stairs to look out the window. You stood in shock as you saw a flat plain wall blocking the Window, \"What the hell...\" You said as you ran to the door and tried to open it but it wouldn't budge. you began to back up feeling trapped and then you felt the whole house shake and you wobbled and teetered and you fell on your ass. You looked behind you as the whole rear end of the house slid open and then it came to you... This was the dollhouse model of your Aunt's house made by her mother!

I don't know! I just walked into your room to see if you were there and I found you about this size, well... actually a little bit bigger.\" Her grin got wider. \"I don't know how it happened... but I am sure glad it did!\" She said as she then reached into the dollhouse to grab you. You tried to press yourself closer into the wall but it was useless, her massive hand peeled you from your spot and her gigantic fingers wrapped around you pulling out of the house and closer to her face. \"What are you planning on doing with me?\" You spit out scared to know what the answer is, cause knowing her it's definitely going to be bad. \"Well, as you know, I have a party to go to and I could use some help getting ready. Like, doing my nails and such.\" She said smiling at you. \"That will be your job if you accept it.\" You raise a brow wondering why on earth she gave you a choice, I mean, this has to be a first! \"And if I refuse?\" You say kind of scared at the thought of what the \"Alternative\" was. \"Well then I give you to Samantha. I heard she was having a Tea Party with her dolls and there is always use for one more!\" She grinned wickedly as you looked at her with horror. Samantha always played rough with her dolls, and she would most likely abuse you badly, probably even worse than Andrea! \"It's your choice, 'Little' Cousin.\" She said.</span></div></div>",

You held onto her hand and could feel her grip getting tighter, \"Sheesh, I got you. Don't be such a baby.\" She said as she could feel you trembling. She walked toward her bed, each step bouncing you up and down in her hand. When you reached the side of the bed Andrea sat down and set you towards the middle of the bed and smirked as she reached into a drawer removing some blue nail-polish and setting it in front of you. \"Alright doll,\" She giggled as she said doll, \"Start with my toes and then you can do my hands and do a good job! I'd hate to have to punish you...\" Andrea grinned as she laid back watching you. You gulped as you heard her say those last few words and immediately got to the nail polish, using all your strength to screw the cap off and remove it.You carried the brush to Andrea's big toe and began painting her nail. It was about the size of a car hood to you and it made painting it easier for you. Andrea giggled as she watched you, the feeling of all this power and control over you made her feel so amused and even turned her on a bit. You painted each toenail carefully and quickly so you wouldn't make her mad. about a half hour went by and you finished her feet. She looked up leaning forward, causing the bed to dip towards her and you fell rolling in front of her right foot which made her smile. Andrea then playfully lifted her foot and put it on top of you, making you smell her nail polished smelling toes, she rolled you around under her foot and then spoke, \"They look good, guess you get a treat!\" She said and then lifter her foot lowering her hand and plucking you from the bed with her thumb and forefinger. You tried to keep still so you wouldn't fall and she set you on her dresser, \"Now, since you're being so obedient...\" She smiles, I'll let you decide where you get to be with me during the party!\" You looked at her confused, \"What? What are you talking about?\" she rolled her eyes giving you that look that you are truly stupid. \"What did you think I was going to leave you here? No! You're coming with me to the party silly!\" You looked at her still confused, \"Okay... but what do you mean pick where I get to be?\" she huffed at you, the wind from her mint breath blowing you back a bit. \"Well moron, I can't just show up with my shrunken cousin in my hand now can I? Noooo, so I'm letting you pick where you are going to be carried. Either you can ride in my *Giggles* Panties, or my bra. whichever you want little cuz!\" She says smiling at you. \"uhhhh... welll.... I uhhhh... I guess your...\"</span></div></div>",

They look tan, strong, and shapely. You climb down her smooth ankle, and walk to her wrinkly sole. It is a lighter shade than the rest of her tan skin, and you have to admit they are pretty sexy mature feet. \"Go ahead and get started, if you do a good job I might give you a reward!\" You ponder what the reward could be, but forget it as you start your task. Her sole feels amazing to the touch, you can feel the muscle behind the firm skin. As you realize just how small you are compared to her foot, you can't help but wonder how many insects lost their lives beneath her powerful bare sole...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue the massage, working your way up her magnificent foot. She utters a sigh of content, then tilts her foot to the side to allow you to reach her toes. You run your little hands up and down each toe repeatedly, and she seems to love it. Noticing the buildup of toejam and sweat between the toes, you try to avoid those areas. The smell is almost overpowering. The massage becomes increasingly difficult as she sometimes wiggles her toes in a slow, sexy excited manner, which only leads to turn you on more. Once or twice you accidentally get caught between her toes as she scrunches them, and she doesn't even notice your insignificant body between her lovely toes. As you finish the right foot, then the left foot, you speak up \"I'm done! Is that good?\" \"Oh my goodness, yes! VERY good! Now your reward: Dinner!\" She says, as she suddenly splays her massive toes and lowers them to you. \"See all that toejam? Guess who it's for! This is what you'll have to eat from now on, I'm sure it's nutritious enough, and its even flavored with my footsweat. Don't worry, I have plenty!\" You look on in half disgust, but strangely also longing... something about the way she provided her toes to you, and how frivolous she described the normally putrid substance that will now become your main food source. You inch towards the crevice between her big and second toes. Might as well go all in, you think as you thrust your face towards the buildup of toejam, sweat, and dirt. You inhale deeply, and get an instant boner... strange. You bite off a small portion, and let it melt in your mouth. It tastes ok, obviously an acquired taste. But you'll have to get used to it. So you start licking all between her toes, taking up your meal of toejam between this woman's incredibly sexy feet. \"Aww, you're so cute, this feels wonderful... you're gonna  love being my little slave for the rest of your life!\" She says with delight. This may not be such a bad life for you afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish, your stomach is full of toejam and sweat. An interesting meal. It is late now, as she brings you to her bedroom. \"You can sleep in my running shoes tonight, they'll be nice and warm, and in the morning maybe I'll go for a jog with you in there!\" She sets you gently on the insole, kisses you goodnight, then goes to bed. The sole of the shoe is warm, and slightly damp with sweet smelling sweat at the toe section. You such some sweat up before gently drifting off to sleep, with the smell of your mistress's feet in your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

All you had wanted was to get out of that basement. . and now all of this had happened instead.  You watched as your aunt eyed you carefully, looking at you in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, I've been working on that 'jelly' you ate for quite some time. Why would you eat something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained that Andrea and Samantha had locked you down in the basement and you had nothing to eat for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, you need to stand up for yourself more. But, you have always been kind of a pushover. . . I'm not surprised that happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the sting of judgement, you looked down at the hips of your aunt. She was wearing a short black skirt with a pair of heels on. Your aunt's sexy curves hugged the skirt tightly, the heels making your already tall aunt look even bigger. At normal height, she must have been 6'5 with those heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when you were normal-sized, you felt intimidated by Olivia. She always dressed very sensually, but in a very powerful way. Right now, she was wearing a black business shirt and a low-cut white shirt underneath it.  The shirt pretty much showed off all of her enormous cleavage, which you had been staring at earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just can't stop looking, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Aunt's words brought you back to reality as you stared up at her face. You didn't realize you had started to stare at her enormous breasts again. Your face turned beet-red at the realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I. . e-ehh. . \" you muttered, not knowing what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so cute when you are confused. Heh heh.\" the giantess said, giving you a small gentle squeeze in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving over to her study area in her bedroom, Olivia placed you down on the table. Moving her chair closer, the giantess sat down, gently crossing her legs and looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, I suppose you want me to help you get back to normal. I might do that, or I might have other plans for you instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther plans? You were starting to realize that your cousins and aunt were not exactly the kind of people that were very interested in being kind to you. At about this time, Andrea returned, the jar of jelly in hand. You turned to look at her. Here was this bully that had constantly tormented you and now she was the size of a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but notice her breasts were similarly sized to her mother's. Maybe just a little bit smaller in a bit tighter. She was wearing a white low cut T-shirt that was kind of see through and a black bra underneath. Andrea had some dust on her hands from going downstairs, she wiped it off on her tight jean shorts that she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe the little twerp ate so much of it! I had to get another jar.\" the giant sized bully exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia grabbed the jar and put it down beside your 6 inch body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do with him now, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia smiled, looking at you and not looking back at her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I think he's going to get lost in the woods. I don't think he's ever going to go home again. He's ours now, our little slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but. . .w-why?\" You started out in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, c'mon.  . . look at you. Even before this happened you have been nothing but a disappointment. You ever wonder why your family keep sending you to us so often? They don't want to deal with you. Besides, you'll finally have use here with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Samantha and I can keep messing with the twerp even with him being so small?\" Andrea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, and if. . . anything were to happen to him. . . well, accidents do happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the two of them started to laugh. Your horrors had just begun!!</span></div></div>",

I-I'm a person. . n-not a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little piece of sh-\" Andrea said her gigantic hand reaching out to smash you down against the table.

I'll put him in my socks and go for a run!!\" She said with a wicked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, if you do that, you'll totally use him up immediately.  Then your sister and I won't even get a turn with him.  How about this. . let me have him first, see if I can deal with this attitude problem of his.  And. . if I can't. . . I think the two of you going on a run sounds like a great idea!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered. . she was serious.  She would totally end your life just because you refused to obey them.  You started to realize that this was for real.  This was just. . a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea looked at you, anger still in her eyes.  She lifted her hand again and then grunted. . putting it back down and walking a bit away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you still have a punishment coming from me, Kyle!! I haven't forgotten this.\" she said as she stormed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia rolled her eyes and sighed as she gently caressed your naked back.  The sudden touch and the sight of your aunt's enormous chest moving closer to you sprung up your member back into action.  You tried to stifle it, but it was all too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, isn't that much nicer than all of that shouting and fighting?  I have so much work to do and now I have to deal with the both of you doing this stuff.  No, this won't do. . not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aunt. . O-olivia. . P-please. . \" you said, terrified out of your mind.  You felt her start to grasp onto you even harder. . you started to cough and hack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm. . s-sorry. . I-I'll be . . a s-slave. . \" you begged as the tightening got worse and worse.  You felt yourself struggle to breathe as you pushed against the fingers as your aunt just looked over some of her work, not even paying you any mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt suddenly stopped what she was doing and looked back at you, releasing you from her vice like grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop? You want me to stop? I thought you wanted to be big again? I thought you wanted to be 'person'.\" She slammed both of her arms on both sides of you and you fell down on your back, hand extended towards her. . afraid of what she might do.  Her large breasts hovered above you and she looked down at you with the look of a deranged maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want then, Kyle? You want to be normal or do you want to be our slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I. . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eye?

She was breaking you and it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her hands back, she sat back comfortably again.  With two of her giant fingers, she began to slowly caress the front of your body, making sure to intentionally touch your erect boner.  You felt both arousal and total fear combined.  It was all so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia let out a sigh as she kept her finger massage going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't just let all of this go, Kyle. I'm a woman of principles.  I have no choice but to punish you.  This is just how it has to go.  The question is. . what kind of punishment should you get?\"</span></div></div>",

Your body still felt pain from when she started to crush you in her hand.  Would she have done it?  Would she have really gone that far.  You just didn't know.what to do to get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giantess tormentor stood up, walking away from you.  She started to pace a little back and forth, not saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Olivia, I-I. . \" you started but didn't know what else to say.  You knew she was contemplating what kind of punishment she would give you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever seen those commercials, Kyle?  The Snickers ones?  Were the person is something they are not because they haven't had a snack.  I think. . I think that is the real problem here.  You are just hungry.  Yeah, just hungry. . that's all.  Once you get your snack, you won't want to disobey again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt walked back up towards her work area and sat back down.  Opening up a drawer beside her, she pulled out a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you ate that sandwich, but you were complaining earlier about having no food down in that basement.  Who am I, if I don't get you something as your new caretaker, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the bottle of purple goop and started to unscrew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. . Aunt O-olivia. . not that!  P-please. . anything but that!!  I-I. . . I'll rub your feet, I'll lick your shoes, I'll clean the toilet with my mouth. . just not that!!\" you begged and pleaded, the tears coming back to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea said you enjoyed my work so much, she said you ate so much of it.  I think you should have a little more.  Isn't that what you said earlier?  That you wanted to be my slave. A good slave does what he is told, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia gives you a small piece of the jelly on the spoon.  It's about a mouthful, considerably less than the amount you ate originally.  Proportionality, you realize that if you ate it, it probably would only make you lose a few inches.  .not bad comparatively. Still, it was the principle. . .this was just terrifying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait. . can't I do something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!\" Olivia shouted as she quickly stood up, her large heavy breasts swaying as she did so.  \"You said you want to eat even more of my work?  Well, of course, sweetie!! I'd love to give you more.  But you have to eat it all. . there are starving kids in China after all. . . you don't want to be wasteful!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed another dose of the goop, you realized that it was probably now enough that if you were to eat all of this, you might lose maybe an inch.  So you'd still be at 5 inches tall.  She was serious about this, she wasn't going to stop.  You had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing towards the shrinking concoction, you touch the goop with your hands.   Cringing as you did so, you place the goop into your mouth and swallow it.  It did still taste like jelly.  You took another bite, and another, and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia watched with glee, cooing over each and every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. . good job, sweetie!! Good job!! That's my little tiny guy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, you finally finished it all.  You felt fear at what would happen now, but relief in at least this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia clapped as she grabbed the spoon off of her desk.  She eyed the end of the spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, sweetie. . what is this?  You didn't finish your meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, but. . no. . you had.  You ate it all.  Your terrifying aunt placed the spoon back down to you and you realized that you had left a little bit on the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor baby!! I understand.\" she said moving the spoon back up into the air, \"you want some more, huh. . is that it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo!!!\" you screamed, shocked that she was still doing this. \"No more!! I ate it all!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?  You want me to feed it to you!! Okay!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to run away.  You had nowhere to go, but maybe if you could just get to the edge.  Before any other thoughts could come to mind, her gigantic hand came crashing down on you.  As she held you down, you saw her start to fumble around in her drawer.  You knew she was working on a lot of scientific stuff and you saw her pull out test tubes, beakesr and. . oh no!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand was a funnel!  With her free hand, she placed the funnel right over your face.  She was careful not to cover your nose, she didn't want to suffocate you.  You yelled out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you clammed your mouth shut, you wouldn't do it. . you wouldn't swallow any of her purple gunk!!  She took spoonful after spoonful and started to drop it down into the funnel.  It slowly made it's way towards you and started to hit your face and the top part of your torso, coating you.  You kept your mouth shut.  You wouldn't give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhack!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt had just hit you in the stomach!! You winced, opening your mouth and letting in the purple goop as you struggled for more air!!  Instead, all you were taking in is more and more of the goop.  You tried to clam up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhack!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit you in the stomach again, this time moving the funnel over your nose too!  You felt yourself get dizzy as you were running out of air. . .swallowing more and more and more of this purple goop!!  You felt yourself drift off into unconsciousness. . . unsure of how much you had eaten. . or how small you would be when you woke up. . .if you did at all, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you heard before you passed out was the coo-ing of your aunt. . . </span></div></div>",

Her footsteps fell like thunderclaps that you could feel reverberate through the floor as she strode into her daughter's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...now what was it you wanted to-oh my!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pretty woman gasped as her eyes found your half-foot sized form on the dresser, rushing closer to get a better look. Your aunt was dressed in a calf-length floral skirt that hugged her hips quite closely, as well as a light pink blouse that strained ever so slightly over her generous bosom. You could feel your cheeks burning in embarrassment as the tall woman knelt down, her breasts swaying down before you, as her gorgeous face loomed over with an expression of deep concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kyle! I'm so sorry!\" She said softly, reaching out with a hand that you flinched away from as you huddled down even more. Olivia retracted her hand, sympathy visible across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ate some of the jelly, the idiot,\" Andrea laughed as she followed her mother in, hefting a white box in one arm and another jar of jelly in the other. \"Finished a whole jar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Samantha locked me in the basement!\" You cried out indignantly, sounding weak and high-pitched even to yourself. \"I was hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's face grew stern as she turned to face her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\" She asked calmly, fixing Andrea with a glare. The teen paused, her grin vanishing in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...maybe,\" the girl grumbled, avoiding her mother's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia rose to her feet to make full use of her height, still standing two inches higher than her huge daughter, and placed her hands on her ample hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, young lady,\" she said sternly. \"You will bring both cakes into my bedroom, along with a knife. I will bring Kyle there. Until I come out you and Sam are to stay in your rooms. Are we clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Andrea said quietly, flashing a look at you as you returned your chin to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame him!\" Olivia said, wagging a finger. \"We are all going to sit down and talk about this once I've cleared this up. Now put the cakes in my room and tell Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Andrea stomped out, making her whole room rattle, Olivia knelt back down in front of you and lowered her face until it was right at the edge of the dresser. Her large green eyes looked bright and warm as she smiled down at you, making your heart race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Kyle,\" she said gently as she moved one of her hands forward and placed it palm up on the surface of the dresser. \"Come with me, it's alright. I'll get you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, your face still as bright as a strawberry, and clamber awkwardly to your feet as you keep your genitals from view. Olivia giggled as you walked onto her hand with your own clasped over your crotch. For a moment you forgot your embarrassment as you marvel at the sensation of your bare feet on your aunt's soft skin, feeling almost like walking across a dense waterbed. Then your aunt lifted her hand and you lost your footing, your arms flying out as you fell onto your butt with your back against your aunt's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, this is easier,\" she said with a wink, her cheeks a little pink, as you hurriedly tuck your knees to the side and grip one of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia walked into the hallway and waited for her daughters to go into their rooms, making sure to fix a stony expression for each. Once their doors were closed she locked them, pocketing both of the keys and made her way to the master bedroom. As you turned to look over your aunt's fingers you could see both of the cake boxes on her bed. Your aunt paused to close her own door and then took careful steps to the bed and sat down, trying to avoid jostling you too much. Keeping you balanced in one hand she used her other to open one of the boxes and cut away with the knife, bringing a piece of the chocolate cake small enough for you to hold, albeit with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, this will make you...grow,\" she said quietly, her voice crackling slightly on the last word. Her cheeks were pink again and she sighed heavily afterwards. Your heart was still beating quite fast in your chest as you watched your aunt, before shaking yourself from your reverie. Was she...excited?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started eating the cake, your eyes widening as the most intense chocolatey flavour flooded your taste buds. It was the best cake ever! You started wolfing it down, slurping the dark frosting and tearing into the perfectly moist sponge, your aunt momentarily forgotten. Before you knew it you had finished the whole piece and you collapsed back in your aunt's hand, cradling your full belly and belching loudly. Olivia laughed at this, her shoulders shaking and leaving you rocking in her hand. You grinned lethargically back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, that was too funny!\" Olivia sighed, smiling down at you. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou then spent a few minutes enjoying each other's company as your belly quietly churned away at the huge amount of cake you had stuffed yourself with, your whole body feeling quite heavy. Olivia was watching you expectantly, her cheeks growing gradually redder as more time passed, her breathing becoming heavier. Then your belly loosed a loud gurgle and your aunt's eyes widened as yours did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's starting!\" She gasped and lifted you closer as you felt the tightness in your stomach recede completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you felt a strange power flood your body, reaching some sort of limit and then <i>pushing</i> out, demanding more room than you could currently give. You shuddered as your body started to grow in small spurts, every breath sending it creaking outward across Olivia's hand. You could feel your...excitement...build down below, but you were helpless to do anything but grip the edges of your aunt's palms, sweating prickling across your bare skin. You grunted as you surged bigger and bigger, your eyes clamped shut, as you felt your butt start to fill Olivia's palm and your legs hang lower and lower. The mysterious power burned hot in your chest, your sweat now pouring down your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurgh!\" You groaned deeply as your pulse roared in your ears and you felt your muscles thicken and grow stronger, definition pushing out against your skin as it grew deeper in time with your growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes cracked open as you felt something new at your crotch. You looked down, past your clearly defined pecs to your twitching member. It had long been at full attention but now, as you shivered through your last spurts of size, you watched and felt it swell longer, thicker and stronger. As you tightened your grip on the tips of aunt Olivia's fingers you moaned loudly as one final spurt sent you shuddering up to double your previous size, your penis surging up to kiss your belly button as the power finally abated and you collapsed. Your head lolled back until you felt your aunt support it with her other hand. As your mind cleared you gazed up into her face, seeing it blaze a bright red and her chest heaving with her heavy panting.</span></div></div>",

As it did, a tidal wave of the jelly coated your body and because you were screaming, you accidentally gulped down a glob. Andrea stood up, her face covered in cake and she licked a bit and gave a bit of a growl. \"Alright, you want to play that game? I-\" she paused as she began to feel weird. Holding her stomach she soon began to fell a tingling sensation. You broke through the Jelly that covered you and began to crawl out of the jar. Coughing, you could feel yourself rapidly shrinking, and you stared at Andrea in awe. Holding her stomach, she began to grow slowly. Her six foot size increasing as she soon doubled in sized! Andrea was 12 feet tall and her head was nearly touching the ceiling! For the most part her clothes had grown with her and she looked around, checking out her new size.

You made me a Giantess!\" she exclaimed to you, your ears hurting from her voice. \"Well... Now let me try something with you, since you OBVIOUSLY tripped me on purpose!

Your jaw dropped as you gazed at your cousins naked form, sure she was a bully, but she was drop dead gorgeous.

Your Aunt smiled like a little kid and Andrea just ate calmly. Samantha was just humming as she ate and you were feeling a  bit sick again. Leaning forward you felt a bit of a strain on your body and then the next thing you knew your shirt was hanging down a bit low. Looking at yourself your Aunt raised a brow to you and asked if you were alright, which caused everyone to stare at you. Nodding you stood up, you pants barely holding on to your waist. \"Yeah... I'm just going to go lie down...\" you said and began to head upstairs. As you did so, you slipped off your clothes besides your pants and crawled into bed, later on you passed out.</span></div></div>",

You shrug it off and begin to wash your face a bit. Stretching you find your pants fall to your ankles and you quickly look down. \"what...?\" you say aloud as you begin to pull your pants back up. Now you realize that the pants are a bit looser than before and you scratch your head as you think. Going to get your socks on you realize that they, along with your shirt, seem bigger too. Feeling crazy you just put a belt on and sigh, thinking you'll have to get clothes again this year. You hear your Aunt yell Breakfast and you then head down stairs. Being the last one to get their you pull up a seat at the end and begin to eat the pancakes your Aunt had made.Glancing up  you notice your Aunt starring at you with a puzzled look and you raised a brow to her. \"What?\" you asked as Andrea and Samantha now both looked at you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Aunt pointed at you with her fork as she swallowed and then spoke, \"Those clothes look much to big on you... Are you sure their yours honey?\" she asked you. Nodding you continue to eat as Andrea snickered a bit from her seat. \"Also...\" Your Aunt said, still having a puzzled look on her face. \"You look different, almost younger even...\" and then you got really weirded out. \"What do you mean?\" you asked her as you looked in the mirror in the kitchen. \"Well Honey I just mean you look the same as when you first came here a few years ago... I swear yesterday you looked older.\" and you then touched your face, were you younger? Shaking your head as that were impossible you look back to your Aunt. \"Are my old clothes still here?\" Your Aunt nodded and pointed up to the stairs. \"Of course, ummm... in the closet in your room.\" she stated. You merely nod and then head upstairs. Going into your room you move a chair over to get to the top. Grabbing a box that had your name on it you opened it and removed a shirt, pants, socks, and underwear. Stripping down to your own underwear you begin to try and put on your pants...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The storyline is similar to R.L Stines Beware of the Purple Peanut Butter with different guidelines. First off, new cousin name, instead of Dora... (So you're not getting your rocks off to a spanish child cartoon...) We'll go with Samantha. Oh and Barney is a girl who is named Andrea, she's a bully just the same though, and stands taller than you without you shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha: 15  years old, is a brat and does whatever to get her way. Has an excessive collection of dolls and even though she is in her teens she still plays with them constantly. She will do whatever it takes to rope you into playing with them with her. She's about 5 foot 2 and is a skinny girl who has a c cup breasts and a firm ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea: 18 years old and is a complete bully. She always forces you to do whatever she wants and will not stop bothering you. She's always watching movies or T.V and is a completer bitch to everyone except her parents. She enjoys torturing you and going out to be with her friends. Andrea is very fit and can throw you over her head (Which she has done before.) she stands about 6 feet tall and has D cups like her mother and is one of the hottest girls in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Olivia: 39 years old, well fit and very young looking woman. She looks beautiful and does not tolerate laziness in her house. Which is why Andrea is much bigger then you. Olivia is a pleaser, she loves making everyone happy and is always smiling and laughing. She's very loving and caring. She has a size D rack and a nice ass to match, she's rather fit and she looks like she's 23, she stands about 6 foot 2.</td>",
