Sydney closed the curtains and turned it up a little louder with a smile. She knew it wouldn't bother her father, Frederick, as he lived in the other wing of the house. Sometimes she loved that her father was well off, though there were other things missing from her life. Her mother, for instance. She had never worked up the courage to ask her father about her. The last time she did he went into a fit of rage and disappeared from the house for days. Something had obviously hurt him very badly and she didn't want to be the one to make him feel like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her book, the newest Martin novel, and sank back into her bed. The mounds of cushions softened her fall and in the dim light of her bed side lamp she was once again snug and warm and settling into her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew, a loud crash woke her from  slumber. She jolted awake and dropped the book on the floor with a loud thump. For a moment she didn't know what had happened and then it dawned on her that she'd fallen asleep. She shook herself awake and jumped from her bed. The crash resounded in her mind. It was sharp and high pitched, like the sound of glass breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing from her room, she hurried along the dark corridor, ignoring the darkened foyer over the balcony and tore into her father's room without so much as a knock. There she saw turmoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed had been turned upside down, the bedside table lay on it's side with all of it's contents strewn across the floor. The dresser mirror was cracked in a spider web and the curtains had been torn down from the poles. Worst of all, the huge sash window had been smashed inwards, glass scattered on the plush carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought she ran forward, and peered out of the window into the dark night. A lone car was racing down their driveway and off into the night with a screech of tyres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Sydney was unable to move. Finally, the rain that pelted her got through and she realised she was getting wet. As she pulled herself back in she heard another crunch of glass and that's when she realised, her feet were lacerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happened? Where is my father? Who was in that car? What now?</i></span></div></div>",

It was not until she could no longer see the car when she stopped and fell to her knees, crying. Someone had broken into her home and had taken her father. Worse, there was nothing she could have done to stop it. \"Why did I fall asleep!?\" miserably, she asked herself. \"I could have done something, given dad a better chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney buried her face into her hands, sitting near the edge of her driveway, struggling to compose herself as the rain continued to fall. She remained there for several moments before something blew into her lap in the wind. Pausing, she lowered her hands and was surprised to find a torn piece of fabric from a denim shirt or jacket. She picked up the fragment and saw that it was a sewn on badge of some sort. \"What is this?\" shaken, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badge was an insignia of some kind. It was eight swords, forming a star, with a ring in the center that held a star within it. Sydney had never seen such an insignia but then it dawned upon her that, whatever it was, dad must have torn it off the clothes of his kidnapper. Who ever had taken him belonged to whoever the insignia represented. Determined to find answers, Sydney limped back into the house where she first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normally, I never dared to venture in as he was always so protective of his belongings. He had explained that it was an impulse with childhood origins, living in a bad neighborhood. \"Where to start...\" Sighing, I asked myself. \"His desk, perhaps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carefully moved through his papers but found nothing of use other than we were far more well off than he had led me to believe. Or was that a clue? I looked deeper into the financial records and found that our wealth had exploded only about a year before when dad took on a new job with some unknown agency. It was definitely a clue. I moved on to his filing cabinet only to find that it was locked. Not to be detoured, I pulled a hair pin and began to pick the lock. Something I had learned from a rather detailed mystery novel series I enjoyed reading. Within seconds, the filing cabinet was unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know...\" smiling, I muttered. \"It actually worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombing through the files, I found that dad had worked on a number of high level cases for this agency only I could not find the name of it. All the files said was Employer One in reference to who dad was working for. I moved to the last file in the cabinet and found an incomplete case which had a picture of the very insignia I had found on the road while chasing the suspect car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agenda Guild.\" Reading the file, I said. \"So that is who took dad. He must have been close to blowing their operation wide open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back through the other files, hoping to find some contact number but found nothing useful. I then turned back to the Agenda Guild file and found three possible people in three locations dad was considering investigating. Each person had a file describing them and possible connections to the Agenda Guild.

Her father was well known around the village, respected and powerful. There would be police checking every backwoods and overturning every stone to bring him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney took a sip from her hot tea and continued to read messages on her computer. As an anonymous account, she had posted the image of the eight swords on all the forums she could find. It had been a long night already of dealing with Internet trolls and false leads.This could be so much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head remembering the few instructions that her father had left behind in case he \"mysterious disappeared.\" The number one rule was that the authorities could not be involved. At all. Sydney had lived in the mansion and enjoyed the finer things in life without thinking much of how her father made the family fortune. Now it seemed any of his business partners could've been slighted or a ex-employee has plotted revenge. With no leads and her tea no longer having effect, Sydney drifted away at the desk with the thought of the swords swirling around. Her father was yelling for help, he was somewhere dark, as if it was an underground maze. <i>Beep!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up from her dream to a find a flashing notification on the screen.

Worse, she was not any closer to figuring out where her father was or if he was even alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" She had mumbled to herself. The website was clear. It was from some upcoming MMO-style game for VR headsets. Not like she cared about anything like that, but sure enough, on the main page there was that symbol again. The eight swords and star looked even brighter and yet more ominous in high resolution. But that was it, there wasn't even much more information on the game except that it would be released in the near future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney thought about something that did show up on the webpage. It was small, a list of the sponsors but with no leads, it didn't seem like a bad idea to try checking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the laptop again. Scrolling past the graphic of the insignia, she found a small listing for the organizations that had made funding possible. Right at the top of the list was the Sawyer Foundation and a picture of a grinning man in glasses. \"There you are, Dad... Since when are you into video games?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of her family resources and unlimited time on her side, Sydney decides her next course of action.</span></div></div>",

She was able to find an address for the company but when she looked it up online, the only available image was a nondescript row of warehouses in the hi-tech San Bernardo area. It was nice to have a physical location as a last resort but there was no guarantee that anybody would actually be there. For all she knew, it was a server farm where their data just passed through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stop thinking about the importance of her father's organization, the Sawyer Foundation, being on the company's website. Finally she realized that if she was going to find out where he was or what he was up to, she was going to have to break some of the rules. She didn't have many rules living at home but going into her father's office was definitely a big one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had either been in a rush or had been distracted enough to be careless because the door to his office was unlocked. The inside of the study was a messy desk filled with paperwork and surrounded by the towering shelves of her dad's private library. He wasn't much of a reader and instead had an eye for collecting rare manuscripts and priceless 1st editions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney goes through the desk, briefly looking at the paperwork which is mostly budget statements for the foundation and a list of upcoming media-focused activities. It seems like nothing that can help until she finally found what she was looking for. An outgoing statement of bank transfers and payments. At first it doesn't seem like any sort of gaming company is listed but it is clear that they have to be under a fake name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne name caught her eye as well as the over a million dollars that had been donated or issued in the form of mysterious, semi-frequent payments.<i> SAMSARA LLC</i> appeared all over the banking statements. Could this be the mysterious gaming company that had left its promotional material in her father's mansion? </span></div></div>",

Follow the trail.\" She heard his voice in her head, it hadn't been that long ago when they would watch conspiracy theory documentaries when he had downtime. She on the other hand, didn't have much going on. Her father had offered her a position countless times, but she always refused. She told him she would make it out on her own, thank you very much. But that never happened either. Instead it seemed like years since she'd last had that conversation and spent so much time already wandering the lonely mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resources really were a blessing. Especially at a time like this. <br>\r\nSydney sat at her desk and clicked frantically to book the next available plane tickets to... <i>Burma?</i> That couldn't be right, could it? She had called in a favor and was able to find the physical address for this Samsara company. Once there was money involved, there was no hiding, especially from the well-connected financial advisors her father had on retainer. As for any suspicions? None at all from them. Her father had given her plenty of security clearance and authorization to handle his account in the event that he wasn't unavailable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a poor excuse of Mr. Foxtrotter being at the hospital with a stomach bug, Sydney had gained access to more money than she ever thought possible. And it wasn't even a considerable portion of her father's fortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I am going overseas...\" Still unsure if this was her father testing her or a genuine emergency, she purchased the planet tickets for a flight that was hours away.

She was jet lagged, exhausted, and despite the couple of champagne glasses that she had for breakfast, still very nervous about the rash decision to hop on a plane and try to find out her father. Was it really this crazy? What if her father was just testing her? Making sure she went through with the plan instead of wasting away on a couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just didn't seem his style. Could he really have expected her to find herself thousands of miles across the sea in a foreign airport, not speaking a word of the language, and still on his trail? Sydney had her laptop out and looked around the airport for the next step in her search. Surprisingly, Samsara was not located in the developing tech sector of the city, but inconveniently located in a highly mountainous region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when she began to suspect that this really wasn't a joke. As much as her father loved mind games, he wouldn't put her in danger, even if it was for the sake of a lesson on independence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the tourism that passed through the region, Sydney found it quite easy to communicate with the workers at the airport. A helpful young man directed her to a set of stands by the exit into the city where she could request additional services such as a ride share or hotel accommodations. Still, if her father was in danger, she had to be vague with whoever she contacted. Just enough information to get to where she needed to. </span></div></div>",

He was sometimes terrible at his job, as she had heard her father complain, but for the elder Foxotter, he was as close to a real friend as anybody could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's fine. Just a bug.\" <br>\r\nShe tried to be casual about it. Arthur requested the spoken code to access further information. This wasn't the first time she had dealt with some issue for her father when he was too busy or couldn't be bothered to deal with it. It wasn't suspicious, but for some reason, Art was extra insistent on hearing the codeword, one of many that her father had in place for security and confirming transaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snowflake. I said, <i>snowflake</i>. Art, seriously! I need these records tonight.\"<br>\r\nSydney thought she sounded too desperate. Would he be able to detect that something was wrong?

Only recently she had convinced him to upgrade his old model to a more modern Smartphone.  She smiled to herself at the memory, then reached out for the device and switched it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first thought was to check his call history.  Just before she did so, she hesitated.  Was this a breach of her Dad's privacy?  How would she feel if he went nosying through HER private calls?  But this was an emergency - she hadn't disappeared in to the night, possibly snatched by some kind of lunatic stranger and he had, so under the circumstances she felt justified.  The last few days call history was unsurprising - the University he sometimes worked for, a local pizza place, his bank, Eliza, the lady who came to clean the place every now and then.  The most recent person he had spoken to was his friend Arthur - Sydney knew him well and had done since she was a young child - he was one of her fathers oldest friends.  Without further consideration she pressed the call icon.  It rang a few times and a middle aged man's voice came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Arthur?  It's Sydney here, it's Jack's daughter, something's happened.  My Dad -\"  Something instinctively told her to stop.  Maybe she had read too many thrillers but suddenly she didn't feel safe talking on the telephone.  What if it was bugged?  What if this was something way more serious and complex than she could imagine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sydney?\" Arthur's tone was worried.  She realised she hadn't spoken for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur, is it okay if I come over to speak to you?  I'll explain when I get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Are you okay?  Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm okay,  I'm sure everything will be fine.  I'll make my way over, thanks Art\".   She cancelled the call and stuffed the phone in her pocket, then made her way back over to her room where she grabbed her bag and coat and pulled a pair of boots over her bandaged feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she began to descend the stairs, she heard a crash come from the direction of the kitchen.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she peered through the bars down onto the expansive lobby, she saw only darkness punctuated by shadows. There was no movement. She didn't expect to say any, not there anyway. She carried her bag down the steps with her, each pace she took downwards muffled by the carpet on the stairs. She was glad her father had opted for that one. She left the bag at the bottom of the stairs in case she needed it for a quick getaway and slowly made her way to the back of the house where the kitchen was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boots thudded quietly on the tiled floor and she walked deliberately, placing her feet down one by one and being as quiet as possible. She made it to the kitchen door where another thunderous crash from inside had her jumping. Her heart thumped wildly in her chest as she reached forward and rested her hand on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she pushed it open. It moved without sound and inside she could make out the shape of the island in the centre of the kitchen, the utensil rack hanging above it hanging by one chain and half of the items scattered across the kitchen top and floor. She smiled at herself and let out a grunting laugh. The nights events had caused her to be jumpy. She supposed it was natural but boy did she feel stupid. She reached into the room with her hand to flick on the light when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, a hand reached out from the darkness and grabbed Sydney's hand before turning her violently as a second hand clasped firmly over her mouth. Sydney screamed through the hand but nothing but a muffled whimper escaped as she felt herself being dragged into the shadows. She started to struggle but a familiar whispered voice caused her to hesitate. <i>\"Be still if you want to live!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney froze, recognizing the voice of her uncle Jack who she thought was out on a business trip in the former Soviet Union. Jack kept a firm hold onto her hand, holding the other securely over her mouth as she heard an unnatural sound that sent a chill down her spine. It sounded like a child's scream but distorted, as if through an old metal pipe. Then she saw the dark figure of what looked like a child come into view. Only, as it turned its head, Sydney saw that it was not a child, at least not anymore. Half of the creature's face was metallic, like that of a broken doll only worse. Its one eye was blue but the other was red, searching the darkness for movement. It rose its hand to look at a paper in its hand and Sydney saw that it was human except for the hand; it was robotic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the longest time, Sydney remained still and silent as the odd creature looked about then moved on, letting out another haunting scream and was gone. It was several long moments before Jack released Sydney and allowed her to turn to face him. \"What- What was that thing?\" shaken, Sydney asked. \"It looked like a little boy but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was a powerful man, standing at six foot five with muscles that would make an Olympian weight lifter jealous. He brushed his longish black hair aside, revealing his deep blue eyes. \"That 'thing', as you put it, <i>is</i> a little boy.\" sadly, he replied. \"Your father and I have been working hard to stop the monsters who had 'created' them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this horrified Sydney. \"What!?!\" almost screaming, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are called 'The Collective'.\" serious, Jack explained. \"They are a group of mad scientists who have pulled their resources to bring humanity into what they see as the next evolution of mankind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By turning kids into machines...\" shaken, I asked. \"That's insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father and I have been fighting this group for decades.\" after looking about, Jack said. \"Your mom has been fighting them too.... from the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is with those maniacs!?\" horrified, Sydney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded. \"Your father did not want you to know this but now they are onto us and that places him, me, you all in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone took dad.\" gulping, Sydney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" almost whispering, Jack said. \"They took him but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack came down to my level. \"Sydney, they were after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney's eyes went wide before she...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ignoring the pain that shot up from her foot, she began to scour his room. She started by the window where she already was but besides the rain that was lashing through the open pane, there was nothing to be seen. She hobbled over to the upturned bed. It was a double mattress with a metal frame which suggested to her that whoever had done this was really strong, either that or there was more than one of them. The thought chilled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dressed showed nothing. He kept only small trinkets in there and items for cleaning and getting ready. The familiar smell of Old Spice floated up to her and her stomach sank. <i>Will I ever see him again?</i> She shook herself.

She knew her father kept his cufflinks and rings and other trinkets in a small leather trinket box. Why not the amulet as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the lamp so that she could see it better. It was round and made of gold and seemed very old. The design was simple - a chameleon. A golden chameleon. What could it mean? She could not escape the feeling that she had discovered something important. Yes, it was only \"intuition\" at work, but Sydney trusted her intuition. It had helped her on more than one occasion, even saved her life once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she call the authorities now? If she waited much longer, they would ask why she hadn't called them immediately.  How could she answer: \"Because I know my father would not want the police involved and I was hoping to figure out who took him myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that wouldn't do. It was not that her father was a criminal. He wasn't, not really. But he had political enemies who could easily spin public opinion in that direction.</span></div></div>",
