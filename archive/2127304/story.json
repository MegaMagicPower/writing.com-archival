        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Inspired by both the manga Mayonaka no X Method and Crocodile's Dimensional Rift story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Midnight Cross Swap. A secret known to only a select handful of high class individuals has recently started growing into a less rare tradition. Word of mouth and rumors have caused the Midnight Cross Swap to be brought to the world from the shadows, yet not all believe it. The rumors say that the ritual it usually performed with groups of eight people at a time and always happens at midnight. Never happening twice in a row it's always a random moment when the subject surfaces. The rumors go on to say that the ritual allows those participating in it to swap their bodies for the remainder of the night, returning to their own body when the morning comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ritual is performed exactly at midnight, with each participant needing to lay down and place a talisman of sorts over their forehead. After that seven doors will appear to each person, representing each of the remaining people. Doors relating to men are red while the doors relating to women are white and each door will typically have a unique design on it to reflect the person it connects to. Once the door is chosen that body is no longer available to the other participants. Everyone must choose a door. Once swapped the participants may enjoy their new bodies in any way they like until the sun rises where they'll immediately swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nThe Rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Proper grammar please. No texting talk unless the characters are actually texting or something.<br>\r\n2. Sexual content is allowed and actually expected. Just keep it tasteful and don't make it the main subject.<br>\r\n3. In situations like Bleach where there are multiple \"dimensions\" interacting together, the cross swap CAN swap between them.<br>\r\n4. Have fun.</td>",
