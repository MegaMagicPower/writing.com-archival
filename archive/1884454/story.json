Possios was one of the unfortunate souls that happend to be trapped in the wasteland of rock and sand. She had been stranded there by a Sith apprentice, who thought a fitting way to kill her would be marooning her in the hellish heat of the Dune Sea. She hadn't been given any supplies. And she was extremely de-hydrated. If she didn't find shelter, (but seeing as her surroundings were nothing but sand dunes, that wasn't much of a choice,) or someone found her soon, she would certainly die. She was walking up the side of a sand dune. when she reached the top of the dune, all that could be seen was many mire miles of sand. She felt her legs give out, and rolled down the dune. Stopping in a prone position on the hot desert floor. She didn't have the strength to get back up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though she considers it, she knows that she doesn't have the strength to stand, to sit, or to even call out into the dune sea for help (not that anyone would hear her). Her only option is to lie there, nearly motionless, waiting for the cool of night where perhaps she may be given some respite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't believe I'm going to die here', she thinks to herself as she feels her entire body growing drier. It wasn't the death she had expected, though she hadn't ever really contemplated how she might eventually die. That particular topic was part of a long list of things she didn't like to talk or even think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desert around her stood quiet, with the wind being the only source of noise amongst the mute dunes and the silent song of the sand. Then a noise, distant but audible, broke through the silence! It was both startling and relieving to Passios, though she couldn't tell what it was from. It was different to the wind, different to the sand, but sounded as though it was organic, like a living thing had produced it. Passios shuffled back and forth in the sand, trying to force herself into a seated position, but she was too weak to even shuffle properly. The noise continually grew closer and closer. She knew it was coming towards her, maybe coming for her? She didn't know, but she would be greatful all the same. Her eyes remained closed in all of this, not prepared to face the suns and how they burn! Then everything darkened, as though shade had been introduced around her. Maybe this was it? Rescue?! Salvation?! She needed to see it! Passios worked to open her eyes, slowly, feeling as though she would have to pry them open. She was very weak by this point. Very gradually, her eyes opened, and she found herself face-to-face with...</span></div></div>",

Too exhausted to even blink out the rough grains, her body sprawled where it had landed, her sun burnt and blistered face lolling to one side, her view of the great, golden beast unrestricted. The wall of heat smiled at her over the rough landscape, waving serenely as she felt her breaths come slower and slower. Shivers racked her body, it could not yet be much past noon, but cold buried itself deep into her bones. <i>I am going to die.</i> She would have cried, though she so rarely had over the short years of her life she may not have remembered how, but it was all for naught. No water was left, even to weep with.</span></div></div>",
