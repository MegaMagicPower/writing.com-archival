Hi!\" Damon said, unsure about what to say or ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis second head whipped his head around towards you. \"Oh, hello there little guy!\" He said cheerfully. \"Where did you come from? You're not a native bird of Sinnoh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Now Damon was confused. This guys was obviously not a Pokemon; maybe a fellow transformed person? But, Damon did not appreciate this head speaking to him like a little pet. \"Stop talking to me like that! I'm human... or... I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're human you say!\" The second head looked at you carefully, then his gaze shifted towards the area around them. \"Where am I? I don't see the school anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? What school? Who are you?\" Damon started to fire off questions at the strange person attached to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Your other head turned around to look at you again. \"You know, the Sinnoh region's Pokemon school of magic!\" Your other head said it matter-of-factly, like you should know about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A magical school?\" You tilt your head questioningly. Was magic real? That might explain how you woke up as a Pokemon. \"Did you do this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't be silly.\" Your other head shook his head. \"As you can clearly see, I am not... whatever Pokemon you are. I am a proud Staraptor!\" He tiled his head up, trying to take a confident pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this guy crazy or stupid? You didn't know which was worse. \"Um... you are not a Staraptor. We are a Doduo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Your other head looked puzzled. He then looked down at his, or rather your single body. \"That is ridic-- AWH! What happened! Why is your ugly head attached to my body?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" you glared at your other head. \"We look exactly the same?!\" You motioned to the reflection in the lake beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWH What Pokemon am I?\" He yelled while gawking at his, your, reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop yelling!\" You demand. \"We're a Doduo, a Kanto region Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening!\" He looked very distraught. \"I came out here and performed the spell perfectly! This shouldn't be happening! I should be a Staraptor... not stuck to you!\" Your other head tried pulling away from you, but only the left leg responded. You both were thrown off balance and plunged into the lake. After thrashing about in the water, you both managed to get your footing on the muddy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spit water from your mouth and glared at your other head. This was turning into the worst day of your life; this was not supposed to be how your day started. You were pissed! Without thinking you began to angrily peck at your other head, and then he began to do the same. It was a flurry of heads, shooting back and forth, up and down, left and right. Your fighting did not cease until, you could not move your head at all. \"What happened!\" you chocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both got lost in the fighting that you found yourself on the ground, on your back. Your necks were now tied in an uncomfortable knot. \"This is your fault!\" Your other head childishly said, trying to glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your fault!\" you angrily replied. You both preceded to try to start the pecking war again, but the knot of your necks only tighten further. \"Ugh, truce!\" You call out, and your other head agrees. The two of you spend the next hour begrudgingly untangling your necks, but you at least began to understand each other better. Your other head was an apprentice mage named Magnus. </span></div></div>",

His body began to glow orange. When Piplup hit him, Damon could feel the damage he took turn into energy within himself. He needed to discharge it.

Piplup flew back a distance and rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh...\" Piplup was struggling to stand back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Quinn! Use Aqua Ring!\" Jodi yelled, and her Piplup did just that. Interlacing rings of water formed from the moisture in the air and surrounded the blue penguin. He glowed slightly, drawing revitalizing energy from the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh. I have to do something!\" Damon exclaimed. \"So I know Counter, but what else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Quinn, use Bubble!\" Piplup ran towards Damon, and jumped high into the air. He opened his mouth and spray of shiny bubbles flew towards Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon was unable to dodge them. \"AWWWW!\" He screamed, landing hard onto his back. His limbs felt heavy, and standing back up seemed to difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, go pokeball!\" Jodi yelled.

I wanted to catch that Riolu too\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodi and Piplup then left. Damon looks at the Riolu that save him. \"Thanks for saving me back there. I don't know what I would do if I was capture\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to help out a Riolu brother out\" Damon looks at Riolu with a confuse look. \"A Riolu brother?\" Damon starts to ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you and I are both Riolu's. So it make sense we help each other out and call you a brother. Besides our aura's are the same as well. I could sense it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon remembers that a Riolu and a Lucario can sense aura around them. He wonders if he could do the same as well in his new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway I'm Ramon. What's your name?\" he ask. \"Damon. Funny both of our names rhyme\" said Damon. \"I agree. Hey Damon could I ask you something?\" Ramon ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Ramon what is it?\" Damon ask. \"Well what I want to ask is?\"</span></div></div>",

All I know is that I used to be human, and I woke up a month ago as a Riolu. Most of everything before that was blank except for my name. But when I sensed your presence, I felt a connection.

His beak glowed white. He used all his force to topple the Riolu pair over. \"Now, use Brine!\" Quinn took a deep breathe, expanding his body slightly.

At first I thought they looked similar to the first two Riolus I saw. But that couldn't be possible.\" Jodi replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen a lot of miraculous things in my time, Jodi. I would not like to rule out anything just yet.\" The professor knelt down to look at the two Lucarios. \"You see, these two look strikingly similar, but not as identical as I would have thought a naturally born pair of conjoined Lucarios would be. There are significant differences in their fur texture and patterns.\" He turned and walked to one of his computers. \"Could you two step onto this platform. This is going to give us an x-ray of your body.\" The professor spoke towards the joined Lucarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon and Ramon looked at each other for a moment, both shared a deep excitement at the prospect of finally learning how they fused. \"We defiantly should have gone to see him first.

On a couple occasions, those fights made them loose battles. One of those occurred during the Vielstone city gym battle, and they lost to the gym leader's own Lucario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the professor asked them to step off the platform for a light blue virtual image of their body to appear in their place. \"Now, my expertise is in Pokemon evolution, but I can give you some helpful insights into Damon and Ramon's form. They were not born that way.\" There was a gasp from both Cynthia and Jodi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Jodi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As sure as I can be. Here, let me show you this as a reference.\" The professor made a brown image of another pokemon appear beside the virtual copy of Damon and Ramon. \"This is a Kanto region Pokemon called Doduo. This species naturally is born as conjoined twins.\" Another image of a yellow Pokemon appeared. \"And this is a Jolteon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia, who had been quite for this whole exchange, finally spoke, \"Wait a moment professor. Jolteons are a single headed species of Pokemon; why does this image have two heads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Rowan nodded, \"Yes, that is true. However, this Pokemon was born as conjoined twin Eevees before it evolved. But, the reason I am showing you these images is to point out what I saw from the x-ray of Damon and Ramon. Look closely at the three images.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone did, but Cynthia was the one who noticed the differences. \"I see professor. Damon and Ramon have slightly different hues of blue, while the other Pokemon are all the same color as their twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! This leads me to believe that Damon and Ramon were merged somehow, though I cannot say what caused this fusion.\" The professor then turn to look at Jodi and her Lucarios, who were now standing by her. \"Jodi, I would suggest that you take Damon and Ramon to see Professor Sycamore from the Kalos region.

His muscles were more powerful, his feet moved more quickly, and he felt that he stood a bit taller than before. He smiled from the thrill, and he could feel Ramon smile from within their linked minds. \"This is amazing.\" He jumped high in the air, rotated through a backflip, and landed gracefully on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is incredible. More amazing than I imagined.\" Ramon exclaimed within their linked minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon paused, \"Wait, you have never done this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon felt, Ramon smile as if embarrassed. \"Truthfully, no I have not done this before. I have seen it done once, and I was eager to experience it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopped near a tree, Damon lifted his paws and stared at them. \"I know you said that you would let me control our body, but why don't you take over, so you have a chance at controlling it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Ramon questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, go ahead.\" Damon said, and he forced his muscles to relax, and then his paws began to move on their own. He was not sure how to explain the sensation. Initially, it was like he was in the 'driver's seat' in a way. He had complete control. But now, it was like he was the passenger. Damon could feel his body, as if it was his own, but Ramon was the one maneuvering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched and smiled as Ramon climbed up a tree. Just before reaching the first branch, he kicked off, seemingly entering a swan dive. He corrected the rotation and landed on his feet and one hand in the dirt. Damon had to admit that feeling his body move on its own was unusual, but he sensed that he could attempt to take back control at any time. \"Ramon, what happens if we both try and control our body at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Ramon responded out loud, like Damon had done when he was in control. Ramon clenched their right paw into a fist. \"Let find out. Try to unclench our right hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon attempted to push Ramon out of the 'driver seat' of their lined minds, but Ramon did not relinquish control. It felt more like they each were holding onto the wheel. The muscles in their right arm began to quiver, and then it began to seize. Shocked, Damon let go of the wheel in their mind, just as Ramon must have. Their body collapsed onto the ground as neither had taken control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd. He felt their body lying on the moss covered dirt, but he also saw himself and Ramon in his mind's eye, facing each other. He spoke to the other Riolu within their linked brains, \"Okay, so if we both try to control our body, it seemed to get confused and shake uncontrollably.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we both let go of control, our body collapses.\" Ramon commented. \"One of us need to be in the driver's seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon paused, curious that Ramon used the words driver's seat, to describe how he also felt about it. He wondered how this Riolu would know about the driver's seat of a car. Before he could ask, Damon heard a noise in the brush to their left. He jumped into control to rotate their head. A flash of red and white was suddenly flying towards them, and he narrowly managed to roll out of the way. A pokeball hit the space where his body had been laying a moment before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed!\" A familiar girl's voice exclaimed from the other side of the bush. When she stood up, Damon was surprised to see his friend, Jodi. \"Alright Piplup, guess we have to do this the hard way. GO!\" A moment later, a penguin-like Pokemon jumped through the brush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon was shocked that Jodi had found him again. He had to give his friend credit, she was persistent. He spoke to the other Riolu through their linked minds, \"Ramon, let me try and battle her, I need the practice. If we get into trouble, then I will let you take over, no questions asked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Ramon agreed. </span></div></div>",

As the attack flew past, he felt his aura, his and Ramon's shared aura tingle in response to the attack. Following instinct, Damon pulled his elbows back as he took in a deep breathe of air, he then released his own stream of bubbles at the opposing Piplup. His aim was true. He hit his opponent, but it seemed to recover quickly from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copycatting a water attack is not going to be very effective against a Piplup, even with our powers combined.\" Ramon commented in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think I know that!\" Damon yelled back through their linked minds. He was distracted for a moment, but that was all Jodi's Piplup needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis opponent charged forward with its beak glowing white, and stuck Damon in his chest. He heard Ramon cry out in pain from within him, having felt the same hit. \"Let me take over.\" He growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I got this. Stop distracting me.\" Damon yelled at his friend. He curled his fist, and felt energy flow around it. A green sphere surrounded his paw, and he thrust it at Piplup who nimbly jumped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You missed...\" Ramon complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon tried to ignore his backseat driver as Piplup came at him again with its glowing beak. Damon was about to jump, when he suddenly felt himself be pushed aside. His body had not been moved, only the other Riolu must have taken control of their body back. Damon watched and felt as an orange glow surrounded them. Ramon let their opponent hit their crossed arms. The impact of the Peak attack hurt, but Damon felt Ramon channel the hit into his own attack. A moment later, Ramon swept his arms in a long arc, releasing the energy into Piplup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe penguin Pokemon was blasted backwards, landing roughly onto the mossy ground. \"That is how you battle.\" Ramon smirked inwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't giving me a chance!\" Damon yelled. He launched himself at their inner stirring wheel, trying to seize back control. Their body began to seize, unable to listen to either himself or Ramon. His body, their body then flew backward as a white, large beak struck at their chest. Damon and Ramon both cried out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon, seemingly having greater wherewithal at the moment, stole back control of their body. He rushed forward and landed his arm's glowing, green fist into Piplup's stomach. Immediately, he felt a rush of energy flow into him, rapidly sealing a few of his wounds. Damon then turned and ran, only daring to look behind for a moment to make sure his opponent was not following him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon ran for several minutes before finally pausing to rest his tired muscles. \"You almost got us caught!\" Ramon yelled within their linked minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are half to blame. You kept distracting me from the fight, and forcing me to fight with you too.\" Damon yelled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were going to make us lose; I had no choice but to wrestle control from you!\" Ramon exclaimed as he tried to seize control again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon felt his body collapse on the ground, seizing, as he fought with Ramon. \"You can do your own fighting from now on! I splitting off from you.\" Damon tried concentrating, and their interlinked auras began to flare around them. When they had joined into one body, their auras did not merge, so much as interweave like their bodies had. They were still separate, in a sense, just woven together. Damon focused his aura into unlocking from Ramon's, like pulling stitches. To his relief, the process had begun to separate their bodies. He no longer felt Ramon's presence in their liked brains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I haven't had a chance to test out this new body!\" Ramon yelled. He had actually yelled, from beside Damon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Damon felt resistance. His aura had slowed to a stop, held in a choke-hold of sorts, unable to unweave any further. Damon peeked to his eyes open and was surprised to see the other Riolu starting at him. Though, Ramon seemed too close, only inches from his own face. He knew that they had only partially separated before Ramon started to fight back. \"Stop it Ramon! Find someone else to merge with.\" Damon yelled out loud. Try as he might, Damon could not finish unweaving his aura. They were locked in a battle of wills unable to separate or join any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon figured that he would have to knock the other Riolu out, force him unconscious. If he did so, he would be able to finish the process he started. \"Might as well hit him with his own power...\" Damon whispered aloud. In the palm of his right hand he channeled his aura, the part that was still interlocked with Ramon's. The part that was keeping him trapped in a half-merged body. He formed their linked auras into a sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly caching on, Ramon yelled, \"Oh no you don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon watched as Ramon's left hand plunged into the sphere he had created. The sphere grew and grew, as their interlinked auras mixed and blended. Unable to manage the power, Damon forced the energy to be released as a blinding light rather than it discharging into them.  And all at ounce, both of them stopped fighting for control, too exhausted to keep it going. Damon breathed in hard, letting his right hand rest beside him. \"I can't believe you tried to stop me from separating us.\" Damon said weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you were forcing me to separate... I still deserve a turn!\" Ramon said back, equally tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not arguing about this. I want to go my own way.\" Damon turned to glare at the other Riolu, who face was still too close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Its not worth the trouble fighting you anyways.\" He smirked. \"In fact, I'll gladly help split away from you. You're more trouble than your worth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon growled but chose not to retort. With his breathing managed, he closed his eyes again to focus his aura, only something felt different now. Damon could no longer distinguish between his aura and Ramon's. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Ramon gasped from beside him. \"Oh no, oh no, oh no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Damon glared at him annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your aura, my aura... Its like there is no difference now. Its like they have...\" Ramon did not seem to know how to finish his statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merged...\" Damon spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamon slowly turned his head to face Damon. He nodded. \"We didn't just weave them together like we did in the beginning. Our auras' have... blended together. I don't think we can fuse or separate any more than we are now. We're stuck half-way!\" </span></div></div>",

I am not sharing her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have her!\" Damon yelled back. \"I was trying to...\" He stopped mid-sentence, too embarrassed to tell his other half what he was trying to do. But then, a sudden thought occurred to him. He wasn't sure if it was from the shared hormones he shared with Arian, or some weird, delayed effect placed on him from Lucina. He suddenly felt very warm, very enticed by the idea of being Lucina's mate. \"You know what... I was trying to lung for Lucina. I should be her mate. She did say I was the most handsome Lugia she had ever seen.\" That last part wasn't completely true, but he felt a rush of joy making Arian jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... You... NO! You are second hand compared to me!\" Arian glared at you. He the stretched his head outward. \"Look at these impressive feathers. They shine bright in the light of the sun, absolutely stunning. Lucina said so herself.\" He then turned and pressed his head against Damon's aggressively. \"I am her one and only mate! You're just a parasite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little...!\" Damon pushed back against Arian's head. His vision went red with anger. Arcing his head back, Damon opened his mouth funneling that anger into an attack, Hydropump. However, Arian was mirroring Damon. The two released all of their furry, all of their power at each other. There was an explosion of water. The blast launched them backwards, felling many trees as their joint body flew through the air. Knocked out, the two Lugia's body lay crumpled on the ground.</span></div></div>",

The freed Pokemon start to run to the exit as Team Galactic grunts try to stop them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed Lugia seeing this use Hyper Beams on them, knocking them out. Soon the last Pokemon is out, the two then look at each other. Then if as come to an unforeseen agreement they fly high, as they then fire 6 more Hyper Beams around the room sitting it on fire, they then use their wings to help it grow, and spreed. with the work done they leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two fly away from the burning Team Galactic base the two headed Lugia are happy. They are basking in their power that they have together, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact both feel that this merger was not so bad, in fact they start to think that sharing Lucina  would be okay too, as they head of to look for her.</span></div></div>",
