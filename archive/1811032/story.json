He'd been looking for this treasure for the past seven months. One clue led to another to another until finally, a dead end. It wasn't until he -- completely by accident -- stumbled across the final clue that had lead him to the ancient Mayan city of Tikal. He didn't know what exactly he'd find there. Tikal had never really been \"lost\" the way some of the other ancient cities he'd stumbled into had been; any ancient artifacts that were there would have been long gone. But still, there he was, paging through his notebook as he pressed hand against rock, hoping against hope that he'd find something -- anything -- that would send him closer towards his goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he caught sight of it: an ancient Mayan glyph. He had seen that before, he was sure of it -- in one of the other Mayan cities he'd passed through en route to this place. Frantically, he turns the pages in his notebook until he finds it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. I knew I had seen it before.\" Nathan runs his fingers over the drawing, frowning down at it. He'd seen it before, at the temple. The glyph's literal meaning was 'Lord', though 'Divine One' might be a more appropriate translation; it was one the Mayans typically reserved for their Gods. There had to be some significance to this symbol. There just had to be a reason it was there at the temple and here in these ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods...  The Mayans...\" Nathan muses to himself. \"There's got to be something that links these two together.\" He closes the book and slips it into his pocket, then rubs his whiskered face with a weary hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt comes back wet with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great! Just what I needed.\" A bullet had grazed his face earlier, leaving a perfect streak of dried blood across the lower half of his cheek. He hadn't yet treated the wound (who did in this line of business?) and he'd managed to open the wound again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, in that second, it suddenly comes to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe presses a bloodied finger into the glyph's carving, tracing the glyph in red. Mayans had made blood sacrifices to the gods in order to honor them, and did so hoping that they'd find themselves in gods' good graces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shudder, the wall suddenly pulls back, and as if by reflex, Nathan jerks his hand away. A musty smell wafts from the entrance, a smell Nathan is well-accustomed to. For a second, he hesitates, then steps inside. A long hall gives way to a small room with a pedestal, and on it is...</span></div></div>",

Seven months of hard work! He can hardly believe it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now is not the time for celebrating; if years of treasure hunting had taught him anything, it was that he needed to get the hell out of dodge first. Too many times he'd found himself with the treasure in hand only to have it tugged from his grasp by a meglomaniac or a rival treasure hunter with a dubious sense of personal morality (and occasionally, hygiene). He reaches out and grasps for the necklace and clasps it around his neck; he takes only a second to admire it before tucking it under his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, time to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only as he steps out of the corridor that led into this room in the first place that Nathan feels his stomach gurgle with hunger. How long had it been since he'd last eaten? Whenever he was treasure hunting, he often forgot to have a bite to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was no matter now. Once he was back home, he'd have time to celebrate hard for a job well done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's nothing that Nathan enjoys more after a successful treasure hunt than a good meal -- and he can say he's indulged in quite a few of them before heading back to America. His appetite after treasure hunts always seemed to be insatiable, but his hunger seemed even greater than usual this time. Still, nothing could beat Elena's cooking. He was eager to spend a few nights at her apartment before meeting up with Sully to discuss a potential sale of the item. Sure, the necklace was nice and everything, but keeping it meant that he had to find some way to pay seven months worth of expenses. And that was something he couldn't afford to do at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when he finally steps into Elena's apartment, she's there at the door within seconds and Nathan suddenly realizes how much he missed this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much he missed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells good,\" he remarks, lowering his head to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiles as his lips meet her own. \"I thought I'd whip something up to welcome you home.\" She pulls away and lets her eyes trail over him, as if taking him in for the first time. Her eyes stop on his midsection for a moment, and suddenly, Nathan feels uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What</i>?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just looks like you've put on a little weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan presses a hand against his stomach and he frowns. It's a little softer than he remembers it; it presses slightly against his belt, and extends slightly over his waistband. When had this happened? He had always prided himself on staying fit and lean. He had to be to stay competitive in this line of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before Elena takes note of Nathan's discomfort. \"C'mon,\" she says, tugging his hand away from his belly, and into her own. \"It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Let's go eat. Besides, you need to fill me in on your big adventure.\" </span></div></div>",

Besides, he deserved a break every once in awhile. And before long, he'd be back to treasure hunting like he always was. He couldn't see any way he wouldn't shed a few extra pounds in some Brazilian jungle or while traveling across a vast Siberian tundra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you make?\" he asks, as she pulls him into the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Elena says, smiling wryly. \"Nothing TOO special.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate sniffs audibly. \"If I were to wager a guess, I'd say roast. No, not that.\" Nate gives another sniff. \"A stew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena glances over at Nate, still smiling as she lifts the lid off the pot sitting at the center of the table. \"Well, I'd say you'd be right on the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Nate exclaims. He can't remember the last time he had some of Elena's home cooking, but it was her stews that he loved the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it isn't long until the two are enjoying a bowl of stew -- and each other's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this <i>necklace</i> of yours,\" Elena says. \"It's not... magical, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magical?\" Nate looks up from his now-empty bowl of stew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, <i>magical</i>,\" Elena says, with a touch of impatience. \"Like that gold statue Navarro was after. Or that brass talisman from your <i>last</i> adventure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate ladles some more stew into his bowl. \"No -- not that I know of, anyway. If this thing <i>does</i> have any magical properties, it certainly hasn't effected me yet.\" He pulls it out from under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're <i>wearing</i> it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best way to make sure it doesn't get lost,\" Nate says, between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena shoots Nate a look that tells him plainly that she's not entirely convinced. \"Look,\" he concedes, \"If you're that worried, I'll take it off.\"</span></div></div>",

Nate lets out a heavy sigh and pulls his hands away. He knows better than to argue with Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few minutes, it becomes abundantly clear to the blonde reporter that it is stuck. No matter how she tries to pry it open, it just refuses to budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Nate says, with the wave of a hand. \"Let's not worry about it for right now.\" But a small part of him is worried. He might not think that this thing is as magical as the other items he's collected (or attempted to) in some of his previous adventures, but this thing's bound to lose a good deal of its value if they have to break it to get it off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, that's the last thing he needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena looks down at Drake pensively. \"Okay,\" she says, somewhat reluctantly as she sits back down at the table.

Of course I'm enjoying it.\" He fills a third bowl up. \"Do you have any idea how long it's been since I've had your cooking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven months now.\" There's disapproval in her tone, and Nate picks up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm going to give it a rest for a couple of weeks. Enjoy some time here with you for a change. I know I haven't been around a lot since, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Nate,\" Elena says, her expression softening. \"I just wish that you were home more often. I miss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords have always come easily to Nathan Drake, but pressing forward the ones that really mattered was what he found difficult. But somehow, he manages to say it -- if only this time. \"And I miss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe presses a hand over Elena's smaller one just as the blonde's lips begin to curl into a smile.</span></div></div>",

Sure, his wounds began to close up leaving behind the occasional scar, but those, Elena was used to. The change in his weight, she <i>wasn't</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach had expanded significantly over the last couple of weeks; the slight curve over his pants had grown after a few weeks of her home cooking. His pants, which were typically baggy and loose over his muscular legs were tight over thicker flesh. Even his arms looked fleshier than she remembered them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan, on the other hand, seemed completely oblivious to his gaining. Rather than acknowledge that he had put on a few pounds, he complained that his clothes were shrinking. It never seemed to occur to him that <i>he</i> might be expanding, even though his belt had moved a few notches since he'd first arrived at her apartment a few weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena deliberated whether or not to say anything. Nathan's appetite had certainly increased since the last time they had seen one another, but he always ate like he was famished immediately after returning from one of his adventures. Maybe she'd just forgotten how much he ate after returning from one of these trips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena presses her lips together pensively as she watches Nate brush his teeth. A generous portion of flab extended over his boxers, still heavy and taut from this morning's breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe.</i></span></div></div>",

He spits out the toothpaste, then wipes his face down with a handtowel. \"Is something up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena presses her lips together and shifts uncomfortably where she stands. There's silence there, and Nate finds himself wishing Elena would just spit it out already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you've put on some more weight recently?\" Another uncomfortable silence. \"I mean, more than before. You're looking kind of chubby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Almost immediately, Nate is on the defensive. But when he tilts his head down and places his hands on his stomach, he finds that it's softer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle that had covered his chest was now covered with a new layer of fat; his boxers, which snapped cleanly over finely-sculpted abdominals did little to contain the extra weight in his midsection. A callused thumb brushes over his bellybutton and finds the indentation there is much deeper than he remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate isn't accustomed to being embarrassed, but he is at that moment. How could he have let this slip through him? How could he have put on so much weight in the last three weeks? Even worse, how could he do so without ever noticing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it's not that bad, Nate,\" Elena says, and he's not sure if she's lying or not. \"I'm just concerned. If you keep putting on the pounds like that, it's going to be harder to do your whole treasure-hunting thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, <i>no kidding</i>.\" Nate's tone is irritable. He knows he shouldn't take out his frustrations on Elena; it wasn't as if she was forcing him to eat all that food in the first place. His appetite had been ravenous ever since his excursion to Tikal. He just needed to show a little more restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena, in the meantime, stands awkwardly in the doorway. He knows she's trying to think of something to say to that, but what <i>can</i> she really say to that? He's really let himself go, and she's just concerned -- with good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he says, more to himself than to Elena. \"There's nothing to worry about.

I can't get it off\" Nate tried as he might the bracelet would not bulge \"I guess its gonna be on me for a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan returned to his hotel where he was staying at and quickly head to his room to try figuring out how to remove the bracelet but decided to<br>\r\ngive up \"Its still stuck so I'll figure out where to find somebody to take this off\" Nate was tired from all that adventuring so he decided to go to bed that day.</span></div></div>",

He doesnt notice that his abs are gone, his pecs are softer and that he's gained 70 lbs in his thighs and ass,100lbs overall. His thighs are rubbing together, making Drake move slower and have to put in more effort just to move his thunder thighs to walk. His ass is alot bigger to and jiggles with every step. He looks in the mirror and only sees his torso so really doesnt notice the huge change to his lower body. After he showers he gets out and shaves and slowly walks/jiggles his way back to bed. He's so exausted and he has only been awake for an hour. He tries to jump into bed but cant get off the ground and collapses from the effort. Drake figures he needs more sleep and he's probably dreaming anyway so he passes out.........</span></div></div>",
