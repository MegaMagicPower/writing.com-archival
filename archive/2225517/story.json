He was currently relaxing on a nice scoop of strawberry ice cream. In real life, he didn\u2019t believe hard work wasn\u2019t needed for a good life and that belief was even more true in dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he relaxed, a shadow suddenly surrounded him. Confused, he opened his eyes to see what was blocking the sun. He flinched as he saw his sister towering over him. She was practically naked and had a sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up little brother! We have a special surprise for you.\u201d She said. Barry tried to ignore her only for the giantess to reach down and grab the scoop he was on. He became afraid as Carmen lifted him up to her face. She licked her lips sending chills down his spine. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much fun with you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarmen\u2026please!\u201d Barry pleaded. The giantess simply chuckled and opened her mouth. Barry could see her sharp teeth ready to tear him to pieces. Her slithery tongue danced a little in anticipation. Other than that, it was pitch black inside. \u201cCarmen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother\u2026it\u2019s time to wake up!\u201d She said louder. The boy wanted to cry as she flicked her hand causing him to go flying into the black void inside her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry woke up startled. The sun was shining and he could hear birds chirping. He looked to his left to see he was still in his bedroom. The boy sighed and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother! It\u2019s time to wake up!\u201d He heard his sister say. He opened his eyes and flinched as he saw Carmen sitting on top of his pelvis. She was only in a bikini but that was pretty normal when she wasn\u2019t planning on going out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what are you doing?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came to wake you up, we have a surprise for you downstairs.\u201d She said. Carmen suddenly got on her hands and knees, putting her face close to his. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I did, I seemed to have inserted myself into your dream. I bet it was interesting.\u201d She said licking her lips. Barry became afraid and started to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarmen please\u2026get off me.\u201d The girl sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh very well. Just hurry up and get downstairs already. We\u2019re all waiting for you.\u201d She said. She climbed off and left the room. Barry took a second to breathe, his nightmare still remained in his head. After he was calmed down a bit, he went downstairs to join the rest of his family.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Barry got downstairs, everyone was sitting on the couch. On the table in front of them was a nicely wrapped present with a red bow on top. His father motioned for him to sit across from them. He did as he was told keeping an eye on the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, it\u2019s time we had a talk. You can\u2019t keep living your life like this.\u201d His father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. If you continue down this path, you\u2019ll have nothing, nothing at all.\u201d His mom added. Barry looked down at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m alive now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d He asked. His father looked at the rest of his family before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was afraid you were going to say something like that. So, we\u2019ve come to a decision. We\u2019re going to give you a choice that will affect the rest of your life. Carmen, would you explain please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly. Barry, you are going to stop being such a parasite and do some actual work. You\u2019ll get a job and work towards a better future.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026what if I refuse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you refuse then open that box. It has everything you need to continue this worthless life plan. Believe me, I so hope you choose the box, it would make me so happy.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarry wait\u2026please, at least consider it before you choose.\u201d His mother pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry thought about it for a moment. He knew that he probably should be working harder and it would make everyone happy. However, the thought of them giving him something that would allow him an easy life made him excited. He grabbed the present and started to open it. His mother saddened while his sister smiled even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boy pulled out the contents, he became confused. It was a weird looking item. It\u2019s shape resembled a neck pillow but looked small enough to be a collar. The item was red with a shiny gem in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut it on.\u201d His father said. Barry nodded and did as he was told. As soon as he put it around his neck, the back closed up. The item felt soft and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly is this? And how will it help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis device is going to shrink you.\u201d His mom explained. Barry flinched. His nightmare suddenly came back into mind. \u201cIt\u2019ll shrink you down to the size of a bug. Since you\u2019re so persistent towards an easy life, we decided to grant your wish.\u201d Barry quickly grabbed it and tried to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Not like this!\u201d He yelled. Carmen startled to chuckle. Barry watched as his father pulled out a remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but you made this decision.\u201d He said. He pushed a button causing the gem to light up. Within a few moments, Barry blacked out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Barry woke up, his head was a little woozy. He felt a hard surface below him and the room was currently silent. When he was able to concentrate, he looked around. The first thing he noticed was that he was now completely naked except for the device around his neck. It still felt physically nice and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then noticed he was currently on the living room table. In front of him was his family, now supersized. He seemed to be handheld size now. They all simply stared stared him. Chills went down Barry\u2019s spine as he noticed Carmen\u2019s smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you going to do to me now?\u201d He asked. The giants stayed silent making Barry annoyed. \u201cHey! Answer me!\u201d He yelled. He started waving his arms making Carmen chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he\u2019s trying to tell us something.\u201d She said. Austin nodded and reached down by the couch. The giant pulled out another interesting device and set it in front of Barry. The device was a box with a small tube on Barry\u2019s side containing a microphone. On the other side was a much larger tube with a speaker at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Barry. Speak into that and we\u2019ll be able to hear you.\u201d Austin said. The boy nodded and approached the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me now?\u201d Barry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live your life as a bug. You can go wherever you want or do whatever you please. You are now free from any rules. If we see you though, we\u2019ll treat you like a bug.\u201d May said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. He was nothing to them now. In the past, he had seen his family kill bugs without a second thought. His mother would use all of her strength and his father would use them for experiments. His sister was the worst though. She loved to torture and kill them in different ways. She even had some framed on her wall. The thought of being part of her collection forever was enough to make Barry tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this to me! I\u2019ll never survive!\u201d He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that\u2019s not true. That collar is very powerful. If you end up dying, you will respawn in a safe location. Let me give an example. If I were to kill you during one of my experiments, you would respawn on the table. Your old body would remain and I could do whatever I want to it but you would receive a brand new body complete with the collar. With it, you can respawn as many times as you need. The collar is also indestructible so you don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking.\u201d Austin explained. It made Barry feel a bit uneasy but a bit better as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen to me now though?\u201d Barry asked saddened. His father motion for the others to leave. Carmen gave an annoyed look but followed her mother out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ll help you by moving you somewhere. This way nobody will come after you right away. As it\u2019s your life, you get to choose. I can drop you off somewhere here or another location. Once I let you go though, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Austin said. Barry nodded, understanding his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy sighed and decided. He wanted to be taken to\u2026</span></div></div>",

He really was now just a bug for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father got to his room and dropped him onto the floor. He stared at him for a minute before leaving. Barry hesitated for a moment. He was truly alone now. He no longer had any family and his friends would never know what happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and sighed. He realized he had been too selfish and deserved this. He looked around at his room. Everything was giant compared to him. Barry thought about his situation. He had two ideas in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was to look for some food. He was getting pretty hungry and he would need to find some sort of nutrition. The other idea he had was to find some sort of base. If he was stuck like this for eternity, finding someplace he could constantly go back to sounded pretty nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of time\u2026</span></div></div>",

But Barry knew he couldn\u2019t give up now. Eventually, he made it to his destination - every appliance and cabinet seemed much larger than should be possible. The fridge, the pantry, the oven...everything was downright enormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry mulled over his options. He could try to open the massive refrigerator and look for a cool snack there, or maybe he could make his way through the pantry and hopefully find something salty to munch on...</span></div></div>",

This was the last time he would ever see it or consider it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant got in the car and moved Barry to the cup holder. The tiny human gave a sigh as they drove away. He stayed still, knowing it would be a bad idea to run. He wondered what his girlfriend and best friend would say when they found out he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Barry.\u201d His father suddenly said. The boy looked up, curiously. \u201cI wish there was another way but you gave us no choice. We had to do something to get things to change.\u201d He gave a sad look. Barry nodded. Thinking about it now, he really did deserve this, especially since they tried to give him once more chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you know the collar was my idea?\u201d His father asked. This caught the boy off guard. \u201cWe all agreed to shrink you down to a bug but I was the one who thought up the collar. Before I came up with it, your mother believed you wouldn\u2019t survive long and wanted you to rest peacefully. After you had shrunk, she was going to step on you and kill you painlessly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of his mother\u2019s large foot crashing down on him frightened Barry. However, he also felt a bit of joy. Even after how much trouble he had been, she was still trying to think of his feelings along with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen there\u2019s your sister. She claimed she wanted to turn you into her pet. She said she would put you in a cage and \u2018play\u2019 with you. I\u2019ll be honest though, I\u2019m sure both you and I can guess her true intentions.\u201d Barry nodded, not even wanting to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin and his bug son eventually reached the park. As the giant grabbed Barry, he knew this was the last time he was going to see him. The giant walked into the park. The boy could see people having fun around them, unaware of his presence. His father took him to a single tree surrounded by some flowers. He dropped the tiny boy next to it and gave him one last sad look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry watched as the giant turned away and left for good. He could see him get into his car and drive away. Now, he truly was alone. No more family or friends, his new life started here. The first thing he decided to do was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her whole body is incredibly strong to the point where she could break many durable things if she wanted to like silverware or toys. Though she has control over her strength, she\u2019s not afraid to use it if needed. She sees bugs as inferior and loves to toy with them before crushing them under her mighty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin (47): He is a hard working man with short dark hair and blue eyes. His normal job is a janitor at a high school. In his own time, he is an inventor. He has created a couple of things like a portal and a shrinking device.
