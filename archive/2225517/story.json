            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a Saturday afternoon and Barry was taking a nap. In his dream, he was in an ice cream world. He was currently relaxing on a nice scoop of strawberry ice cream. In real life, he didn\u2019t believe hard work wasn\u2019t needed for a good life and that belief was even more true in dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he relaxed, a shadow suddenly surrounded him. Confused, he opened his eyes to see what was blocking the sun. He flinched as he saw his sister towering over him. She was practically naked and had a sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up little brother! We have a special surprise for you.\u201d She said. Barry tried to ignore her only for the giantess to reach down and grab the scoop he was on. He became afraid as Carmen lifted him up to her face. She licked her lips sending chills down his spine. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much fun with you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarmen\u2026please!\u201d Barry pleaded. The giantess simply chuckled and opened her mouth. Barry could see her sharp teeth ready to tear him to pieces. Her slithery tongue danced a little in anticipation. Other than that, it was pitch black inside. \u201cCarmen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother\u2026it\u2019s time to wake up!\u201d She said louder. The boy wanted to cry as she flicked her hand causing him to go flying into the black void inside her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry woke up startled. The sun was shining and he could hear birds chirping. He looked to his left to see he was still in his bedroom. The boy sighed and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother! It\u2019s time to wake up!\u201d He heard his sister say. He opened his eyes and flinched as he saw Carmen sitting on top of his pelvis. She was only in a bikini but that was pretty normal when she wasn\u2019t planning on going out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what are you doing?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came to wake you up, we have a surprise for you downstairs.\u201d She said. Carmen suddenly got on her hands and knees, putting her face close to his. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I did, I seemed to have inserted myself into your dream. I bet it was interesting.\u201d She said licking her lips. Barry became afraid and started to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarmen please\u2026get off me.\u201d The girl sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh very well. Just hurry up and get downstairs already. We\u2019re all waiting for you.\u201d She said. She climbed off and left the room. Barry took a second to breathe, his nightmare still remained in his head. After he was calmed down a bit, he went downstairs to join the rest of his family.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Barry got downstairs, everyone was sitting on the couch. On the table in front of them was a nicely wrapped present with a red bow on top. His father motioned for him to sit across from them. He did as he was told keeping an eye on the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, it\u2019s time we had a talk. You can\u2019t keep living your life like this.\u201d His father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. If you continue down this path, you\u2019ll have nothing, nothing at all.\u201d His mom added. Barry looked down at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m alive now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d He asked. His father looked at the rest of his family before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was afraid you were going to say something like that. So, we\u2019ve come to a decision. We\u2019re going to give you a choice that will affect the rest of your life. Carmen, would you explain please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly. Barry, you are going to stop being such a parasite and do some actual work. You\u2019ll get a job and work towards a better future.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026what if I refuse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you refuse then open that box. It has everything you need to continue this worthless life plan. Believe me, I so hope you choose the box, it would make me so happy.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarry wait\u2026please, at least consider it before you choose.\u201d His mother pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry thought about it for a moment. He knew that he probably should be working harder and it would make everyone happy. However, the thought of them giving him something that would allow him an easy life made him excited. He grabbed the present and started to open it. His mother saddened while his sister smiled even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boy pulled out the contents, he became confused. It was a weird looking item. It\u2019s shape resembled a neck pillow but looked small enough to be a collar. The item was red with a shiny gem in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut it on.\u201d His father said. Barry nodded and did as he was told. As soon as he put it around his neck, the back closed up. The item felt soft and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly is this? And how will it help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis device is going to shrink you.\u201d His mom explained. Barry flinched. His nightmare suddenly came back into mind. \u201cIt\u2019ll shrink you down to the size of a bug. Since you\u2019re so persistent towards an easy life, we decided to grant your wish.\u201d Barry quickly grabbed it and tried to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Not like this!\u201d He yelled. Carmen startled to chuckle. Barry watched as his father pulled out a remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but you made this decision.\u201d He said. He pushed a button causing the gem to light up. Within a few moments, Barry blacked out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Barry woke up, his head was a little woozy. He felt a hard surface below him and the room was currently silent. When he was able to concentrate, he looked around. The first thing he noticed was that he was now completely naked except for the device around his neck. It still felt physically nice and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then noticed he was currently on the living room table. In front of him was his family, now supersized. He seemed to be handheld size now. They all simply stared stared him. Chills went down Barry\u2019s spine as he noticed Carmen\u2019s smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you going to do to me now?\u201d He asked. The giants stayed silent making Barry annoyed. \u201cHey! Answer me!\u201d He yelled. He started waving his arms making Carmen chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he\u2019s trying to tell us something.\u201d She said. Austin nodded and reached down by the couch. The giant pulled out another interesting device and set it in front of Barry. The device was a box with a small tube on Barry\u2019s side containing a microphone. On the other side was a much larger tube with a speaker at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Barry. Speak into that and we\u2019ll be able to hear you.\u201d Austin said. The boy nodded and approached the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me now?\u201d Barry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live your life as a bug. You can go wherever you want or do whatever you please. You are now free from any rules. If we see you though, we\u2019ll treat you like a bug.\u201d May said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. He was nothing to them now. In the past, he had seen his family kill bugs without a second thought. His mother would use all of her strength and his father would use them for experiments. His sister was the worst though. She loved to torture and kill them in different ways. She even had some framed on her wall. The thought of being part of her collection forever was enough to make Barry tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this to me! I\u2019ll never survive!\u201d He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that\u2019s not true. That collar is very powerful. If you end up dying, you will respawn in a safe location. Let me give an example. If I were to kill you during one of my experiments, you would respawn on the table. Your old body would remain and I could do whatever I want to it but you would receive a brand new body complete with the collar. With it, you can respawn as many times as you need. The collar is also indestructible so you don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking.\u201d Austin explained. It made Barry feel a bit uneasy but a bit better as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen to me now though?\u201d Barry asked saddened. His father motion for the others to leave. Carmen gave an annoyed look but followed her mother out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ll help you by moving you somewhere. This way nobody will come after you right away. As it\u2019s your life, you get to choose. I can drop you off somewhere here or another location. Once I let you go though, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Austin said. Barry nodded, understanding his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy sighed and decided. He wanted to be taken to\u2026</span></div></div>",

He really was now just a bug for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father got to his room and dropped him onto the floor. He stared at him for a minute before leaving. Barry hesitated for a moment. He was truly alone now. He no longer had any family and his friends would never know what happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and sighed. He realized he had been too selfish and deserved this. He looked around at his room. Everything was giant compared to him. Barry thought about his situation. He had two ideas in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was to look for some food. He was getting pretty hungry and he would need to find some sort of nutrition. The other idea he had was to find some sort of base. If he was stuck like this for eternity, finding someplace he could constantly go back to sounded pretty nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of time\u2026</span></div></div>",

But Barry knew he couldn\u2019t give up now. Eventually, he made it to his destination - every appliance and cabinet seemed much larger than should be possible. The fridge, the pantry, the oven...everything was downright enormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry mulled over his options.

This was the last time he would ever see it or consider it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant got in the car and moved Barry to the cup holder. The tiny human gave a sigh as they drove away. He stayed still, knowing it would be a bad idea to run. He wondered what his girlfriend and best friend would say when they found out he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Barry.\u201d His father suddenly said.

Thinking about it now, he really did deserve this, especially since they tried to give him once more chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you know the collar was my idea?\u201d His father asked. This caught the boy off guard. \u201cWe all agreed to shrink you down to a bug but I was the one who thought up the collar. Before I came up with it, your mother believed you wouldn\u2019t survive long and wanted you to rest peacefully. After you had shrunk, she was going to step on you and kill you painlessly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of his mother\u2019s large foot crashing down on him frightened Barry. However, he also felt a bit of joy. Even after how much trouble he had been, she was still trying to think of his feelings along with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen there\u2019s your sister. She claimed she wanted to turn you into her pet. She said she would put you in a cage and \u2018play\u2019 with you. I\u2019ll be honest though, I\u2019m sure both you and I can guess her true intentions.\u201d Barry nodded, not even wanting to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin and his bug son eventually reached the park. As the giant grabbed Barry, he knew this was the last time he was going to see him. The giant walked into the park. The boy could see people having fun around them, unaware of his presence. His father took him to a single tree surrounded by some flowers. He dropped the tiny boy next to it and gave him one last sad look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry watched as the giant turned away and left for good. He could see him get into his car and drive away. Now, he truly was alone. No more family or friends, his new life started here. The first thing he decided to do was\u2026</span></div></div>",

But this seems even more cruel; now there's virtually no way that he can escape this fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then that means he won't be getting out of his punishment,\" Austin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is just being a wimp,\" Carmen said. \"The Bug totally deserves this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy for you to say, Young Lady,\" May snapped. \"But how'd you like to be in the same situation? I tell you, it would be less cruel to have just squashed him and put an end to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How true, Madame,\" I finally said. My voice joining the conversation made three of them jump. They finally took notice of me standing in the dining room, in front of the table. I stood there leaning on my cane, wearing my usual attire a black blazer, a black trilby and glasses rimmed in crimson - blood red. A far cry from my true form, they could only behold me as a relatively young man - probably would look no older than the son and/or brother that they just abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" the father asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the Lawyer,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Whose Lawyer? We have our own Lawyer. And that doesn't explain why you're in our house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-no, you misunderstand me,\" I said. \"I'm not <i>a lawyer</i>...I'm <i>the lawyer</i>; as in, the one guy you don't want see representing your opponent.\" I raised a business card. \"S. Hark; Attorney at Law.\" I then threw the card toward them; before it reached the father, it immediately split in three, the other two going off toward his wife and daughter. They flew so fast that the cards actually flew like shurikens, and soon embedded themselves into the couch cushion near the mother's head, the leather strap of the daughter's purse, and the pole of the broom held by the father. The three of them were visibly startled by the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know what this,\" the father said. \"But the game is over; I'm calling the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine go ahead,\" I said as the man moved for his phone. \"In fact, you should save the time; they're right outside right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave the man pause. Now curious, he moved toward the window and looked out onto the street. He spotted two patrol cars sitting outside the house. The officers were clearly not just loitering about; they were standing outside their cars and their eyes were locked on the house; this was a bust - they were waiting for the go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those officers are with me,\" I told them. \"They're waiting for my signal to move in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" May asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a consulting detective working with the local police to solve strange and unusual cases,\" I told them pulling a badge from my jacket pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you were a lawyer,\" Carmen said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also a fully licensed Medical Physician; able to practice medicine anywhere in the country,\" I told them. None of this was conjecture but was instead only the tip of the ice-berg. Truth be told, I'm actually a member of an ancient race of immortal beings that once ruled this planet, causing chaos for mortal kind. That is until a human wizard decided he was going to teach us a lesson. I've been stuck in human form ever since; dying and reincarnating in new bodies, with only limited access to my magic, in an endless cycle for centuries...It leaves more than enough time to learn all of these things. I did gain a new perspective from my centuries imprisoned, and I decided to use my skills to help people instead; now a days I act as a kind of guardian angel, dishing out karmic justice to assholes who need to be taken down a peg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course right now I'm here in my capacity for law enforcement,\" I said. \"I mean really...did you honestly think you could make your teenage son disappear and get away with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes went wide at my statement as they realized how serious this situation was; the presence of the police outside and my rather unorthodox appearance in their dining room. The mother tried to compose herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disappear?\" she asked. \"There must be some mistake; our son Barry isn't missing - he's out looking for a job, right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that, May,\" I told her curtly. \"I doubt there's a job market for persons only an inch-tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women were now more visibly worried. But the father stepped away from the window. \"Alright, that's enough of this. I don't know what this is about, but until we speak to our Lawyer, we don't have to say anything to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Austin; you don't have to say anything; we already know the entire situation anyway,\" I told them. \"It's a really interesting story; frustrated Janitor/Inventor father is tired of his lazy-son; invents a shrinking/respawning collar, shrinks son to size of an insect, with intent to abandon him in such a state permanently, revoking his status as a human being, even threatening to do physical harm to said boy...all to teach him a lesson about being lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin's face was flush with fear but he was trying his best not to say anything incriminating. But all he could muster was a denial.<br>\r\n\"That's absurd; I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure ya do; next you'll be telling me that you didn't drive him out to the park and abandon him near a tree, did ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where you took him?\" Carmen asked \"You sneak, that's why I couldn't find him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen!\" her father yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounded like an admission to accessory to this crime,\" I said. \"Thank you Young Lady; you just gave yourself away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now hold-up,\" Carmen said. \"I had nothing to do with this; it was all him - it's like you said, he invented the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took our baby to the park?\" May asked - even with my immense cynicism, I couldn't deny she sounded sincere - \"How could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, you are still an accomplice to your father's crime, Miss; and right now those lists include conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to desert, possession of illegal, unregistered weapons-technology, and malicious intent to mutilate, and/or otherwise cause bodily harm, and murder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the charges listed, Carmen began to panic. \"Hey I'm not involved in any of that; if anyone here had any intent to harm the bug it's her!\" she said pointing at her mother, who now looked flustered and feigned surprise. \"She thought that it would be a simpler idea to just step on the little creep and squash him outright! I wouldn't have been as cruel; I was gonna keep the little guy as a pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human slavery; check,\" I said adding that to the list. It was clear at this point that Carmen realized nothing she was saying was helping her case, so I decided to move on. \"Although this filicidal intent is quite disturbing; what kind of a mother would want to kill her own son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it all wrong,\" she pleaded. \"It wasn't out of malice; it was to spare him from the fate that these two had decided for him. I was going to put him out of his misery. It was certainly less cruel to spare him from the fate he had decided for him!\" she yelled now fingering her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May! Shut up!\" Austin yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-no, actually...I quite agree with your wife I'm afraid,\" I said turning back to the father. \"You see, if not for this little detail, I'd have already had the cops in here, busting the lot of you and I'd already be on my way to rescue your son...But the secondary function of the collar; that is where I got mad...That's why I am taking this so personally you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is; shrinking your son against his will is one major violation of his rights; abandoning him to live as an insect where he'll inevitably be crushed in a world completely unawares and indifferent to him; that's murder...But what you did sir, is something else entirely; something worse. You thought you were showing your son mercy, with that collar? You think that the inability to die will make him a better survivor? You think that bringing him back after every horrific, mutilating death, will somehow be good for him? No...You didn't just murder your son; you condemned him to a living Hell. And for what?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm trying to teach my son a lesson about being lazy,\" Austin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, trying to teach him a lesson huh? Trying to convince him to make something of himself, right?\" I asked almost playfully - I tend to have a bit of a sadistic streak if you hadn't noticed. \"Tell me...why do you think he's so lazy in the first place? Did you ever teach him the importance of a good work ethic while growing up? Did you ever show him the benefits to be gained from working hard? Did you raise him to have the perspective that although working isn't easy, the satisfaction of a hard days work and productivity makes a man feel accomplished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin was somewhat stunned by these questions as he reconsidered Barry's childhood. He was now starting to realize that because he worked a lot and spent most of his free-time inventing new devices, he hadn't actually spent much time with his son. He had just assumed the kid would turn-out alright on his own. Now he was fully aware that he'd neglected his duties as a father. He was rather stumped for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought as much,\" I said. \"So you decided that instead of addressing the problem that YOU created and neglected to fix, you were gonna take the <i>easy</i> way out; which involves developing shrinking technology on-top of respawning technology, to teach him a life lesson. You literally decided to develop technology to break the laws of physics, in order to teach your son a lesson...Did you ever consider, I don't know...<i>patenting</i> that technology and selling it? Now don't get me wrong; shrinking-technology is a big no-no; you're already in big enough trouble with the government over that one...But the technology to save lives from certain death? That would be worth <i>billions</i>; your family would never want for anything again. It literally wouldn't matter if your son was lazy because he'd never have to work a day in his life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he'd still be the worthless bum that he is right now,\" Austin said. \"I needed to teach him a lesson about working hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you shrink him and tell him his life is now living like a bug?\" I asked. \"Tell me...What good is this lesson going to be if he's going to spend the rest of his life as a bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at me like he didn't understand the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that the point of teaching someone a lesson is that they can learn and apply what they learn later in life or the next time they're in the situation. What good will this lesson do your son if he'll never be able to apply what he has learned to a normal life?\" The two parents took on a look of realization as they figured out just how absurd their plan was - the daughter was largely indifferent to her brother's suffering. \"And you made your intentions quite clear when you said you'd treat him like a bug, up to and including the squashing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then closed the gap on the father, looking up into his face at a rather uncomfortable proximity, giving off the faintest unhinged look in my eye. He nervously leaned back but otherwise made no movement.<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine the nightmare that your son is currently living in?\" I asked him. \"You think this is the easy life for him - free from rules and restrictions that society imposes? All of the other bugs that you've marked him as...They are now gigantic predators who are much stronger and more numerous than him. Out there in the wild...he's good as a place for a wasp to lay its eggs, or for a spider to cocoon in its web. And that's only mentioning bugs and nothing else out there. And that's the kind of Hell your son is in...And the worst part is, it's never going to end. You think that being eaten by a giant spider is a horrible fate? Try going through it twice! It's bound to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell my words were having an effect on them - even the awful sister. The mother was on the verge of tears, and I was detecting a hint of shame from the father. I continued.<br>\r\n\"But you know the worst part of it all is? Even after all of that, the worst part is undoubtedly the heartbreak...when your son learned that his own parents - his family - didn't care about him. And that they willingly put him into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's his own fault,\" the father suddenly said, causing my satisfied grin to fade. \"We gave him a choice and he chose to continue to be lazy; he's got no one to blame for himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes went wide and a smile grew across my face; the fear in the father's eyes was a clear indication that my mood was now reaching a volatile state and that I was not to be trifled with. After centuries of existence, this mortal was dangerously testing my patience.<br>\r\n\"So...you wish to teach a lesson to your son - claiming it is for his own good - where he will undoubtedly be tortured in an endless cycle of painful death, and will be completely unable to learn anything from this lesson to improve his life for the better...And you say that he 'chose' this torturous path, when I know for a fact that he truly did not know what he was agreeing to.\"<br>\r\nThis was really becoming rather personal to me; and filling me with rage. I saw the parallels of what this mortal man had done, what he was trying to be.<br>\r\n\"Do you know who else did something like that and claimed impunity?\" I asked. \"Do you know what that makes you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man tried to answer, but I did not give him much of a chance. I had immediately moved my cane to my left hand, and immediately swung my right arm, striking the man hard in the jaw. The right hook was strong enough to send him flying back and falling to the floor.<br>\r\n\"-A Blasphemer,\" I answered. I'm not religious in any way; in fact the subject rather annoys me; but what I do hate is mortals who step out of line...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" \"Austin!\" the two women called immediately moving to his side, helping him up. He sat up and glared at me, wiping a stream of blood from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lawyer liked that,\" he spat at me with spite and vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he didn't,\" I told him curtly. \"I spoke with your attorney this morning before I came here; he knows <i>exactly</i> who I am and is rightly too afraid to go head to head with me in court. And after what I told him what I've got on you guys...he wants nothing to do with you. And I'm afraid you won't get much better from any other ambulance chaser in this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of this matters anyway; you've got nothing but a wild story,\" Austin said standing up. \"You've got no proof - you can' t prove any of this. It's your word against ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snapped my fingers and began to pout. \"Darn it, you're right,\" I said. I turned and approached the dining room table. I then began to casually lean against it. \"Without any evidence, I have no ability to prove any of this. Ugh...if only I had one single shred of evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a blue light appeared on the table off to my right - the two women were astounded by it, but the father looked mortified that this happened now. It was when the light faded down that the inch-tall Barry - still in the collar - appeared, lying on the table, struggling and trying desperately to stave off some kind of attacker.<br>\r\n\"No! Get off me! Get off of me!!!\" he yelled, horrified - I of course heard him without a need for a microphone, but the family was still deaf to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry?\" the mother asked approaching. I held up my cane to stave her off, preventing her from approaching. Before long, Barry calmed down and realized he was back in the house on the dining room table - he'd just respawned for the first time, meaning that he'd just experienced death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you feeling, Kid?\" I asked him. He flinched at realizing a stranger was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" he asked absentmindedly before remembering he was too small to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry kid, I can hear you,\" I said with a kind smile. \"So tell me, what was it that got you out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Squirrels,\" Barry said. \"...So many squirrels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, squirrels might look cute, but they are real assholes,\" I said now pulling a card from my coat and putting it on the table before him. \"And I'm your new best-friend; S. Hark, Attorney at Law - I'll be taking your case and representing you. You like this house? Once I get you emancipated, the three of them will be paying for it for the rest of their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna sue my parents?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sue them?\" I asked my sadistic look returning. \"That's literally the last thing I'm going to do them; it'll be a signal that I'm almost done with them.\" I turned back to the family. \"Your entire purpose of this punishment was because you feel your son was too lazy and didn't work hard...So you decide to give him the easy life by throwing him out with the bugs. Do you guys have any idea how hard his life would be at that size? Every moment would be a struggle for survival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least it would teach him how to work hard,\" Austin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what good would that do him?\" I asked. \"Besides, it's not like any one of you knows what hard work actually is; none of you have worked hard in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I resent that!\" Carmen shouted. \"I just so happen to be in college right now and I'm currently working my ass off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, I instead pulled a photograph of a young man - bespectacled and studious - from my pocket. Her eyes went wide seeing it. I addressed her parents. \"Do either of you know who this is?\" I asked. \"This is the young man your daughter is bribing to do all of her homework for her, while she spends her days down at the nail salon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fucking knew it!\" Barry shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told us you were working in the Registrars Office,\" Austin said. \"What else have you lied to us about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh are you making moral judgements against your daughter when you clearly didn't teach her anymore than you did your son?\" I asked. \"How about we expose some of the secrets in your closet?\"</span></div></div>",

It might be a modest job as a janitor but at least I earn my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except you don't, Pops...not really,\" I told him. \"I did some research on you before I came here; I spoke to your employers. You do your job alright; but you do it poorly. When asked to describe your work performance, the terms 'gross incompetence bordering on mental incapacity' was brought up more than once. They say you blunder even the slightest task and instead spend most of your shift daydreaming about the various inventions you tinker with.\" The father's face practically melted into a dejected sorrow as my scathing words cut through him. \"The truth is the only reason you haven't been fired and blacklisted from employment in this city, is because a certain someone has won good grace for you by passing some generous donations to the company's CEO.\" My eyes then narrowed in an accusatory glare at May - the Mother. \"On the rare occasions that she <i>isn't</i> in bed with the man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped and her husband's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n\"You're sleeping with my boss?!\" he yelled. \"And what does he mean about 'donations'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to come up with an excuse, but I was getting bored of this and wanted to move things along.<br>\r\n\"Oh come now; you invented shrinking technology and the IRL-Extra-Life System; you seriously cannot be this dumb,\" I said, getting the father's attention again. \"Your wife doesn't work...How could it be that you, your silver-haired wife, and two kids could possibly afford to live a house this nice on an incompetent Janitor's salary alone? Didn't you find it strange that despite your low income, your family always seemed to have money in an emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he talking about?\" Austin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back to the wife. \"May, how's that inheritance you're currently sitting on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inheritance?\" Carmen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh didn't she tell you? She came into some money some time ago when her Uncle passed away,\" I told them. \"She's been hiding the money in a secret account the entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us about this?\" Austin asked his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't take it too hard old, man,\" I said. \"I mean sure, it's easy to immediately assume that your wife thinks you're a simpleton who can't be trusted with money - I mean look what you did to your own son - but maybe you should just believe that she's just a greedy old bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait...does this mean we're rich?\" Carmen asked with a rather sycophantic smile forming on her face - as if she'd forgotten the literal shit her family was in at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're not rich - persay,\" May said. \"We're just slightly above being 'Well-Off'. I kept that money hidden for emergencies - like keeping the house. Its also how I've been indulging your father's inventing hobby. But it's also why we wanted Barry to get a job; to alleviate some of the financial burden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So at what point did you consider 'shrinking and crushing' a good alternative?\" I asked. \"Your wife has never worked a day in her life because she hasn't had to. Between the lot of you, you wouldn't know a hard day's work if it came around and bit you in the ass. And that's a hard day's work by societal standards; you were ready to force your son to brave the wilds of an ecosystem he was not suited at all to survive in; the likes of which would shock the lot of you. And yet you have the nerve to condemn your son to a shrunken Hell, while you watch from your glass house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry meanwhile had been watching and listening to all of this; focusing all his energy into it to block out the memory of the squirrels coming after him. Hearing how pathetic his parents and sister were, and were willing to treat him so shamefully, genuinely started to piss him off. He didn't know who this Lawyer kid was, but he was hoping he'd throw the book at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens next?\" he asked. \"Are they under arrest? Are they going to jail for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family flinched, knowing that the cops outside were waiting for the order to storm in and take them. But my next words surprised them even more.<br>\r\n\"No actually; at least, not quite,\" I said - much to Barry's surprise. \"You see - being as reputable as I am, I've been given a lot of leeway in handling this case.\" I reached into my coat and pulled out a sheet of paper. \"This is the warrant issued by Judge Cyris - good friend of mine, great colleague - that states that I am to put the three of you under house-arrest in any manner that I deem fit, until the day of the hearing. Effectively this is a 'I can do whatever I want to you people and get away with it' license.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put the paper back in my pocket. \"Now...you all did this to Barry to teach him a lesson, in a game that's completely rigged...Unfortunately for you, I also like to teach lessons. And I live by the philosophy 'What's Good for the Goose is Good for the Gander'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Austin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" I said taking out a radio from my pocket. \"Shark to Spotter, Shark to Spotter; come in Sargent - Operation: 'What Goes Around' is in effect; stand down and wait for further instructions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut the window, the cops got back into the cars and drove away. Barry's heart sank; for the first time all day he felt in-power and now his hope that his family would be punished was driving off. \"But why?\" he asked. \"Why did you send the cops off? Why aren't you taking them away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Kid; all in due time; the state can have your family after I am done with them,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you intend to do with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" I said waving my hand. Without warning three collars similar to Barry's appeared around his parents' and sister's necks. It was the first time Barry had seen my magic, and the situation was now dawning on the others; they were in deep shit now. Snapping my fingers, the remote appeared in my palm. Seeing it, the father's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't!\" he said stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's this <i>blue button</i> do?\" I asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? There's no blu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed the button, silencing the man immediately as the three of them began to convulse from an electric shock, released from the collar. The three of them collapsed to the floor. Barry was startled and immediately reached for his own collar, expecting pain at any minute. I looked over my shoulder at him.<br>\r\n\"Y'like this? It's a little addition I made myself. Don't worry, your collar doesn't have it; this isn't about you, Barry - it's about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" the father said as the three of them slowly recovered and began to stand-up again. I waited just long enough for them to get to their feet and for the father to make eye-contact with me. I pointed the remote and poised my thumb over a different button this time. \"Please, don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I told him - my voice was not my own, but was instead a perfect mimicry of his own. \"<i>But you made this decision.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed the button causing the gems on their collars to light up and within moments, all of them blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood proud and satisfied as I watched their bodies diminished and shrank out of their clothes; their collars remaining form-fitting and tight on them. Barry was awestruck at what he just saw. Less than a few hours after he watched his family shrink him and what was certain he'd never see any of them again, they were now being given the same fate he was. Part of him couldn't help but chuckle at the irony; finally it seemed like things were going his way. But he looked up at me bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what exactly are you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of me as five parts Guardian Angel and five parts trickster demon,\" I said. \"I stand up for people who can't stand up for themselves and I doll out karma to those who have been skirting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you choose to help me?\" he asked. There was a more personal reason, but the kid wasn't ready for that burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever read the Metamorphosis while in school?\" I asked. He swayed his head. \"It's a Russian story about a young hard-working man who literally works like a dog to support his unemployed and lazy parents and layabout sister. One day the universe decides that his life is so insignificant, that he turns into a gigantic bug...I hated the book; what really pissed me off is not the fact that the family gradually treated him like a bug, but more or less the attitude they displayed. The father and mother are perfectly able to work, and yet they treat him being transformed into a bug as a huge imposition on them because he's no longer bringing in money for them to use. They treat him like he did this on purpose...They eventually neglect him and physically abuse him, until he decides to starve himself to death to relieve them of the burden of taking care of him...Those parents were monsters; and at the end of the book, they immediately start thinking of ways to exploit their daughter for money. I've hated that book ever since it came out...And that's why I had to come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you see me reflected in that story?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes; the details are a bit flubbed here or there...But I can't stand the idea of family members doing this to each other; and especially for such stupid reasons. What really gets me is that your dad thinks that he was somehow being kind to you - giving you a chance as it were - without realizing the Hell he was sentencing to you to. The road to Hell is often paved with good intentions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed that the shrinking was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how he likes a sampling of his own medicine...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a few minutes after the shrinking took full effect and the family began to stir. It began with the father, rubbing his eyes, adjusting to the light after seeing the bright flash. Before long, his hand brushed past the collar and he remembered what happened. Soon he noticed his wife and daughter trembling nearby, just as naked and collared as he was. He quickly went to embrace his wife. It was a moment before they realized the smooth surface they were on was not the floor and was instead the dining room table - I moved them up there while they were still passed out. Before long, they spotted Barry also standing there with his arms crossed. He gave a rather casual salute to his father when the man spotted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long their eyes wandered up the monolithic structure that was looming over them nearby; me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on and speak; I can hear ya,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?!\" the father screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karma...that's what I've done,\" I said. \"I figured that you lot would appreciate the opportunity to practice what you preach. Wouldn't want to be hypocrites now, would we? You guys get the same deal Barry does - one-inch-tall, bug status...infinite respawns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay this cannot be happening right now!\" Carmen began to complain. \"I am supposed to be at the salon getting my nails done! And then I'm supposed to meet Jack later; we have a date planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI narrowed my eyes at her. \"Young Lady...You don't really seem to comprehend where you stand right now. <i>Bugs</i> don't go to the Nail Salon; only <i>People</i> do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT a Bug!\" she fumed. \"You fix me right now! You can do what you want with them, but get me back to my normal size right now! I don't want to be a Bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should've thought of that <i>before</i> you ever thought about squashing your brother or keeping him as a pet,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Car,\" Barry chimed in using his nickname for her. \"How could any of you think that? Normal people don't even consider any of this as an option!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way,\" I said. \"You better start thinking about what you've done, because odds are you're never gonna see the inside of a nail salon again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Carmen to shut-up but the father soon chimed in - the wife was still too terrified to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a minute!\" he said. \"You said that lessons don't work unless you can apply what you've learned. You have to be fair; you can't leave us like this, you've got to give us a chance to get out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Pops,\" I told him. \"In fact I have every intention of giving you a chance to return to your normal lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them seemed relieved to hear that, only for their hope to melt away with what I said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I never said it was going to be easy.\" I stood up and walked away from the table. \"If you guys wanna be People again - and not bugs - you're gonna have to earn your humanity back.\" I walked through the kitchen all the way to the living room on the other side of the house. Snapping my fingers, an antique grandfather clock appeared up against the furthest wall of the house; to a normal sized human, it would only be a few yards away from their location - barely a moment's walk. But being the size of bugs, the clock was miles away. I looked back at them and raised the remote. I reached up and placed it on the crown of the clock, knowing that to them, the tower was a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my keen eyes, I could see the disheartened looks on their faces as I slowly walked back. By now I was striking a match to light my tobacco pipe. I came back to the table, releasing a puff of smoke. It turned out to not be as suave as I thought, as it set off the smoke alarms in the house. With a wave of my hand they were silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now,\" I said. \"Judging by the looks on your faces, you're starting to understand what's going on here. I'd say that you guys have no time to spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Austin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your house as a <i>serious</i> pest problem,\" I said rather darkly. \"I've made an appointment with some Exterminators; they're gonna come in here and bug-bomb the place. They're scheduled to arrive in three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes got wide with horror when I said that. The sight pleased me the slightest bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have until then to reach the remote and get yourselves back to normal; if you don't, you'll be choking on death in a poisonous fog like the other bugs...And then the collars will bring you back, where you'll go right back to choking. You'll be suffocating on gas for hours, painfully without end with no relief. And who knows; I might decide to deactivate the collars at that point, and let death be for keeps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother shrieked at that. Carmen looked pale. And Austin was silently cursing himself that the situation had gotten so out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think about escaping; I mean, you could try to leave the house and wait for the fumes to dissipate...But if you do, then you forfeit the game; and I'll leave you all like that, outside, on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family was terrified, but Barry had been enjoying most of what I'd been saying. Each new rule I added to them made him more and more excited at seeing the terror on their faces. I had observed it but said nothing. It was a bit painful when I had to tell him next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said; your deal is the same as Barry's; you get seen you'll get treated like a bug...or worse. So if I were you, I'd stay out of sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't think about doing anything horrible to them,\" Barry said. \"I just want a good view to watch them scramble about trying to get up that clock. Because now you guys are gonna know how I felt; to know that the people who are supposed to care about you literally couldn't care less! You saw you as nothing but a bug. I won't hurt any of you...but I'm not gonna lie and say I won't enjoy watching you guys struggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my lip. \"Yeah...about that, Barry,\" I said rubbing the back of my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" he asked looking at me. He saw the conflicted look on my face and his smile faded. \"You <i>can't</i> be serious...You came here to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hear me out, Barry,\" Hark said. \"You got to trust me when I say that this will help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said this wasn't about me!\" he shouted. \"Now you're gonna leave me here like this; you're gonna do what they did? How is that supposed to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they did an incredible amount of damage, Barry,\" I said sternly. \"I need to know if what they broke is beyond repair; and I need you to figure that out for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? What are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out, all in due time,\" I said. \"And yes, this isn't about you - it's about them; that's why you're gonna be exempt from certain rules. Like for example, whether your family makes it to the remote or not, you're getting back to normal size. And if you guys do lose - your collar will provide you with a breathing apparatus so you'll survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't like this,\" Barry said. His knees looked weak; for the first time today he'd felt like he was on-top only to have it ripped away from him. I could tell he was reminiscing about the squirrels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Kid; your family can't do this without you. And no offense, but you could really learn something about hard-work from this experience; nothing like an adventure to make a man out of ya. And at the end of it all, <i>their</i> fate will be in <i>your</i> hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you'll find out,\" I then turned to leave. I could feel the disappointed look on the kids face as he realized I was in-fact leaving him there. I turned back. \"I'll come back for you all in three days; and I'll be watching your progress very closely. If I were you I'd get a move-on; the clock is ticking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I turned toward the door and vanished. So now the four - now miniaturized - family was left all alone in their house; a once familiar habitat had become an open wilderness. Some slowly turned to look at the clock I left and stared in hopeless longing at how they were going to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what will they do first?</span></div></div>",

How is any of this my fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hadn't been such a lazy bum, none of this would've ever happened,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're seriously blaming me?\" he asked. \"And you guys think that shrinking me and treating me like a bug had nothing to do with it? Why didn't you guys talk to me first? Why do you have to jump to the extreme?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh like you'd have listened to us,\" Austin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see; talk to your difficult son about getting a job or murder; I can see the flow of logic - really well thought out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stuff it, Barry; I bet you did all of this on purpose - yeah, you set us up and had your friend there do this to us,\" Carmen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend? I didn't even meet that guy until a few minutes ago; and in case you hadn't noticed, despite him saying he'd help me, he left me stuck here with you lot. And hell, I'm not even sure how he did all of this stuff, considering that you built the damn collar in the first place,\" Barry said pointing to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how did he do all of that?\" Austin asked. \"I only ever made one collar and it was a prototype; he must've been watching us for some time, but why would he have done that if he didn't know what we were going to do? There's no way he could've known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he did say that making the collar means hot-water from the government,\" Carmen said. \"Maybe that's why they were watching us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't see what the big deal is; I had no idea the prototype was even going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute - stop,\" Barry said now reaching for his collar. \"Are you telling me that you had me put on this damn thing not knowing if it was going to work or not?! What the hell is the matter with you?! This thing could've killed me - and NOT brought me back! What were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We clearly didn't care, Twerp!\" Carmen snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen, will you please shut-up!\" Austin shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys...You hate me so much that you don't care if I live or die, or even if you kill me,\" Barry said now fighting back tears. \"You guys are monsters - and yet, I'm stuck with you. I've done nothing wrong and yet you all want to kill me! Well I'm not gonna forget this. You heard what he said - your fate is in my hands - and three-days or no three-days, when all of this is over, I'm gonna sue you guys into oblivion - you're gonna spend life in prison for this, and I'm gonna spit every time someone mentions your names to me! Until then, I hope you guys end-up pinned to a trifold on some kids' science-project!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry turned away in a huff. The father and sister sat in silence - it was unclear if they were stunned by his words or too overwhelmed by the situation to retort. Barry meanwhile had made it to the edge of the table and was now looking for a way down; if he was stuck like this for three days, he wasn't going to spend it up here. During the moment of silence, the three of them finally heard weeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally noticed May - the mother - curled up and crying into her knees. She had been so shocked by everything that happened that she stayed quiet and trembled to herself. But seeing her family - her husband and children not only shrunk but fighting with each other like this - the gravity of the situation hit her, and she began to weep. Ordinarily she'd be embarrassed that her family was arguing like this - even in private - but now, at the size of bugs, she realized how insignificant they were. They could be in a public place right now, and no one would hear them arguing; no one would even know they were there. She never felt so small and helpless in her life, and she was certain they were stuck like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" she wept. \"This is the end; we're doomed...We brought this on ourselves for what we did. How could we agree to do something so horrible and expect to go unpunished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut-up, May,\" Austin said. \"I don't want to hear from you; not since I found out that you've been sleeping with my boss - or the hiding money from me. Well I hope you've enjoyed it, because once we're divorced, half of it is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you wake-up, Austin,\" she finally snapped. \"Do you not realize where we are right now? In three days, the exterminators will arrive, and we're all going to die. And you heard what that Hark-guy was saying about the collars; after that rant, there's no way he'd let us respawn after that...We're going to die; and we deserve it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you-two deserve it - and especially the Piss-Ant over there,\" Carmen said pointing to Barry. \"But I can't die; I'm too pretty to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry listened to all of this madness and consternation coming from his former family. He began to realize just how vain and greedy they were; Carmen being only concerned about herself because of her looks and his father too distracted by divorcing his mom to even notice their situation. His mom seemed to be the only one to take it seriously, but she was a complete blubbering mess. Barry was beginning to realize what I had meant when I told him that his family needed him to do this with them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's not like he wanted to at all. His sister was a cunt and his dad was a monster. He couldn't help but sympathize with his mother, because out of all of them she seemed to be the most reluctant to go through with it. Hell in some sick way, she was the more merciful of the three of them. Not that he was ready to forgive anyone, but he realized that the longer they kept fighting, the more time they were wasting. He took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut-up! All of you!\" he shouted. Carmen and Austin were about to start snapping at him again, but he immediately shut them down. \"If you've got nothing constructive to say, you should save-it! Now listen to me; we are NOT going to die. Now I need all of you to calm down, and listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who put you in-charge, Twerp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry, the last thing we need is to hear from a screw-up like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>will</i> listen to what I have to say!\" Barry shouted with a force that actually scared the two of them; he'd always been such a timid and easy-going guy who rarely raised his voice. \"We are not going to die; I already tried dying earlier this morning; I've had my fill of it for a single lifetime. I have no intention of doing it again. And the thing about experiencing your own death, reshuffles your priorities a bit, with the memory burned into your brain as a cute, seemingly innocent rodent starts eyeing you up, assessing you, stalking you, before him and his buddies surround you and rip you to shreds...Well...After experiencing that, you could literally be with your worst enemy and not wish that upon them. I don't want to die any more than you do, nor do I want to watch you die, regardless of how much you deserve it. So now, we're gonna stop wasting time. We've got three days to get to that clock and get back to normal before the Fumigators come. And it's a straight shot from here, to there; all we gotta do is get down to the floor, and get through the kitchen and the living room. So how about we stop sitting around, and get off this table?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them were a bit stunned by Barry's speech. May gradually got up off the ground, and the other two nodded.<br>\r\n\"So, how do you propose we get down from here? It's a bit of a long drop,\" Austin asked, with a judgemental tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry thought about it; what should've been 3 or 4 feet was more than a hundred foot drop for them. They could consider climbing down the legs of the table; they had intricate designs they could use for foot-holds. But the leg was metal and smooth, meaning they could easily slip. Barry looked around and saw the bowl of decorative wax fruit on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we might be the size of bugs, but that doesn't mean we have to act like them,\" Barry said approaching the bowl. \"Maybe there's something here we can use to get down. Maybe we can shimmy down the banana to the chair; or maybe even overturn the basket itself and use it to climb down to the chair. It can't be that heavy compared to us.\" Barry tried to move the basket, only to realize that with the weight of the fruit inside, at their current size they'd never be able to move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Genius,\" Carmen snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I'm trying to come up with a plan!\" Barry spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I've got an idea,\" Austin said approaching the wicker fruit-basket. \"Earlier before the kid left, he set off the smoke-detectors. Maybe we can start a fire to set them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What good would that do?\" Barry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If our neighbors hear them going off, and no one turns them off, they might come over to investigate - or complain. They'll come in and we can try to get their attention. If we succeed, we can get them to help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Hark said that we should avoid being seen; people will treat us like bugs if we do,\" May said very nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and keep in mind; what's an annoying sound at normal height is near unbearable for us. I don't know about you guys, but my head was splitting when he set them off,\" Barry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's our options,\" Austin said. \"We either find something in the basket we can use, or we set a fire using the wicker as firewood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which will the family go with?</span></div></div>",

For most of his life, he had let others do everything for him while he fooled around. He never got a job and did pretty bad in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many years of watching this, his family decided to give him the life he wanted by shrinking him down to the size of a bug.
