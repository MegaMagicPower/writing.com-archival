It's a little Loud\" a voice cried out from another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mom\" Arthur called out and turned the volume on the TV down, which alleviated the pain in your ears. Were it not for that pain you would've thought yourself dreaming and still in your bed. Since it was clear that wasn't the case, you decided to make your way toward Arthur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nheading toward a Giant probably isn't the best course of action, but at the moment you are out in the open. And vulnerable. The safest place is under the couch. Getting there took a bit longer than expected even though you ran most of the way. A reminder to how small you've become. But you finally managed to make it. Doubling over and gasping for breath you vow to spend some time each day getting your cardio up to par. In the time it took you to get there Arthur had gone from a sitting position to one of laying down. Just think of it, above your head was a colossus that may or may not have heard your squeaky cries. If you could get close enough there was a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, get close enough. Easier said than done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe with a Grappling hook and a good strong rope. And the upper body strength to get yourself up there. Maybe you could try to yell up to Arthur from the floor. You're closer now and the TV volume was lower, there might be a chance. You run to the other side of the couch to where you'd be closer to Arthur and step out from under it.  You couldn't see Arthur but you knew he was still there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You yell \"Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was immediate. Two socked feet swing out from above and touch down on the floor with an earth shaking THUD as Arthur sat up. The TV went mute. He heard you, or he heard something. With renewed hope you run toward his feet.  </span></div></div>",

You stop as you see the source of the ground shaking tremors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors were the result of thundering footfalls made by Arthur's mother, Jane. You had thought Arthur was the biggest thing you had ever seen, but he was dwarfed by his mother. You stare at her sneaker covered feet and look up, waaaaaaaay up to her face. What you could see of it. As she approached you saw less and less of it as her chest blocked it from your field of vision. You were so awestruck by the sight of this Goddess that you didn't realize you were in her direct path until it was almost too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run back the way you came just in time as a colossal foot came down where you'd been standing only a moment before. The combination of the displacement of air and the impact of foot on floor knocks you too the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to do some work on the computer. Could you keep the volume down on the TV? It won't take long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sweety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Jane turns and walks toward the computer. You watch here for a moment ,thinking. A responsible adult would be better to get help from, but then again Arthur was closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Arthur, he was still sitting up on the sofa and hadn't lay back down. If you could climb up onto his sock covered foot and held on you could ride the foot up to the sofa and just walk up to his face. Getting his mother's attention would not be as easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

You cute dimples and beautiful dark brown eyes!  You also soft skin! It was so comfortable when you picked me up earlier that I felt like I was in heaven (more like hell or rather purgatory)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...thank you...I think you are cut also!\", DW gasps out cutely as she slaps her hands on her thigh and sits up stiffly straight as she cutely stares down at you, but her actions scare the bejesus out of you as you nervously chuckle as the vibrations coursing throughout the be undulate you in the air a few times too many, which causes you too finally end up closer to her pink dress where as you can see her white stocking covered crotch, which gives you detailed outline of her forbidden fruit and the sight fuses you to her nervously gulp as well as curse yourself for the thoughts that are popping up in your mind. Luckily and also unluckily a draft of wind that carries a kraft cheese smell knocks you out of your stupor and thoughts. You glance around you and see that DW has shifted to sit Indian style with her stocking covered pale brown smooth soles behind you and the folds of her pink dress in front of you with an opening you were trying not to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you DW! You know what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", curiously asks DW as one of her hands snakes down for she can fondle your hair, which almost causes you to have a heart attack.

They pull on my hair and hog the slide and sandbox. They are disgusting! They dig in their nose and eat their boogers. They  stuff things in their pants! They burp and fart all the time! Hmph!\", exclaims DW cutely as she shifts a few times causing you to move ever closer to an area you should not and do not want to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe!

Thoughts keep flying through your mind as you wait and for some reason, the odor of DW's cheesy feet keep getting stronger as you hear a grating noise behind you, accompanied by the sound of cooing and sighing above you coming from DW. You muster up some courage and open your eyes as you turn to the source of the grating sound. You see DW's giant hand digging voraciously with her chipped pink polished fingernails through a large torn opening of her crepe pink colored stocking sole. You, as if you are in a trance stare at her fingernails that are vigorously scratching her tan smooth sole and turning it into wheat yellow from the pressure she is putting on it while she let's out sighs of moans and comfort behind you. Her foot odor is starting to bother you and stirs your nether regions a little as you force your gaze away from her tan creamy smooth sole to glance up at the white sleeve covered arm above you that is attached to the vigorously scratching hand, which makes you stand up to turn a full one hundred and eighty degrees around. You feel startled as soon as you turn around due to DW's big dark brown eyes bearing down on you while she is sporting a strange expression on her face, which gives you the creeps. In fact so much so, that you roughly fall backwards on your behind from her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...what is it, DW?

Why were your eyes closed just now?\"</span> said DW as you could swear you saw her eyes twinkle and grin branch out even further on her face, which was highly unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously gulp before you barely manage to stutter, \"Uhm...uhm...n...no particular reason! I was uhm...just thinking about something!\", then watch DW's eyebrows, that are almost overshadowed by her bang, wrinkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh, really?\"</span> said DW with raised eyebrows as you hear her fingernails still digging vigorously into her sole behind you, while the smell of her slightly cheesy foot odor lingers into the air as you nervously stare up at her weird expression and her muffled sighing moans of satisfying her itchy sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes!\" you exasperatedly say, when you finally managed to get it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh, that is not what I think...\"</span> said DW teasingly as you keep inwardly cringing from the grating sounds of DW scratching her sole behind you, while you try not to breathe through your nose because of her foot odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what makes you say that?\" you say as you shudder from her piercing gaze that is pressuring you so much, that you feel a little weak in the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh...no 'particular' reason. It's just, you did not close your eyes until I started reaching toward you...soooo, you are scared of me, aren't you?!!\"</span> said DW teasingly as her eyes twinkle as she is staring down at you and her other free hand is impatiently drumming the ground with her fingers awaiting a response, while her other hand is still vigorously scratching her sole behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...ye...no!

You stay seated on top of her pink comforter cover as she stays seated Indian style in a thinking pose for a while. It is so quiet that you can hear the noises that are in the house, kids playing outside, and especially her rhythmic rubbing of her sole behind you. You did not have to wait for long in the awkward silence because DW eventually broke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Do you uhm...well uhm like my feet?\"</span> hesitantly asked DW with a curious glint in her eyes as she brought both hands to slap them exasperatedly on her knees as she sat upright waiting for your answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do I like her feet? Of course not! I was just transfixed by her scratching her creamy tan smooth sole and distracted by  her lingering foot odor...oh, my god! What is wrong with me?!! Do I like her feet?!! I think I actually do!' you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have been having an inner dialogue for a while because when you glance up from your thoughts, you see DW mischievously looking down at you with her hands no longer on her knees, but pressed down on her pink dress completely hiding the view of her stocking clad crotch that you were trying not to look at earlier, while her entire upper body was upraised as if she was impatiently awaiting your answer, which makes you scared to answer her question because of what trouble it might bring upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DW, I...I really do not know! I was just watching you scratch your foot at first, then next thing I know, I was kind of in daze staring at your sole as it turned yellow from you putting pressure on it. I...I am sorry!\" you confusingly say while lowering your head, then bring your face back up to see DW's expression, which trembles for a bit, before a blossoming into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DW...why are you grinning?\" you nervously ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><br>\r\n\"No reason. I am just glad you kind of like my feet...you know, because Timmy and Tommy Tibble usually make fun of my friend Emily and my feet when we are outside at recess,  playing make believe, saying that we have stinky feet and they are too big for our height. Uhm...I guess my feet are kind of big though, well at least to you (she giggles). Do...do you think my feet are stinky?\"</span> said DW cutely while her body starts shifting as she stops sitting Indian style to hug her knees to her chest as she peers over them, while her transparent white pinkish stocking clad crotch is in full view, so much so, that you can see a huge cartoon feminine cow illustrated on her panties, which makes a weird uncomfortable feeling course throughout your body as you smell the slight fragrance of her womanly prepubescent scent wash over you. Your face blushes as you inwardly ask yourself what is wrong with you mentally and physically, after all this girl is at least a good six years younger than you. Luckily, you did not experience the strange feeling for long, because DW's massive feet thunder right in front of you, which knocks you into the air to back on her thick pink comforter cover via your stomach as you hear her muffling giggles at your embarrassing display that was entirely her fault while her slightly cheesy foot odor washes over you for being so close to her feet. You embarrassingly pick yourself up off of the ground as you hesitantly look up at her to see an amused expression etched on her face while she still trying to muffle her giggles, which makes you for whatever apparent reason stick your tongue out at her and she bursts out laughing in response as her feet drums the bed while she is hugging her knees to her stomach. For some reason, you start laughing with her also. You both gradually come to a stop, then you both make eye contact with each other while a fuzzy feeling that you never felt, arises in your heart and you beam a smile as she beams one also, then you inwardly shudder as you see her smile turn into a mischievous grin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Soooo....how does my big ole feet smell?</span>\" ask DW teasingly as she wiggles her torn pink clad stocking toes in front you, which causes more of her slight cheesy foot scent to wash over you due to her fanning her massive toes your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously gulp as you look at the torn pink clad stocking toes before you and look at her smooth creamy tan big toe that is poked out of one of the torn holes in her stockings. You can see a little bit of a brown gunk like substance under her chipped pink polished toenail from your position as she continuously wiggles her toes up and down to tease you while you feel an alarming stir from your nether regions as you remove your gaze from her wiggling big toe to blushingly gaze up at DW, who was still mischievously grinning while staring down at you amusingly with her big dark brown eyes. Just as you were about to say something to change the subject, she interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

Let me help you out...\"</span> said DW mischievously as she lifts her left foot up and brings it towards you as you can see her tan smooth creamy sole from the huge tear in her stocking, which you can see that her sole is still slightly yellowish from her scratching it so much earlier. You do not get to confusingly admire the view for too long because her stocking clad big toes that were hovering over you, lower on top of you, encasing you and your surroundings firmly into a stuffy darkness as DW assaults you with her big and soft toes. Her foot odor is quite strong, but it is at least manageable, yet also kind of intoxicating, which your nether region excitedly agrees to because it starts to awaken fast. You try to think about other things as her toes are fondling your body, while a little bit of her sweat creeps its way through her stocking toe flesh into your mouth, which you reluctantly swallow because her soft, yet firm toe flesh pressing down upon your mouth does not give you any reprieve to spit it out. You reluctantly swallow her foot sweat as a salty, yet sweet taste floods your taste buds, which weirdly stimulates your nether regions even more as you force yourself not to give in to your primitive desire that your body and mind are begging you to do. You let out a muffled scream as you tell DW to \"PLEASE STOP!\" as you try to get from under your captors warm, soft, smelly, and sweaty embrace while trying not to swallow any more of her foot sweat and breathe in anymore of her foot odor, but it is to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDW, who is blossoming a huge smile on her face from the wonderful feeling of you being under her big smelly toes. She does not know of the suffering you are going through or the stimulation she is giving you as she shifts her foot over you to position you under her still itchy sole to use your tiny little body for a much needed foot scratcher and massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Ehm...ehm...mmmm! You feel so good right there! Ehm! Yes! That is the right spot! Yes! Ehm! You are so 'goood' at this!\"</span> says DW while moaning as she lightly bites her lip that is quivering with satisfaction. She gazed at her left foot from above as she thoroughly kneads you into her pink comforter cover while she continuously lets out moans of satisfaction and uses her right foot to help massage the top of her left foot as she scoots back a little bit to get more comfortable so that she can relish your soothing feeling under her itchy sole better. She feels something wet gush under her sole as she is kneading you into the, but ignores it and assumes it is her itchy foot sweating (well she is partially right).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are reluctantly moaning out and gasping exhaustedly underneath DW's soft sweaty sole as she repeatedly assaults you with her foot. Even though, she is kneading you down firmly into the comforter, your body spazzes out violently as you come to several reluctant ejaculations in your shorts that spill through to make its way on DW's already sweaty sole. Tears stream out your eyes as she repeatedly kneads your body against her sole, unknowingly milking you for all your worth as you repeatedly and exhaustingly shudder. Her foot odor and sweat  permeate your senses and body as you can hear her moans of satisfaction, which only serves to jeer your reluctant body on and that is such weird thing that your body is still sexually attentive, even though you think you have already spasm all of your worth already. The friction from from her soft sole rubbing against you as her salty, yet sweet sweat continuously acts as a lubricant for your body. It seems like this is never going to end as tears steam out of your eyes to forever be lost in the depth of her overpowering sole while you keep asking yourself 'What is wrong with you?'. After all, you did not expect your first time to be taken by a little girl's giant foot. You were about to loose yourself into depression, but you notice DW's sweaty stocking sole ease up in pressure on you. You hurriedly open your eyes and see her yellowish red sole through her torn pink stocking slowly rising away from you. You hurriedly try to get yourself together for DW will not see your embarrassing appearance, however your startled to notice your shorts along with her nether region is rising with her sweaty sole. You feel emasculated as you hurriedly struggle to get yourself and your shorts unattached from DW's soft sweaty sole as you hear her purse her lips as if she is reluctant to part her sole with you. You finally succeed in getting unattached from her foot as you shudder while seeing her sweat glistening off of her creamy yellowish red sole, as well as your fluids rising away from you slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurriedly fix your clothes and face, then try to remove the tiny pink threads that came from her stocking out of your hair and off your body. You think your appearance is fine now, but you feel the cold uncomfortable feeling of the air making contact with DW's foot sweat that is covering you, which causes you  to have chill bumps. You confusingly watch her pink stocking clad foot gradually disappear from your vision as her toes mischievously wiggle over you. When her giant foot is completely removed from your vision, you see DW's legs spread widely apart on either side of you far in to the distance, which is very unladylike, especially her pink dress that is crumpled and allowing you a clear view of her white pinkish transparent stocking clad crotch, where as the feminine cartoon cow on her panties are staring at you. You nervously gulp as you look up and see DW enthusiastically smiling down at you while cutely biting her bottom lip with her hands laid on her outstretched legs and also her upper body is bending slightly towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Hey silly! That felt great, you know! You felt really good under there! Thank you for helping me scratch my big ole smelly foot!\" </span>said DW teasingly while giggling as you embarrassingly blush while avoiding eye contact with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome DW...\" you manage to say while wishing you had a hole to hide in somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Like, soooo...?\"</span> asked DW teasing while sporting a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inwardly shudder as you nervously ask, \"S...so what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Does my feet stink, stupid? Duh!\"</span> asked DW teasingly while you can hear the impatient drumming of her fingers in the distance as she awaits your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes? I think. Well, kind of., but honestly not unbearable though!\" you nervously say as you hear DW burst out in giggles above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"You are 'soooo' stupid and silly! Like, you were just underneath my sole, but you still are unsure how they smell! Come here, for I can see silly!\"</span> enthusiastically exclaimed DW as her right hand reached for you. Your vision turns dark as you are once again enveloped in DW's soft pudgy hand while your breathing becomes rugged do to the lack of air. Eventually her hand opens up to have you stare into DW's anthropomorphic nostrils, in which you see several crystalline deposits of mucus in the dark caverns. She sniffs several times and your body slightly raises up as you hold onto on of sorts pudgy folds on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"P-EWW! You stink! I cannot believe you could not make up your mind of how my feet smell! Hmmm...you must have been trying not to hurt my feelings, huh? It is alright for you tell me things, it's not like I am going to hurt you or anything!\"</span> exclaims DW while hurriedly bringing you away from her nostrils to eye level with her sparkling dark brown eyes and long eyelashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She is...beautiful...' you inwardly tell yourself as DW brings up her let hand to fondly rub your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DW, y...your foot odor is really not that bad to me...I guess because I like your feet!\" you say hurriedly as you turn slightly around in DW's cupped palm to avoid eye contact with her. You hear DW giggle at you while muttering <span class=\"chotpink\">\"you're so cute!\"</span> under her breath as she uses her left hand forefinger to forcefully turn you around to look up at her. You blush as you both make eye contact and you are surprised see DW blushing also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere turns quiet as you both just stare at each other for what seems like a long time, until you hear a loud older female voice yell out \"DW COME HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

You  fall down kind of roughly and a few areas felt like they were sprained. You ignored the pain to find your bearings to see that you are on a giant white marble slab surface and see what appears to be a sink in the distance. You keep panning your surroundings with your eyes and realize you are in a giant kitchen. You gulp and realize you feel like a sore thumb for some reason and try to shake off the feeling until you turn around to see the reason you feel this way. DW is just staring at you...like you are some type of exhibit at the fair, which causes you to gulp nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...why hello there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" , said DW cutely back, which makes you think about the absurdity of this moment. After all this young brat just kidnapped you and now she is pulling an innocent act...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My whole name is Dorothy White Read, but every one calls me DW for short!\", said DW cutely as she looks at you with a weird gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry?\" rudely interrupted DW. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you know what I actually surprisingly am! How did you know?\", you say in mock excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess because she was too young or just could not notice the sarcasm in your tone, since she responded back in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am smart aren't I! I could just tell. My mommy calls it a mother's instinct...\" said DW joyously, but you stop listening as you tried to comprehend what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brat just said she had a mother's instinct...does she know what that means?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...DW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" cutely responds DW as she brings her arms up to lay upon the counter to rest her head upon them as she creepily gazes down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what a mother's instinct is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course silly! It is when a mommy can tell stuff about her child!\" enthusiastically exclaimed DW, while goosebumps appear on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...DW, you know you have to have an actual child for you to actually have that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you are so silly and dumb! You are my child silly! I am your mommy!\" giggles DW as she raises on of her hands to nuzzle your head with her finger, which scares the bejesus out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis...this brat, just said that I was her child and she is my mommy! This cannot be happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DW...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCall me mommy!\" sternly said DW as she was still nuzzling your hair, which made you want to jolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Mommy....can call I call you something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" said DW as she cut off all the room for discussion and negotiations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as realize what your life has come to. Your reality just seems to get bleaker and bleaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDW eventually eases her hand off of you and goes off in the distance to get a bowl out of one of the lower shelves and a spoon out of the drawer, then she goes to the refrigerator to get something and put it into the bowl, while leaving you by your lonesome. You look behind you and glance upwards to see some giant plants sitting on the windowsill above the sink as you hear a microwave start up in the distance, while you try to get an estimate of your height. According to the facet, you should be about an inch or a little bit more. Thunderous booms start coming your way and you turn around to see DW coming towards you with a bowl with steam rising from it and a spoon inside, napkin, and what appears to be a cup of juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably she isn't so bad after all you think as a smile unnoticed to you appears on your face, while DW stares at you blushing a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDW mistakenly slams the items too hard on the counter and it causes you to stumble and fall as you hear her giggling at you, which makes you feel so embarrassed. You embarrassingly gaze up her pink dress and white undershirt to eventually cast your gaze upon her smiling face, which cause you to feel warmth inside for some strange reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDW abruptly brings her hand up to nuzzle your face with her finger as you embarrassingly actually enjoy the warmth of her touch. She stops as she brings her finger away from your face but unconsciously your face follows her finger, which causes her to giggle at you and your face to turn beet red as you cannot believe this just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, someone likes their mommy!\" coos DW and you thought you could not be embarrassed any further then how you feel now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDW grabs the spoon and brings it toward you, then you can see giant hot steaming butter beans on it. You are not that fond of butter beans, but you are hungry. The only problem is that it is too hot. You gaze helplessly up at DW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asks DW in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's uhm...kind of hot and rather a little too big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly me! Mommy forgot!\" exclaimed DW  as you watch her raise the spoon as she opened her mouth and actually dump the food inside, which causes you to cringe when you saw her pearly whites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, the spoon leaves her closed mouth empty as you see her vigorously chewing and appearing to slosh the captive butter beans around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cannot be doing what I think she is doing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as actually spits a light green mass covered with saliva onto the spoon and brings it toward you with dribble hanging off of the spoon, which causes you to nervously gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot eat this shit! It looks like some gerber baby food baptized in spit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! See! Mommy takes care of everything!\" exclaimed DW happily, she must be apparently proud at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the spoon and haphazardly step in a fallen pile of dribble and it cause you to cringe. You steel your nerves as you lap up the gruel with your hands to your mouth as you swallow trying not to think about the slimy disgusting taste. The bleakness of your reality seems to be getting worse and worse. You see DW gazing down at you while trying to sneak a few giggles, but it is not working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish a fourth of the spoon and feel rather full, then watch the frightening sight of DW finishing the rest and the remaining butter beans. She belches a cute burp and cheek flushes red once she is done, while a few strands of butter beans land down upon you from her burp as she embarrassingly says, \"Excuse me!\" She drinks  some of the juice and looks sheepishly down upon you, then back upon the cup of juice as an mischievous grin appears on her face. She sloshes the juice in her mouth, then spits it upon the spoon while impishly grinning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are thirsty aren't you...\" said DW mischievously as you see their is more of her spit mixed with the juice than the previous spoon of butter beans. You came to the realization that she is doing this on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...no thanks, I am quite full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, drink up! You need to wash the food down or you will get a tummy ache!\" Exclaimed DW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze up at her and look deep into her dark brown eyes and realize there is no room for discussion and reluctantly taste some of her spit, which developed the urge inside of you to vomit, but you held it in as you hear DW giggling so much that the spoon is shaking. After she had her fun of humiliating you, she threw all of the dishes in the sink and you could hear a loud clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins down at you evilly as her pudgy hand comes up to envelop you in darkness, then you can hear the familiar sound of her thunderous footfalls below!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is she taking you? </span></div></div>",

You shudder as you recall the horrible experience, while you cast your gaze over two other possible hiding places, but you realize that they are definitely not worth mentioning, since you would never hide there willingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the folly hiding places is a red velvety blanket covered pet's bed, which you assume belongs to a dog, since it has a bone chew toy laying beside it. The reason you would not hide there is because you have watched several Animal Planet's shows of The Dog Whisperer and you also have a pet dog yourself, so you know that dogs are naturally horny and possessive creatures; therefore you definitely do not want to be a part of it's attending of it's 'primitive needs'. The other possible hiding place, where you would not hide, is a foot away from you and even so, you can smell a cheesy Frito-Lay corn chips odor emanating from the giant pair of dirty banged up red converse shoes, which you saw the giant girl gruntingly take off her stinky feet. This is definitely a no-no for a hiding spot. You can actually see greenish transparent vapor arising from it! Therefore you basically are left with the end table, lamp, dresser, and entertainment center; since you cannot hide under the sofa because the giant smelly girl will be expecting you to be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other choices are not really a definitive solution either, since the hiding spots are all in the vicinity of the green striped sofa, so it is more than likely, that the surrounding area will be searched by her. With this in mind, it only leaves you with two choices: the television on top of a moss green entertainment center in the distance in front of the sofa and also, the dog's pet bed. It really is a no brainer on which decision to make now, but you still have two slight, but big problems. The first is that your adrenaline is starting to wear off, which is causing an exhausted feeling to start creeping up on you. The other reason is even more daft, which is the distance to the television. After all, to reach the television, you will have to run out in open view to cross the toffee brown rug that stretches out before you, which are followed by a vast expanse of wooden floor boards that branch out from underneath the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not have much of a choice, so you make a mad dash across the shaggy toffee brown rug as you feel vibrations undulating from the floor as someone is making their way to the assumed living room that you are in. Your heart thumps violently as your body starts sweating rapidly as you breathe erratically while  sprinting with all you might. Running through the shaggy carpet is affecting your running speed and also tiring you out faster as the the vibrations undulating through floor, pulsate more fiercely and faster as you hear voices that you try to ignore. You grimace as you realize that you only have covered about half of the distance, while still sprinting as fast as you possibly can. The voices sound like they have come even closer and you can no longer ignore them as you eye the entry way to the living room out of your peripheral vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Francine! I told you Arthur is not here! Why are you even over here anyway, huh?\"</span> said a young girl's voice agitatedly as she thundered into the entry way of the living room followed by a much larger girl, whom happened to be the girl who tried to kill you earlier. You pause where you are on the brown wooden floor boards as you silently pray they do not notice you. You glance at the television and entertainment center in front of you, then mock yourself mentally for not being faster because it is literally just about six inches in front of you. You want to just sprint the small distance, but you are spent, plus you do not want the two giant potential killers to notice you. You unconsciously brush your hand against your forehead to wipe the sweat off that is about to fall into your eyes as you turn your head to look back at the two giant girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you should stay calm, you cannot help but shudder when you see the cute shorter giant anthropomorphic looking girl, who's wearing cyan blue Mary Jane shoes with light pink stockings followed by a magenta pink dress with a white sleeve blouse underneath, while you can see the visage of her face is not entirely human due to her animalistic features; however, she was still entirely cute, especially with her light brown hair bob cut which highlighted the features of her face. The cute giant girl looked kind of pissed off, since she was hatefully staring at the older taller girl, whom you assumed is named Francine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"I told you, I was going to just wait until he comes back, DW. Plus, it's not like I am bothering or breaking anything! You should be glad I came over or you would not know that you even have a bug in your house!</span>\" snapped Francine at the shorter girl, whom you assumed to be named DW. As soon as Francine started her rant, you turned to look at her as your body unconsciously shuddered as you gazed upon a giant pair of splotched green and brown socked feet, which were suppose to be white. Your eyes remained on her dirty socked feet for a while, then you removed your gaze to see her faded blue jeans that has a few small tears along with grass and dirt stains strewn throughout it followed by a giant dirty red sweater, which you can tell that she is not wearing an undershirt from the way it is tightly hugging her surprisingly lovely body. You snap your mind out of your wandering perverse thoughts about the girl that tried 'kill' you figure as she snappily referred to you in her last sentence. You nervously gulp as you look upon her cute face to see her monkey anthropomorphic facial features, which surprised you, but for some reason she was attractive to you. Just when you were asking yourself what was wrong with you, DW angrily stomped her foot, which caused your body to loose its sense of balance as you fell forward trying to catch yourself, while DW started ranting again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I should be glad! You probably brought the stupid icky bug here! Then again, it probably is not a bug and you are just using this as ploy for you can stay over because you invited yourself in unannounced! And you wonder why my brother avoids you!\"</span> spitefully said DW as she stomped her way over to the sofa as you tried to make yourself inconspicuous as possible. You watched as Francine and DW searched by the sofa while you cringed at the thought of if you had remained hidden there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

Are these your shoes!\"</span> exclaimed DW as she dramatically coughed while covering her nose and made the expression as if she was about to vomit as she held the shoe to make sure the icky bug was not hiding by it. Francine embarrassingly put down the sofa pillow she was checking behind as she meekly uttered the word <span class=\"cplum\">\"Yes!\"</span>.  Francine face, especially around her cheeks turned a vibrant red color because of how embarrassed she was as you surprisingly felt sorry for the smelly giant girl that sounded remotely like a hardcore stalker from DW's account of her. Francine seems like a basic tomboy girl who lacks hygiene care. She reminds you of your tomboy friend at home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh, my God! Francine this STINKS!\"</span> exclaimed DW as she dropped the shoe as she broke into a coughing fit and fell backwards to thunderously fall on her behind, which scared the bejesus out of you. Francine looked liked she was so embarrassed that she was about to cry. You were trying to feel bad for the smelly stalker girl, after all, she did try to kill you. She wasn't so bad though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Ugh! Francine! Like wow! These shoes really stink! The icky bug probably came to our house to get away from you! Like eww! No wonder my mom said that you always have to wear your shoes at our house! Why did you even take them off?!!\"</span> exclaimed DW while shaking her finger at Francine and stomping her foot a few times to help vent out her frustration. Francine's face looked so distraught that it was heartbreaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell is wrong with me?!! I am actually feeling sorry for the girl who tried to kill me!' you thought, but DW luckily helped break your inner dialogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"I did not mean to take them off! Honest! I was just trying to get comfortable...I'm sorry! It is a bad habit...and plus, it's not like I hurt anything! And the smell is probably not even that bad!\" </span>exclaimed Francine embarrassingly apologetically at first, then angrily fumed the last part as she put her hands on her hips and furiously stared down at DW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Not that bad! You have got to be kidding! They smell worst than my dad's cheese and garlic souffl\u00e9! Ugh! My nose feels like it is clogged up!\"</span> exclaimed DW up at Francine, who was standing over her while her face kept transitioning from embarrassed to furious. You could not help, but think DW is a mean brat as you watched Francine as she shuffled her feet while staring down at DW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Why are you looking at me like that? Huh? Are you mad or something? No one asked your smelly self to come over here! You can't get mad at me for telling you the truth!\"</span> exclaimed DW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"I already said I am sorry! You do not have to rub it in, okay! I get that my feet stink! You do not have to be so mean about it!\" </span>exclaimed Francine as she furiously stomped her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Me mean! What are you a little kid! You are older than me, yet acting like a baby! You know my mother has told you several times before, not to take your shoes off at our house! So don't go acting all brand new! You know you stink and you obviously don't care about it, so why should I be nice about it! In fact, leave and take your smelly shoes with you!\"</span> exclaimed DW as she lifted herself up off the ground and crinkled her nose as she scowled at Francine, then angrily thundered her way out of the room as Francine just stood there in a lost daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as your gaze left Francine to focus on the entertainment center in front of you. Your body was feeling remotely tired, but you have gained a little energy back due to the previous scene. You quickly make your way under entertainment center while hearing sniffling. You peeked out from behind the entertainment center to see Francine grudgingly and violently try to put her smelly red converse on as she furiously wiped her eyes with her sleeve. You heard her mutter something under her breath about Arthur, DW, and someone you assumed to be named Buster as you watched her continue struggle to put her shoes on. Her teary face made you feel somewhat sad, along with her attempts of furiously putting her shoe on, while you did not notice that you unconsciously exited your hiding place and was approaching the giant girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally realized, you were not that far from her. You nervously gulped as you tried to stay upright on the vibrating ground as Francine continued to struggle to put her shoes on. You could see pieces of dirt, grass, and bits of sock thread land here and there as you tried to avoid. Luckily she did not notice that you were right below her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to back away slowly to go back and hide for you could wait to contact an adult, but life does not always quite work as planned as you heard Francine angrily grunt and saw her red converse shoe come flying your way. You hit the ground as you curled yourself up in a ball because it was impossible to run, so you might as well fruitlessly protect yourself. Luckily the shoe thundered behind you as you were launched into the air a few times due the floor undulating. When you finally got your bearings, you realized it was quiet...in fact, too remotely quiet. You felt chill bumps appear all over your body as your heartbeat sped up as you slowly looked up to see Francine big dark brown teary eyes staring down at you. You weakly laughed as you waved up at the giant girl, which she surprisingly waved back. Her face changed several times as you studiously watched her while you tried to decide whether or not you should make a break for it, however, your body was quickly enclosed into a dark, soft, and kind of damp place as you heard a few grunts from Francine. You would shiver in fear, but you were to cramped to move as your breathing became rather rough. You listened to a door slam along with the sounds of kids playing and cars, while you tried to get a rough idea of where you are and where are you going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you going?</b></span></div></div>",

It must be intelligent. She thought about taking it to The Brain, but no. No one must know of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the apartment, she forced herself to be as calm as possible and causally walked inside. She checked her front door. It was locked. Upon unlocking it she looked about. No one was home. Francine breathed a sigh of relief and headed for her bedroom. She closed the door behind her, then slowly opened her fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinding light was the first thing to greet you. Then, as your eyes adjust, you find yourself staring into Francine's face. Her mouth hung open slightly as she looks at you, bathing you in hot humid breath. She's so close that you can't help but gaze up into her mouth, taking note of the interior and the tunnel beyond. You gulp as you realize just how easy she could do it if she wanted to. Through the lips over the Gums, look out stomach here you come. You also notice the beads of sweat on her face and her damp hair. It had been a rough trip for you, but you had no idea she had been running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine took out the magnifying glass from the desk and examined the creature more closely. Though the physical appearance was like nothing she'd seen before, the clothing it wore was unmistakable. She placed the magnifying glass back in the drawer and watched the creature stand up in her clammy palm. She wondered what it must think of her. Then DW's cruel words came back to haunt her and she though how badly she must smell to this creature.  But she saw the path in front of her clearly now.  Francine looked about and found a drinking glass. After placing the creature inside it, and confident that it couldn't get away, she gathered her clean clothes and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her leave through the glass and reluctantly sit down. There was no way to climb glass walls so there was little else to do but wait until Francine came back.  Your thoughts turn dark as you wonder what she had planned for you. </span></div></div>",

Your eyes dart back and forth across the wide expansion of toffee brown rug that stretches out before you, while you can see wooden floor boards coming out beneath it in the distance. You are torn about where you should hide as you glance over the green striped sofa behind you, light brown end table beside the sofa, the television on top of a moss green entertainment center in the distance which is showing soccer at the moment, the floor lamp on the left side of the sofa, or the maroon brown chest behind the sofa that you were able to see when you were hiding under the sofa dodging the giant girl's hand while she was trying to grab you with her chipped paint fingernails that were a little dirty. You shudder as you recall the horrible experience. There remains two last hiding spots, but they are really not worth mentioning since you would definitely not hide there willingly. One is a red velvety blanket covered pet's bed, which you assume it to belong to a dog since it has a bone chew toy beside it. The reason you would not hide there is because you have watched animal planet's show The Dog Whisperer and you have a few pet dogs yourself, so you know that dogs are natural horny and possessive creatures; therefore you definitely do not want to be a part of it's primitive needs. The other hiding spot where you would not hide is a foot away from you and even so, you can smell a cheesy Frito-Lay corn chips smell emanating from the giant pair of dirty banged up red converse shoes which you saw the giant girl take off. That is definitely a no-no for a hiding spot. You can actually see vapor arising from it! Therefore you basically are left with the end table, lamp, dresser, and entertainment center; since you cannot hide under the sofa because that giant smelly girl will be expecting you to be there. Unfortunately it seems like you will not get that chance to come to a decision on where to hide because you hear thunderous footsteps accompanied by voices  in the distance quickly coming into the living room you assume to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder and realize your adrenaline has worn off, so now you feel like a spent engine as you watch a giant pair of speckled green and brown suppose to be white socked feet and a giant pair of white sketchers with a cerulean blue bottom. Of course the pair of dirty and most likely smelly socks belong to the giant girl that just tried to kill you. The giant girl is wearing faded blue jeans that has a few small tears along with grass and dirt stains strewn throughout it followed by a giant dirty red sweater, which you can see that she is not wearing an undershirt as you see her enthusiastically conversing with a giant even bigger than her beside her, which causes you to nervously gulp. You swallow as you gaze at the the unknown bigger giant, who has on white sketchers with a cerulean blue bottom, faded blue creased jeans that has obviously been ironed, a pink cardigan cashmere sweater, a white dress shirt, and a watch with a dark maroon brown band on her left wrist. Her clothes are hugging her womanly figure dearly as it highlights her curves. You nervously swallow once again as you see the giant peeved mature beautiful face from where you are standing as both of the giants thunderously walk towards you. You weakly fall down behind one of the legs of the end table hoping and praying that you do not get found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Read, I swear I saw a weird bug in here!\" said the giant girl that almost killed you as her pungent foot odor starts to spread throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francine! You know this is not funny, right? You, Buster, and Muffy were just here yesterday and saw my husband and I thoroughly cleaning because my mother-in-law is coming over this weekend to stay with Arthur and DW all next week for my husband and I can go to that baking competition...anyway, I did not see a bug nor any dust while I was cleaning up! The only reason I even bothered to look over anything is because of my mother-in-law's mouth...\" said Mrs. Read in a peeved tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honest Mrs. Read, I saw some weird looking bug!\" exclaimed Francine as her footsteps became more thunderous and was obviously affecting you as you tried to keep your bearings while she walked to the side of the sofa where the end table is and also your hiding spot. You watch her dirty smelly speckled green and brown suppose to be white socked foot tap impatiently as her eyes pan the floor in front of the sofa for you, while you try to subtly cough as you almost suffocate from her cheesy Frito-Lay corn chips foot odor. You can see Mrs. Read in the distance looking under the dresser and etc. trying to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francine, I do not see not a 'thing!'\" said Mrs. Read in a clearly upset tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Read...I really thought I saw one, honest! I am sorry! I know you were packing...\" said Francine in a depressed tone, but was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Look Francine you are a tomgirl, like really! You are scared to pick up a bug! Look...I know you like Arthur...\" said Mrs. Read in a exasperated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I\" stammered Francine as her stinky feet shuffled in front of you as you saw dirt and torn bits of grass fly everwhere while you cringed and Mrs. Read approached her to hold her by her shoulders, then firmly look her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Francine, you do not get a boy to like you by hounding him all the time and bullying him. Arthur tells me all the time about how you bully and tease him. You are just going to push him away from you and create a barrier between you both. He is a boy remember, so he cannot tell that you are doing because you like him. Try to ease up, okay.\" said Mrs. Read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! He is such a wuss though and every time I try to ask him to hang out, he avoids the question or brings Buster or Brain along! I do try! Pro...probably, it is just not meant to be.\" said Francine emotionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francine, you have long way to go in life. You are going to meet new boys and you both are only in middle school. You have plenty of time to develop a relationship. Do not try to rush things, okay Francine?\" said Mrs. Read as rustles the hair on Francine's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" said Francine greatly lacking enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Francine!\" exclaims Mrs. Read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Read?\" asked Francine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you not to take your shoes off when you come over my house! I just picked up this rug from dry cleaning this morning! Now, I am going to have to take it back and clean up the house again! I get on you about it literally every time you come over here! If you do it again, you can forget about getting invited or just plainly coming over ever again! Do you understand?!!\" exclaimed Mrs. Read as her bountiful bosom heaved up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes! I am so sorry Mrs. Read! It is a habit! I did not mean to!\" meekly said Francine as her brown skin on her face surprisingly flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, as long as you understand! Anyway, Arthur sneaked out the back and ran to the Sugar Bowl with Pal, Brain, and Buster. If you hurry, you can probably catch him...\" said Mrs, Read as Francine dropped down on the floor to hurriedly put her banged up smelly red converse shoes on, which came as a horror to you, because when she dropped on the ground, she stretched out her hand to catch herself and unfortunately you had stepped out of your hiding place to ogle Mrs. Read's hour glass figure, so Francine's hand was about to land on top of you. You watch as her chipped painted finger nails come your way as you try to think of a way out of this situation. Your mind is stumped, but luckily when Francine puts her hand down, you slip into the gap between two of her fingers. You breathe out a sigh in relief as you try to calm your racing heart. You glance at her curled brown fingers and see see dirt under her fingernails that causes you to cringe. You almost lose it and tell yourself that there is 'no place like home',  but the reality of your situation does not allow reprieve for self pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run toward and grab on to the sleeve of her red sweater as she takes her hand back to tie her shoes. Warm vapor arises from it as the foot odor stings your eyes and causes them to water, while you hold on to her sleeve for your dear life. Gladly and luckily, she does not take too long to tie her shoes. You watch as she hops off of the floor as you feel air pressure bearing down on you while yours ears ring. You feel light headed and slightly delirious. For some reason you seem to be approaching Mrs. Read, while being enveloped in a wonderful fragrance. You see you are approaching something that is fuzzy pink, then silky white and afterwards, it all of sudden becomes dark and the fragrance is stronger. You feel the surface you are laying on shift while you try to get your consciousness back to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to and realize...</span></div></div>",

Your face pales as your nose picks up a horrendous odor that almost causes you to vomit. You reluctantly gaze towards the dirty banged up giant red converse shoes beside you where the horrendous odor is emanating from and cringe at the thought of if you had fallen inside of them. Just the thought of it almost happening, sends goosebumps throughout your body. You hurriedly back away from the dirty giant red converse shoes until you can no longer smell any trace of their cheesy horrible odor. You back up so much that you find yourself no longer on the wooden floor, but now on a red velvety surface. You bend down to touch it and realize that it is kind of soft. It seems to be cloth that is pretty long. Your eyes follow the  cloth  to see it ripple, then branch upswards. You are curious to find out where it leads, so you climb it as you start smelling this weird familiar smell.  You climb to the top to see the red velvety cloth start to branch out into a sort of bed surface with serveral types of yellowish golden strands of something. You keep thinking about what could it be, when voices interrupt you from your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO!  PAL AND I ARE BACK FROM OUR WALK! IS ANYBODY HOME!\" yells a young masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur, why in the hell are you yelling like some type of mad man!\" exclaimed the previous giant girl that tried to kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francine, why in the world are you inside of my house!\" exclaims Arthur in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had come over to hang out and knocked on the door, but no one answered, so I twisted the doorknob and surprisingly it was unlocked...I invited myself in.\" said Francine uncaringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did what!

Jesus! You wine like a freaking girl, you wuss!\" said Francine in a clearly annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...fine! What did you want to hangout and do?\" said Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I almost forgot! Muffy, Buster, and everyone are waiting for us at the Sugar Bowl! I almost forgot I told everyone that I was coming to get you! Jeez! I almost forgot! Your wussing reminded me!\" says Francine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not 'wussing'! Anyway let me unhook Pal and give him some water and a treat, since he was such a good boy today!\" says Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let me go get my shoes!\" gleefully says Francine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoes?!! Francine I know you did not take your smelly dirty shoes off and walk around on my mother's just dry cleaned carpet! I should have known! I knew I smelled a strong weird cheese smell when I came in! I thought it just another one of my Dad's dishes that went wrong!\" angrily exclaims Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Arthur! The smell isn't even that bad, you little wuss! You did not even know until I said I was going to get my shoes anyway! Be glad I have socks on! You say anything else about my 'dirty' 'smelly' feet or shoes, I will give you an up upfront personal interview with them!\" angrily exclaims Francine, while you can swear you hear Arthur nervously gulp from all way in the living room you appear to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long pause, where you could hear a few barks, but Arthur was silent. You could not help  but think what a pussy he is. Like an uninvited person unannounced comes inside your home without your permission, then kicks her banged up shoes off to make herself more comfortable. On top of that, walks around in her filthy dirty supposed to be white crew socks that look like it is speckled green with splotches of brown strewn throughout, then she has the audacity to actually threaten you for complaining about the absurdity and wrongs of her actions! Arthur is a wimp! Nah, fuck that! He is bitch made individual. The ridiculous thing is that he is still quiet as you hear and see  Francine's giant smelly socked feet thunder into the living room as she stops to bend down and roughly put her shoes on as you can see sock lint, strands of grass, and dirt fly up in the air even from where you are standing. Francine's pungent cheesy foot odor spreads throughout the room due to her fondling with her dirty red banged up converse shoes. You cringe from the odor and actually feel bad for the ground she walks on. She thunders back off once she has wrestled her shoes back on and you give a silent Amen for the absence of her company. You hear the door shut, followed by the sound of some happy barking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Arthur and Francine must have left. Arthur still not say anything even when he left...what should I do now?' you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long to think of answer when you hear thunderous foot falls coming towards you, which causes you turn around to see the source and you see this yellowish golden haired puppy running towards you, whom you assumed is named pal. You cringe as you come to a sudden realization...red velvety cloth, strands of yellowish golden things, and white fluffy walls surrounding it. This...no, you are in a freaking pet's bed! Not just any pet's bed, but a pet that has just taken a long walk and most likely is coming to lay down to take a nap in it's bed! You fearfully shake as see the yellowish golden monstrosity of a puppy come your way, then stops once it's right above you. You hesitantly gaze up its body and your eyes stops to rest upon a yellowish golden mound, that has a round pink mound with a split in the middle staring down, then dryly joke to yourself that you cannot call Pal it anymore because 'it' is clearly a 'he'...you feel humiliated at your reality as of this moment. You fearfully watch as Pal sniffs while walking around in a circle in his bed. You cringe as you see his glossy pink nose start sniffing towards, then stops to land right in front of you. You feel the urge to get up and run as fast as you can, when you see two large beady black eyes curiously gazing down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...good boy! You are pal, right! You are a big puppy!\" you nervously exclaim as Pal sniff you a feels times and lightly growls as he brings his golden yellowish fur covered paw towards you. You scream as Pal's pink paw pads go behind you and send you flying forward. You shake fearfully once you get your bearings and look above you. You see Pal's yellowish golden fur covered penis coming down to lay upon you. You hurriedly get up to run away, but sadly you were not fast enough and find yourself facing a red velvety surface with a plushy sensation thoroughly pressing down on you back. You keep telling yourself this is not happening as a few tears escape from your eyes to bury themselves in the soft red velvety cloth as Pal's dog smell of piss, musk, and sweat flood your senses. You can feel Pal's sweat making its way through your clothes as he makes his self comfortable above you. You shuffle and wiggle around to get from under Pal's penis, but stop as soon as you hear a light growling moan, which causes you to dramatically shudder. You feel the pressure removed from your back and you turn around to see Pal's slightly twitching manhood being raised up in the air. You are so happy! You hurriedly brush the yellowish golden pet dander off of you, then get up to get the hell away from this giant puppy, but stop once you see Pal's giant black beady eyes staring at you and you could swear that he is sporting a grin. You cringe, then hurriedly start running. Pal growls at you and you fearfully stop. Pal brings his paw toward you to lightly push you back to the place you were hurriedly trying to get a way from as you watch his masculine mushroom  horror come towards you. You get wedged between his yellowish fur covered skin and his twitching pink cock head that seems to be twitching even more due to you unwillingly stimulating it. You can feel Pal shifting back and forth above you as you are being forced to serve as help for his stimulation. To your horror the friction that is becoming slightly faster as time progresses, causes an unwilling participant to awaken in your pants. Tears start continuously streaming out of your eyes as strands of pet dander and particles of dirt make their way into your mouth. You get wedged further behind Pal's pale pink cock head as you hear him growlingly moaning and slightly whimpering in the distance. You fall out of your entrapment between Pal's pale pink cock head and this yellowish golden fur covered foreskin to look above you to see an almost three inch pale pink cock above you that is dribbling cum down upon you. You are too scared and frankly out of energy due your previous fruitless struggling of trying not to get up close and personal with Pal, so you listen to him loudly growlingly moan ecstasy as he brings his throbbing three inch monstrosity to forcefully slam into you and hard press you down into the red velvety cloth as your face ends up directly in front of the opening of the pre-cum oozing slit monstrosity mushroom cock head. You can feel the pulsing throbbing sensations of Pal's damp pale pink musty cock as he thrust it down into your face as you feel that you can no longer sink into the  red velvety cloth surface. Pal's cock seems to be heating up warmer and warmer as more ooey gooey cum starts sputtering all over your face, then you hear a moaning howl, that almost made you think Pal was a wolf as you feel and see a forceful spurt of creamy white yellowish thick liquid drench you and you haphazardly breathe a little of it in along with a masculine sexual musty smell as Pal grinds all of his worth on you, then pants tirelessly while giving out a few light moans. You watch as the pale pink mass, his cock, deflate as he raises his self in the air as you feel lifeless. Pal's black beady eyes appear before you as he tiredly enthusiastically barks at you then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are visibly shaken by the massive proportions of your environment and the thunderous footsteps that are coming toward you only serve to make it worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This cannot be happening...' you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as a pair of giant brown Mary Jane shoes appear in the distance  thundering towards you. You feel startled as your gaze follows above the wearer's shoes to see knee high white laced socks hugging a lovely calf muscle connected to daffodil yellow shapely thick thighs that were almost hidden by a fluffy purple dress. You  rub your eyes in disbelief, then continue to feast your eyes on the shocking display of mass proportions before you. Your gaze wanders over the purple fluffy dress to the exquisite lavender belt that separates the giant's budding torso from her indeed shapely bottom. The long sleeve white silk like blouse she is wearing beneath the dress, highlights her daffodil yellow colored creamy skin. Your gaze reaches further up and you see a sight that mentally shakes you to your core. The giant female you are gazing at is not...well completed human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This...she...no! This reality cannot be real!' you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks like a mixture between a human and a monkey...but strangely she is still beautiful to you. You feel a warm fuzzy feeling arise in your chest and you ask yourself what is wrong with you as your gaze wanders over her two luscious auburn colored braids that are dangling by swinging back and forth as she is approaching your way with a lavender hand purse underneath her armpit. By the giant girl's budding figure and beautiful young face, you estimate she is in the early teen range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should you I to her for help? She seems to be the prissy type..' you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has finally made it right in front you. You are so close to her, that you can smell the slight odor, as well as feel the heat that are emanating from her giant Mary Jane clad foot in front you. You nervously back away as you see her shuffle her giant feet and grunt something about Francine telling her to do something and why Francine could not do it herself. You definitely do not want to get the giant prissy girl's attention now...she is freaking talking to herself. That is a no go, but you do need someone to help you. You stare at her feet as they shuffle and threw the notion of receiving help completely out of your mind. Unfortunately, it seems like you do not have a choice because you see the area you are in is suddenly enshrouded in a dark shadow. You hurriedly glance up as you start to run and see a giant lavender colored hand purse with a silver clamp and buckle on it falling towards you. You breathe a sigh in relief because you thought it was the giant prissy girl reaching for you. You continue running, but it is to no avail. The lavender hand purse thunders directly in front you as the resulting impact blows you a little backward into the open floor and knocks you flat on your feet to the ground. You feel a splitting headache as you hear the giant girl mutter the word 'damn' above you, which is definitely not appropriate vocabulary for someone of her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the lavender hand purse a little distance away in front of you and see that it was knocked open slightly ajar while it was laying on its side. You see the giant girl's white knee high sock covered legs start to fold towards you and fear of being found makes it's way into your heart because you are in an open visible area on the floor. You steel your nerves as you hurriedly pick yourself off of the ground and make a mad dash towards the opening of the lavender hand purse, then hurl yourself inside. When you make it inside and settle down, fatigue hits you from your adrenaline wearing off. You glance around your barely lit surroundings and see various forms of make up utensils with the word maybelline illustrated on them, such as mascara, lip gloss, eye liner, powder, etc. You also see the iPhone 8 cellphone that was featured on Apple's website and also has not even been released out to the public yet. Your suspicions of her being a spoiled prissy rich kid has been confirmed. You hate people like her. Just because they have money, they think they can get and do anything they want. Anger starts to arise in your heart as you start to think about how in the world you are going to get yourself out of this situation as you feel the purse being picked up, while followed by the giant girl's mutterings. You try to avoid all of the make up utensils, pack of stride gum, and the huge iPhone that are constantly being shook around due to her moving. You cannot help but mutter a few curses under your breath because you already were fatigued, yet now you have to play dodgeball. You look around for any possible way to get you out of this situation and you see a slit for a pocket in the upper left hand side of the purse. You muster up some energy as you make your way to it, but have a little trouble climbing the silk wall, however you eventually make it as you hear voices...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muffy, did you see Arthur and Buster?\" said a female voice as you assume the giant girl's purse you are in name to be Muffy, since she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mrs. Read. They were not upstairs in Arthur's room nor downstairs in the living room when I checked.\" said Muffy in a respectful tone, even though you could detect annoyance in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Muffy, they must have escaped out the back door again. They probably ran over to the Sugar Bowl or the arcade. I am sorry about that Muffy. You know boys will be boys.\" said Mrs. Read in an apologetic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Mrs. Read! Francine had called me and asked me to pick up Arthur and drop him off at the soccer field. She said that she had already called and 'told' him to come. Anyway, I was in the neighborhood picking up up something for my Daddy. I will see you later Mrs. Read\" said Muffy in a polite tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Muffy, goodbye. Make sure you tell your parents I said hello.\" said Mrs. Read as you hear Muffy break her polite tone and mumble a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear door shut and another one opens as you hear an older male voice say, \"Why good evening Miss Muffy. How was the visit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was highly dull and a remotely unpleasant environment, Bailey. Anyway, take me home Bailey.\" said Muffy in a brat like tone, which made you recall your experience with rich spoiled kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Miss Muffy. I will get you there in an expeditious manner.\" said Bailey in a cultured tone as the purse you are in jerks for some reason and you end up flying out of the side pocket of the purse onto a capsule of lip gloss. Light floods the inside of the purse as you see a pair of big lovely dark brown eyes searching the purse. You hurriedly hide behind the giant capsule of lip gloss, but unfortunately for you, that is what she was searching for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs the lip gloss that you were dumbly hanging on to. You watch surroundings grow further and further away from you as you are being lifted up higher and higher, which was not all together a pleasant experience. Muffy raises the lip gloss and you to face level with her as you her other free hand creep its way towards you. You cringe as your feet dangle listlessly above your impending doom below. You watch her pink blush manicured fingernail fingers unscrew the cap of the lip gloss as the skin from beneath her fingers turn slightly red from her opening it. You swing yourself into the unscrewed cap, but Muffy unknowingly raises it higher and you end up bouncing off of it onto the opening of the lip gloss. You try to move around and realize that you are a little stuck while inwardly shuddering as you and the lip gloss approach Muffy's awaiting luscious thick lips that are puckering. You can smell her warm spearmint breath as you helplessly stare at her tantalizing buttermilk tan lips. You start to energetically wiggle and move around, but you do not seem to be making that much progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only have one hope remaining, but you are too scared and frankly really do not want to go through with it because you are scared of what will happen afterwards if you succeed in getting her attention. Your fingernails dig into the flesh of your palms as you gaze up at Muffy's beautiful face and across her daffodil yellow creamy skin, then you sigh out and feel as if though you are throwing yourself into a frying pan as you scream \"STOP! PLEASE HELP! I AM YOUR LIP GLOSS!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Muffy hears you, what happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You cringe as your gaze follows the wearer's silhouette to see a relaxed fit pair of cobalt blue pants, followed by a tucked in long sleeve sea-green shirt with a  cerise red collar, and what appears to be a young humanoid white rabbit boy face. You gawk at absurdity of what you are seeing for such a long time, that you do not snap out of your stupor until the giant white rabbit boy is almost upon you. You look around for somewhere to hide, but you are out in the open on a green striped sofa with magazines scattered throughout with illustrations that depicts a muscle bound humanoid white rabbit that looks as if he was masquerading as Super Man. The title on a few of the magazines reads Bionic Bunny. Bionic! LoL, more like bunnicula gone bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour inside jokes stop when you see the giant white rabbit boy's white furry hand reaching for the magazine that you are standing on. You shudder, while you gaze up at him, then realize he has not even noticed you. You pause on your realization as he is sliding the magazine that you are laying on in the direction of the other ones for he can straighten them up. You watch as he picks up the magazines that are now stacked with you on top of the pile, which rests face up abreast to his stomach. You are slightly shaken by this white humanoid rabbit's smell of food, musk, and something else, but you cannot tell what it is that washes over you for being close to his body. The magazines tilt down as the giant boy is walking, which makes you roll down the magazines to eventually find yourself to rest against his now you know pudgy stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is so freaking embarrassing and humiliating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant humanoid white rabbit boy stomach growls and you can feel the vibrations from laying against his stomach, which causes you to cringe. Luckily, you get withdrawn from your beginning inner thoughts by hearing him start a conversation with someone.  You can barely make out to see because of the tilted magazines, however you manage and see a golden rustic yellow sweater with a silky white dress shirt underneath and followed by a humanoid boy creature  that you cannot tell what he is. You see he is holding a red leash in his hand that is attached to a golden yellow giant puppy that has seemed to have  caught a whiff of something, but does not pursue whatever it is as you see his owner bend over to unleash him, then the giant golden yellow puppy just scampers off. You wonder about what should you do as you listen in onto the two giant boys conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buster, you are seriously not going to go to the Sugar Bowl to hang out with Brain and everyone? Are you alright? You, purposefully missing food doesn't sound right...\" said the unknown humanoid boy in a worried tone as he raised himself back off of the ground after he unhooked his puppy's leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's just I have to do that essay over from last week's homework because Mr. Ratburn asked me to. Plus, you know Prunella is going to be there and she...you know kind of gives me the goose bumps.\" said Buster as he shifted the magazine while he was talking and you end up holding onto his sea-green shirt for your dear life as you nervously glance down at your doom below. Luckily, Buster folded his shirt because you can ease yourself up into the fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known you were avoiding Prunella. You know Buster, if you keep avoiding her, she is going to hound you worse at school.\" teases the unknown humanoid boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh! Whatever Arthur! Like you do not avoid Francine!\" guiltily said Buster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh! That does not even count! Francine is taller and stronger than me, plus she always smells like sweat and musk! You know my torment is way worse than yours! I mean it's not like Prunella is going to put you in a headlock to force you to smell her armpit or when you comment on her smell, force you to smell her feet!\" exasperatedly said Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...now that you mention it, you are way more screwed than me. I do not even know why you would go anywhere where she's at!\" said Buster, which causes both of them to burst out laughing as Buster's shirt shakes much not to your delight. You listen to them start to talk about him borrowing the Bionic Bunny comics to use for his essay, then tell Arthur bye as he leaves to head back home. The ride in the fold of his shirt is bumpy and his annoying smell just makes it worse. You can hear kids laughing, cars passing by, dogs barking, and other things while Buster is passing them. You wish you can see them, but the fold instructs your vision of the outside world. You hear Buster grunt as the sound of jingling makes it way to your ear. You assume Buster is opening his door and your assumption was confirmed when you hear Buster yell \"MOM, ARE YOU HOME!\", which was not of benefit to your poor ears. No one answered him however, and you hear him let out a lonely sigh. You can feel him walking for a bit, then are hit with a blast of light as you end up flying towards a dirty brown carpet with cheese puffs, clothes, change, etc. strewn about. You scream as your body wrestles against the air pressure and your senses get overwhelmed with the smell of spoiled or stale food, musk, cheese, and a sort of masculine smell. You try to brace yourself, but it does little to help. You fall brokenly onto a pile of dirty clothes as your head spins a little and you see a giant red shoe fly over you followed by a pale white glistening sweaty and meaty wrinkled sole that is accompanied with an overpowering eye-tearing corn chip smell. You watch his giant smelly foot fall awkwardly to the side. It looks like Buster almost lost his balance taking his shoe off. You would laugh, but he slams his other banged up red converse clad foot directly in front of you, which scares the bejesus out of you and you let out a short scream. You frighteningly watch him bring his free sweaty smelly foot in the distance to press down onto the white part on the top of his red converse shoe. You can see his meaty toe flesh turn yellow from the pressure he is putting on it and also the blackish brown toe gunk between his toes. You shudder as you gaze at his yellowish brown sort of long toenails that has a plethora of stuff beneath it. You can feel vomit, bile, or whatever arise in your throat and you struggle for all your worth to hold it down because you feel once you start, you will not be able to stop. You hear him grunt several times as the giant banged up red converse clad foot wiggles in front of you, along with his glistening free pale white foot with matted white fur on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurriedly retreat behind some dirty pajamas and cheese puffs to get away from his flailing stinky feet. He finally wrestles his shoe off and you can swear you see droplets of sweat rain down from the giant airborne red converse shoe. You turn around to see his yellowish red pale white meaty sole that is still slightly raised from him kicking his shoe off, then watch as it thunders to the ground sending a wave of stench and compressed air. Tears fall from your eyes as you realize the reality of your life and bite into the stale cheese puff beside you to relieve your aching stomach while Buster thunders around the room. You watch him pick a half-eaten slice of pepperoni pizza off of the floor to eat it, then let out a loud belch once he finished. This kid disgusts you... you watch as he sits at a desk in the distance and flip through some magazines as he grabs a pen to chew on the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on the smelly brown carpet thinking about what you should do. What should you do?<br>\r\n- [ ] <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
