He lives in a nice apartment in Celadon City, has a nice job managing the Game Corner, and never has to want for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what he'd tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he wouldn't be entirely wrong. He's lived an average life, nothing special, but one blessed enough to shape him into a total sweetheart. Maybe even a pushover. Maybe. Just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what he <i>wouldn't</i> tell you is that he feels lonely. Not due to a lack of friends or acquaintances, he has those. Joel's problem is that he's never found that special someone. And at his age, he finds that incredibly embarrassing. So much so that he avoids the topic altogether. He hasn't quite given up the search, but he's not exactly trying all that hard either. Chalk it up to a lack of confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe self-consciousness issues don't end there. He's gotten a tad pudgy in recent years, and he doesn't find it flattering. Much like his (lack of) love life troubles, he completely avoids the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Oh, here's a couple of fun facts: Those who know him consider Joel to be rather \"dad-like\", both in terms of appearance and demeanor. A few even think his lips look awfully kissable...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then. What's in store for him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Low chatter filled the studio apartment. From the kitchen island where a certain Arcanine loomed, Joel laid out an assortment of snacks on the counter. Pizza logs with clumps of pepperoni dribbling out the side. Sushi rolls cut into bite-sized circles. Cocktail shrimp, like little pink thumbs, plunged headfirst into a crimson sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel himself watched as his friends gathered around the television. Small crowds on the screen cheered as the parade of lovingly crafted pokemon floats maneuvered through the familiar main-street haunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey Joe, there\u2019s Game Corner,\u201d Harry, a wild Rattata said. He bounced on the balls of his feet as the camera panned past the carefully painted art of trading card characters in festive gear and the words Happy New Year in jubilant red font.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel chuckled. He took a beer from the fridge and popped the top with a bottle opener. The bottle cap bounced on the counter as he reached and dropped it into the trash can. His sinuses were rosy with firewater -- the flames in the core of his stomach lapped up the fuel. He stifled a soft burp, then nursed his drink once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOutdid yourself on the glasswork, kid\u201d Joel tilted his bottle at the Rattata. The purple shift manager bowed for the guests, and they applauded generously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Umbreon in a white turtleneck sweater sat on a loveseat outside of the partygoers, one leg crossed over the other. Joel took a plate of appetizers and made his way for the Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet,\u201d Joel presented the umberon a beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umberon waved them off politely, then smiled, \u201cI\u2019m content here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel pulled up a stool and sat beside the Umbreon, the arcanine pushed his glasses up his muzzle and cleared his throat. \u201cUh, thanks for showing up. I know you\u2019re not one for parties and all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to apologize,\u201d the Umbreon, one Edgar Gray, uncrossed his legs and he sat with his hands in his lap. \u201cThough I\u2019m not looking forward to driving home with all the drunkards that\u2019s for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got space here; I wouldn\u2019t let you do that if you\u2019re uncomfortable,\u201d Joel snorted, and he took a mouthful of beer, \u201cyou\u2019re always welcome, you know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t changed a bit, have you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel beamed, and he looked over at the television. The countdown was on the horizon. A massive papier-mache Master Ball dangled above town square with spotlights on its blue \u2018chassis.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do love how a smaller city celebrates; it feels more...personal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCeladon\u2019s a nice place once you get over the fact that the locals all know each other, took me years to start fitting in,\u201d Joel picked his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe television lit up with activity as the others in the room began to countdown. Five, four, three, two, one-- Happy New Year!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master ball popped open as a deluge of confetti scattered the ground like technicolor snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel hooted and chuckled, \u201chappy new year Ed.\u201d He playfully punched the Umbreon's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar wore his ever polite smile and rubbed his sore arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rattata hooped and hollered as a firework finale illuminated the windows. All eyes were peeled from the TV to watch the garden of sound and light erupt in the sky. The colors flashed in familiar shapes -- the head of Rayquaza in brilliant celadon green peppered with oxidized crimsons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour young protege is certainly an excitable one,\u201d Edgar mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho? Harry?\u201d Joel took his glasses from his muzzle and cleaned them on his shirt. \u201cAh, he\u2019s a good kid. Don\u2019t let him anywhere near sugar though. I think his parents deprived him of it when he was younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the party died down, Harry moved through the bright crowded room and found Joel beside Edgar. Harry raised his bottle and smiled -- his buck teeth glistened in the fluorescent light. \u201cHappy New Year Bossman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry you know you can just call me Joe outside of work, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it, boss,\u201d Harry slumped in the loveseat beside Edgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel rolled his eyes, but tipped his bottle toward Harry all the same, \u201chappy new year, Harry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he a little young to be drinking?\u201d Edgar quirked his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m twenty-three,\u201d Harry sputtered, and he held up two fingers and then three in rapid succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so you\u2019re a la--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd,\u201d Joel grunted and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA late bloomer?\u201d Harry\u2019s ears fell some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u201d Joel shook his head, \u201cI was a Growlithe into my twenties, but look at me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry snorted, \u201cright boss. So\u2026\u201d Harry cocked his head, \u201cyou guys got any resolutions for the new year?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar shrugged, \u201cstay home more, read more books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do plenty of that, Ed,\u201d Joel chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019m on the right track,\u201d Edgar examined his clawed fingers, \u201cwhat about you, big guy?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig guy. Joel winced and patted his paunch. \u201cEr, I\u2019m a tad old for resolutions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on boss. There\u2019s always room for resolutions. We don\u2019t ever stop getting better, right?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could always stand to lose some weight,\u201d Joel shrugged, \u201cor maybe put on the right kind of weight.\u201d He flexed a flabby bicep and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what boss, I\u2019m on the same page,\u201d Harry bounced a little in his seat, \u201csee I\u2019ve meant to bulk up on account of the, y\u2019know, but it\u2019s not easy for me to put on weight. Any weight, I mean. But I met this guy, and he\u2019s been really helping me out. I put on a whole two pounds in a few weeks. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda wish I had that same problem,\u201d Joel rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you know you could bulk up pretty crazy I bet. I read up that guys who put on weight easy get muscle just as quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar slumped back in his seat, \u201cyes, but you\u2019re talking to the king of excuses here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel shrugged, \u201cbetween the store and home stuff I don\u2019t have time for the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw c\u2019mon boss, I bet if we worked together and kept each other accountable and all, we could get it done,\u201d Harry said with his dewy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel rubbed his temples, \u201calright, fine kid. I\u2019ll see this guy you\u2019re going on about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy oh my,\u201d Edgar quirked a brow, \u201cmaybe you have changed some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardy har,\u201d Joel scoffed, \u201cnow before this whole gym talk kills my appetite, I\u2019m getting another pizza log.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nEarly that next morning, Joel tottered into the kitchen. His glasses slightly askew and a horrible headache embedded deep in his skull. He watched the coffeepot come to a boil as his furry paunch peeked beneath his undershirt. He sighed and tucked his gut away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the kitchen-island, he saw Edgar asleep on the couch. The Umbreon curled up in a cozy bundle of blankets with his head propped atop a spare pillow Joel kept for guests. Joel smiled, almost like old times, much as Edgar pushed his buttons he was glad to see the Umbreon back in his life even if it could only be for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel gasped as his cell-phone buzzed to life. He fumbled with the lock screen and put it to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2019ello?\u201d He grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, boss!\u201d said Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel leaned over the counter and rubbed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s New Years\u2019 day, Harry; I don\u2019t think that the gym is open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here right now! The owner says he\u2019d be glad to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it have to be today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon boss, you said you were serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel scratched his gut, sighed, and nodded, \u201cfine. I\u2019ll be there in an hour\u2026\u201d Joel hung up the phone and hobbled back to his room. His stiff legs barely obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>The Bodybuilder:</u></b><br>\r\nShed the winter weight and rock the beach-bod -- Joel\u2019s new fitness instructor is a Machamp with a passion for bodybuilding. Six-packs, bowling ball biceps, and glutes that can kill with a flex. Symmetry and balanced bulking are in this regiment. Will Joel be able to keep up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Musclebeast:</b></u><br>\r\nBigger is better, but the biggest is best -- Joel\u2019s new fitness instructor is a Nidoking obsessed with gains. Roidguts, meaty slabs for arms, and pecs big enough for their own area code. Growth is all that matters in this regiment, chemically induced or otherwise.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Celadon Gym was always a bit too out of the way for Joel's liking. That's what he always told folks, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, he did genuinely feel that way. It was just, when paired with all his other reasons for never exercising, it tended to come off as an excuse. Which it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy <i>was</i> it holed up in an isolated part of southwestern Celadon anyhow? Joel had asked his employees that before and gotten several different answers. One said it was because the gym leader favored quieter places. Another claimed it was a drug front. Someone joked that it's a gym rat containment zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, nobody knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like I'm here to find out,\" Joel muttered to himself as he pulled into a parking spot close to the building. He observed the lot; mostly empty, unsurprisingly. A familiar purple and cream figure stood at the entrance. He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the car, he waved at Harry, who enthusiastically waved back and ran up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin', boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel began walking to the entrance, Harry falling in step with him. \"So who am I looking for here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry waved a hand. \"Oh, don't worry. You'll know him when you see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a helpful description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting back a sarcastic remark, Joel let Harry take the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe automatic doors of the entrance's glass wall opened and they stepped into a surprisingly quaint lobby. Well, surprising to Joel. The last gym he'd ever been to was the one at his college, and that was part of an educational building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry went over to the receptionist, Joel took everything in. The reception area was the typical white tiling associated with that modern \"professional\" kind of look he never cared for, but it gave way to a dark wood panel flooring that covered the rest of the room. On the opposite end was a large double door labeled \"stadium.\" The other to two walls each had two similar entrances, with one on each side labeled with plaques he couldn't quite make out; the locker rooms, most likely. Of particular note were the various potted plants in the corners and on the desk. He couldn't identify any of them (not one for plants) but they certainly looked more exotic and less plastic than one would expect from your average lobby. One of the desk plants even sported an assortment of red, blue, and purple flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, evidently done talking with the Pidgeot receptionist, turned to Joel and pointed his thumb at the double doors on the left. \"Payton's right through there. He doesn't like it when you interrupt his workout, so we'll have to wait a bit if we catch him during a set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\" Joel followed Harry through the closer double doors. The transition from wood paneling to softer gym tiles was jarring enough, but the plethora of gym equipment made him feel like he'd entered a new building altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could take it all in, a deep grunt caught his attention. Harry motioned to follow. They passed a row of bench presses when Joel stopped dead in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas...was that a person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive, purple beast with a gray torso worked away at a plate-loaded weight machine, grunting and huffing with each rep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel's mind raced. What was this thing? Who let it in here? Why was it using the equipment? And why was Harry just smiling and nodding to himself as he watched?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he thought: Oh. That's Payton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course. That wasn't some creature, that was a Nidoking. A big Nidoking. Huge, even. Also the buffest man Joel had ever seen. He would've made a comment under his breath, but Harry's warning had him worried even the tiniest noise would--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, none of that. This Payton fellow may be a real monster of a 'mon, but that was no reason to think of him as some feral beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, no one could deny his intimidating size. Those arms, for example. Biceps like bowling balls, forearms nearly the size of Joel's waist (which was <i>not</i> slim, mind you!), boulder shoulders, and hands big enough to crush a man's skull... And those veins! They bulged and throbbed, decorated so much of his arms. His traps threatened to swallow up his neck; turning his head must be difficult. Then came the torso. By Arceus, each individual pec had to be bigger than his head! And they jutted out so far, straining a white tank top that failed to cover a mighty roidgut. Below that, pillar-like legs tested the limits of black spandex shorts that stopped a third of the way down the thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plates clanged one last time as Payton let his arms fall to his sides. Drenched in sweat, he grabbed a towel laying at his side and wiped his face dry. He then dropped the towel and caught his breath for a moment before turning to his two-man audience, briefly eying Joel before focusing on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin', Harry!\" he said with a grin. Damn, that's a deep baritone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin', coach!\" Harry replied. \"Happy New Year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you!\" Payton turned back to Joel. \"I take it he's the guy you told me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Harry gestured toward Joel. \"Meet my boss, Joel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPayton slowly got up. He had to at that size. Honestly, it was a wonder he could even move at all. He didn't even have to try to emphasize his unfathomable musculature; it just happened naturally. \"So you're him, eh? Harry's told me a lot about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel gawked for another moment then forced himself to focus. \"Some of it good, I hope.\" That didn't sound too freaked out or anything, did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the joke hit its intended mark, eliciting a laugh from Payton. \"Nothing but!\" He extended a hand. \"Nice to finally meet the man himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Joel accepted the hand, gripping and shaking it as firmly as he could. Hopefully Payton could feel that. \"Nice to meet you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPayton seemed about to ask something when Harry darted over to Payton's pile of things by the weight machine and handed him a water bottle. \"Ah, thanks,\" he said before taking a swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel couldn't help but smile. \"Kid has a knack for getting in tune with others, doesn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he does, that he does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two older men beamed at Harry, whom turned bashful, clasping his hands behind his back. \"Yeah well...\" He sheepishly kicked at the floor. \"Just doing what I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPayton nodded. (Was that difficult for him?) \"Speaking of which-\" he turned to Joel \"-he mentioned you might be interested in my services.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Joel's gaze fell to his paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon boss!\" Harry interjected. \"You told me you'd like to 'put on the right kind of weight.' And Payton's just the guy to help you do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am!\" Payton stuck out his chest. So huge... \"I didn't start off like this, y'know. Truth be told, I was about your size when I started, gut 'n all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel stared in something akin to wonder. \"Did you now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. It'd take some doing, but I promise if you take up my program and really stick with it, you'll get...close to my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne side of Joel's mouth curled upward. \"Just close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like being the biggest guy in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" He thought for a moment. \"What exactly does your program entail of? I doubt anyone can get gains like yours just by working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be taking a lotta stuff. Pills, supplements, <i>lots</i> of protein powder, that sorta thing. It's also more about size than anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel looked past Payton--a tad difficult, considering--and noticed a pin inserted a little less than a third of the way down the weight stack. \"Huh\" was all he could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGains beyond belief, but he wouldn't be as strong as he looked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"Well, strength isn't much of a concern for me... I guess I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPayton held up a hand. \"Just take a week to think it over. I'll give you my number and if you're up for it, gimme a call and we'll work something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel felt like breathing a sigh of relief. \"Okay, great. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Payton went to collect his things. \"Well, if that's everything, I better hit the showers. Harry, come help me with my back, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Seed Sown:</b></u><br>\r\nJoel just can't get Payton out of his mind. To think that such a size was possible... And he could even achieve it! Well, maybe. First he has to make that call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Apprehension:</b></u><br>\r\nAbsurd sizes? Taking supplements? Is this Payton guy's program really such a good idea? Not sure what to think, Joel sticks around a little longer. Seeing how Harry gets along with the guy might help him decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>On the Back Burner:</b></u><br>\r\nNo need to mull it over right now; he can call Payton whenever. Besides, it's New Year's! Today's a day to rest, relax, and spend time with others. And with Edgar in town, the two of them can finally catch up.</span></div></div>",

He dropped a pile of envelopes on the bar, then hung his keys on a small sudowoodo statuette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLow jazz fusion music played, with its rapid jumps up discordant scales, and the drums a backbeat hip-hop jam. Edgar sat on the couch, cocooned in his blanket. He bobbed his head to the music as he thumbed through the virtual pages on his tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it go?\" Edgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel sighed, he sorted out the mail he neglected throughout the week. He tossed credit card apps into an ashtray and flicked embers at them until they turned to black ash. \"Went pretty well, the guy in charge was pretty nice but Ed,\" Joel chuckled, \"you shoulda seen him. He was huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Theodore Clark huge?\" Edgar looked up from his tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take Ted and, like, fuse him with his long lost twin, and you've got a Nidoking look-a-like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar whistled, \"and he's supposed to be training you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Joel rubbed the back of his neck, \"I haven't exactly signed up yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar scoffed, he looked down at his tablet again, his pointed ears swiveled, \"too intimidated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel slumped in the couch beside the Umbreon. Joel sniffed. \"A little, yeah,\" Joel pushed his glasses up his muzzle, \"besides that, I wanted to get home before you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar said nothing, but Joel saw the slightest of twitch in Edgar's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought maybe I could convince you to stay a bit longer,\" Joel shrugged, \"treat you to some Celadon hospitality before you disappeared again. After all, you didn't say goodbye last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar sighed. He laid his tablet on his chest, and he faced Joel. The Arcanine wore a puppy dog pout, his moist blue eyes glistened behind his square spectacles. He punctuated the well-rehearsed expression with a small whine. The desperate cherry atop this pitiable sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought you'd be too old to do that,\" Edgar grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you'll stay a bit longer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, you incorrigible canine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel's brow raised, and his maw hung loose in a dog smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay another night, I've got hotel reservations I need to make good on,\" Edgar raised his index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least let me treat you to lunch,\" Joel reached over and squeezed Edgar's shoulder, \"I know just the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Village Green wasn't especially busy that cold January afternoon. The streets beyond the canvas windows were empty of cars. Only the occasional 'mon braved the sidewalk in search of open establishments. Joel and Edgar entered the restaurant side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, hardly anyone here, perfect right?\" Joel whispered to Edgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar nodded once, his hands tucked into his coat pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Mister Vesta,\" a Furret host said, adjusting his bowtie as he took notice of Joel, \"how might I help you this fine afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a table for two, Pas,\" Joel held two fingers up and patted Edgar's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For two? Back in the dating scene, eh?\" Pasquale took two menus from his desk, and he beckoned Joel and Edgar follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar's ears straightened. Joel cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Ed's an old friend of mine who came to visit, figured I'd give him a good time before he left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel took his favorite seat near the back, where the warm Altomarian food smells wafted from the kitchen doors. A smooth clarinet tune played from hidden speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I start you off with something to drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bottle of Pietrabianca please,\" Joel nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasquale gave a curt bow and left for wineracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar shuffled uneasily in his seat, \"so people here, they know you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bi? It's not a bad word outside of Saffron, y'know?\" Joel eyeballed his menu. His heart was already set on the 'Fruit of the Sea and Pasta.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to admit, it's hard to imagine you with an active dating life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, ouch,\" Joel mocked a wince, \"and two, it was only a couple dates,\" he loosed a sad sigh, \"but as you can tell I wasn't all that successful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to salt the wound,\" Edgar offered a slight smile to reassure the Arcanine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still with that guy, what's his face,\" Joel scratched his chin, \"Chet? Chad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chester,\" Edgar rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's it. Knew it was one of those teen-movie bully names,\" Joel giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an ass,\" Edgar fought a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah, you still seeing him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're...\" Edgar's smile faltered, \"we're giving each other space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wine arrived in the knick of time. Joel poured a glass and ordered his food in a pinch. Edgar mumbled \"Chicken Parmesan,\" and he sized up the white wine like a fox to a hen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel poured a generous glass for Edgar and took a sip from his own. He smacked his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar swirled his wine. He nursed a healthy swallow. His ears flattened, \"how much space is between Palette Town and Saffron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Joel pushed his glasses up his muzzle, his nostrils flared, \"so this road trip isn't really just a short visit to your folks' place is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar went to sip his glass and found it nearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are your folks still...\" Joel cranked his wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar poured himself another glass, \"you know my mom called me 'the prodigal son?' In that sour 'I-told-you-so' voice she's got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that answers my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have anywhere else to go,\" Edgar rubbed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel drummed his claws on the table, \"well, there's room at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joel, no.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for now. I promise you'll have your own space, you don't have to pay any rent or food. I'll even let you pick up hours at the Game Center when you're ready for that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no.\" Edgar's eyes watered. He poured another glass. The silence was thick between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And dinner is served!\" Pasquale laid out the plates with gusto. Joel thanked the Furret as he returned walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel prodded the buttered shrimp and scallops, and he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're incredibly sweet J, always have been,\" Edgar said softly. He invoked the nickname! Joel's tail sagged, he had wondered if he would ever hear it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar bowed his head, \"I almost hate you for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel winced, for real this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I see you, with that dumb smile, with your friends and your home and your career, how happy you are, how different you are, I'm almost fooled into trying again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wine was talking now, but at least it spoke openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel sighed, he took Edgar's hand and clasped it in both of his meaty paws, \"I'm not asking that we try again. I'm offering you a safe place to stay. The fact that you're around again, well, that's a happy bonus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<u><b>Warmer</b></u><br>\r\nEdgar is still guarded but agrees to stay if Joel keeps his distance. The past refuses to stay in the past, but part of Edgar is open to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Wildfire</b></u><br>\r\nEdgar's guard is down, he desperately wants to believe things are different. Maybe it's the wine or the rebound from a bad relationship talking, Edgar chooses a more intimate agreement. Under one condition...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Extinguished</b></u><br>\r\nEdgar doesn't believe Joel's changed enough. Heartbreaking as it is, he can't open himself back up again. He leaves and Joel is left to contemplate what's been lost and where he ought to go from there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their lips touched again, the heat in Joel's core spread to his limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood in Joel's living room, locked in an embrace. Their clothes piled on the floor beside the couch. Joel's briefs hugged tight to his pudgy hips -- his tell-tale erection pitched the fabric upward, and it brushed against Edgar's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar gasped, his shoulders trembled as Joel pulled him closer. The Umbreon laid his head against Joel's chest. He loosed a shaky whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel stopped, he loosed his grip, \"you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar's chest rose and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we don't have to do anything if you're not feeling it,\" Joel ran his hand through Edgar's ears and down the back of his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar hooked his thumbs around Joel's briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel stood still as he let Edgar make the next move. A wave of pleasure crawled up Joel's spine as his penis bounced free. The plain white briefs slunk down his doughy thighs and to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar kissed Joel's neck, and Edgar pushed Joel to the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine lay supine, his body aching and throbbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon slid off his own underwear, and he straddled Joel cautiously. Though on top and in control, he still seemed anxious. He felt small on the larger-than-usual Arcanine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel rubbed Edgar's flat stomach, \"I missed you, Ed.\" Joel grabbed Edgar's hands and squeezed them. A smile, full and brimming with warmth, lit up Joel's cheeks. There was a kindled flame once absent from Joel's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar's nerves scattered -- he was safe here. Edgar took Joel into himself and lowered his hips. The Umbreon's penis flexed as it grazed against Joel's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel moaned, his jaw stretched open and locked. He reached out, and he stroked Edgar's length -- his thick paws wrapped tight around Edgar. Edgar whimpered, and his eyes clenched tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world and its worries disappeared. Only Joel and Edgar remained. Their bodies rocked to and from each other. Faster and faster. They lasted no longer than a minute, their bodies so starved for intimacy and touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar seized, a white streak jettisoned between Joel's fingers and across his belly. Joel came next. His legs and his testicles spasmed as he filled Edgar further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gasped for breath as Edgar slumped flat on Joel's soft chest. The long orgasm lulled them from stupor to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel's eyes cracked open. Edgar lay in Joel's arms, he took pawfuls of Joel's chest fur. Darkness enveloped them, the faint glow of Joel's cellphone cued the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staying doesn't sound so bad anymore,\" Edgar yawned. How long had he been awake? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\" Joel croaked, he licked his dry lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's this nagging doubt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do to prove that I can make this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more excuses Joel, no more hiding when things get hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, no excuses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when I ask you if you're signing up for that gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm signing up tomorrow.\" Joel sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Edgar nuzzled Joel's neck, \"the longer you keep to that mindset, the longer I stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel's thoughts faded. He hugged Edgar tighter. His addled mind wondered where dreams and reality began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<u><b>Bon-Bon Bulking</b></u><br>\r\nJoel signs up for Payton's gym but discovers that the secret to Payton's size is built on a performance-enhancing drug: Rare Candy. Sure there are side-effects -- intense mood swings, increased appetite, losing control of one's pokemon abilities, addiction -- but the pros just might outweigh the cons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Pain and Gain</b></u><br>\r\nTurns out a lifestyle change is a miserable undertaking, but at least it won't come with weird side effects. Payton respectfully abides Joel's decision to bulk naturally and shows him the ropes. The first week is honest workouts, bulking on protein and supplements. The results are slower, but cleaner. Unfortunately, Harry's taken a serious liking to Payton's secret regiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone else was where he should have been -- nursing their hangovers and spending time with loved ones. Yet here he was scouring the streets for an address that he hardly remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel glanced around at an intersection, drove through, and he saw the remains of the previous evening\u2019s festivities. The local shops were still adorned in their New Years decorations. With streamers and  shiny ribbon dangling from second story windows and the Rayquaza statue at the local \u201cCeladon Community Center\u201d dressed in evergreen garlands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther along Mainstreet, Joel neared his own business: Game Corner. Beside his humble establishment was the two-story bakery: Goldenkrisp. A smiling Kanghaskhan adorned the signage. On the front porch, shoveling snow was a young Kanghaskhan, no older than twelve,  with her adoptive cubone brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kanghaskhan looked up from her shovel and waved, eyes pearly and alight. Her cubone bronter clutched his snow shovel to his chest -- the impliment utterly alien in his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel rolled down the windows and he pulled beside the bakery, \u201cyour mom\u2019s already got you two working, RB?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRB nodded, \u201cI think she thinks vacation\u2019s a bad word or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr she looked it up in the wrong dictionary,\u201d Joel pushed his glasses up his muzzle, \u201chey Ridge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cubone nodded attentively but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing down here if your nerd store\u2019s closed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMister Harry wanted to meet me  and I happened to be in the neighborhood --\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door creaked open and a positively massive Kanghaskhan stood in the doorway. Her broad frame cast a horned shadow on the snow. . Her face creased with stern age lines born of the hard Wild\u2019s lifestyle.  Draped across her chest as an apron woven with traditional Altan tribe symbols. She saw Joel and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoel!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019 Sarnai,\u201d Joel  waved, \u201csorry to bother the kids, but you know me, I can\u2019t not say hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPah you know better than to apologize, always nice to see you neighbor, \u201d Sarnai said and she sprinkled her mumbling with her native tongue, \u201cWhat brings you to work, is your store not closed today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh like I was just about to tell the kids, I\u2019m meeting a friend somewhere down here and figured I\u2019d say hello.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ringing bell set the Arcanine\u2019s ears erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, oh,\u201d RB shuffled toward her mother, \u201cmama, the cookies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarnai gasped and bolted inside. Joel\u2019s brow quirked and she returned a moment later. Warm smells wafted through door and sliced through the blustery winter world beyond. In her arms was a blue pastry box. An assortment of chocolate chip cookies teased a growl from the Arcanine\u2019s belly. He hadn't eaten that morning, foolish as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thanks but I really can\u2019t dip into your profits--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo humble but I was waiting to give these to your tomorrow anyhow. I owe you after your help with this past Festival Eve.\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Sarnai, I am grateful and I would gladly take them, but I\u2019m sort of starting this diet and--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they are the special ones made with Aspear berry sauce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAspear berry\u2026\u201d the Arcanine grunted, \u201cokay maybe I can take those off your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d Sarnai took the box to Joel and fed it through the passenger window of his car. The box of cookies filled the confined space with the tart yet chocolaty scent that contributed to his growing waistline over the years. Joel forced a smile as she stepped back from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe I\u2019d best get going, don\u2019t want to keep Harry waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof, Arceus no, he will come to pieces if he has to wait,\u201d Sarnai chuckled, \u201cperhaps you could stop by later. If you don\u2019t have any other plans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, got a busy day ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know how to reach me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Happy New Year guys, and take care,\u201d Joel rolled up the window and drove off. Baked temptation seated beside him. Already his New Years Resolution was dissolving as the Aspear berry scent burrowed through his will. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At his side was a barefaced building with a \"Masura's Gym\" sticker on the front window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel grabbed the box and took it from the passenger seat and hid it on the floor. He grunted as his seatbelt dug into his gut while he forced himself upright. The Arcanine cleared his throat and and smiled once Harry noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you gave me the right place?\u201d Joel said as he rolled down the window<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s brand, brand new,\u201d Harry rubbed his hands together and fought back shivers He sniffed the air briefly. \u201cBoss, are those cookies I smell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeasonal air freshener,\u201d Joel bit the inside of his cheek as he rolled up the window.

The fire rushing through his system relaxed and a wave of relaxation washed over him. Beyond a narrow entryway they found a massive open room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlastic lined the floor where workout equipment was being assembled. Benches, power racks, barbell stands. And for some reason a monster truck tire smack dab in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one of the completed benches sat asf lay a Hariyama. The stout pokemon grunted as he benched what Joel realized was  eight hundred pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beefy Charizard with a bulging gut and rippling biceps stood behind as spotter.  His clawed fingers trembled as he watched the master at work - as if fearful he might not be able to properly spot at this weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hariyama gasped as he finished his set. He reracked the barbell, then rocked himself to a sitting position. His rolling mass of belly spilled over the front of his workout shorts. The Hariyama clapped his hands of sweat and fought to catch his breath. He swung his legs around the bench and looked over at Harry and Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, he gave them a curt wave, then motioned for them to come closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019 er\u2026\u201d the Hariyamaa snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry,\u201d the Charizard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d  The Hariama said, \u201cit\u2019s been a haze of new faces, I don\u2019t mean any disrespect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone taken master Masaru,\u201d Harry bowed and remained that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bulky pokemon across Harry stared nonplussed. Joel cleared his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe name\u2019s Joel Shao.\u201d he extended his paw to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaru took his hand and shook it once, \u201cah,  I thought I recognized you. You own one of those stores along Main-Street, is that correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel smirked, but could barely mask his bewilderment, \u201cer, yes. How\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaw your picture on TV the other night, some card game thing --\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the Cardcanum for Charity tournament,\u201d Joel chuckled, \u201cyeah we had a bunch of locals hold a tournament and people donated money to the Pokemon Center.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn any case,  it\u2019s humbling to have such a well-liked Celadon citizen enter my  establishment.\u201d Masura crossed his arms. \u201cName\u2019s Akebono Masura, and this here is my business partner Aiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHullo,\u201d the Charizard waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure\u2019s all mine really,\u201d Joel held up a palm, he never really considered himself a pillar of the community but it was nice to be noticed, \u201cbecause  I think you can help me out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not getting any younger and, uh, I sorta want to get into a shape other than \u2018round,\u2019 Harry tells me that you run a pretty impressive program.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasura stroked his chin, \u201cit\u2019s not an easy one, and it doesn\u2019t come cheap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess you get what you pay for,\u201d Joel tapped his foot and looked toward Harry, \u201cthe gentlerat here, he didn\u2019t mention anything about me spotting his tab did he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did mention striking a sort of deal,\u201d Masura and Aiden both turned to face harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rattata shrunk into himself, a bashful smile on his lips. He gulped. \u201cWell, y\u2019see, I had this idea. So, you\u2019re a new business in town, you need some advertising, and I want,\u201d Harry cleared his throat and put his arm around Joel, \u201cwe want to reach beefcake status like you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasura\u2019s wrecking ball biceps and bulging pecs certainly   interested Joel. The heavy coat of prodigious belly fat and softness stacked atop the muscle slabs, however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking we could do a cross-promotion thing,\u201d Harry put his hands behind his back, \u201cJoel and I, we do this fitness challenge. Do monthly or weekly progress pictures. Show off your work. We advertise it all over our store. People enamored by our transformation flock to your gym. Everybody wins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I think I like where this is going,\u201d Masura stroked his chin and paced, \u201cthen perhaps I could get you two on the premium circuit. Show off the best I have to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Harry jumped but immediately retracted. \u201c I mean, yes, that would expedite things What d\u2019you think boss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel sighed.  Wasn\u2019t this new years thing about <i>losing</i> weight? Joel flexed his fingers and imagined himself deadlifting half a ton. So what's a little extra belly fat? Joel nodded slowly, \u201cI think we could make that work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel and Harry stepped back into the snowy streets. The shivering Rattata inched closer toward the heat radiating from his Arcanine boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y\u2019know, it\u2019s gotta be nice b-being your own space heater,\u201d Harry sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has its perks,\u201d Joel bit his bottom lip, \u201care you going to be alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m feeling so much b-b-better now that we landed that deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time try to include me in the initial negotiations,\u201d Joel said. He looked up and down his shivering shift manager, \u201cdid you walk here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded rapidly. His whiskers bounced with his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel shook his head, \u201cyou could\u2019ve asked me for a ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-was too excited to wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel looked back at his parked car. He loosed a long sigh, then turned back to the Rattata. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry darted to the car, threw open the door, and nearly stepped on the box of cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Joel threw up his hands. \u201cYou saw those guys in there; you think they got that way cutting carbs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sniffled, \u201cfair point,\u201d he moved the box to the back seat and huddled up on the passenger side. With the engine ignited, the Rattata sighed happily as warm air enveloped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short way down the road, Joel pressed the brakes as a stoplight flickered red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, boss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have a cookie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage is nearly set, but there\u2019s one more choice to make -- who gets to be \u2018more than friends?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Rekindling:</b></u><br>\r\nJoel decides to eschew meeting with anyone else that day in favor of spending the afternoon alone with Edgar. It\u2019s been years since the struggle of their collegiate youth, and the often unspoken feelings between them. Perhaps there\u2019s room for a braver Joel to finally connect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Dinner with Family:</b></u><br>\r\nJoel takes up Sarnai\u2019s offer to dine with her family. He\u2019s been watching out for them ever since they moved next door to the Game Corner -- sending customers their way, buying the kids gifts when money was tight, and now things might be moving a step further. Joel\u2019s always been \u2018fatherly\u2019 anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Age Brings Experience:</b></u><br>\r\nJoel spends the afternoon bonding with Harry over their mutual resolution. Joel\u2019s always seen a lot of himself in Harry -- both late bloomers, outgoing yet insecure about their bodies, and no luck in romantic ventures. Maybe Joel\u2019s always been more than a mentor to his protege.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec leaned forward, eyes narrowed as he scrutinized his reflection in the bathroom mirror. He looked the same as he always did: average face, middle-of-the-road physique, and a standard height of five foot nine. The textbook definition of a Plain Jane- er, John. Jay? Regardless, his looks were nothing special. Never had been. Just typical Alec, ever unchanging from birth to present day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet something had changed. Overnight, at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his stomach, frown deepening. Over the course of his first semester at Goldenrod University, his belly had developed an ever so slight amount of padding. It didn't turn into an outright muffin top or anything; just a little outward curve of body fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how did that happen? It wasn't like he'd changed his routine or anything. No dietary adjustments, no exercise, hadn't taken any drugs or anything... He never ate with anyone, so it wasn't like there was anyone around to lace his meals with anything either. And even if that were somehow the case, what would they be trying to accomplish by making him lose weight? Malnourishment? Why even do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with frustrated confusion, Alec straightened up and scratched the back of his neck. He certainly didn't consider losing his only sign of the Freshman 15 a <i>bad</i> thing, just a totally weird and out of nowhere thing that made no sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on top of that, something about him just felt different. Everything else about him looked the same as ever, so what gives? He twisted his body this way and that, stretching his arms, even squatting a bit. Something about the way he moved was just...off. In a way he couldn't describe. Alec groaned. His vocabulary failing him just reminded him that his first essay of the semester was due at the end of the week. Why did his body have to start acting weird now? He didn't have time for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Well, actually he did. But still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec thought for a moment. Aside from the stomach thing, his body didn't look different, just felt different. And even then, only when he moved. Maybe--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door. \"Dude, c'mon! What's the hold-up?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec winced. Taking one last look at his boxers-clad reflection, he exited the bathroom, muttering an apology to his Pidgeot roommate as he slipped past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, he'd have to worry about this later. Even though he could hypothetically use sudden loss of body fat as an excuse to take a sick day, he knew from experience he'd be spending the rest of the semester semester struggling to keep up. Even straight B's took work, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his roommate's impatience, neither of them had to rush; their classes weren't until later in the morning. He could afford to take his time getting dressed, which he did. Though not exactly the tightest clothes, they fit him well enough that he should be able to notice if he'd shrunk anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept he didn't notice any difference. Aside from his stomach, everything fit him the same as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, he heard a flush followed by the sound of running water. A moment after that his roommate exited the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared at each other in silence for a moment before Alec felt the need to say something. \"Do I look, uh, different at all?\" he asked, gesturing to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis roommate stared. \"Uh, no?\" he replied slowly, raising an eyebrow. \"Why, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec sighed. Of course the Pidgeot wouldn't notice. They only ever hung out in the dorm room, if being in the same place at the same time could even be considered that. With a shrug, Alec said, \"Kinda. My belly fat just...disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have belly fat? Or had, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" The Pidgeot looked away in thought. Then he just walked over to his side of the bedroom and set to dressing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec watched him, waiting for any further response. Nothing. Just awkward silence again. He watched his roommate for a bit longer before giving up and returning his attention to his stomach. Maybe if he stared at it long enough, he could figure out where the fat went...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, no. That's just stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see much point in worrying. Not yet, at least. He would have to keep a close eye on his body for a while, though, to keep track of any further changes. Then something would definitely be up and he'd have to do something about it. Then again, if it were something that only benefited him like--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach grumbled. Well, regardless of the how and why or what could potentially happen going forward, it shouldn't be too hard to get that fat back. Campus dining wasn't exactly geared towards weight loss, after all. Just one decent breakfast at the cafeteria should get him on the fast track to returning to normal. Not that he <i>wanted</i> to fatten back up, but he didn't care enough to avoid it either. He always had a respectable appetite anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see much point in worrying. Not yet, at least. He would have to keep a close eye on his body for a while, though, to keep track of any further changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Regimen-Free Bulking:</b></u> Only a few days after his belly fat vanished, Alec notices his frame looking a little broader than usual, his clothes fitting just a touch tighter than they should. But it's not fat; there's some firmness that wasn't there before. A little definition too. But why? He's just been going about his normal routine like always. Still, it's hard to complain... <i>(Muscle Growth only)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Hunkification:</b></u> Like the above option, Alec gains muscle bit by tiny bit each day. But in this case, it's not the only growth he's experiencing. His eye level rises, not by much but just enough for him to notice something off. And not just that, the groin of his pants is tightening, and it isn't just because of his hips or thighs. <i>(Muscle Growth + Height Growth + Cock &amp; Balls Growth)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Best(?) of Both:</b></u> It's not just muscle Alec gains. While his limbs and pecs show a little more muscle definition by the day, his belly isn't exactly forming a six pack. Quite the opposite, in fact. Whatever is causing him to grow also kicks his appetite into overdrive, resulting in him gaining that little belly back and then some. <i>(Muscle Growth + Weight Gain)</i></span></div></div>",

He hated his frumpy Feebas self, thanks in no small part to all the bullying he endured in school. It didn't help that his parents' good looks gave him a lot to live up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, puberty came along and blessed him quite nicely. Sleek, vivid scales; a long, graceful tail with a fan of tail fins that put his ratty old one to shame; eyes shining with an allure they never had before; and a sleek, slender body possessing curves a bit more feminine than was expected of males of his species. The small torso was one thing, but he also gained a narrow waist and hips that were just a bit wider than the norm. And he loved it all. He loved stripping down before bed and basking in his newfound beauty. He just couldn't get enough of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one night, about a week after evolving, a thought occurred: how good would he look in his mother's dress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty damn good, it turned out. Better than good, even. Fit him to a T.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, Lee has left his hometown of Fortree City and Hoenn entirely. He now lives in Ecruteak, balancing his day job and his moderately successful career as the online cross-dressing model WaterLiLi. His rise in popularity is a gradual one, but there's no hurry. He's only 27 and he still looks better than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and don't let his attitude put you off. He's not really egotistical, just...very self-confident. And a tease, if you show him any interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpansion sounds detrimental to him, but who knows. Maybe he can make it work!</span></div></div>",

Not too many know her well enough to pick up on them, as she's the type to prefer a small group of friends.

She wasn't going to get much of that done today. Not really a problem, considering she always did well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Still,\" she said, turning back to Aurore, \"it's awfully mean to make you write an essay this close to midterms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No kidding,\" Aurore replied dryly. \"But apparently, Mr. Pyroar disagrees.

The most sizable pair she'd ever seen, in fact. Maybe not downright <i>huge,</i> but certainly a good cup size or two above average. That must be why this mystery busty girl had the top button of her blouse undone, exposing her white-furred cleavage. Or maybe she just wanted to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that aside, who was this busty girl? And why was she presenting herself to Sylvie in such a way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle snapped Sylvie out of her thoughts. Her ears twitched. Clearing her throat, she looked up to see the smirking face of a Braixen. She blushed, averted her gaze. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braixen giggled again. \"Oh, don't be. I wanted you to stare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie blinked. Her brow furrowed a tiny bit. \"Why?\" she asked, daring to face the other girl again but not daring to look anywhere below her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third giggle, and the leaning Braixen straightened up and walked over to the chair opposite Sylvie. She sat down, rested her head in her hands. Her orange eyes twinkled with amusement and a touch of mischief. \"Sooo, how are things?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Midterms.\" The Braixen's expression soured for a moment, then brightened right back up. \"Buuut anywaaay...\" She leaned forward. \"I'm glad I finally got a chance to talk to you again, Sylvie! It's been forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie's eye brows subtly rose. \"How do you know my name? Who...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, this girl started looking vaguely familiar. A Braixen with a pretty face and a sunny disposition... Come to think of it, that sounded just like--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braixen girl's-- Raina's smile widened. \"You do remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie nodded. \"We were partners for a science project, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! During our first year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie leaned back in her seat, glanced up at the ceiling a moment before looking back at Raina. \"That was two years ago. I'm surprised you remember me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I remember you!\" Raina leaned even further forward. By this point, she was giving Sylvie another good look at her cleavage. \"Who wouldn't remember someone so pretty and nice and smart and pretty and, and... Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing at the praise, Sylvie found herself struggling to maintain eye contact. \"I,\" she stammered, \"er... Thank you.\" She cleared her throat. \"But that all better applies to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, you think so, do you?\" By this point, Raina leaned far enough that she practically laid on the table. She arched her back, thrusting her chest towards Sylvie. \"And would <i>these</i> have anything to do with that? Hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie's blush deepened. She tugged at her shirt collar. \"I don't remember you being so...flirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw c'mon, I'm just teasing!\" Raina settled back into her chair. \"And so what if I'm being a little flirty? You'd wanna show off too with breasts like these.\" She cupped them for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts, Sylvie couldn't help sparing a brief glance at them. She flinched at Raina's knowing smirk. \"I don't remember you being so well endowed either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina trailed off. She scanned the area, compelling Sylvie to do the same. The library was empty by now, save for the staff members. Turning back to her, Raina said, \"Why don't we talk about this on the way home? Here's not a good place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie tilted her head in confusion, silently asking Raina for elaboration. When she got none, she nodded and stood. Raina did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sidewalk was sparsely populated as Sylvie and Raina walked alongside each other. Not many folks were out and about so late in the day, especially away from the more tourist-heavy areas. It gave them a sort of semi-privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, my breasts,\" Raina started. \"They're a very, um, let's say recent development.\" With a snicker she added, \"If you'll pardon the pun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How recent, exactly?\" Sylvie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this week. People have been talking about me, of course. Accused me of stuffing my bra, getting work done. That sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it wasn't because of surgery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Raina huffed. \"Just 'cause my family's rich doesn't mean I get to spend it on whatever. Mom and Dad would kill me if I got breast surgery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet they let you enhance them through some other means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had help from someone my parents trust a lot. And it took a lot of convincing. Like, a <i>lot</i> a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie nodded despite not entirely understanding. The lives of rich folk were nothing but a mystery to her. \"And what kind of help did they give you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Developing breast enhancement pills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came so plainly, as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world. The blase delivery of it nearly made Sylvie wheeze as though it had come along and punched her in the stomach. \"Is that so,\" she said, her disbelief showing through her usually level tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina forced a laugh, looked away in some random direction. \"I guess it does sound pretty crazy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie shook her head. \"Have you told anyone else at school about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Just you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why just me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina stopped in place. Sylvie stopped as well and turned to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She looked down, interlocked her hands behind her back. \"To be honest, I wanted to share them with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvie's eyes widened a touch. Words failed her for a good, long moment. The best she could manage was a soft \"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaina gave a small nod, still not meeting her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Raina inhaled deeply and forced herself to make eye contact.</span></div></div>",

Curious teens of either gender (assuming they're legal)? Pamela will gladly take them all to bed and give them a wonderful time. And she'll make sure they enjoy every second of it. Hell, she'd have sex all day if she could get away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, a single woman of thirty years needs to work.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pamela awoke to a soft, warm embrace. It wrapped around her, caressed her lovely body. And why wouldn't that be the case? Her body, her drop dead gorgeous and sinfully sexy body, lived to be embraced and caressed. Such tantalizing curves were far too good to be display only. Most everyone she'd ever met loved her body, and she always made sure to return that love in kind. Assuming they were up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Pamela pulled the covers off, revealing her nude self in all its glory. And nobody else. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally though, how long had it been since the last time she'd taken anyone to bed? Or, heck, just spent some \"quality time\" in general? Days? Weeks? Surely it couldn't have been months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What day is today?\" she muttered as she sat up on the edge of her bed. \"Oh right, Saturday. Goody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, she stood up and walked over to her full-length mirror. More accurately, she sashayed over in a manner that would look comically exaggerated if anyone else tried it but perfectly natural with her. Pamela couldn't help but smile. Even in the lousiest of moods, she never failed to appreciate how sexy she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially when no one else was doing it for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile became a frown. Something had to have changed, but what? Couldn't have been her body. A perky pair of breasts bigger than her head, a plump ass of equal size, wide hips, thick thighs, a relatively thin waist, a slight layer of fat all around (which was in no way a negative), soft and supple lips, clear blue eyes that perfectly matched her scales, long eyelashes, a towering height that trumped any man she'd ever met... Yup, same as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela trailed a finger down one of her breasts and pinched the nipple. It felt nice, but couldn't compare to someone else's touch. An eager young man looking for a one night stand, an older woman in need of good stress relief, even a freshly eligible teen learning the ropes would be more stimulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving her biggest sigh that morning, she shrugged. \"Maybe I'll go for a walk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool morning breeze brushed against Pamela's scales. She inhaled, held for a moment, then exhaled. Maybe it was her mood but Vermilion City's salty air seemed a tad stale to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStale. Just like her sex life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"No Pam, don't dwell on it. Just go out and have a nice walk and get some breakfast and enjoy yourself. Somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter adjusting her sports bra and jogging shorts (which looked more like booty shorts on her) and double-checking her purse she set off, already set on her destination. A nice breakfast diner was just a few blocks down from her condo complex, making it perfect walking distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way out of the complex she caught sight of a familiar married couple: Greg, a Raticate, and Mary, a Ninetales. They smiled and waved at her, which Pamela returned in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think they used to be so bashful around her. Not that she could blame them; a woman of her stature--not to mention the raw sex appeal--had to be intimidating. Although the real bashfulness came from that one time she talked them into a threesome. Not because they didn't enjoy it (they said it was some of the best sex they ever had) but because it forced them to...realize certain things about themselves. Things they needed time to come to terms with. And when they finally did, it didn't take much to persuade them into a round two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, round three wasn't looking like much of a possibility. Both Greg and Mary made it abundantly clear they preferred Pamela as just a friend rather than a friend with benefits. Oh well, Pamela would sometimes think, their loss. Only now did she finally realize it was her loss too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing of note happened during her walk down to the diner. She passed some people on the way. Some of them glanced at her. Some didn't even do that much. What happened to the days she could turn heads just by existing? Looks of disbelief, amazement, envy, <i>lust...</i> Hell, she almost missed the disgust! At least that was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe All-Day Breakfast Diner was just that. It had the typical old-school aesthetic and a pretty standard menu, but the food was good and the staff kept the place in good shape. Nothing special on the whole. Still, it did what it needed to and did it well enough for Pamela to stop by regularly. She even used to bring some of her lays here if they spent the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA set of newspaper vending machines lined the entrance. Pamela gave them a passing glance when one caught her eye. The Kanto Tribune, sporting a full-body shot of a muscular Samurott woman. Smiling, Pamela paid 50 pok\u00e9dollars and took a copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can always count on you to brighten up my day, Athena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she took a closer look. Athena lacked her usual confidence. A subtle slouch and an expression that tried to look neutral but possessed a subtle glumness. The headline wasn't much better: \"Unova's Top Battler in Slump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you too?\" Pamela walked to her usual table, not bothering to look up from the paper. A quick scan of the article revealed Athena couldn't muster up the same passion for League Battling she used to have. Nothing challenged her anymore. Even deliberately putting herself at a disadvantage didn't work. So, she decided to take a hiatus and do a little soul searching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, poor thing,\" Pamela said. Part of her hoped that meant Athena would go on a little vacation. Maybe to, say, Vermilion? It would be a nice chance for them to get acquainted, if it were possible. A walk around the city, some dinner, maybe get her hands on those tantalizing muscles and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fawning over your celebrity crush, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela looked up to see a Sandshrew waiter grinning at her. \"Am I that obvious, Dan?\" she replied with a grin of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan laughed. \"Well, considering who I'm talking to...\" He raised a pencil and notepad. \"The usual?\" Pamela barely nodded before he started jotting down the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that her problem? Had she become too obvious and predictable to woo anyone? Even Dan, a young man of nineteen years who still got flustered at the tiniest hint of anything sexual, could approach her without any problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, they had known each other ever since Dan's friends dared him to have sex with Pamela for his eighteenth birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich didn't happen, of course. Dan really wasn't interested and Pamela didn't like the idea of fucking someone eleven years younger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven getting herself out of this rut (heh) wouldn't be worth violating her moral code. Although, as she watched Dan walk away, she couldn't help but notice his butt filled out his khakis quite nicely. Had it always been that shapely? Or maybe he'd put on a little weight and had a cute little belly to go with it. Soft to the touch and sensitive to boot, perfect for--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, shook her head. \"Get a grip, you nymphomaniac...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne breakfast platter later, Pamela trudged home. Again, none of the people she passed by gave her more than a quick glance. It especially hurt when it was someone she knew. Vince, the Kadabra; Iolana, the Decidueye... Even Jack, the studly Machamp. They used to go at it about once a week! What happened to that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her condo brought no comfort. It was one of the large rooms the complex offered, generally reserved for larger species. Though not on the same level as an Onix or a Snorlax, Pamela was just too tall and shapely to fit comfortably in anything smaller. This resulted in a living space with more than enough room to accommodate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also resulted in her feeling awful lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's changed?\" she asked her reflection before pacing about her bedroom. \"I'm as sexy as ever, as friendly as ever... What am I doing wrong? Arceus above, even high school me had an easier time with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, high school. A turbulent time of growth, self-discovery, more growth, experimentation, even more growth, and developing and refining the skills that made Pamela such an effective seductress. By graduation, she'd at least made out with most of the student body (plus a few teachers, something her adult self regretted) and cemented her status as a queen of lust and sexuality. And she was just a Nidorina back then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all so new and exciting back then. College was fun too, but by that point she'd fallen into a routine of sorts. With everyone being legal adults, sex stopped being this tempting taboo and became another fact of life. She evolved into a Nidoqueen and dabbled in a kink here or there, but it was more or less a repeat of high school. Same for her adult life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela stopped pacing. \"That's it,\" she whispered. She returned to her mirror. \"Nothing's changed. And that's the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplacency. Routine. Just because she hadn't grown tired of it didn't mean others wouldn't. Even her regular partners would get sick of it eventually without something to shake things up. There's no pleasure if they just went through the motions. Release, sure, but no satisfaction beyond that. And it certainly didn't help that she had one of the biggest libidos in all of Kanto, if not the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no way I'm letting this continue,\" she declared to her reflection, which mirrored her determined expression. \"Things are gonna change. Maybe I can't get that old first time magic back, but I'll get as close as I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her window, she placed one hand on her hip and clenched the other into a fist. \"Queen Pamela is making a comeback!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not a lot of people at Henry\u2019s Treats had the specific knowledge of what the new, busty Nidoqueen gal Pamela had been hired to do at the relatively Mom &amp; Pop dessert store. The hedonistic Pokemon has just quit her job as a secretary and had only been working at the Bakery for sometime now. Not let go. Not even fired. Just quit, for no other reason than, \u201cThis place blows.\u201d Apparently she flipped off her boss and kicked over his desk on her way out, permanently burning the bridge with that employer. \u201cI can do better than that dump,\u201d she boasted to anyone who asked what her last job was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the life of them, none of her other co-workers understood what exactly she did all day was good for business. From what they could tell, all Pamela seemed to do was raid the kitchen and stuff her face full of sweets. When asked, the curvy Nidoqueen simply replied that she was doing \u2018quality control work\u2019, taste testing the products before they hit the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her new colleagues, a Raichu called Veronica, had developed a sort of scathing jealousy towards Pamela. All she ever did day in and day out was stuff her face and full her gut, and despite not helping the business and in point of fact actually bringing it down due to all the food she ate, the boss loved her. The Raichu has been working at Henry\u2019s for a couple of years now, but the Nidoqueen shows up for work for a month and now she\u2019s her new boss. \u2018That\u2019s right, not only was she the store\u2019s new taste tester, she was the assistant manager too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Verooonicaaaa~\u201dsang an all too familiar voice in Veronica\u2019s ears, making her look up from the cake she was frosting for a kid\u2019s birthday party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gargantuan pair of mamarries were heaving over the head of the Raichu, putting immense pressure on the buttons of a way too tight tank top. Purple, jiggling tit fat bulged out from the front of the strained fabric. She had only been here for so long, but already Pamela\u2019s nonstop eating of desserts was starting to show it\u2019s effects on her body. Veronica tried but failed to not look at the ridiculous amount of bare skin billowing of her new boss\u2019s skimpy shirt. She remembered another thing about the Nidoqueen that the Electric type didn\u2019t like - the Snorlax was allowed to wear whatever she wanted when she wanted! Shorts that showed off her massive fat ass and jiggling thighs and shirts that let her lard laced belly on full display to the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...yeah, Pam?\u201d went Veronica through a forced smile, the electric mouse type\u2019s cheeks sparking with energy as she looked at the annoyingly attractive yet plump face looking down ar her past the horizon of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo sorry to bother you and all, but we\u2019re out of boston-cream doughnuts. Oooh, and PB&amp;J doughnuts! And banana nut bread, and lemon cake...and basically just about everything really!\u201d Pamela confessed with a cutesy giggle and innocent smile, licking her fat paws clean of any crumbs leftover. The cake frosting on her chubby cheeks confirmed that she had just got done with eating absolutely everything in the kitchen before the lunch rush would come through the shop doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn't expect anything less from you, Pamela.\u201d Veronica grumbled, getting back to her cake. \u201cAnd I suppose you want me to go get the cooks from their lunch breaks and tell them to make another shop\u2019s worth of desserts so we have something to actually sell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela gave another giggle, making the buttons on her shirt strain even harder. \u201cSilly Veronica! No, it\u2019s all for meee~! I gotta finish \u2018taste testing\u2019 as much as I can before the day is out, you know. Have \u2018em ready for me by lunch, okay? I can\u2019t meet with the big man in charge in an empty stomach.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...sigh...sure thing, Pam.\u201d said Veronica with gritted teeth, getting a good look at the rest of Pamela\u2019s scandalous outfit as she walked away to find any more food she missed. Her tank top, held together flimsily by a couple of once fitting buttons, no longer stretched all the way to her fattened, dessert stuffed tummy spilling over the side of her shorts. Everything just...wobbled. The Raichu gave out a sigh and put the finishing touches on the kid\u2019s birthday cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! After all morning it\u2019s finally done. Gotta get someone to bring this to the little tyke\u2019s party.\u201d Veronica smiled as she looked over her work. A bright blue, double decker cake with the word\u2019s \u2018Happy B-Day Rolly!\u201d written in cursive on red frosting. Before she could pack it up, however, a pudgy purple paw snatched it away from the counter. Veronica blinked and looked up to see Pamela gripping both sides of the delicacy with a lick of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no no no no NO Pam! That was are only order for the entire month! C\u2019mon, it\u2019s a kid\u2019s birthday cake! Are you really so mean to eat-?\u201d Veronica didn't get to finish her sentence as the hungry Nidoqueen stuffed the ceremonial dessert into her happy mouth, eagerly gulping it down as frosting stained her face. \u201c...guess that answer my question\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela gave a very unladylike belch as she patted her full tummy happily. \u201cMmmm! So goooood! Thanks for the food Veronica, Birthday Cakes are the best. Well, except for Wedding Cakes, can\u2019t compete with that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPAM!\u201d Veronica shouted, a vein nearly popping out of her forehead. \u201cYou just ate our only order for the whole month! And it was a Riolu\u2019s birthday cake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know!...so?\u201d Pamela tilted her head with a smile, not getting the point of what was wrong with what she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Veronica sighed and took off her chef\u2019s apron.\u201dI\u2019m just going to gather the cooks before you literally eat us out of a place of work. Try not to ruin any other kid\u2019s dreams on their birthdays, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo promises!\u201d Pamela cheered with a wave goodbye as Veronica left the store.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry Baker was the sharp, fair, and youthful Zoroark founder and manager of Henry\u2019s Treats. He had inherited the store from his parents, who had it passed down from their parents, whose parents had given to them, and so on and then some. The name of the store changes each generation, although they always keep the motif \u2018Given Name\u2019s Things\u2019 in the title. This Generation was \u2018Henry\u2019s Treats\u2019, but the last generation it was \u2018Linda &amp; Jack\u2019s Baked Goods\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was also a secret chubby chaser, meaning he was attracted to women with bigger frames to be polite, meaning he liked big fat chicks to be blunt. When down on her luck Pamela stroller into his office and asked for a job, she was already putting in some weight after resorting to eating cheap fast food to stay above water. The crafty Zoroark\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw her and knew that with the right help she could get even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe late twenties-year-old manager grinned as the ever growing and widening Nidoqueen game into his office. \u201cThey're my most hardworking employee! Well, how was today\u2019s batch of food? Good, great, could be better?\u201d Henry asked with a genial smile, watching as the hedonistic Pokemon walked towards his desk. Her massive breasts jiggled in unison with her stomach on display for the world to see, her monumental thunder thighs and rump grinding against each other. Pamela sat her colossal ass down onto the chair in front of his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry knew that hiring Pamela was a bad idea. He wasn't oblivious to the fact that the store\u2019s profit has plummeted as Pamela\u2019s food intake soared. He knew she was hated by the others for how much special treatment she got. He just didn\u2019t care. He wasn't thinking with his heart or mind most days anymore. As of late, every decision he made for the store revolved around the object of his desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaww, thank you, boss! Let me think\u2026\u201d giggled the Nidoqueen coyly. \u201cI beat my personal record today! I cleared out the entire store before my lunch break, not after. They were all really good like always, but lately, I feel like the chefs have been a little skimpy making them. I mean just look, I\u2019m wasting away!\u201d The Nidoqueen lifted up her painted on the shirt to reveal her titanic tummy even more as it jutted out from her torso. She put both paws on either side and squished it, making it even more pronounced to the Zoroark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now\u2026\u201d Henry drooled at the sight of so much lard, so soft and wobbly. \u201cIt seems to me that you\u2019ve been putting a lot of initiative into your job! Keep this up, and you\u2019ll go far here! I think this warrants celebration!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore food?\u201d Smiled Pamela like the gluttonous Snorlax she was, her squashed stomach giving an ominous and deep gurgle of hunger, even though she ate enough to feed a starving family for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never told me you were a psychic, Pam!\u201d<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nAs time went on with Pamela\u2019s new job as a quality assurance tester and assistant manager of Henry\u2019s Treats, the busty Nidoqueen ate more and more of the mom &amp; pop shop\u2019s tasty pastries, and with each baked sweet she grew both in height and width. Another month has gone by for the store, and business had continued to flop, while Henry\u2019s most hardworking employee was to blame<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frame holding the door to Henry\u2019s office practically exploded as Pamela, bigger, taller, and fatter than ever, wiggles herself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess who's ready to bust some moves!\u201d said the gargantuan gal in glee as she waddled her way towards Henry\u2019s workspace, her footfalls creating miniature earthquakes along the floor. The store was no longer able to stay in business due to her actions and the boss's encouragement, and the ancestral bakery had filed for bankruptcy not too long ago, not that Henry particularly cared. It was all for the best cause in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the Zoroark organized one last get together before the bank would come in the morning, and everyone was invited. Veronica, who stood like a wallflower in the corner drinking spiked punch, looked at Pamela at frowned. There was the Pokemon that put her out of a job, and she was getting a party for it as a reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nidoqueen was in a dress, a dress that may have fitted her when she first got here. Henry found it amusing, Veronica rolled her eyes. It was a gift from Arceus to the employees who brought their kids that her belly was so full of blubber, it did a fantastic job of keeping her as decent as possibly better than a panty ever could. She was, in fact, wearing panties, but they were essentially squiggly lines compared to her bare, astronomical ass. Her top could only reach to the Nidoqueen cavernous middle, whilst cleavage bulged from all sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hefty Pamela giggled as she noticed the parents trying to cover their kid\u2019s eyes. A Riolu with the word \u2018Rolly\u2019 squigged on his nametag was pointing at her, trying to get his dad\u2019s attention. His dad just looked away, not wanting to deal with it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a bit of a tough month for Rolly the Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, it started on his birthday, the big one-oh, and his father took him to the bakery he worked at to place a special cake order. After cracking open his Tepiggy Bank, he put in all of the money he had earned from doing chores and little odd jobs for the neighbors to buy a big of a cake he could afford. He was looking forward to the treat, and could hardly keep his excitement at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan his father told him after school that he wouldn\u2019t get it. To his credit, Rolly is a tough and brave boy who often spared others if he was feeling sad, but that day a few tears were shed. Instead, he split a cupcake a friend had given him at school with his dad that night. And as the month went on, things started to get worse. His dad, Klaus, started to receive less and less money from his job at the bakery, putting a strain on the single fathers finances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the night Henry\u2019s Treats went Bankrupt, a few tears were shed. But there was good news, he had another job offer coming up, and if all goes well he would be making even more money than he did before. So, to celebrate, Klaus to his son Rolly to his job\u2019s one last party, a proper closing to a dark chapter in their lives. Of course, the Lucario in his optimism had completely forgotten about...her. So when Pamela waddled her fat ass into the office, he obviously didn\u2019t want to deal with her, the reason why he\u2019s being fired and who are his kid\u2019s birthday cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy, who\u2019s that chubby lady?\u201d Rolly pointed out the gargantuan Nidoqueen In The middle of the room, shaking the floorboards as she danced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus, however, thoroughly did not want to deal with her at all, so he just mumbled something incoherent and walked away, motioning for Rolly to follow him. However, the Riolu didn\u2019t. Instead, the small Pok\u00e9mon crawled down from his seat and made his way to the middle of the office to deal with what his father would\u2019nt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d Rolly greeted with a naive smile, speaking up so the Nidoqueen could hear him over the loud music. His teachers at school had been trying to get him to make new friends, and while his fellow peers may not be fruitful, maybe he should start with his dad\u2019s freinds. \u201cMy name\u2019s Rolly, Rolly the Riolu. What\u2019s your name Miss my dad\u2019s friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela came dangerously close to crushing the life out of the small Pok\u00e9mon as she heavily fell her fat paw onto the floor as she danced, making Rolly lose his balance and fall on his hindquarters. He looked up to see the imposing figure of the Nidoqueen smiling cheerfully above him. \u201cNawww! Aren\u2019t you just the cutest thing alive!\u201d Without asking for permission, she grabbed him by his waist and hoisted his body up into the air to get a better look at him. \u201cWhy, your so sweet I could just eat you up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh...thank you ma\u2019am!\u201d Riolu nervously giggled, not sure if the voluptuous Nidoqueen was being serious or not. \u201cI think you almost stomped on me earlier\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my little coconut dream pie, at my size things around me tend to bend and break.\u201d She booped the Little Riolu\u2019s nose with a pudgy index finger. \u201cAnd the smaller they are, the easier for me to crush them it is. And you, Rolly, are very, very small. Hmmm...why does that name sound familiar\u2026\u201d Pamela closed her eyes and thought hard while Rolly dangled in midair, completely at the whims of the bigger Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, You must be Klaus\u2019s kid!\u201d Pamela lit up as she remembered who the Little Riolu in front of her was. \u201cI ate your birthday cake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what?\u201d Rolly\u2019s eyes widened at this revelation. \u201cBut...Dad said that it got nailed to someone else on accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, nope! I definitely ate it up, and it was delicious!\u201d Pamela licked her lips, remembering the taste of the blueberry icing and chocolate base. However, she made a small frown when she noticed Rolly beginning to tear up. \u201cHey, don\u2019t be like that sugar plum. The cake isn\u2019t gone, your looking at it right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly wiped his eyes with a free paw and tilted his head in confusion, not sure what the pudgy lady was saying. Pamela explained. \u201cIt all went right here, see?\u201d Pamela directed the Riolu\u2019s vision down to her bulging belly, shaking and quivering as the Nidoqueen shook it for emphasis. \u201cSorry you had to wait so long to get it, vanilla cupcake. Happy belated birthday~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Rolly suddenly found himself squished up against the softest thing he ever felt as Pamela hugged the Riolu into her gut, as to get better acquainted with his birthday cake. Although confused at first, he eventually smiled and returned the embrace. It wasent as good as a birthday cake, but the Nidoqueen\u2019s belly was more comfortable than any bed or couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Silly me, I never gave you my name. How very rude of me.\u201d Pamela finally relented her hug and set Rolly back on the floor, a little dazed from the lack of air. \u201cMy name is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPamela!\u201d Klaus finally noticed that his son wasn't with him, and in fact was with his obese coworker. He rushed over to his son, thankful that he wasn\u2019t hurt but no less protective. \u201cPlease try not to suffocate my son!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Klaus, what perfect timing!\u201d Pamela greeted, completely ignoring the hostility that was coming from him. \u201cI was just about to ask you for a teeny favor. My landlord is kicking me out of my apartment since I spent all my money on food, so I need a place to crash at so I can get back on my paws. Henry said he would love to, but his wife wouldn\u2019t like it. Veronica said something that I don\u2019t think your banana muffin would like to hear. Soooo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus\u2019s jaw almost hit the floor at what Pamela was asking him. She, the cause of his financial troubles and why his son couldn\u2019t have a cake on his birthday, was seriously asking him to stay at his place?! No, no no no no no nooooooo! But before he could evan tell her that, Rolly had piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Dad?\u201d Klaus looked down at his son, with a pleading look in his eyes. \u201cPamela said that since she ate my Birthday Cake, she is my Birthday Cake. It\u2019ll be like mom is home again with three people living in the house, too. Pretty please with strawberry sprinkles on top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Klaus was a lot of things. He was damned good pastry chef, a whiz at his taxes, and reportedly very satisfactory in the bedroom. But above all of that, he was a father who hated to see his son sad. So, against his better judgment and a million red flags going off in his brain\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...alright.\u201d Klaus sighed, rubbing his son\u2019s ears. \u201cBut only for-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Pamela grabbed Klaus by his shoulders, catching him by surprise, and brought him into a hug like she had given his son. Only this time, the recipient\u2019s face was positioned into her heaving bosom than her belly, muffling sno sort of protest the Lucario made. \u201cDaww, thanks Klaus, your really doing me a solid here! Why don\u2019t we head back to your place and ditch this gig? I already raised the food table clean anyways.\u201d The hefty Nidoqueen hoisted yo the Riolu into the air as well, finding himself perched on top of her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the newly formed trio were on their way home. And life for the father and son would soon pan out to be very Interesting. In the days that followed Pamela settling into her new home...</span></div></div>",

As of late, she's had to face goons carrying actual riot shields instead of random debris. This makes those goons especially hard to deal with up front, so she's had to develop maneuvers to dispatch them as fast as possible. This exercise was the latest, and most brutal; stagger them by kicking them right in the shield, roll around to the other side and, while they're still stunned, bop'em in the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy the punching bag had endured twenty of these combos and counting, grunting a small <i>pumpf</i> with every blow. He was swinging in a pendulum-like motion almost constantly, the magnets holding him to the ceiling being the only thing keeping him from flying across the training room which he called home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJump kick, dodge roll, and punch once again, with Bertha's breath becoming slightly more labored. She sighed with slight disappointment; she was running low on energy, so she'd have to do the finale now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last kick, one last roll, and the Bertha paused. She breathed in deep and closed her eyes, allowing herself to relax somewhat. Her dreads rose as she allowed her aura to flow through her, and she stiffened once again with a clench of her fists. On cue, her entire musculature began to visibly expand; what was once buried under a layer of fluff surged outward into mountains and ravines of taught flesh, and a chorus of cracks echoed throughout the room as they collided and released. In a flash, she was a good half wider than she was before, and with a powerful scream she thrust her fist straight into Sandy's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt <i>this</i> blow, his magnets could hold no longer. He was ripped right from his roots and soared across the floor, slamming right into the wall before slumping to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha stood triumphant for a glorious five seconds... before collapsing into exhaustion as her body deflated back to normal. She could feel sweat caking her fur by the gallon, and every bone in her body was wracked with pain. It was clear that she could stand to lay off the poffins for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't mull on that thought for long, for she then heard a fast-paced knocking on the door. She would typically say to wait for her to get back on her feet, but these knocks gave an air of a rather serious situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... done! You can... come in...!\" Bertha announced between each breath, her breathing falling back to normal but still panting somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door beside her proceeded to swing wide open, and in the vacant frame stood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Professor Gretchen Lowes</b></u>:<br>\r\nA short, shrimpy dunsparce madame who specializes in the history of Johto.

Still too winded to talk much, she said nothing as he bent down and offered her a gym towel and a bottle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said through ragged breath, shifting to a kneeling position and taking each item in hand. She winced. Even basic movement made her arms scream in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Infernape's grin faltered a bit. \"Had a feeling you'd be done with your training right about now, so I figured I'd bring you a little something,\" he said, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha bit off the bottle cap and chugged half of the water in one go. Ahh, refreshment. Everything hurt like hell, but at least her thirst was quenched. \"Your timing's getting better Lazlo,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Lazlo stood up. \"Um, I'd ask if you'd like any help getting up, buuut...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so.\" He strolled over to Sandy, hands clasped behind his back. Bertha heard him mutter, \"Ooh, that musta hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a punching bag. It can't feel pain,\" she said. Her breathing was a little more even now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but poor ol' Sandy's gonna retire early at the rate you're going.\" Lazlo seemed to take notice of something, judging by how he leaned closer. A tear, perhaps. \"Or die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha had to scoff at that. \"No wonder you never show raiders any mercy; you spend it all on inanimate objects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, they're evil. They deserve it.\" Lazlo raised his hands in defense. \"'Sides, I save some for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I appreciate that.\" Bertha stood up slowly. Ow, ow. Stop hurting, legs. Ow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have made quite the pained expression, as Lazlo frowned and asked, \"You sure you're good to move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Bertha grunted. The pain was fading, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look fine.\" Lazlo sighed. \"Look--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not learning Bulk Up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flinched but was otherwise unfazed. \"Oh c'mon, a smaller boost has to be worth not hurting yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulk-Up causes strain too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha sighed. She looked at the towel in hand for a moment, then dried her head and neck. How many times would she have to say no before he finally listened? Yes, rapid body expansion took its toll, but she needed <i>some</i> kind of secret weapon. Now more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence continued as Lazlo set Sandy back up on the cable. Bertha dried the rest of herself off. At least, she dried what she could. Ugh. Well, she planned on showering anyway. She moved to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, turned to Lazlo. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis expression brightened. \"I got approval to join you on the expedition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" He grinned from ear to ear. The flame on his head flared up a bit. \"We're gonna kick some serious ass together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha couldn't help but smirk at his enthusiasm. Still a kid at heart, this one. \"You'll be doing most of that. They need me to help with the excavation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if they were bringing Lazlo then there was a strong chance the team was in for quite the raid. Possibly even multiple raids. Either way, she'd be getting her fair share of the action. And depending on how many goons attacked at once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what she lacked in mobility she made up for endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go shower,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I'ma get some training in.\" Lazlo assumed a boxing stance and started pummeling Sandy with a rapid flurry of punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha shook her head. Quick to the punch, quick to change moods... Did he ever slow down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smell caught her attention. She sniffed an armpit and cringed. Right, better do something about that.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">At one point, there was an interactive on this site about anthropomorphic Pok\u00e9mon undergoing various forms of expansion. Said interactive and its creator have been gone for some time, so I decided to revitalize the concept in my own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe setting is an alternate universe of the Pok\u00e9mon world: humans are replaced with anthro 'Mons, while normal animals take the place of the regular 'Mons. (It raises some potential ethical questions, I know, but it's better than having the anthros eat meat from feral versions of themselves.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattles are about the same, minus Trainers. The league basically works like in the anime. Gyms too, though they also double as workout gyms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, it's pretty much the same world; same geography, same towns and cities, same habitats... You get the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">And now for the guidelines.</font></b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs stated in the short description, this interactive will be quality controlled. This means I'll be keeping a close eye on things to make sure this interactive doesn't get bogged down with low quality additions and excessive choice chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>So what am I looking for in additions? Well...<br>\r\n</u><br>\r\n--The format works like this: pick your character, then your type of expansion, and then the cause of said expansion. After that, <i>get straight to the story.</i> Any additional setup should be within the story itself.<br>\r\n--Once the story's started, try to avoid chapters that only exist to provide choices. I'll allow some leeway if several choices are introduced within the narrative and you don't have enough room to put all the options in a single addition. Ideally, though, I'd like to keep these situations to a minimum.<br>\r\n--Okay. Writing quality. This is the big one. I won't demand absolute perfection, but I will ask for a considerable amount of effort. You won't need to cut it close with the character limit in every addition, but you will need to write more than one or two short paragraphs. These may be fetish stories, but they're still <i>stories.</i> They need sufficient content if they're gonna be any good.<br>\r\n--And no, writing a whole bunch of small chapters will <i>not</i> compensate for a lack of content in each individual chapter. Quantity is not an acceptable substitute for quality.<br>\r\n--No sloppiness with the spelling, grammar, or formatting. Double-check your work, and use paragraph breaks.<br>\r\n--Seriously, I can't stress paragraph breaks enough.<br>\r\n<b>--EDIT 07/04/2020:</b> I'm sorry for not making this part explicit, but I reserve the right to delete any additions that I do not consider up to standard. I'm not just blowing smoke when I say this is quality controlled. If you're not sure of your addition's quality, please have a proofreader double check it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>As for the actual story content...</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--I'll allow multiple types of expansion to occur within the same story. Just make sure there's an option to pass on it. No forcing additional fetishes on the reader, in other words.<br>\r\n--Expansion can be undone if desired, but again, no forcing it on the reader.<br>\r\n--Motives for and/or causes of expansion are allowed to change within the framework of the story. (e.g., accidental weight gain becomes willing, willing breast expansion becomes unwilling, etc)<br>\r\n--All characters that undergo expansion and/or take part in sexual activities must be at least 18 years old.<br>\r\n--As a result, pedophilia's pretty much off the table.<br>\r\n--Scat and watersports are also forbidden.<br>\r\n--Dark subject matter like rape and abuse are allowed to be explored within the story. Just... Handle with care, okay? It's touchy stuff. Leave content warnings, just to be safe.<br>\r\n--On a lighter note, same-sex relationships are A-OK! And yes, that applies to both males and females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that should do it. I realize I'm asking a lot, but don't think this means I'm demanding absolute perfection! I'm still just a novice myself, after all. Just try your best and have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, P.S. If you want to discuss something concerning the interactive, feel free to hit me up!</td>",
