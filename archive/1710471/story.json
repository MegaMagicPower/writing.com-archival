You act as Gandalf's spy in Mordor. You speak spider, which is how you managed to befriend Shelob and convince her to let you use the tunnel without her eating you. You use a bow with poisoned arrows,poisoned arrows, it is said, which come from the venom of Shelob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps you are Shurduk, The good half troll. You do not have the bloodthirsty and harsh characteristics of your fellows and for that you have been thrown out of the land of Harad where you lived. You are not like your fellows, you do not turn to stone in sunlight, but during the day you can choose for your torso to turn to stone. This makes for strong armour. You went north to the land of gondor and came across some rangers of the North. They would have killed you if their captain, Aragorn had not stopped them, saying \"This creature bears no weapon, we should ask him his intentions\" The rangers heard your story and their captain, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, took pity on you. He sent you to Rivendell where Elrond also pitied you and let you stay there. you have the strength of ten men and carry a two handed axe in one hand, you also carry an 8ft longsword and a shield. You also carry a bow and poisoned arrows. You are a master with poison as you grew up learning about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you are Fralas, The elven king of Harandor. It is rumoured that you are descended from Turgon himself. He is a stronger fighter even than Aragorn himself. He is more stubborn than Gimli and they often argue. Often, you duel to settle disputes. You think this is what makes you a good king. You are wrong. You are a good king because you always put your people before yourself. You are gifted in magic and carry a staff and a bow that is made of Mithril.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps you are Murder, The daughter of Sauron. You escaped from Mordor when you were young with the help of your brother Marduk. He took you to Rivendell. There you learned the arts of the elves and decided to join them against Mordor. You know the pass of Cirith Ungol just like your brother and he taught you to speak spider too. You use no weapon, \"Fists are all the weapons I need\" you can cast magic. But have no need of a staff. Although Gandalf makes you use one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nOr perhaps you will chose your own character and weapons. You decide, Even the smallest person can change the course of the future. Follow the basic storyline but apart from that make it as unconventional as you like.</span></div></div>",

You were going to help them to get into Mordor and to the crack of doom. You were looking forward to seeing your sister Murder again. No doubt she would challenge you to an unarmed combat match. You worried about her. She is a bit of a hot head and if she doesn't keep her mind on task she could end up getting herself killed. You knew that she was just as well trained in each of the weapons as in unarmed combat. You knew that you had no cause to worry and that she had made lots of friends. It was partly because of Murder that you had not been killed yet. Elrond would have killed you on the spot if Murder hadn't stopped him one night when you came to visit her. Now you were spying in Mordor so as to get all the information you could. You recently heard that the nine had left Minas Morgul and you had no doubt why. The ring had been found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to destroy the ring, and you knew you would be the only one who could do it. Suddenly, You saw someone you knew.</span></div></div>",

She fouund they were light enough not to slow her punches. \"Mithril is as light as a feather and as hard as a dragon scale, I even added some enchantments so that you won't feel the weight of it at all, it'll be exactly the same as you normally fight, but you'll be ten times more deadly\" Murder hugged you. As she hugged you, the spikes scraped your back. \"Careful\" you grunted \"those spikes are sharp\" Murder withdrew. \"There's one other thing, give me one of the gauntlets\" Murder handed you one of the gauntlets. You closed your fist and pressed an indent on the palm. A blade shot from the knuckles. \"I utilized the twilight realm to store that blade, when activated, it comes out of the twilight realm and attatches itself there, as it spent time in the twilight realm, it never rusts, never ages, it will stay exactly the same\" You retract the blade. \"Now, would you like to see if you can beat me in a duel, or will we go to the council\"</span></div></div>",

Several elves had gathered around to watch you fight. Many of them had fought you before, none of them had been able to beat you. Arwen was there to referee. She pointed her sword into the air, then brought it down. This signalled the start of the duel. You and Murder circled each other, ready to strike at the other's weakness. You feinted a stumble to get Murder to charge. She took the bait and charged you. You sidestepped her and kicked her down. You put the point of the sword between her shoulder blades. You had one this round. \"Marduk wins round one\" said Arwen. Murder got up and retreated to twenty steps away. \"Two more rounds to go\" said Murder \"I can still win this\" You grinned. \"Don't bet on it\" you say, holding one sword out in front of you with the other above your head. Arwen's sword came up again. It went down and the second round began. This time, you charged. two blades came from Murder's weapons. She thrust one of her fists at you. You parried the blow before striking with your other sword. She brought her blade into contact with your sword, pushing it back. You matched her strength. As you concentrated, you almost missed the attack from Murder's other weapon. You met her blade with your other sword. Sparks were flying from your weapons now, but neither of you were wavering. You had to do something as this was draining your energy. Your thoughts were interrupted as Murder's blades retracted into her Fists of Death, she dropped to her knees, grabbed your wrists and threw you over her head onto your back. You were so shocked it took you a few moments to realise you had lost the round. Murder pulled off one of the gauntlets and helped you up. \"Round three?\"</span></div></div>",

Soon, the blade in your left hand was locked with both of Murder's blades. She pushed hard against it, then grinned. Pulling one of her hands away, she knocked your blade from the side. The blade flew out of your hand. Murder stepped back and removed her left Fist of Death. You now both had only one weapon. You gripped the multi-purpose elven blade in two hands. You charged again, at the same time that Murder charged. At the last moment, you twisted out of the way, stuck out your leg and tripped Murder up. You went to put your sword between her shoulder blades as before, but she rolled over and hit your sword from the side, with enough force to knock it from your hand. She again got up, retreated, and threw away her other Fist of Death. Now you were both weaponless. The only weapons you had were your fists. You had once chastised Murder for using no weapon. Now she had put you in a position to have to fight without one too. \"That round was a draw\" said Arwen \"Round four to choose the winner\"</span></div></div>",

Murder nodded and you both raced towards the council chamber. When you got there, you both sat down next to each other. \"Good of you to join us\" said Elrond \"Now, you have all been called here to decide the fate of the One Ring\" A hobbit came forward and placed the ring on a stone in the center. \"The Ring cannot stay here\" said Elrond \"Gandalf has brought great tidings from Orthanc, Saruman the White has betrayed us\" There were murmurs of disbelief, shock, even anger at this statement. You had heard Sauron had a new ally, you just didn't think it was Saruman. \"Then there's only one thing we can do then\" said Murder \"The ring must be destroyed\" \"That would be suicide\" you say \"The only way to destroy the ring is to cast it into the fires from whence it came, the fires of Mt Doom\" You felt a shudder move around the room at the name. On the slopes of this mountain, Gilgalad, High King of the Elves was slain, as was Elendil, King of Gondor. It was here that Isildur, son of the king, cut the ring from Sauron's hand and in doing so, defeated him. Elrond had been present at this battle, he urged Isildur to destroy the ring then and there, but Isildur was already under the Ring's influence. He carried it with him on his return to Gondor, but was ambushed and the ring fell from his grasp, lost. This was the last you had heard of the ring.

Arwen sat astride her horse, yours alongside it. You quickly climbed onto the horse and nodded to her. Both horses galloped across the Bruinen and galloped off on the road towards Bree. <br>\r\n\"Aragorn is a ranger,\" said Arwen \"He will not stick to the roads, he knows they will most likely be followed on them, we need to search the wilderness between here and Weathertop,\" <br>\r\nYou nodded, veering your horse off the road and trying to find the trail of the group while following a common search pattern. <br>\r\nYou and Murder had used this pattern when hunting when they had escaped from Mordor.

Their horses reared, surprised. \"I warned you\" you say \"Leave, that first volley was a warning, the next volley will be for the kill\" The Witch King came to the fore of his riders. \"You shall pay for thissss\" said the Witch King, his voice, like the many poisonous snakes of your homeland, was dripping with poison.

If they had continued, you would have had to fight. Before the Ringwraiths had reached Bree, you had set up slings in the bushes, fitting many arrows into the slings. You had then tied a piece of string through them all and left it next to you while you confronted the Ringwraiths. It had been a clever strategy, but if they had continued, you would have had to fight to stop them. You collected your slings and string and headed back to the bush to wait for Aragorn. Little did you know, the Ringwraiths came back and tried to attack the Ring bearer and his companions. Aragorn had found them first, you saw as they left Bree, but that tale is for another time.

You said nothing. Saruman the White, leader of the Order of Wizards, was on the side of good. Why would he be chasing Aragorn? \"Why does he seek the Ring bearer?\" you asked, after all, it would make more sense.

He does not know the way into mordor. \"I wil help you\" you say. \"I know of a secret way into Mordor, but the road is perilous and we may not survive\" \"I will also come\" said Gandalf. \"You carry the fate of us all little one\" said Boromir \"I will follow you to whatever end\" Aragorn son of Arathorn stepped forward \"You have my sword\" He said. \"And you have my bow\" said your friend Legolas. \"And my axe\" said Legolas's friend Gimli, You had often wondered why Legolas and Gimli were such good friends, but you decided to just accept it. Then three more hobbits came out of hiding to stand by the other hobbits side, declaring that they were coming too. Elrond considered and then sent one of the hobbits, Peregrin Took(pippin), home. He protested but Elronds decision was final. You wondered if they knew the peril they were getting themselves into. Pippin might be the lucky one. That night you and Gandalf discussed which route to take. \"We could take the road to the Morgul Vale and the pass of Cirith Ungol\" You suggested \"I can speak to Shelob to let us through\" \"It's too dangerous!!\" said Gandalf. \"I have heard that Sauron has taken Minas Morgul\" \"That is sad news indeed\" You say. \"But what other choice do we have?\" \"We could assemble all our allies and try and create a diversion\" said Gandalf. \"Mordor is still impenetrable\" you argue. \"I need to think of another plan then\" said Gandalf \"Your plan would not work\" \"One thing is for certain, the ring cannot stay here\" You say \"We don't have the strength here to fight both Mordor and Isengard\" \"We should move out by morning\"agreed Gandalf.</span></div></div>",

Fear. You had heard rumours of Fangorn Forest. An old hobbit tale talked about the trees coming alive. You hoped that the hobbits tales were not true. \"We have to go in then\" said Legolas. He then started towards the forest. You pulled out your staff \"Iluvi\" The tip of the staff lit up. They started into the forest. However, a little way into the forest, something strange happened. \"Their trail end here\" said Aragorn \"How could they just vanish?\" You suddenly heard a strange noise. A cloak getting caught on a branch. \"Aragorn, eth no eldas\" said Legolas, speaking in elvish, translating as there's something out there. \"What do you see\" said Aragorn, also in elvish. \"The white wizard approaches\" said Legolas. \"Do not let him speak, or he'll put a spell on us\" replied Aragorn. You aimed your staff and got ready. Then, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli attacked the wizard in the clearing. You came out of hiding. \"Duck\" you shouted. The trio dived out of the way. Fire shot from your staff at the wizard. The light surrounding the wizard increased in brightness and you were forced to put your hand over your eyes, breaking your concentration and ending the spell. You slumped down onto the ground, exhausted. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli had been similarly beaten. \"You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits\" said the wizard. You were confused. If this was Saruman, they would have been dead already. \"Where are they?\" shouted Aragorn. The wizards voice changed. \"They passed this way, the day before yesterday, they met someone they did not expect\" replied the wizard. Your eyes narrowed. The only person you'd ever heard say that was Gandalf. \"Gandalf?\" you asked. The light masking the wizards appearance faded to reveal the smiling face of Gandalf. \"You fell\" said Aragorn. \"Wait\" you say \"What happened between here and when I left Lothlorien?\" \"Gandalf went back to kill the Balrog\" said Legolas \"He managed to destroy it, but died\" \"So why is he here if he died?\" you say. Gandalf tells you the story. About how he was brought back to finish the task of destroying the ring. He told Aragorn that Merry and Pippin were with the Ents and were safe. </span></div></div>",

In less than a day, you reached Edoras. \"The lady Eowyn stands on the steps of the Royal court\" you say, your keen eyes picking out the figure clothed in a white dress, standing on the steps in front of Edoras. As you spoke, a flag floated down beside you. \"Apparently, she saw you too\" said Aragorn \"It is an old custom of the Rohirrin to let their flags go to ask for aid from travellers\" \"We should make haste\" you said. You rode through the front arch of Edoras and up to the Golden Hall of Meduseld. A man garbed in the clothes of a captain came through the doors of Meduseld. \"I cannot allow you to go before Theoden King so armed, by order of Grima Wormtounge\" You handed over your staff, your sword and all the weapons that you hardly ever used. This captain didn't realise that you were so proficient in fighting without weapons. As this happened, you realsied that Gandalf had not handed over his own staff. \"Your staff, hand it over\" said the captain. \"You would not part an old man from his walking stick\" said Gandalf. You almost laughed. The crafty old man. The captain walked into the hall and the five of you followed. As you walked up the hall, you noticed the old king sitting on his throne. Theoden looked older than his years. Next to him was a small man dressed in black. You dug your nails into your palm in anger. You saw no magic around this man, but he reminded you of an Uruk Hai. He was whispering to the king. He then got up and came towards you. \"Late is the hour when this conjurer chooses to appear\" said the man. \"Be silent, keep your forked tounge behind your teeth\" He then revealed his staff. A look of fear appeared in the man's eyes. \"His staff, I told you to take the wizard's staff\" Several men ran from either side. One of them tried to cut you in half. You jumped over the swrd and kicked your assailants sword arm. He dropped the sword to the ground. You then punched him in the head, knocking him out. As you looked to the throne, you heard all sounds of battle cease. Theoden was laughing. \"You have no power here Gandalf  the Grey\" Gandalf threw off his grey cloak to reveal a white one underneath. Theoden was thrown against the back of his throne. Then, Theoden started to collapse. Eowyn ran to support him. Theoden seemed to get younger before your very eyes. \"You did it Gandalf\" you say.  </span></div></div>",

The area had many discarded and broken weapons. The area had many Rohirrin weapons brought in for repairs, but it was also where the Uruk-hai weapons recovered from the battle where Th\u00e9oden's son Theodred was slain. You had seen how the Uruks fought. You borrowed an several Uruk swords and one Uruk shield, and returned to the training area. <br>\r\n\"In order to learn how to fight against an Uruk hai, you must learn how to fight against their weapons,\" you shouted, dropping several of the Uruk weapons and hefting the last in your hand, also taking a shield \"Eowyn, do you wish to demonstrate again?\" <br>\r\nEowyn turned, getting ready with her own sword. You blocked with the flat of the Uruk hai blade. <br>\r\n\"The blade is wide and flat,\" you said \"It will be able to block any attack coming from the side of it's sword hand, not all of them carry shields, but the ones that do will be able to block an attack coming from that side too, you have to press your attack until you find an opening, their armour is weak at the neck, and under the arms.\" <br>\r\nAs you talked, you fought as you expected an Uruk would. <br>\r\n\"Their numbers will be large, it will look daunting, but my skill is far greater than an Uruk, if you can beat me, Eowyn, you should be able to defeat an Uruk.\" <br>\r\nEowyn brought her sword down extremely hard on your shield. It shattered. You didn't feel much from the hit, but you didn't. <br>\r\n\"Taking away an advantage they have over you definitely makes sense,\" you say \"Most of them will not have shields to begin with, however.\" <br>\r\nYou put both hands onto your uruk sword and attacked again, pushing Eowyn back with the ferocity of your attack. <br>\r\n\"The Uruks will be fierce, and attack without mercy,\" you said, your voice carrying over the battle. Eowyn defended with her sword, using the distraction to trip you. Still playing the part of the Uruk, you allowed her leg to come into contact with yours, but didn't budge. Eowyn went down. <br>\r\n\"The Uruks will have heavy boots on their feet, tripping them isn't a great strategy,\" you said \"It was a good try though.\" <br>\r\n\"Then how would you suggest we beat them?\" asked Eowyn as she was pushed back<br>\r\n\"Let's take a break,\" you said, returning to the pile of uruk weapons and shields \"That is something you'll have to work out for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the break, you took up the position to fight Eowyn again. This time, Eowyn found an opening and sliced for your head. You blocked it just in time. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" you said \"That attack would have killed at Uruk Hai, hit the armour at the head, under the arms, or hit the boots with your sword, they wouldn't be able to hold up to it.\" <br>\r\n\"Was that the point of this session?\" asked Eowyn \"To teach me to strike at the vulnerable armour points? Why didn't you leave it at telling us where to strike?\" <br>\r\n\"The skill level I was using,\" you said \"Was way above what I would expect an uruk hai to fight at, I did it this way because if you can find an opening in my defence if I'm fighting like an uruk hai, you should have no problem finding one when fighting against a real uruk hai, the uruks will have a lot more armour than I do, so I blocked those points more, when you attack a real uruk, they won't need to guard themselves, they'll be able to attack more freely, just try to aim for the weak points in the armour, and you should all be fine.\" <br>\r\nYou looked around. Many of the women Eowyn had called had left, they apparently didn't wish to fight anymore. <br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said one of the warriors \"For training us, we'll be able to train on our own now.\" <br>\r\n\"I've got to go check the defences,\" you said \"To find out where I'd be best positioned to cast magic on the enemy, I'll watch for any sign of the enemy coming, and inform the king if I see them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went up to the wall and walked along it, looking for the best vantage point. </span></div></div>",

Looking through the weapons made for men, you chose a heavy sword. While you usually required no weapon, using only your fists against the uruk hai would hurt your hands.

Helms Deep was well fortified against attack from all sides. The mountains around it made attack over that way impossible. The only way into Helms Deep was through the same way the Rohirrin had entered. As such, once battle commenced, the Rohirrin would be unable to escape, it would either be a great victory, or a total defeat. <br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said a small voice. You looked around to see a young Rohirrin girl, only about sixteen or seventeen, standing behind you \"My name is Hannah, I saw your weapons demonstration, I'd like to help to defend Helms Deep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt broke your heart to see one so young volunteering to the battle, and it was partly through your actions that she had. <br>\r\n\"Do you have a weapon?\" you asked. She unsheathed a sword, passing it to you \"Have you fought before, Hannah?\" <br>\r\n\"Never,\" she said \"But I guess, I was inspired by your weapons demonstration.\" <br>\r\n\"Here, take it back,\" you said, handing her the sword and pulling out your own. <br>\r\nHannah gripped the sword correctly, and prepared herself. <br>\r\n\"Now,\" you said \"You heard my lesson, in order to defeat an uruk hai, you must strike at the neck, shoulders or knees, those are the only weak points in their armour. Understand?\" <br>\r\nHannah nodded. <br>\r\n\"Good, let's begin,\" You charged at Hannah, your sword going for her side. She blocked it at the very last minute, sending you off-balance, before disengaging with her sword and bringing it into contact with your neck, then stopped. <br>\r\n\"For someone who's never used a sword before,\" you said \"You are pretty good, very few people block with such precision at the right time to pull off a move like that.\" <br>\r\nHannah blushed. \"I watch a lot of the men practice fighting a lot, I guess their technique must have rubbed off on me.\" <br>\r\n\"No,\" you said \"I only know a few people who can block like that, and they're all elves, you, Hannah, are a natural, in fact, if your interested, I'm watching for the enemy right now, I could do with someone to run messages for me, would you do that? Then, during the battle, we could fight together.\" <br>\r\n\"I like the sound of that,\" said Hannah \"Do you want me to take any messages right now?\" </span></div></div>",

You learned that her father was one of the Rohan Royal Guard, personal protector of the king, and her, her two older brothers, and her mother helped to tend to the stables for the Guard's horses. When her brothers got older, they would always play fight with toy weapons, and then her brothers joined the guard. Although she had wanted to join too, she was not yet old enough. She continued play fighting with her brothers when they were off duty. Her brothers were still in the Royal Guard, and still protected the King. In exchange, you told her a part of your own story, how you were raised in Rivendell, trained in magic by Gandalf, and eventually, went on the quest for the ring, which pretty much brought her up to the present. <br>\r\n\"You haven't told me everything,\" stated the extremely perceptive Hannah.<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't,\" you said \"There are some parts of my past that I feel ashamed to talk about, it would only dampen both our spirits before the battle.\" <br>\r\n\"O.K,\" Hannah accepted \"Promise you will tell me after the battle?\" <br>\r\n\"I promise,\" you said.

You took Aragorn off the horse and onto you own shoulders, carrying him so the horse could be relieved of its burden. He stirred as he was transferred, and as you ran back towards the gates, he woke up. His horse followed you at its own pace, able to keep up now it was not carrying him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the gates, refugees were all around shouting \"Hes alive.\" You set Aragorn on his feet, still allowing him to lean on you as you heard Gimli's voice. <br>\r\n\"Where is he, I'm going to kill him.\" Gimli emerged from the crowd. <br>\r\n\"You,\" he said \"Are the luckiest, canniest, the most desperate man I ever knew, bless you Aragorn.\" <br>\r\nAragorn patted Gimli on the shoulder \"Where is the king?\" Gimli gestures in the direction of the hall. As you and Aragorn make for the hall, your path is again blocked by Legolas. <br>\r\n\"Your late,\" said Legolas, in elvish \"You look terrible.\" Legolas gives Aragorn the pendant recovered at the battle. Aragorn smiles, and thanks Legolas in elvish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you entered the hall, still supporting Aragorn, he told Th\u00e9oden of what he saw. <br>\r\n\"A great host, you say?\" asked Th\u00e9oden<br>\r\n\"All Isengard is emptied,\" said Aragorn <br>\r\n\"How many?\" asked Th\u00e9oden <br>\r\n\"Ten thousand strong at least,\" Aragorn replied  <br>\r\n\"Ten thousand!?\" exclaimed Th\u00e9oden, disbelievingly<br>\r\n\"It is an army bred for a single purpose,\" you said \"To destroy the world of men.\" <br>\r\n\"That's not all,\" said Aragorn \"It is rumoured that Saruman himself rides with his armies.\" <br>\r\n\"Saruman is coming here?\" asked Th\u00e9oden \"Then we are lost.\" <br>\r\n\"We can still fight,\" you say \"Saruman the White is powerful, but so am I, I can use my own magic to counter his advantage, it's your decision, King Th\u00e9oden, but I'm just telling you so you know your options.\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever you decide,\" said Aragorn \"Some dark sorcery spurs these creatures on, they will be here by nightfall.\" <br>\r\n\"Let them come,\" said Th\u00e9oden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went out of the hall, and addressed his captains \"I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms, to be ready for battle by nightfall.\" <br>\r\nTh\u00e9oden then turns to you, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli \"We'll cover the causeway, and the gate from above, no army has ever breached the Deeping Wall, or set foot inside the Hornburg.\" <br>\r\n\"This is no rabble of mindless orcs,\" said Gimli \"These are Uruk Hai. Their armour is thick, and their shields broad.\" <br>\r\n\"I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf,\" said Th\u00e9oden \"I know how to defend my own keep.\" <br>\r\n\"I can work magic from my original watching post on the Hornburg,\" you said \"If I can take out Saruman, I will.\" <br>\r\n\"Saruman's forces will break on this fortress like water on rock,\" said Th\u00e9oden \"They will pillage and burn, we've seen it before. Crops can be resown, homes rebuilt. We will outlast them.\"<br>\r\n\"They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops and villages,\" said Aragorn, his voice rising a little \"They come to destroy its people, down to the last child!\" <br>\r\n\"What would you have me do?\" asked Th\u00e9oden \"Look at my end. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be their end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.\" <br>\r\n\"Send out riders, my lord,\" said Aragorn \"Rohan must call for aid.\" <br>\r\n\"And who would come?\" asked Th\u00e9oden \"Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.\"<br>\r\n\"Gondor will answer,\" said Aragorn<br>\r\n\"Gondor,\" said Th\u00e9oden, his voice again angry \"Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was Gon...\" Th\u00e9oden stopped. <br>\r\n\"No, my lord Aragorn, we are on our own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTh\u00e9oden walked away, calling orders \"Get the women and children into the caves.\" <br>\r\nAs men rush to secure the gate, you head back to your post on the Hornburg, dropping by the weapons store on your way to collect your staff.

You immediately recognised Galadriel in elegant white armour. <br>\r\n\"Long ago,\" said Galadriel \"An alliance existed between our peoples. We fought and died together. We come to honour that alliance, here at Helm's Deep, and in the remainder of the War of the Ring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn, Legolas, Gimli and you bow to Galadriel. Then Aragorn welcomed the group in Elvish. <br>\r\nThen, Haldir said \"We are proud to fight alongside men once more.\" <br>\r\nIt took a few hours, but the elves and men were positioned on the battlements, ready for battle. You conversed with Galadriel. <br>\r\n\"Saruman rides with the Uruk hai,\" you said \"I put on a good show of being up for fighting against him, but I'm an Istari in training, and he's the head of the order, if I could have stood up to his magic, it wouldn't have been for long.\" <br>\r\n\"Do not despair, Murder,\" said Galadriel \"I foresaw Saruman's presence here, so came with my armies to fight alongside you.\" <br>\r\n\"I've got the Hornburg covered,\" you say \"I can defend it with my magic and it's a good position to cast from, you'll fight with your warriors on the main gate?\" <br>\r\n\"I will,\" said Galadriel \"Elladan and Elrohir shall aid you in defending the Hornburg.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you an angel?\" asked Hannah of Galadriel. You'd sent her to find out if the elves needed any provisions. Galadriel laughed. \"Who's this? I thought all the Rohirrin women and children were sent to the caves.\" <br>\r\n\"She wanted to fight,\" you said \"I said she could carry messages for me and fight alongside me in the battle, she is an extremely gifted fighter, her name is Hannah.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, Hannah,\" said Galadriel \"I am not an angel, but I hope my presence at the battle will bring the same thing an angel brings.

You saw Eowyn on the Deeping Wall, rallying the troops to yell in defiance. They did, yelling abuse at the orcs and cheering. The uruk leader put his hand up, then blew his horn. And all hell broke loose. The Uruks charged. Many carried ladders which were raised to the Deeping Wall. You aimed your staff, then concentrated. A wave of energy came from your staff, smashing each ladder as some uruks got halfway up. However, your spell didn't extend very far, so a few ladders stayed up and several uruks managed to get over the walls. The ones that had been on the ladders fell to the ground, many of them dying or injured to the point they could not continue. More ladders were brought up and they again brought them up to the walls. Before you could fire again, a fireball came at your position from below. You immediately cast a powerful shield around the area you were at. The fireball was absorbed by the shield, the energy added to your staff. You fired the absorbed fireball at a group of uruk hai, destroying both them and their ladder before they could reach the walls.

Just as an Uruk shield wall hiding a battering ram started up the causeway. <br>\r\n\"Murder, can you do something about this?\" asked Elrohir, casually, dropping down beside his twin, also drawing two elven blades. <br>\r\nYou aimed with your staff, and jumped over the twins heads, doing two somersaults in the air, and slamming your staff down. A shockwave emanated out from where you landed, smashing most of the shields in the shield wall but not killing any of them. <br>\r\n\"You know, you could have killed them,\" said Elladan. <br>\r\n\"I don't need to,\" you said, gesturing to the wall, where the elf archers on the walls were already taking aim.

A bolt of blue lightning shot from the end of the staff at the uruk hai in the centre of the party. The lightning forked to the other twelve uruk hai in the party, causing them all to collapse to the ground, dead. <br>\r\nYou ran through the centre of them, firing more spells from your staff at other groups of uruk hai as you looked around for Saruman.

Saruman was using an area cloaking spell. There was some form of weapon hidden in the area Saruman was concentrating on. <br>\r\nYou aimed your staff at Saruman and fired a second spell at him. This one was far more powerful than the cloaking spell, and it knocked him through several of his own uruk hai, killing them as he came to rest on his back. As several uruk hai tried to attack you, now more of them had taken notice of you, Elladan and Elrohir battled them, leaving a ring around you and Saruman clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaruman got to his feet, using his staff to aid him. <br>\r\n\"This is all pointless, you know,\" said Saruman \"While you fight a war here, defending this thatched barn, the Dark Lord musters his armies to take all Middle Earth, we will rule together.\" <br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" you asked \"You seriously think that my father will share power with you? Then your crazier than I thought.\" <br>\r\nYou and Saruman began to circle each other, keeping the same distance. <br>\r\n\"It is the leaders of men who do not know that their war is already lost,\" said Saruman \"They are outnumbered and outflanked, I shall crush Rohan, and his armies shall crush Gondor, the world of men will fall.\" <br>\r\n\"I thought I might be able to talk you round to our way of thinking,\" you said \"But it seems obvious that that's not going to happen.\" <br>\r\nAnd then you did something that Saruman did not expect. You laid your staff on the ground. <br>\r\n\"I have no need of a weapon,\" you said \"I'll beat you without the aid of my staff.\" <br>\r\n\"Then you shall die,\" said Saruman. His staff glowed with blue light, and a bolt of blue lightning shot towards you. It stopped in its path about a foot away from you, as a bright, white orb of light appeared around you. <br>\r\n\"There is only one lord of the ring,\" you said, as both your hands glowed blue. You put them together, pointing them towards Saruman \"And let me tell you, Saruman, my father does not share power.\" <br>\r\nYou spread your arms wide. The blue energy travelled up your arms and to your body. It travelled down your body and along your legs, which rose slightly, so you were hovering a few feet above the ground. You put both your hands together, and a much larger bolt of blue lightning came from them, hitting Saruman in the chest, causing him to be thrown out of the circle. You pointed your hand at your staff, and it flew into your hands. Pointing it at Saruman, you concentrated. His decent was slowed just enough, that he was knocked unconscious. You then fell back to the ground, slamming your staff into the ground as you did. A shockwave of magical energy emanated from you, knocking ever uruk hai within a three mile radius to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElladan and Elrohir, the only two left standing, ran around the knocked over uruk hai, slicing through as many of their necks as possible. <br>\r\nYou ran to where Saruman lay, taking his staff, and putting it with your own on your back. Then you looked around, to see Elladan and Elrohir running full pelt away from the wall. You saw an armoured uruk hai running towards it with a flaming brand. You pointed both staves at him, and lifted him off the ground, throwing him into his fellows, the brand being extinguished. You then looked to Elladan and Elrohir, beckoning to them. They ran over, dispatching more uruk hai as they did. <br>\r\n\"Saruman is still alive,\" you said \"I've taken his staff, but he's still dangerous, guard him, and don't listen to a word he says.\" <br>\r\nYou ran towards the wall, pulling out both staves as you did, firing spell after spell at the uruk hai around you. When you reached the wall, you found several containers filled with an extremely flammable substance. You pointed your own staff at the containers, causing them to levitate, then threw them to different points on the battlefield. As they were coming down, you fired a fireball at each one. They all exploded, killing many uruk hai. However, at least half of the uruks numbers were still alive, and attacking. The night was almost over, you saw the first rays of the rising sun came into the valley, and they illuminated a rider, dressed in white, holding a white staff and riding a white steed. While you were happy to see Gandalf again, you once again questioned his sanity. Was he really going to attack 5000 uruk hai on his own? Then, more riders were revealed, as they rode forward to the top of the hill. Even from this distance, your elvish eyesight picked out Eomer and his eored. They charged down the hill, as Gandalf raised his staff, white light shone from it as the horses drove into the uruk hai. <br>\r\nAt the same time, the gates to the hornburg opened and Th\u00e9oden led a host of many horsemen in a charge towards the uruk hai. <br>\r\n\"Charge!\" shouted a female voice, and you looked around to see Galadriel and Eowyn leading a huge amount of elves and men, male and female alike charged out of the main gate. The uruk hai were pushed back on all sides, being pushed towards the river. Many who tried to swim across. Galadriel cast a spell, causing the river to kill the uruk hai swimming across, and then rise up, crashing down on the uruk hai from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Uruk Hai captain stepped forward, and spoke in the common tongue. <br>\r\n\"We beg mercy from the combined armies of elves and men,\" he said \"You have beaten us, we surrender.\" <br>\r\nYou stepped forward, the two staves on your back, you spoke \"Lay down your arms,\" you said, in the tongue of the orc, so that the ones who did not speak the common tongue could understand. <br>\r\n\"Why do you allow these creatures to live?\" asked Th\u00e9oden \"They have slaughtered Rohan's towns and villages, why should we be merciful.\" As he spoke, the uruks had already lain down their arms. You used your magic to levitate the weapons and throw them across the river. <br>\r\n\"If you would like to kill defenceless prisoners,\" you said \"Go ahead, King Th\u00e9oden.\" <br>\r\nTh\u00e9oden lowered his sword, placing it back in it's scabbard. \"Where do we put them all?\" asked Th\u00e9oden \"Rohan is poor, we do not have large prisons and we do not have the money to feed them.\" <br>\r\n\"We fight with you,\" said the uruk hai captain \"The Uruks and the men of Rohan will fight together.\" <br>\r\n\"We can take them,\" said Galadriel \"The orcs were once elves, twisted and changed into what they are today, perhaps we can find a way to help them.\" <br>\r\n\"But your people sail to the undying lands,\" said Aragorn \"How will you help the uruks if you sail there?\" <br>\r\n\"Elrond believes that the time of the elves is over,\" said Galadriel \"But I do not agree, we are abandoning men to their fate, the elves are at least partially responsible for Sauron's rise to power, and for Sauron himself, I will not abandon Middle Earth to a fate created by my people, we fight with you, and we will do all within our power to cure the uruks.\" <br>\r\n\"Thank you, my lady,\" said the uruk hai captain \"And when the time comes, we fight with the people of Rohan.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, hand over the Palantir.\" <br>\r\nSaruman's eyes widened in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't look so surprised, I know Isengard has one, I know my father took the Palantir from Minas Ithil when he invaded it, turning it into Minas Morgul, it didn't take me long to figure out that you had one too, that's how you and Sauron made your allegiance,\" you say \"I can't allow a tainted artefact to stay in the hands of a known enemy. Hand it over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaruman reluctantly pulled the Palantir out of his cloak, handing it to you. You looked at Gandalf. He put his hand inside his cloak and used the cloak to take the Palantir, stowing it in the cloak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magical items like this can lure you into evil,\" you said \"We'll imprison him in the tower of Orthanc, when we get there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gandalf \"Good choice, we'll maintain a guard on him until we can go to Orthanc.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to a council on Gandalf's behalf, representing him there. Galadriel represented the elves of Lothlorien, along with Elladan and Elrohir. Aragorn represented Gondor, while Th\u00e9oden and Eomer represented Rohan. An uruk captain called Lurkan represented the uruk hai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father's wrath will be terrible,\" you said \"His retribution will be swift, the Battle for Helm's Deep is over, the Battle for Middle Earth is about to begin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will attack Gondor,\" said Aragorn \"Gondor will call for our aid by lighting the beacons, when they are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rohan is in no position to go to Gondor's aid,\" said Th\u00e9oden \"We must rebuild our villages, replant our crops, this war has left Rohan weak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Uruks will be ready,\" said Lurkan \"We are always ready for war.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The elves of Lothlorien will be ready when called,\" said Galadriel \"We will also assist with Rohan's rebuilding until the beacons are lit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us not speak of such things now,\" said Th\u00e9oden \"What is still to be done?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While the Uruks attacked Rohan,\" you say \"The Ents of Fangorn attacked Isengard, their leader Treebeard would be a valuable ally if we can convince him to join our cause, and we must imprison Saruman in Orthanc until he has learned the error of his ways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Th\u00e9oden \"One thing I learned from this battle, Rohan's policy toward women enlisting in the army is wrong, effective immediately, women are to be treated, in military matters, in the same way as men.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can implement that when we return to Rohan,\" you said \"Right now, we've got to go to Isengard, just the army generals need go, the rest of the army can head back to Rohan, we'll meet you back there.\" </span></div></div>",

It was slower progress than you would have liked, but eventually you found your way back to Isengard. As you came in view of Isengard, you heard a cry of joy, as a small figure raised a flagon of ale. <br>\r\n\"Welcome, my lords and ladies, to Isengard,\" <br>\r\nYou smiled, as you recognised the forms of Merry and Pippin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGimli was not so happy to see them. \"You young rascals,\" he said, stuttering slightly \"A merry hunt you've led us on and we find you feasting and smoking.\" <br>\r\n\"Peace, Gimli,\" you said, smiling slightly<br>\r\n\"We are sitting, on a field of victory, and enjoying a few well-deserved comforts,\" said Pippin \"The salted pork is particularly good.\" <br>\r\nYou shook your head, the young hobbit knew just how to get Gimli's attention. <br>\r\n\"Salted pork?\" asked Gimli, eager. <br>\r\nYou heard Gandalf say under his breath \"Hobbits,\" <br>\r\n\"We're under orders, from Treebeard, who has taken over management, of Isengard,\" said Pippin<br>\r\n\"That inferior tree has taken over my home?\" asked Saruman, disgusted \"I've changed my mind, I'm not cooperating anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reacted quicker than Saruman did, and a strange circle glowed on the ground around him, just as he conjured a fireball. It immediately fizzled out. <br>\r\n\"I don't think you get to do that,\" you said \"Your still alive, because you may still have information we might need, don't do anything to make me change my mind, you won't like me when I'm angry.\" <br>\r\nRed light has appeared in your eyes, causing Saruman to shrink back. You notice that several of the horses around Saruman have recoiled as well. <br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked, as the light vanished, returning your eyes to their normal green.<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" said one horseman \"Just thought we saw something, ma'am.\" <br>\r\nYou shrugged, and moved forwards, the circle you cast moving with you and forcing Saruman to walk. Because you were a little distracted by what happened, you didn't notice the gleam in Saruman's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that you didn't really need to go and meet Treebeard, having met him already, you passed the circle spell over to Gandalf's staff, and waited with Merry and Pippin, chatting with them. However, they seemed to be eyeing you warily, too. <br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" you asked \"Why do you recoil?\" <br>\r\n\"Something happened after you cast that circle spell,\" said Pippin \"It's gone now, but your eyes, they turned red, and it seemed like they were made of fire.\" <br>\r\nYou immediately thought of the eye of your father. How could he be affecting you, though? He enslaved the Ringwraiths through their rings, the orcs were his to command, and the trolls were as brutal as he, so why were you being affected by him? <br>\r\nYou quickly took out some old parchment, and quill, drawing something on it. <br>\r\n\"Like this?\" you asked, after you had drawn a picture of your father's eye. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Pippin \"Exactly like that, only like fire, why, is it something that's happened before?\" <br>\r\n\"No,\" you said \"Nothing like that's ever happened before, the picture I drew was of the eye of my father.\" <br>\r\n\"Sauron?\" asked Merry \"Are you saying your eyes changed to look like Sauron's eye?<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you said \"I didn't see it, I'll have to ask Gandalf if anything like this has happened before.\" <br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" said Pippin, trying to lighten the situation slightly \"Want some food? We raided Saruman's stores after the battle, here, have some.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the rest of the day talking about other things, until Gandalf and the others returned. It was time to return to Edoras, Saruman was trapped and powerless, you had his staff to add to your own power, and your magic circle prevented him from casting any magic. </span></div></div>",

Because Sauron holds the Palantir of Minas Ithil, when he gazes upon it, he is linked to every other Palantir, even to you.\" <br>\r\n\"So in theory, if someone were to touch me while Sauron was watching, Sauron would be able to see us?\" you asked, trying to understand. <br>\r\n\"In theory,\" said Gandalf \"Like I said, this sort of thing has never happened before.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do,\" you said \"I don't want my father to know I can see into his plans, but there's not much I can do about it.  The hobbits are already spooked just by seeing my father's eye in my own eyes. I don't wish any more harm on them.\" <br>\r\n\"Nor do I,\" said Gandalf \"And I hope they do not come to any more harm, but these are dark times, I fear they will not be kept out of this war much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night, and you slept. You had a nightmare. A white tree was burning in a courtyard of stone, a white city was also burning, and then you saw Sauron coming up towards you, and Pippin appeared in front of you. He looked terrified. Sauron asked him his name, but he didn't answer. I tried to look away, but I could not, but no matter how much psychological torture Pippin was put through, he told Sauron nothing of Frodo or the ring. You tried to pull yourself away from Sauron, away from Pippin, and everything faded to black as you woke. Pippin was on the floor, trembling. You reached him first, muttering a spell to bring him out of his fear. He immediately scrambled away from you. Gandalf got Pippin to tell him what happened. After Gandalf was finished, you went over to Pippin, and tried to talk to him. You managed to convince him you were still the same person. Sauron had a lot to answer for. You wished you could deliver the killing blow yourself. But you would  do your part. What you had seen suggested that Sauron was going to attack Gondor. Warning them about the attack and preparing the defence of the city was the best you could do. There was another thing yours and Pippin's encounter with Sauron had done. Sauron now thought Pippin had the ring. This could work to the Free Peoples' advantage. This, and more, was discussed in a meeting. a few days after the Palantir incident. It was decided that Gandalf, Pippin and you would go to Gondor. </span></div></div>",

You didn't tire easily, when you had awoken from your seemingly eternal hell in the Ringwraiths twilit realm, you had felt like awaking from a nightmare. As such, you were very reluctant to sleep every night, for fear of returning to that place. Pippin was under no such illusions, and slept during the nights. It gave you and Gandalf time to talk. <br>\r\n\"I've messed up now,\" you said \"I should be able to block that sort of thing out, especially since I knew about it, now Pippin's been brought into a war.\" <br>\r\n\"He was already in the war,\" said Gandalf \"This was never my intent, I do not wish harm to the hobbits, they give me hope, though, they will all play their part in the days to come.\"<br>\r\n\"Of that I have no doubt,\" you said \"I just hope that no ill comes to them before the end.\"<br>\r\n\"I wish that with all the hope in the world,\" said Gandalf<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the fifth day that your horse Asfel and Shadowfax came within sight of Minas Tirith. No matter how many times you came here, you always marvelled at the sheer size and beauty of Minas Tirith. It didn't have the elegantly carved and well-built elven houses, and there was very little open space within the city, but as a defensible fortress, it was both defensible and aesthetically pleasing. <br>\r\n\"Minas Tirith,\" said Gandalf \"The city of kings.\" <br>\r\nWhen they rode into Minas Tirith, and all the way up to the top, where the seat of the king of Gondor sat. Also on this floor, was the White Tree of Gondor, which you had seen burning in your dream. Pippin recognised it, too, and asked Gandalf about it. <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gandalf \"The White Tree of the king, lord Denethor, however, is not the king.\"<br>\r\nAt this, Gandalf turned and talked to Pippin \"Be warned, Lord Denethor is Boromir's father, it would be best if you do not mention him.\" <br>\r\nGandalf turned to walk in, and then turned back \"And say nothing of Aragorn either,\" said Gandalf, then hesitated \"In fact, it would probably be best if you don't speak at all, Pippin.\" <br>\r\nYou shake your head, but say nothing.  </span></div></div>",

An elderly man sat there, he was bent over on the throne, and you noticed that he was holding something. <br>\r\n\"Hail Denethor, son of Ecthellion, Lord and Steward of Gondor,\" said Gandalf. As you got closer, you noticed that the thing Denethor was holding was a split arm guard, that you recognised as belonging to Boromir \"I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel.\" <br>\r\n\"Perhaps you come to explain this,\" said Denethor \"Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead?\" <br>\r\nYou looked to Denethor. His city was about to be invaded, and he was here wallowing in his grief over his sons death. You understood his grief, but a good leader had to be able to put aside that grief in times of greatest need. You had never liked Boromir personally, but you had respected him for his martial prowess and he did seem to have a soft spot for the youngest hobbits. You were about to speak all of this to Denethor, when Pippin stepped forward.<br>\r\n\"Boromir died to save us,\" said Pippin \"My kinsmen and me, he died defending us from many foes.\" Pippin walked up to the throne, and knelt down. <br>\r\n\"I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt,\" said Pippin. <br>\r\n\"This is my first command to you,\" said Denethor \"How did you escape, and my son did not? So mighty a man as he was.\"<br>\r\n\"The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow,\" said Pippin \"But Boromir was pierced by many.\" <br>\r\nYou were surprised, Pippin spoke as an elf lord, or human noble would. You had no idea he could be so, for lack of a better word, noble. <br>\r\n\"This is not the time to grieve Boromir, Lord Denethor,\" you said \"But Gondor needs a strong leader for the war that is to come, you could be that leader.\" <br>\r\n\"The enemy is on your doorstep,\" said Gandalf \"As steward, you are charged with the defence of this city, where are Gondor's armies?\" <br>\r\n\"You still have friends, lord,\" you said \"The Rohirrin are ready to ride, and my kin ride with them, your allies will not desert Gondor in its time of need.\" <br>\r\n\"Send word to Th\u00e9oden of Rohan,\" said Gandalf \"Light the beacons.\" <br>\r\n\"You think that you are wise, Mithrandir,\" said Denethor \"Yet for all your subtelties, you have not wisdom, do you think the eyes of the white tower are blind?\" <br>\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" you say \"But if they do not call for aid, then Gondor will be besieged, how long can you stand against the armies of Mordor, there are over 10000 orcs within Mordor, and cruel men of the South and East enter Mordor every day, if you do not call for aid, Gondor will soon wave the banner of the Eye.\" <br>\r\n\"You shall not speak to me of how to run my city, elf,\" said Denethor \"And you, wizard, I see your game, with your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor, and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides with Th\u00e9oden of Rohan, and know that this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, shall never be crowned king, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North, last of a long house long bereft of lordship.\" <br>\r\n\"Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, Steward,\" said Gandalf<br>\r\nDenethor stood from his seat. \"Rule of Gondor is mine, ignore this.\" <br>\r\nGandalf, seemingly appalled at Denethor's refusal to call for aid, turned to leave. <br>\r\nYou waited before the throne \"You would do well to think on this, Son of Ecthellion, for the elves do not give their aid willingly, and will not give it again if you do not accept it this time.\" You turned, and followed Gandalf and Pippin out of the hall. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Looking around, he notices that he's in some kind of forest teeming with life and beauty. After getting an eye full of the scenery, he searches himself. He was clothed in simple rags and had nothing protecting him. On his belt, he felt an odd weight bringing it down. He instinctively reaches down and feels his hand grasp a hilt of some kind. With great ease, he unsheaths a mighty, if somewhat broad blade, from his belt. Examining it, he looked at it in discuss. \"A pitiful blade.\" He thought putting back into its sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his back, he finds a large spear and a set of bow and arrows. Holding the spear, he tests its wait and gets a natural feeling with it. It was more acceptable than the sword and more useful. Slinging it back onto his back, he takes out the bow. To his disappointment, the bow was a simple one, made of a sturdy wood. The arrows weren't very good quality either and he almost considered getting rid of the bow. In the end though kept the weapon, he would never willingly throw away a useable weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with his self inspection, Sinnoh began trekking out into the forest. His journey did not last long, for he was soon interrupted. Turning around a tree, he found himself face to tip with an arrow. In front of him was a large elf and he was surrounded on all sides by several other elves. Sinnoh, not wanting a fight after getting into this world so quickly, surrenders. \"You are a smart boy.\" One elf said as he bound Sinnoh's hands behind his back. \"I am no mere boy.\" Sinnoh corrected. \"I am much wiser than a boy. A child would have tried to fight you off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinnoh was abruptly ordered to march as he followed the leading elf through the forest. \"Would you mind telling me where we are?\" Sinnoh asks out loud. \"You are in the realm of Rivendell my friend.\" Said the leader. \"Ah. That's where we are. Well that's good news I guess.\" Sinnoh says. \"Where are you taking me?\" One of the elves stared at him, \"You ask too many questions.\" he complained. \"We are taking you to Rivendell. \"What have I done to deserve this treatment?\" Sinnoh asked. \"I have done nothing wrong, but you insist on taking me prisoner? That doesn't sound fair to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sternly being to told to \"hold your tongue\" Sinnoh remains silent for the rest of the march. After a long time, he could see out in the distance a great city of beauty. It appeared to be built into some kind of mountain and had a beautiful waterfall flowing throughout it. It was a truly magnificent sight, and Sinnoh was glad that he was being taken to such a beautiful place. He was soon left inside of an empty room, and sat there alone for quite some time while quietly whistling to himself. Soon, Sinnoh grew bored and started looking around at the various artifacts in the room. Examining each carefully, he admires their beauty before heading up stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reaches upstairs, he's presented with the most stunning sight he had seen yet in this world. On a wall. There was a large mosaic-like painting of a man leaning on a stone, holding up a broken sword as a shadowy figure glared down at him while it swung its mighty mace at him. Directly across from it, was a statue of a woman with her hand outstretched. On those hands, was a cloth on which a broken sword lay. Several shards lay scattered across the cloth while part of the sword remained on the hilt. If this sword was to be re forged, it would be just like when it was first made. Eventually, Sinnoh's curiosity left him and he went back downstairs, sat back down, and made himself comfortable. </span></div></div>",

Soon, a tall elf with long black hair and an imposing figure enters the room accompanied by two other elves. Standing up, Sinnoh bows respectfully before the elf. The elf replies with a bow of his own and speaks to Sinnoh. \"Welcome to Rivendell. I am Elrond, Lord of Rivendell. What is your name and business in these lands?\" He asks. \"My Lord Elrond,\" Sinnoh began. \"I am Sinnoh, a simple traveler who has stumbled upon your lands. I may seem young to you, but I have lived through many tings that have matured me beyond count of age. My business is my own, but I do not yet know it. For my goal in this world is unclear to me at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you speak of?\" Elrond asked. \"You are only a child, barely yet considerable a man. But yet you claim that you have lived through many things that have matured you beyond reckoning. Explain what you mean to me!\" Sinnoh chuckled to himself. \"To do that, I would need to show you something that I must get; but I can't do that with my hands bound. Would you release them for me?\" Sinnoh asked. Soon, Sinnoh's bonds were undone and he was rubbing his hands to get his circulation back in action. \"I shall start from the beginning; but I warn you, this tale is long and you will most likely not believe me.\" Sinnoh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Sinnoh told Elrond everything. He told him about his life and the founding of the magic stone. He explained that he had lived through many perilous quests and journeys in many different worlds and how they all matured him. He also explained that the stone prevented him from aging and that in reality he should be about twenty years old. Finally Sinnoh finished his story and Lord Elrond spoke his mind, \"I can see no lie in your eyes or mind. You have my trust. What a strange tale.\" He said. Suddenly, one of the elves spoke, \"Lord Elrond the council meeting shall start soon. You must go now.\" The elf said. \"Very well.\" Lord Elrond said standing up. \"Come with me Sinnoh. This council will likely decide the fate of our world. You are likely to find your destiny there.\" Sinnoh stood and followed Elrond out into the hallways of Rivendell. \"This council will not only decide this world's fate, but also mine. I hope that it goes well.\" Sinnoh thought. </span></div></div>",

Before he left, Murder added, \"You are making fine progress, Slade, do not lose heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlade nodded then gave you a look before leaving. \"Um... sorry if I distracted him.\" you said, feeling a little guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Slade must be able to block out such distractions if he is to be an effective fighter, and leader.\" replied Murder, lightly, taking up a towel. \"Do not fear, though, he has a good heart, he will not hold a grudge against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched Murder dabbed the sweat from her brow and found your heart racing, looking at her beauty. <i>\"I have never seen an elf up close like this before.\"</i> you thought. <i>\"Her beauty is beyond compare.\"</i> then, realizing what you were thinking, you asked. \"Why did you face him without a weapon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder laughed, it was the most pure and melodious laugh you had ever heard. \"I don't need a weapon.\" she said, smiling. \"Were you not paying attention to the lesson I served Slade?\" she then placed the towel aside and faced you directly. \"So, what brings a young human such as you to Rivendell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Cire, son of Bard, King of Lonely Valley.\" you answered. \"I have come to join the fellowship in their quest to destroy the evil ring before it falls into the hands of destruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder looked at you, a small grin of amusement on her face. \"You look rather young to be joining such a quest.\" she said. \"Are you certain you can handle the perils that will surely await us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned. \"Perhaps I can answer that question with a friendly unarmed match up.\" you suggested. \"Of course, you will need to rest up, first. It would not be fair of me to challenge you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder smiled at your comment. Although you lack of knowledge regarding elves was obvious, she found it noble of you not to want to take what you clearly saw as an advantage over her. \"You have never faced and elven warrior before, have you, prince Cire?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have not.\" you replied, honestly. \"However, I have proven myself against the strongest humans in my kingdom.\" you then blushed. \"Also, about price Cire, please drop the prince part. Here, I wish to be treated as the others, no better, no worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Murder was slightly impressed. <i>\"He is not like other humans of royalty.\"</i> she thought. <i>\"This one actually has a touch of modesty to spite his arrogance.\"</i> then she said, \"A true warrior must be able to fight at his or her best, regardless of how tired they feel, until the battle has ended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You then accept my challenge now?\" you asked, slightly surprised. \"I will not hold back, I fight to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be insulted if you did hold back, young Cire.\" said Murder, seriously. \"You may place your weapons an armor on the table to your right. Before you enter further, please remove your shoes as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and proceeded to disarm yourself. Unknown to you, Murder was watching your every move, looking for a limp, a wince when you move a certain muscle, anything she could use to her advantage. she was not doing this to gain any advantage, it was a skill she had learned and it became automatic. As you finished, a few minutes later, Murder was pleased to see you were quite strong for her age, which meant she did not have to go soft on you to avoid breaking your bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The boy does not realize how much stronger elves are to humans.\"</i> she thought. <i>\"But, then again, I learned the hard way myself never to underestimate a human.\"</i> she inwardly giggled. <i>\"They are always full of surprises.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you were ready and you entered the dojo type building with your shoes off to face her. \"What are the conditions of this match up?\" you asked. \"What determines a victory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder pointed to a large painted circle on the floor. \"The victor will be the one to throw their opponent to the floor, outside this ring, three times without being thrown by the other.\" she replied. \"The rules are simple, no weapons other than your hands and feet, no touching of 'forbidden' parts of the body, and finally...\" she smiled. \"No crying when 'you' lose to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at that. \"I expect you to follow that same third rule, should I be victorious.\" you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, young Cire.\" replied Murder, amused. \"Though I doubt that will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the contest began...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only yours was no ordinary sword and the Ringwraiths seemed to recognize it as they hesitated momentarily. Your sword was called Fang, its handle was made from the finest gold while the blade was carved from a tooth taken from the great dragon, Smaug. News of the sword's creation spread quickly as tales have spoke of Smaug possessing untold magic, explaining his 'invulnerability'. Upon bringing Fang to bear, its blade ignited in a bright orange flame and the sound of 'breathing' echoed from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sword, though powerful, will do little to tip the odds, boy!\" said the one, returning his sword to its sheath. \"You have received your one warning. The next time we meet, you will not see us coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the four Ringwraiths rode passed you and Murder, vanishing from sight as they did. Only, with Fang still at the ready, you alone could hear their horses ride off into the distance. Once you could no longer hear them, you sheathed your sword, its fire and 'breathing' silenced. \"They are gone.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder slowly turned to you, her face ashen with fear, before turning red with annoyance. \"You are either very brave or very foolish, young Cire.\" she scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then quickly explained who the Ringwraiths were and what they were capable of, causing you to turn pale. \"We had better move on then.\" you said. \"Please lead, I am obviously unworthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder, seeing that your regret was genuine, sighed before managing a small grin. \"As I said, you have much to learn.\" she told you. \"Your sword, Fang, will give you an edge but I expect you to heed my warnings in the future, understand!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, taken back by Murder's sharp tone. \"Yes, Murder.\" you replied, quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder nodded. \"Let's move on, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour journey continued.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You decided to remain on guard as well, better safe than dead. upon reaching Hobbiton, you and Murder found that it had been attacked. Doors to the small houses were shattered and belongings were seen strewn about. You immediately knew where the four Ringwraiths had rode from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could those devils have possibly found here?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder frowned. \"The ring of Smaug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes nearly bugged out of my head, hearing that. \"Smaug had a ring!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder dismounted in front of Frodo's house and urged me to do the same. \"You know that when your father was recovering 'black arrow', the weapon that killed Smaug, he also claimed one of the dragon's fangs.\" she said. \"At this time, Gandalf the grey used the ring of fire to steal Smaug's resurrection magic and trapped it into a cursed ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that ring, someone could bring Smaug back!?\" I asked, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder shook her head. \"With that, Smaug could bring himself back.\" she told me, darkly. \"He would use the bearer of the ring as his new body, reshaping it into his old form and living again with the ring bearer no longer existing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to say something but Murder cut me off. \"The ring is evil and gives off a 'pulse' similar to the rings of doom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why we were sent to retrieve it.\" you replied, darkly. \"Because it will lure those dark horsemen away from the fellowship of the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder nodded. \"You learn fast, young Cire.\" she said. \"However, it is not my first choice to join that mission. Our job is to take the ring to Lord Elron and leave him to assemble a team to that task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then followed Murder into the house where we found Frodo, waiting for us. I winced, seeing a splint on his left leg. \"It is not as painful as it looks.\" he said. \"However, it is definitely broken... I can not join you on your quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still have the ring?\" asked Murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo nodded. \"I have it but only prince Cire may carry it.\" he replied. \"These are orders directly from Gandalf the wizard, I dare not evoke his wrath.\" he reached into his pocket, producing a gold band on a gold chain. \"My lord, I was instructed to tell you <i>never</i> to wear this ring on your finger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" you said, taking the chain. \"I was told of Smaug's resurrection magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Frodo nodded. \"My lord...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just Cire.\" you said, patiently. \"This mission is too important to be distracted by titles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well... Cire.\" said Frodo, slightly impressed. \"Could you please give us some privacy? Murder's family had sent a currier who ordered me to convey message to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then bowed your way out of the house. Once alone, Frodo turned to Murder, serious. \"The message is short but clear. Do not allow Smaug to return, regardless of the cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder looked out the window, spotting you, then turned to Frodo and quietly nodded. \"Let us hope Cire is strong enough not to be taken by the ring's power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gandalf assured me that Cire's kind heart will offer him some protection.\" said Frodo. \"However, he is human. Help keep his mind focused on the mission at hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Murder left Frodo's house and you were back on your horses, riding back to Rivendell with all due speed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She yelled in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what we have here, Chum.\" said the one who had Murder by the leg. \"A little snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other troll laughed, making your blood boil. You did not realize that Murder was waiting for her opportunity to strike. Her mistake was to forget that humans have a hair trigger temper when it came to protecting those they befriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release her, vermin!\" you warned, showing yourself. \"Do it now or taste my wrath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two trolls laughed at you, making your blood boil even more. \"Oh, do you have a crush on this little morsel?\" asked the second troll, smiling cruelly. \"Perhaps I'll let you watch as we eat her first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed again but fell silent as your rage reached new heights. You drew fang and griped the ring so not to lose it. Unfortunately, it was all that was needed to show Murder Elron's warning. Your entire body was immediately engulfed in flames from fang, though you did not feel it and terrifying face peered out of the flames that caused the trolls to freeze in utter horror. It was the face of Smaug! Murder's eyes widened as she too found herself gripped in fear.

It was to their good graces that it started to pour down raining then as it was enough to calm Cire who re-sheathed fang, sending Smaug away. As he released the ring, however, he felt very weak and slumped to the forest floor with Murder running to him. She carefully checked him for injuries, Elron's words echoing in her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"In all my years, I have learned one certain thing about humans... the power of their rage is unfathomable and those who can control it are the ones you do not want angry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat following morning...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can only guess he never had the chance to use it against the ring wraiths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your majesty, he did not.\" sadly, Henner confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed then turned to Murder. \"As king of the Lake kingdom, I order you to hold onto the black arrow, Murder.\" your voice quivering, you ordered. \"If Smaug should return through me, slay the damn dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You are either very courageous or very foolish, young Cire.\"</i> holding back her tears, Murder thought. then she replied, \"It shall be done... King Cire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will follow at a hundred paces in a triangle formation to serve as lookouts.\" suggested Henner. \"This way, there will be less of a chance of any surprise attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we move on.\" regaining your composure, you said. \"Please refer to me as Cire, an equal to you all. Aragorn, I ask that you continue to take the lead, this quest is too important to risk it on an inexperienced... king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn nodded but did not speak as words were not necessary at that point and the fellowship continued on its quest...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You, Murder and Henna's troop, as well as Aragorn and Legolas carried bows. The hobbits held stones. Gimli held one of his throwing axes. Boromir did not have a ranged weapon, but was experienced at fighting wargs in close combat. They then lit a fire in a clearing and put some bad meat on it. Then, they all concealed themselves in the forest around the camp fire. As the first warg came into the clearing, it's nose in the air, you let loose an arrow, right through its neck. It fell to the ground with a thump, muffled by the heather placed around the campfire. One of Henner's men ran into the clearing to make sure the warg was dead, signaled that it was, then ran back into hiding. You had some reservations about the men checking the wargs, their scents could be tracked if they moved over the same path too frequently, so you agreed to their checking on the agreement that they find a new hiding place following the death check. From her position up a nearby tree, Murder gestured to an area of bush. A wargs head stuck into the clearing, and was immediately felled with an arrow in the eye. Henner and her men didn't even bother to go check this one. You signed to Murder. <br>\r\n\"How many are there left?\" <br>\r\nMurder held up eight fingers. You nodded and refocused your attention on the clearing, only to jump backwards at the face of a warg. You quickly brought your bow up and shot an arrow at the warg just as it was about to roar at you. The arrow came clean out the back of the warg's throat and kept going, somehow, it hit another warg that had just peeked into the clearing from the other side. The entire fellowship was shocked at what happened, even you.   </span></div></div>",

It was a move you had seen before when fighting against the forces of Khand in the east, but you had not thought these orcs and wargs would have thought of it. The wargs would scout the area, using their silent language to communicate, and when they found the enemy, they would scout their position and then call in their masters to surround their enemy. They were snarling and howling as they ran forward in a blind rage to avenge their fallen mounts. You had fought a warg pack before but not one so blood driven for revenge as these. You managed to keep the beasts at bay but you also had the wargs coming your way. \"This is fun, eh, Murder?\" sarcastically, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me to discuss your meaning of fun later, Cire.\" punching a wolf in the head, Murder replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoromir threw a warg off with his shield then drove his sword through its rider, pushing him off. \"We are wasting time here!\" annoyed, he said. \"Let's finish with these creatures and move on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a warg managed to grab Murder by the wrist and bite down. She screamed, more startled than hurt, then kicked the warg off. Still, it was enough for an orc to thrust his sword at Murder. It only grazed her shoulder but, from your angle, it looked as if it had pierced her heart as she fell back with blood spewing onto the crude blade. \"NO!\" enraged, you screamed. \"Bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your rage, you did not notice the other orc who thrust his sword at your chest. Only, to his great misfortune, the tip of the blade hit the ring of Smaug you had around your neck. The ring burned hot as you drew Fang in response. \"Taste my wrath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder, who had dodged the warg and the orc, made short work of the two then turned to see the human rage Elron had warned her about. With her elven senses, she could almost see the heat from your blind fury as you rose your burning sword, Fang. \"The three elements are in place.\" turning pale, she said. \"Smaug is returning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, to her surprise and relief, Smaug appeared as a ghost rather than flesh and blood. It hissed at the suddenly pale panicked wargs, steam pouring from its mouth. \"You insignificant incests!\" with a hiss, it roared. \"How dare you bar my path to destiny! BURN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a ghostly fire spewed from Smaug's mouth, engulfing the wargs and their riders. It did no damage but it was more than enough to send the superstitious creatures running for their lives. Once they were no longer a threat, Smaug vanished, leaving you standing in the middle of the field, looking thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did Smaug not return?\" shaken and confused, you asked aloud. \"Why did he not take my life to renew his own?\" you looked down at yourself and noticed that you still had one female breast. the answer became obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cire, are you injured?\" walking up to you, Murder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine.\" quickly, you replied. \"I have found a way to keep Smaug from returning.\" pausing, you then asked, \"Are you injured, I saw that warg thrust his sword through you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He missed by a hair, I can take care of myself.\" with a slight smile, Murder said. \"How can we stop Smaug from returning before we destroy the ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smaug needs a <i>man</i> to possess in order to return.\" ruefully, you replied. \"It was due to my one female breast that kept him from taking me over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder smiled, touching the hilt of her elven sword. \"You realize that, once you are female, it will take a month for you to change back into a man.\" bemused, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather live my life as a princess and grow up to be queen than to see that worm, Smaug curse this land again.\" firmly, you said. \"Do it before I come to my senses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder drew her elven sword. \"As you wish... <i>princess.</i>\" giggling, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she thrust her blade...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The corset, however, left much to be desired as Murder squeezed and crushed your midsection to the point where you had to gasp for breath. \"Is this really necessary!?\" complaining, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most women do not like these.\" serious, Murder said. \"However, yes, it is necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea.\" after a thought, you said. \"Get this thing off me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Murder helped you out of the corset and held it up as you had requested.

They had planned to stay for a few days in Lothlorien to recover their strength, now that Chrysophyllax was welcome in Lorien, you, along with the company of the rings, proceeded with Galadriel to the wood elves capital, Caras Galadon. There, you and the company relaxed for a few days. It was on one of the nights, when the rest of the company was sleeping, that you awoke to see Galadriel beckoning you. You followed her to a clearing, where what looked like a large basin. <br>\r\n\"Will you look into the mirror?\" asked Galadriel<br>\r\n\"What will I see?\" you asked<br>\r\n\"The mirror shows many things,\" said Galadriel \"Things that were, things that are, and some things that have not yet come to pass.\" <br>\r\nYou looked down into the dark water. It rippled, and then, you saw Laketown, and it was on fire. You saw man and dwarf running about, fighting against a strange breed of orc. Then, you saw the worst. You saw your father, old, and vulnerable, standing before a great dragon, leaning on a stick with one hand and holding a sword with the other, but he did not strike. He fell to his knees before Smaug. He opened his mouth, and Bard the Bowman was no more than ash. <br>\r\n\"No!\" you shouted, tearing your gaze away from the mirror, just as it changed back to dark, rippling water. <br>\r\n\"I know what it is you saw,\" said Galadriel \"For it is also in my mind, it is what will come to pass, should you fail. The quest to destroy the Ring of Smaug will also require you saving Laketown, for if Laketown is attacked, Smaug's coming will be much sooner.\" <br>\r\n\"What of the Ring of Sauron?\" you asked \"Without the protection of our company, it will not reach Mordor.\" <br>\r\n\"I do not wish harm to the hobbit,\" said Galadriel \"But Frodo will soon have to continue his quest alone, there are already those in the company of the ring who would take the ring for their own, your quests are separate, so your fellowship must divide, if you do not, both quests will fail.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen it was time to leave, Galadriel gave each member of both Fellowships gifts, to Murder, she gave a magical orb, imbued with the same magical properties as the staves of the Istari, Murder's preference for fighting without weapons had made her adverse to using a staff. To Henner, she gave a modified bow, woven from a willow tree by herself personally, to the two hunters with Henner, she gave swords of Elven make. Finally, to you, she gave a sword, imbued with the elven rune of ice. This sword had two special purposes, the first was that it counteracted the sword Fang when used at the same time as it, the second, was that it froze any enemy slashed by it in a block of ice. It sensed the thoughts of its user, so it would know if the person fighting against its user was friend or foe. You thanked Galadriel for her gift, as she turned to Chrysophyllax. <br>\r\n\"What gift would a dragon ask of the elves?\" she asked<br>\r\n\"Your hospitality and kindness are all the gift I need,\" he said \"For my kin are hated by many people, it was nice to be shown kindness.\" <br>\r\n\"Then I offer you my hospitality if ever you should be wanting, for as long as the people of Lorien can offer it,\" said Galadriel \"Be warned, the Ring of Smaug is powerful, and the prospect of becoming Smaug out of a will to do good will tempt you, but the evil of Smaug will eventually corrupt Cire, and he will become worse than him. If Cire becomes Smaug, as either a man or woman, you must kill him.\" <br>\r\nThis she said telepathically to Chrysophyllax, you only found out about it much later on. <br>\r\n\"Good luck on your quest, I hope that you save Laketown,\" said Galadriel.     </span></div></div>",

When she reached the creature's back, she ran towards the orc sitting on the creature's back, and stabbed it. It shrieked in orcish as it died, and the red light surrounding him and the creature vanished. As it did, several arrows struck the creature in the legs, causing it to fall to the ground in considerable pain. Tauriel jumped off, somersaulting before landing on the next one in the circle, stabbing that one too. Murder, not wanting to be outdone by her sister, called a command to her horse, and it unfurled it's wings. She flew up, avoiding the flame from the creature she was attacking, and slashed clean through the creature's neck. </span></div></div>",

They had to be destroyed swiftly and completely only you were not certain how. Just as you were about to blindly charge in, a memory sparked in your mind. You saw your birth father and your birth mother standing on the docks of Laketown. Your father held a burning torch while your mother held an ice blade similar to the one Murder had given you. The placed the two together and fired an impressive beam of fire and ice at the old worm, Smaug. The blast hit the dragon but it was not enough and he fired back with a blast of fire that took them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears flowed as the memory faded but it gave you an idea. \"Smaug was too heavily armored for such a blast but these orcs are paper by comparison!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shouted a command to your horse, Arwen and charged forward. Arwen gave a animal battle cry as he leaped onto a pile of rubble to the roof of a stone structure and then into the air as you drew out both Fang and the ice sword. \"Taste my fury!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Murder and Tauriel paused as you slammed the two swords together. There was a hollow boom before a powerful stream of both fire and ice fired forth from the swords. A majority of the orcs and their hellish mounts were instantly scorched and frozen at the same time. There was no time for the foul creatures to even scream as their lifeless forms fell to the ground and shattered before vanishing in a blood red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArwen landed on the hard ground and cried out in satisfaction as you then eyed the remaining forces with a battle hungry look. It was just the distraction Murder and Tauriel needed to destroy the last of the attacking forces with the rest of your group joining, being inspired by your surprising power. Within minutes, not a single orc was left standing or in the air. You dismounted Arwen to be confronted by Murder who seemed stunned by your display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the world did you obtain Elven magic!?\" Surprised, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed slightly. \"My birth father was human, the prince of an island nation beyond the bay of Belfalas.\" Softly, you explained. \"My birth mother was an Elf; the princess of an Elven kingdom beyond the great waters of Belegar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are half Elven?\" Surprised, Tauriel asked. \"I thought such unions were forbidden due to the great instability of a human's emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what my adopted father, King Bard told me, their marriage was not blessed by the two nations but by Elrond of Rivendell. They were married in the kingdom of Dale and my birth father became my adopted father's most trusted second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTauriel nodded. \"When it comes to true love, riches and prestige are meaningless without the one you hold dear.\" Smiling slightly, she said. \"It's an old Elven quote. It stands behind a strict Elven law. It is not frowned upon for a human and elf fall in love. However, should they bond in marriage, they must start anew on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder shook her head. \"How about that; you are a true prince.\" she giggled. \"Well, a <i>princess</i> and you are half elven, no less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a female, even half elf, she as magic and it is strong.\" Her smile broadening, Tauriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought the tears forming in your eyes. \"I remembered my birth mother and father using that trick against Smaug when he attacked Laketown.\" The tears began to fall. \"They failed and Smaug killed them with his fire. Bard took me in as his own and was soon after declared king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are Elrond's Godson.\" Whispering, Tauriel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Godson?\" Turning to you, Murder asked. \"Why was I not told of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The quest was too important for such distractions.\" Looking guilty, you replied. \"Also, if you recall, I did not wished to be known for my titles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurder shook her head, smiling. \"You never cease to surprise me... <i>princess.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed brightly then cleared your throat. \"Yes... well I suggest we continue on with our quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTauriel gaped at you for a moment then stated, \"Um, Cire...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aragorn slew the captain before he could deliver the killing blow, and managed to stabilise him. The last we heard of him, he returned to Gondor, he sees the error in his ways, and the ways of his father, and he intends to put things right.\" <br>\r\n\"Then there is hope for redemption for Boromir,\" you said \"What of Merry and Pippin?\"<br>\r\n\"They were taken,\" said Gimli \"We chased them for weeks, but they were eventually killed by the Rohirrin, who then questioned us on our business.

Legolas broke off from his conversation with Tauriel, and checked around for tracks from the battle. He walked to the edge of a cliff, and looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard, a throaty chuckle from a dying orc that lay near the edge. <br>\r\nGimli went over to him, and picked him up \"Tell me what happened to Aragorn and I will ease your passing. <br>\r\n\"He's....dead,\" said the orc \"Took a little tumble off the cliff.\" <br>\r\nLegolas came over and put his sword to the orc's throat \"You lie.\" <br>\r\nThe orc chuckled again, and then fell limp in Gimli's hand. The orc's hand opened, and a familiar necklace dangled from his fingers. <br>\r\nLegolas took it up, examining it closely. <br>\r\n\"Get the wounded on horses,\" said a voice. You looked up to see a bearded man with a crowned helmet \"These creatures will return, leave the dead.\" <br>\r\nLegolas stared the man down. <br>\r\n\"He's right,\" you said \"We cannot stay here.

The Rohirrin mourned the dead, the Riders of Rohan had very little in the way of martial power to begin with, and now, they had been reduced further. The battle was also against the Riders' best tactics, mounted combat. Their manoeuverability, which had seen them through so many battles, would not fair them well in this battle. If Saruman's army was anywhere even half as large as Sauron's, then the Rohirrin would also be outnumbered. But Helm's Deep had stood as a beacon of hope to Rohan for many a day, and it was to Helm's Deep that Theoden now led them. <br>\r\nThey rode into the city to cries of relief and hope from the women and children that accompanied them. Theoden began issuing orders to man the walls, and ready every man and strong lad to be ready for battle by nightfall. It was nearing night, when something unexpected happened. You were on watch, when you saw Aragorn's horse, with a tired, haggard, and wounded Aragorn riding atop it. <br>\r\n\"Open the gates!\" you shouted, and your cry was echoed by others. You ran down to the courtyard, where a small crowd had gathered. <br>\r\n\"It's Lord Aragorn,\" said one <br>\r\n\"Where is he, out of my way, I'm going to kill him,\" Gimli's voice was audible over the murmurs as he pushed his way through. Aragorn slowly lowered himself off his horse, to face Gimli. <br>\r\n\"The time for killing is not now,\" said Aragorn \"I must speak to the king.\" <br>\r\nGimli clapped Aragorn on the back, nodded, and led him through the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the keep, at the back end of Helm's Deep, a war council was called, you, Murder, Tauriel and Legolas were all there, as were the members of the Fellowship that had come to Helm's Deep. <br>\r\n\"I saw Saruman's armies,\" said Aragorn \"They are many, orcs that march in the light of day, they travel fast, they outnumber you many times over.\" <br>\r\n\"How many?\" asked Theoden<br>\r\n\"Ten thousand strong at least,\" said Aragorn<br>\r\nTheoden looked directly at him \"Ten thousand?!\" <br>\r\n\"It is an army bred for a single purpose,\" said Aragorn \"To destroy the world of men, they will be here by nightfall.\" <br>\r\n\"Let them come,\" said Theoden. He walked out of the hall. When you were alone, you said \"Is he serious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, along with Tauriel, Murder, Legolas,Gimli and Aragorn, followed Theoden out of the hall.<br>\r\n\"I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall,\" said Theoden, to a man in the garb of a captain. <br>\r\nHe led you and your companions to the causeway. <br>\r\n\"We will cover the caueway and the gate from above,\" said Theoden \"No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall, or set foot inside the Hornburg.\" <br>\r\n\"This is no rabble of mindless orcs,\" said Gimli \"These are Uruk Hai, their armour is thick, their shield's broad.\" <br>\r\n\"I have fought many wars, master dwarf,\" said Theoden \"I know how to defend my own keep.\"<br>\r\n\"And how many of these creatures have you fought personally?\" you asked, a little annoyed at Theoden's dismissal of Gimli's combat expertise \"If you do not take advantage of the experience of the fighters here, then you are a greater fool than I had once thought.\" <br>\r\n\"Do you know whom you address?\" Theoden asked \"It is not I who is the fool here, girl, if you had talked that way to me in Edoras, I would have had you flogged and left in prison for a night.\" <br>\r\n\"But you wouldn't,\" you said \"For I am Cire, daughter of King Bard, and with his recent death, now the king of Dale and the surrounding villages.\"<br>\r\nTheoden stared you down, then seemed to decide that what he was saying was more important than punishing you, and walked past you, out along the Deeping Wall \"They will break upon this fortress like water on rock, Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn, we've seen it before. Crops can be resown, homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast them.\" <br>\r\n\"They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops and villages,\" said Aragorn \"They come to destroy it's people, down to the last child.\"<br>\r\nTheoden turned, and grabbed Aragorn's arm. \"What would you have me do? Look at my men, their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be their end, then I would make such an end, to be worthy of rememberance.\" <br>\r\n\"Send out riders,\" said Aragorn \"You still have friends, without their aid, Helm's Deep will fall.\" <br>\r\n\"And who would come?\" asked Theoden \"Elves, Dwarves, we are not so lucky in our friends as you.\" <br>\r\n\"The men of Dale would answer,\" you said \"I can vouch for the fact that my people would come to your aid, perhaps with the dwarves of Erebor at their back, but them I cannot vouch for.\"<br>\r\n\"Gondor will answer,\" said Aragorn<br>\r\n\"Gondor!?\" said Theoden, his voice turning to anger \"Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was Gon-?\" Theoden broke off. <br>\r\n\"The men of Dale are too far away to arrive soon enough to make a difference,\" said Theoden \"I appreciate your offer of aid, Lord Cire, but Rohan will face this threat alone.\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the leadup to the battle, Murder taught you a few basic spells which would allow you to control the water of the River Isen, which flowed into Helm's Deep. Powerful spirits lived in that water, as they did in every river, and most magic is just negotiation with those spirits. That is how Arwen had controlled the water in their fight with the Wargs and their riders. Murder taught that some spirits were twisted, corrupted by the influence of other things, such as the  Old Forest on the border of the Shire, where the spirits of the trees such as Old Man Willow were less than benevolent, kept in check only by the Shepherd, also known as Tom Bombadil. You reached your mind out to the river. At first, you felt a presence retreat from your mind, you felt an emotion: Fear, surprise, but also a feeling of pain, as if the presence was wounded. You decided to attempt to broadcast something, a memory of Lake Town during times of peace, a child playing with a kite, a thriving marketplace, with many people, but focused mostly on the clear waters of the lake, and how you would often spend time staring out over the lakes in order to calm your mind. The spirit allowed your mind to connect with it, and immediately, your vision of the Deeping Wall was replaced with a cavern  with a large underground lake. You stood up from where you had been meditating, realising that you are once again, male, and panicking, thinking Smaug could return, until you heard a soothing voice, which sounded like a whisper, but you heard as clear as day. You knew instinctively that this was the voice of the river:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Calm yourself, King Cire, this conversation happens inside your mind,\"</i>  A small geizer of water erupted out of the centre of the lake. You noticed that no ripples were created beyond the geizer, and no waves lapped the shore of the small area of land you were standing on. The geizer seemed to slowly shape itself, becoming vaguely humanoid, as the water slowly died down, a beautiful woman wearing a majestic blue dress with bare feet, stood on the surface of the water as if she were standing on land. She continued to speak within your mind. <br>\r\n<i>\"I must confess I am surprised that you have chosen to speak with me, you are only the 4th gifted one to ever speak to me, the first was one of the Children of Illuvitar when they brought me into existence, the second was Radagast the Brown, on his last visit to Isengard, the third was Murder, from the Black Lands, and you were the fourth, what do you wish, human? I felt your compassion and love, hence why I let you in, but what the White Wizard has done to me has left me with little compassion for your kind,\"</i> <br>\r\nYou wondered what the spirit meant by the fact that Murder had come from the Black Lands. You had often heard Mordor referred to as such, but surely Murder could not have come from there. <br>\r\n\"I mean you no harm, if that's what you're asking,\" you said \"What should I call you, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<i>\"No-one has ever deigned to ask my name,\" said the spirit \"The Men of Gondor named me Isen, and I guess that will do for now, I have no name.\"</i><br>\r\n\"You clearly have no love for Saruman and his armies,\" you said \"Why is that?\" <br>\r\n<i>\"Saruman's war machinery dumps foul contaminents into me,\" said Isen \"Contaminents that cause me much pain, constant pain. I wish an end to that pain, and that will only come when Saruman's forces are defeated. Your plight seems a bleak one, may I aid you in defeating the force arrayed against you?\"</i><br>\r\n\"What aid can you give?\" you asked, surprised that it had been as easy to procure the spirit's aid.<br>\r\n<i>\"My eyes span the entire river,\" Isen replied \"I can warn you of the enemies position, and perhaps hinder their procurement of fish if they so desire it, perhaps drowning a few in my waters. I can also aid in the battle itself, attacking at the right time could sow discord within the ranks of the orcs. For the first time, I feel I can help to save myself, rather than relying on others to do it for me.\"</i><br>\r\n\"Very well,\" you replied \"Keep me updated, and I'll give you the signal to attack.\"</span></div></div>",
