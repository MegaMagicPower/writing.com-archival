This was the first time he had been in the Grand Arena, but he had been battle-hardened from months in the pit fights. Every day served as a new reminder that his family counted on him to save them. His wife didn't even know the danger she was in yet. And his uncle...\r<br>\nHe suppressed the hatred he felt at the thought of Kane. It was Kane who had dragged him broken and bleeding across the desert to simply sell him into fighting, something he had been trying to escape for years.\r<br>\n\"Ryan, are you all right?\" Sarah asked from the top bunk. She watched him with a sad expression. Her brother would never have recognized him, if he were still alive. Ryan had once been a happy little boy, but things had changed too much since then.\r<br>\n\"Not yet. Soon, though.\" he responded quietly. \"Soon.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nEarly morning found Siph and Ressek sitting on the windowsill, welcoming the dawn's weak golden light. Ressek's long tail swished across the floor, occasionally knocking one of its bony nodules against the stone walls.\r<br>\n\"I wanna win, Rethik. I wanna be da champion oth da Arena.\" Siph had yet to master common speech, and spoke with a lisp.\r<br>\n\"You wish for the chance to face Calarith? You were always weird, Siph, but I never believed you were insane.\" Ressek sighed, his forked reptillian tongue flickering in the air. \"And now I'm in the mess with you. Though I relish the chance to kick Krath around, I don't want to be here.\"\r<br>\nSiph patted his friend. \"I know, Rethik. I'm thorry.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nDavid Talis watched his son sleep from the doorway. Dawn was breaking, but John could sleep through almost anything. It almost brought a tear to the lycanthrope's eye, for he had thought that he would never see his son again, let alone anyone. But now they were to be in the same Arena, fighting each other.\r<br>\nJohn's eyes opened and he watched his father for a moment. The man wasn't young anymore, but still had a youthful strength.\r<br>\n\"You shouldn't have come.\" David said softly. \"I want you to get out of here, no matter what.\"\r<br>\n\"I know you do. But I can't.\" John hesitated. \"Mother thinks you're dead. She's sad and scared to believe otherwise.\"\r<br>\n\"I can understand that. But I promise, we'll get out.\" \r<br>\nJohn gave a small smile to his father and then climbed out of his bunk to prepare for what may be his longest day yet.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRaven gnawed on the bars of his cage, for lack of anything else to do. He may have been the most violent of all the competitors, and they wouldn't allow him a roommate, for fear of him eating them before the fights. He stiffened at the sound of someone coming down the stairs. He was almost like a puppy, growing excited at the prospect of visitors.\r<br>\nElise stopped just outside of the sturdy metal cage, studying the dragonette carefully. Finally, she spoke.\r<br>\n\"This is all your fault. If you had just left me alone, everything would have been fine.\" she spat the words like venom, and Raven's smile broadened. He let out a strange noise, something like a squawk and an eagle's cry.\r<br>\nShe growled at him. \"You will pay soon, little dragon.\" Then she turned and headed back up the stairs.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMarr floated out of his room, stretching his arms before the start of competition. Dark green mosses and weeds trailed from his three right claws, and left sickle. Both his claws and sickle were the only solid points on his form. They were a dark greyish-brown, the color of muddy bones, which in fact, they were.\r<br>\n\"Come back here, fog-slime!\"\r<br>\nMarr slowly turned, fixing his slanted red eyes on the brute behind him.\r<br>\n<i>our time is not yet, krath,</i> the wraith said. Its voice, if the sound could be called that, was little more than a whisper, and often confused for a breeze than communication.\r<br>\n\"Don't give me that, fog-slime. I kill you now, if I could.\" With an angry grunt, Krath stomped off down the hall in the opposite direction, his long tail swishing menacinly behind.\r<br>\n<i>ha, the fool. he can't hope to kill me.</i> Marr chuckled, echoing the sibiliant sound through the long hallways of the Arena.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTyger practiced another thrust, imagining Ryan's head in place of the wooden target. She didn't like the warrior, and aimed to kill him. She started at the sound of Shalar's voice.\r<br>\n\"You are quick.\" He stated simply. \"I'm sure that if Ryan's death is at your hands, it will be slow and painful, though.\"\r<br>\nHe stared solemnly at his bladed claws. \"I only wish that Reivus' death could be avenged in the same manner.\" He paused, and glanced up at Tyger, his long head-blade swinging in line with her throat. \"Why do you hate him, Tyger?\"\r<br>\nShe glared at the bladed warrior. \"He is my enemy. We disagree on certain issues. Also, he reminds me of the man who killed the rest of my clan. Besides,\" she added, smirking. \"He's Harac's grandson.\"\r<br>\nShalar stared hard at her, then laughed. \"And he is the man who killed Reivus' murderer, Tyger. By all rights, I should <i>thank</i> him. You ought to as well.\"\r<br>\nShe shrugged and pushed his head-blade away from her, turning his head. \"I have no reason to thank him, unlike you. The man who killed my clan was also one of the last. Like Ryan, he was a Catalyst.\"\r<br>\n\"Then he was a fool. Ryan is no such thing, Tyger. And he shouldn't be your target. After all,\" Shalar stated, \"he's trying to do what you never could- save his family.\"\r<br>\nShe glared at him, trying to find words. Finally, she managed to cool herself down. \"Perhaps. But you are wrong. He is a Catalyst, and I don't envy you discovering that when you fight.\" With that, she pushed past him and into the halls. The fights would begin soon, and she would not miss it.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nCalarith gazed in wonder as the dawn sun rose above the Arena's walls. \"It's glorious, isn't it?\" he asked. The Arena's master nodded silently, still awed by the presence of the massive dragon. \"From all parts, they come. And for what end? To earn a chance to fight me.\" The dragon sighed happily, a tongue of fire flickering from his nostrils and mouth. \"Glorious...\"\r<br>\nThe Arena's master simply nodded again. \"If you'll excuse me, Calarith, I must start the competitions. I trust you will come to watch?\"\r<br>\nThis time it was the dragon's turn to nod. \"I will see them prove themselves, or die trying.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Swooping low, he sped over the dirt floor of the battleground, barely missing the twenty-foot wall that kept the fighters in their place as he reached the opposite end of the Arena. Already, people were starting to filter in, getting early seats for the day's bouts.\r<br>\nThe great dragon shook his head, causing the tassels on his headfins to swish back and forth. Without warning, a gout of fire shot into the sky- the current Champion roaring his defiance to the would-be challengers. He knew that deep below, in the bowls of the great Arena, his challenge would be echoing through the stone hallways and passages, ringing in the ears of the combatants.\r<br>\nSmiling broadly, Calarith landed on the opposite wall, on a broad terrace made for the wealthiest of observers. His sharp eyes noted shadows behind the Arena's entrances.\r<br>\n<i>It will begin soon,</i> Calarith thought. On another terrace, much closer to the Arena's floor, the Arena master stood, preparing to begin the fighting.</span></div></div>",

The thick rough skin gave reluctantly against Ryan's blade, but his strength and skill were more than enough to persevere.\r<br>\nKrath roared in pain and anger, lashing out with his long tail to try and bring Ryan to the ground. The attempt failed horribly, Ryan deftly leaping over the swiping tail and scoring another long gash as it passed below him.\r<br>\nThen Krath saw his chance. With the fastest movement he could muster, he backhanded Ryan, his claws and wrist blades digging into the warrior's flesh.\r<br>\nRyan flew backwards, hitting the ground several feet away. Blood leaked from the sharp gouges in his side and chest.</span></div></div>",

His skin was a golden brown, and he was scowling fiercely.\r<br>\nElise was handed a sword. She looked at it doubtfully. No magic anywhere in the dull blade.\r<br>\nShe murmered some words. They got stronger and stronger, flowing into the weapon like oil in a pond. Soon the blade was shining brightly. Elise muttered a shield spell in case she was called off for starting before the fight was declared.\r<br>\nRessek was also handed a sword. It was of broad steel, he noted, with the plain pommel used by the peasants in tavern brawls. He clenched his teeth and threw away the sword. <i>I fight with my body, not with steel.</i>\r<br>\nThe Arena master dropped a red cloth, signifying the start of battle.\r<br>\nThe two figures advanced. Elise's lips seemed to be mouthing something. Ressek ignored it. What good were prayers in a field of hell?\r<br>\nHe was knocked down with the force of the blow. He hit the sand with such force that heis sword struck the ground and stayed upright, vibrating.\r<br>\nQuick as lightning Ressek scrambled up, lashing out with his long tail. The bony nodules whipped into Elise's head, sending her reeling. Elise swiftly wheeled to the right, cutting Ressek's arm.\r<br>\nHe cried out in pain. It was not an ordinary wound. He could feel it vibrating with magic. Ressek might not have been a mage, but he could detect magic.</span></div></div>",

I do not wish to kill you.\"\r<br>\n\"And I wish to be killed, lizard! Dammit, Ressek, destroy me! My life is over, my road at an end!\"\r<br>\nA war raged inside Ressek. It would be easy to grant Elise's screaming requests, but that was not who he was. <i>Seek your death elsewhere, Elise,</i> the martial artist thought, and struck an entirely different point on her body. A pained squeak escaped her as she crumpled to the ground, unconcious.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Look at that, Warden. A fighter who does not wish to kill. This may be an interesting tournament after all.\"\r<br>\n\"Interesting, yes,\" the Arena master replied, scowling at Ressek, \"but not what will satisfy the crowd. They want blood, and it will be up to me to make sure that they get it. Peli, come here.\"\r<br>\nA short, stocky woman came forward, bearing a piece of parchment with the names of the competitors. \"Yes, Jared?\"\r<br>\n\"I told you before- never call me by that name.\"\r<br>\n\"Of course, Arena master.\"\r<br>\n\"Make sure Ressek's next fight is with Raven.\" Turning back to Calarith, the stout master of the Arena grinned. \"If they won't see the blood of those Ressek fights, they will see his.\"\r<br>\nCalarith watched as they exited the terrace, making whatever preparations were necessary for the next fight, and decided he did not like the manipulative little man who ran his battlegrounds.

It was here that Calarith flew, his wings carrying him over the scorching desert far quicker than any earth-bound traveler could hope to match. A trip that would take Arena supply caravans three days or more took Calarith only half a day. And so, shortly after noon, the massive dragon landed outside the city, scanning the low rooftops for the person he was supposed to meet.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You say Michael Ryan's captor left here a day ago?\"\r<br>\nThe cloaked figure nodded. Sandy yellow robes hid most of his features, but the human was still of a distinguished build, and besides, only a few kept the hoods of their robes up in desert heat, even if the cool breeze of the ocean were upon them.\r<br>\n\"Kane left in a sloop yesterday morning, headed out north. He was very skittish, and barely talked to anyone.\"\r<br>\n\"Daskir, remove that silly hood. There's no reason to hide your scars from me.\"\r<br>\nHesitant to obey the dragon, but more hesitant to do otherwise, the man removed his hood.\r<br>\n<i>Even after all this time, such atrocities between humans amaze me,</i> Calarith thought blandly. The left side of the man's face was normal, though slightly wrinkled with age, but the left side was a thick mass of scarred tissue. His right eye was a sickly yellow, his cheekbones all but revealed under a very thin layer of puckered scars. His jaw was pitted with small depressions, and near the joint of it was a deep pit nearly an inch across. Another legacy of the 18-year war Harac had waged on the Five Kingdoms.\r<br>\n\"Now that you have marveled at my deformities, Calarith, may I conceal them again? Such gawking is unbecoming of a dragon.\"\r<br>\n\"Yes, of course, Daskir. I thank you for your information on Kane. <i>Ryan</i> will owe me a favor for this, and if it is him I fight in the final match, such information will throw him off-balance. I do not fear fighting a Catalyst, but there is always the chance that I may lose.\"\r<br>\n\"Of course, Calarith. Speed of Aumer be with you,\" the scarred veteran said, turning.\r<br>\n\"And His strength with you, Daskir,\" Calarith replied. Turning, the dragon left the edge of the city, winging his way back towards the Arena. With luck, he could still catch the last fight of the day.</span></div></div>",

The fight will be that much harder, now.</i>\r<br>\nFor Shalar, two arms became four at the elbows, and he crossed all four in a guarding position. His eyes flickered gold, his equivalent of blinking. \"Shall we start again?\" he asked Tyger.</span></div></div>",

Quick as lightning, they locked blades, Tyger barely managing to block his four sets of claws. However, she could do little or nothing about his long head-blade. Its hooked tip ripped another gouge, this time across her forehead. Blood streaming down into her eyes, she flung him back. \r<br>\nShalar stumbled a bit, but caught himself with his tail, and looked back. Tyger no longer stood before him, and as he looked up, he caught her bony foot square in the face. Overbalanced, he fell to the ground, lashing out blindly with his left arms, claws raking the air. A hiss from Tyger and a tug at the tips of his blades told him the slash had been successful, but at a price. Hot amber blood ran down his arms, a deep slice suddenly evident in his upper arm.\r<br>\nA throbbing ache began in his injured arm, but he pushed it aside.\r<br>\n\"Well done, Tyger. You have blooded me after all.\"\r<br>\n<i>\"After all!?!\"</i> Tyger shrieked. \"You calm, silent son of a bitch! Damn you, you're as bad as Ryan at times!\" She was breathing heavily, but mastered her anger, pushed it down. <i>No, I can't let him rile me! To do so is to blind myself and invite death at those claws.</i> Tyger chuckled. <i>Not that he'd have the heart to finish me, but why take chances? I won't fall so easily.</i>\r<br>\nAfter a few seconds more, and without any further talk, they clashed again. The crowd roared with approval, these two inhuman combatants hacking and clawing at eachother. A loud clang resounded through the stands and bowl of the Arena, and a glint of metal flew through the air, flashing brightly in the mid-morning light. One of Tyger's dirks, caught and tossed away in Shalar's claws. It buried itself in the dirt some yards away.</span></div></div>",

First that damn dragonet, and now a walking fishhook.\" Elise spat on the ground with disgust. After besting her longtime enemy, Raven, she was full of contempt for non-humans. Shalar wasn't sure if it was because of Raven's survival, or because now that she had defeated him, she was a woman without a goal, a shell of her former determined self.\r<br>\n<i>Either way, she's empty. I should take great care not to anger her, or her revenge will be long and slow.</i>\r<br>\nThe Arena master, for the fifth time that day, dropped the red flag that signaled the fights. Elise leapt back as Shalar's blades sliced the air she had been occupying a second ago. Tendrils of black fire snaked from her palms, but Shalar's ruddy gold blades deflected the soul-scorching flames.\r<br>\n\"You're a shell of who you were, Elise. Raven's defeat isn't enough for you, is it?\"\r<br>\n\"He ruined my childhood, Shalar!\" she spat. \"He destroyed my life, and he lives yet! I have faced and defeated him, but he still lives!\"\r<br>\nHis claws still held in a double guard across his chest, he stood openly in the center of the Arena. \"You're worried that he'll come back, aren't you? That he'll rise up from the ranks and face you again.\"\r<br>\n\"Wouldn't you feel the same, if Harac still lived? You think you would be satisfied to know that you've bested him if he still were alive?\" She raised her arms muttering softly. Brilliant blue lightning gathered in a wide circle around her, seeping up from the ground. \"You're pathetic, Shalar. The mediocre warrior, out to avenge his dead brother.\" Her eyes flared, and with them, the lightning flashed up around her in a column fifty feet high. The spectators closest to her side of the Arena backed away for fear of shock. \"Well I lost far more than you, Shalar. And now I will teach you the pain of that loss.\"\r<br>\n<i>Dammit!

His long gait took him to the Arena's twenty-foot stone walls in two more steps. With a mighty leap, he latched onto the walls, and began scaling them swiftly. His four arms heaved him upwards to the top of the wall, and by now Elise was beginning to get worried. <i>What is he up to?</i> Then she realized- her spell's power was weakest at the top! He could leap into it at perhaps the thirty-foot mark from there, and break through!\r<br>\nShe tried to pull more power to her protective column, but it was too late. With a blinding flash, Shalar broke through, lightning trailing from his many blades. Unhurt, he landed at her feet.\r<br>\n\"The pain of your loss is just beginning, Elise.\" His right claws gripped her by the shoulder and waist, and heaved her bodily into the sides of her own column. There was a briliant flash and Elise screamed in agony as the powerful bolts burned her skin wherever they touched, setting alight her robes in spots. In that instant, the whole column collapsed, tumbling inwards to bury Shalar under a cascade of lightning. He raised his claws over his head, covering as much of himself as he could, but the pain was still almost unbearable as the uncontrolled bolts scorched his back, lashing into him as they fell to earth and were drawn under.\r<br>\nPainfully, he stood, steam rising from the burns on his back.

Slowly, too slowly, the wraith turned to find her hovering at face level, her large wings beating the air every few seconds. He slashed at her with his sickle arm, but she blocked the bone blade easily and wheeled inside his guard, driving her other dirk straight into his left eye.\r<br>\nThe scream of agony rippled through the crowd like a shockwave, everyone reeling from the half-telepathic wail as it reverberated inside their heads as well as their ears. Half-stunned, Tyger fell to the ground, both hands cupped over her ears. Above her, Marr tore the dirk from his eye. Green mist seemed to boil out of him.\r<br>\n<i>So that's what a bog wraith's blood looks like,</i> Shalar mused.</span></div></div>",

Both his eyes were faded, rust-colored spots, and Tyger was sure he was temporarily blind. <i>That is, at </i>least<i> temporarily...</i> She pulled her dirks from the ground and staggered towards the Arena doors.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And now, it's my turn.\" Shalar sighed and excused himself from the combatants' terrace, making his way to the staging area in the stones below. <i>I've got to learn magic.

One of those landed it on an orderly's boot.\"\r<br>\nTyger laughed painfully. \"How bad did our beloved Arena master chew you out?\"\r<br>\n\"Not bad, all things considered. But I know he's cooking up something. He won't let this slide, especially not the way he's been manipulating the fights lately. For all I know, he might pit me against David for a grudge match, or he might simply decide to go with a big finish and have Calarith kill me.\"\r<br>\nTyger's eyes widened. \"You think he would do that? Send Calarith on you?\" Shalar simply nodded again.\r<br>\n\"I believe he'd do anything if the need called for it. After all, he allowed Ryan to be sold to this battle, with full knowledge of his predicament, and drafted Ressek into the fights simply because he was helping Siph off the field.\"\r<br>\n\"If you had to fight Calarith, do you think you could beat him?\"\r<br>\nShalar laughed, an ugly, almost panic stricken laugh. \"He would tear me apart in moments. I may be fast, but I don't think I'm ready to beat the Arena's champion. Hell, I'd be lucky to live through Raven right now.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nNight had fallen on the Arena, and the last bout was coming to an end. Calarith stood regally on his terrace, joined by the Arena master. The man had made his way up here, to this highest point of his Arena to gain counsel from Calarith.\r<br>\n\"He is an obstinate one, no doubt. But I refuse to believe it is necessary for me to kill him. He will make a fine challenger when he is properly weathered.\" Calarith's voice was low but cultured, giving him an air of superiority that he exploited at any encounter. <i>Of course, humans are so easily cowed by appearances. My size alone would do well...but why resort to such barbaric measures as physical intimidation? Politics have such a finesse to them.</i> Calarith turned, fixing his eyes on the man who provided this battlefield he presided over. \"Ultimately, it is your decision. How severe is too far?\"\r<br>\n\"But that's the problem- I don't know whether to reward him and the crowd with a glorious battle, like his long-time hate, David, or to send someone deadly and finish him!\" The Arena master held his head in his hands, his shoulder-length hair clinging to his sweaty cheeks. He looked up at the great dragon. \"I'm at a loss, Calarith. For perhaps the first time in my life, I don't know what to do.\"\r<br>\n<i>Such a fool of a human. It's amazing they survive as they do, but I suppose he is a poor example. It's humans like Ryan and Elise that make up the backbone of their survival. Whether they acknowledge it or not...</i> Calarith closed his eyes in thought, then fixed them on the Arena master again.</span></div></div>",

A thin gray line of storm clouds hunkered on the horizon, preparing to pounce. It gave the Arena the feel of a true battlefield, one where armies of warring kingdoms clashed, hundreds of men fighting and dying, hacked to pieces, or doing the hacking. <i>The storm gathers...</i>\r<br>\nOpposite him, there was nothing but the stone doors. They slowly rumbled open, and Shalar saw iron gates behind it. That could only mean one thing. <i>There's only one fighter here nasty enough to need channel gates. Raven!</i> Shalar glanced up at the Arena master, holding the red cloth above the Arena. He actually smiled at Shalar when he noticed the creature's gaze fall on him. <i>The price of insolence is meant to be death...but when did Raven become the assasin?</i> It didn't matter. The Arena's keeper dropped his cloth, and with a ghastly screech, the gates were drawn open, leaving the sleek black dragonet tearing into the field of battle. The minute he saw Shalar, his eyes narrowed, and he threw himself into the air, preparing to dive at Shalar like a hawk.</span></div></div>",

He squeezed off one startled, angry chirp before Shalar's elbow blade landed flat across his throat, gagging him.\r<br>\nChoking and coughing, the dragonet fell hard to earth. In comparison, Shalar landed lightly on his long toe-blades and whipped his tail out, puncturing Raven's left wing, then tearing a huge rent in it as he ripped the hooked blade free.

Those who are not are too easily defeated.\" The great dragon nodded at Raven's circling. \"Such as the leap he made at Shalar in the beginning. Brash and bloodthirsty, and it has cost him dearly already.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRaven hissed and snapped at Shalar, trying to force a move other than his solid \"double-guard\" position, crossing both his upper and lower forearms  in a double X that would easily thwart any hasty moves. <i>Blood. I must have his blood! I cannot even smell it yet- I have not blooded him! I </i>must<i>!</i> Raven feinted a charge to Shalar's left flank, then as Shalar moved to block him, his tail lashed out to hit Shalar in the legs, unbalancing him. <i>Oh shit! No! I can't fall!

In an instant, Raven went from careful stalking to a sudden lunge, directly at Shalar's throat. The two of them fell backwards, Shalar desperately trying to hold Raven off his jugular. The dragonet's claws raked his arms and sides furiously, scrabbling madly in his attempt to drive his sharp teeth into Shalar's throat. Then the dragonet made his mistake. His wings fluttered open, trying to gain purchase in the air that would give him the extra push needed to reach Shalar's throat. That gave Shalar all the opportunity he needed, kicking out with his powerful legs to drive Raven skyward. His wings caught the air enough to drag him backwards, away from Shalar. As he fell back, the bladed creature's claws shot out, grabbing the dragonet by his own throat and ribcage, digging in slightly with their sharp hooks. With one fluid motion, Shalar turned, flinging Raven at the portion of wall closest to them. As with Tyger in his first fight, Raven struck the wall hard.

It would be a shame for you to follow his path.\" Painfully, David waved to the terrace where the Arena master stood.

And indeed, something\r<br>\nwas coming closer, though not Shalar.\r<br>\nRipples of gold light flowed from underneath Shalar, stretching out in a narrow\r<br>\nband that traced its way along the ground to where Johnathan stood, in demon\r<br>\nform. A short distance from reaching him, the ground under the magic cracked. A\r<br>\nheartbeat later, hundreds of tendrils of magic snaked out from the ground,\r<br>\nwrapping around Johnathan's arms, legs, neck, and waist. Far beyond the crack,\r<br>\nJohnathan could just make out Shalar's glowing form on the far side of the\r<br>\nbattleground.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShalar saw dimly that his magic was tangling itself around Johnathan. <i>\"Now\r<br>\npull. Pull!\"</i> the voices echoed. They had been right thus far, and Shalar saw\r<br>\nno reason to ignore them now. Not knowing why or how, he pulled the tendrils\r<br>\nback, as hard as he could.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohnathan screamed in pain as his demon form was litterally torn from him. A\r<br>\nshadowy image that might have been the demon's acquired soul hovered in the air\r<br>\nbefore him, though his vision was blurred with tears as he shut his eyes hard to\r<br>\nthe pain. He lay on the dusty ground in human form, rich purple blood soaking\r<br>\nhim and the dirt around him. Bellowing in rage and terror, the demon's soul was\r<br>\npulled under the ground, and the crack sealed itself with a bright golden\r<br>\nflash.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShalar felt the rumble as the ground sealed itself. Suddenly, the magic he had\r<br>\nunleashed was gone, and the \"stone door\" he had opened sealed itself within\r<br>\nagain, the voices retreating beyond it and out of reach. Completely drained,\r<br>\nShalar sank to his knees. Above him, he could just make out through his clearing\r<br>\neyesight the Arena master, red with rage, declaring him the winner. Golden\r<br>\nphosphorenes shone for an instant as Shalar blinked. <i>I won...Arena master,\r<br>\nyou podgy bastard, I won.</i> With those final thoughts, Shalar collapsed into\r<br>\nblackness.</span></div></div>",

We were beginning to wonder,\" she said, and put\r<br>\ndown a sheet of parchment. \"Do you know what happened?\"\r<br>\n\"I defeated Johnathan. Then I blacked out,\" Shalar said blandly.\r<br>\n\"You are what is known as a 'wild talent,' someone with innate but nearly\r<br>\nuncontrolable natural powers. Yours come from an earth element, apparently,\" she\r<br>\nsaid with mild interest, looking over the parchment records. \"And you've\r<br>\ncompletely drained yourself, or so we think.\"\r<br>\n\"So you think?\" Shalar repeated.\r<br>\n\"Apparently, whatever magical reserves you have are locked very deep within.\r<br>\nBecause of that, sensing the levels of such magic is very difficult, often\r<br>\nmisleading, and that is why it has taken until now for you to use them- a 'wild\r<br>\ntalent' must be pressed hard to reveal their abilities.\" She offered him a\r<br>\nsympathetic glance. \"An unbeatable demon would qualify.\"\r<br>\n\"If he was unbeatable, then why did I win?\" Shalar asked cautiously. This ordery\r<br>\ndid not look like someone who would tolerate an offense.\r<br>\n\"You didn't defeat the demon, Shalar. You returned him. Johnathan's\r<br>\nshape-shifting abilities come from acquiring a copy of the creature's soul. By\r<br>\nusing these copies, he can become virtually anything he wants to. But inside is\r<br>\nstill his form. Your magic tore the demon's form from him, and returned it to\r<br>\nits own realm. Johnathan was almost killed,\" she added sadly.\r<br>\nShalar blinked. <i>Surely she doesn't have interest in him?</i> he thought, but\r<br>\nleft the thought unspoken. \r<br>\n\"In any event, you are fit to return to competition. But be warned- try to\r<br>\nrelease much more of that magic and you'll find yourself in much worse shape\r<br>\nthan simple exhaustion.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Despite the orderly's report,\r<br>\nhe did not believe he was ready yet to return to battle. <i>It's been too long\r<br>\nsince I've eaten. I need strength. And food. I wonder if my pack is still\r<br>\nfilled? It should be in the barracks then...yes, less of a trip.</i> Choosing a\r<br>\ndifferent corridor, Shalar made his way back to his barracks room. Tyger was\r<br>\nwaiting for him- and so was someone else.\r<br>\n<i>What is Ressek doing here?</i> Shalar wondered, and asked Tyger aloud.\r<br>\n\"I came to ask you about Siph, Shalar,\" Ressek replied, turning from the window\r<br>\nto face his next competitor. \"Don't kill him.

That does not justify his death\r<br>\nany more than the true reason I killed him, but I will not repeat such an act\r<br>\nagain.\" Shalar pulled his pack from under his bunk, rummaging for something\r<br>\nedible. No one spoke for a moment. \r<br>\nIt was Tyger who at last broke the silence. \"Why ask this, Ressek?\"\r<br>\n\"Because, Siph has his own magical abilities.

I do not wish to see Siph meet the same end as the demon before\r<br>\nhim.\" Ressek clasped his long-fingered hands on Shalar's shoulder-blades. \"And\r<br>\nbelieve me, you <i>will</i> be hard pressed. Siph wishes to win for glory, and\r<br>\nthat sort of ambition is more than enough to drive him on.\" Ressek shook his\r<br>\nhead sadly and released Shalar's shoulders. \"He has something to prove, and is\r<br>\nvery desperate to do so.\"\r<br>\n\"Desperate people make too many mistakes, Ressek. Tell him that. If he needs an\r<br>\nexample, he can look to the lowest terrace of the Arena in his next fight.\"\r<br>\n\"The Arena master...?\"\r<br>\n\"He is <i>very desperate</i> to see me dead. His tournament-long conspiracy is\r<br>\nbeing unraveled simply because I fight in my own style, and he has taken drastic\r<br>\nlengths to see me dead in the Arena.\"\r<br>\n\"And of course, he wouldn't have you die any other way.\" Ressek turned back to\r<br>\nthe window. \"He is a fool indeed.\"\r<br>\n\"Not to interrupt this wonderful talk, but I have a fight with Elise to win,\"\r<br>\nTyger said, and pulled both her dirks from the wall as she made her exit. Shalar\r<br>\nwatched her go, wondering how much she had changed from the hate-filled creature\r<br>\nshe had been in the beginning.\r<br>\n\"And what of you, Ressek?\" Shalar asked, when she had gone.\r<br>\n\"I do not care, Shalar. It was not my choice to be in this Arena, and I will be\r<br>\nhappy if all I do is survive it.\" Ressek shuddered. \"My last fight will be with\r<br>\nElise. I pray that it is not my <i>last</i> fight.\"\r<br>\nSilently, he too made his exit, leaving Shalar alone in the barracks room.\r<br>\n<i>As the end winds down, so do our spirits.

Turning with the force, Shalar spun, landing a hard blow to Ryan's side with his tail.\r<br>\nAgain, the sword came around. Too late to block the blow, Ryan instead aimed for Shalar's tail. A deep slice in his tail welled up with amber blood, spraying the ground as Shalar finished his turn. <i>So far, Ryan has had the better of this exchange. I must blood him, or I will die quickly at his sword. Regardless of what he said.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I think perhaps I have finally found a match for that damn creature. But there's something odd about Michael.\" Jarred watched carefully as Ryan and Shalar went at it, blow for blow, block for parry. \"He fights like a demon- like a...\" Jarred's mind reeled, refusing to contemplate what his mouth had been about to say. \"No, he can't be a Romarc. His eyes are all wrong.\"\r<br>\n\"I'm sorry, sir- were you talking to me?\" a nearby guard asked.\r<br>\n\"No. Tell me, what do they call Michael in the barracks?\"\r<br>\n\"They call him Ryan, sir.\"\r<br>\n\"Not Michael, or Michael Ryan? Just Ryan?\"\r<br>\n\"Yes sir.\"\r<br>\nJarred swore. \"No, it can't be. He died in the 18-year war. As did his parents...\" <i>There's no way you can be Ryan Lee Romarc! He's dead- isn't he?!?</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBelow, Shalar and Ryan broke apart, breathing heavily. Shalar stole a glance at the Arena master, but his attention was suddenly captivated by the semi-familiar man.\r<br>\n\"Ryan, look at our Arena master. There's something funny there,\" the bladed creature panted.\r<br>\n\"What are you...\" Ryan's question died on his lips as he glanced at Jarred. \"He thinks he knows who I am. I hope for my sake and his that he dismisses it.\"\r<br>\n\"And why would you want that?\" Shalar asked, turning back to Ryan.\r<br>\n\"Because I will have no hope of leaving if that man knows I am Ryan Lee Romarc!\"</span></div></div>",

A few of these guards are likely to be remenants of Harac's armies.\"\r<br>\nShalar was still absorbing that information when Ryan again came at him, sword raised. Quickly, Shalar deflected the blow, the steel blade sparking off Shalar's bronze claws. Whirling, Ryan brought the blade back around. Too late, Shalar raised his arms to block it. The sword's edge bit deep into his arm, drawing another line of blood from Shalar. Wincing, Shalar kicked out. His long foot-claws smashed into Ryan's knee, drawing twin lines of blood from the swordsman. Ryan stepped back carefully, but Shalar pressed his advantage. His right arms and elbow blade struck out at Ryan, who could not defend himself from all three at once. The swipe at his face was blocked, but the single elbow blade drew a ragged gash across his chest, the lower arm digging into his already injured leg. Ryan pushed the pain from his mind, then fought back. One blade seemed like many to Shalar, who was rapidly backed up by Ryan's vicious counterattacks. Everywhere, the sword seemed to come at him, only barely being parried in time, before it would reappear in another location, seeking his flesh.\r<br>\nHis back against the wall, Shalar leaned into the cool stones and kicked out with both his feet. The claws dug into Ryan's thick shoulders, knocking him backwards to the ground.\r<br>\n<i>I hope I have magic left- I will need it now.</i></span></div></div>",

With a sudden surge, his protective net brightened, then, as before in his fight with Johnathan, a ripple of gold light raced across the ground towards Ryan. A lump of earth followed it closely, as if a fast mole were chasing the magic. A small dust cloud rose from the lump of earth as it reached out towards Ryan.\r<br>\nThen Ryan's eyes glowed bright.\r<br>\n\"Stop,\" he commanded the light. To the surprise of everyone, the light halted in front of him. Cracks in the ground told the story of a magic seconds away from breaking loose, but the end of that story would go untold. With the finality of an executioner, Ryan drove his blade into the earth, right into the heart of Shalar's magic. A golden flare of light shot from the hole, then the whole Arena shook. A ripple of fire raced back down the trail of magic, blasting dirt high into the air as it consumed the tunnel of earth. Dust, smoke, fire, and light all retreated towards Shalar, standing in his golden net.\r<br>\n<i>\"Perhaps. But you are wrong. He is a Catalyst, and I don't envy you discovering that when you fight.\"</i> Tyger's words echoed in Shalar's mind- then the stone door that held his magic slammed shut, and everything went dark.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe instant before the backfiring magic reached him, Shalar's shield dropped. The ground beneath him erupted, flinging him back into the wall of the Arena.\r<br>\n\"Finish him, Ryan,\" the Arena master commanded. \"Kill him now.\"\r<br>\n\"Like hell I will, Jared.\" Ryan stared hard at the man, still one of the most hated men in the Romarc kingdom. <i>But we're not in the Romarc kingdom, and I must remember that. Here, that bastard holds sway.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShalar's conciousness trickled back slowly. The first thing he saw was the Arena master practically falling off the terrace as he leaned out, staring hard at something in the middle of the battlegrounds. As he raised his head, a wash of dizziness came over him, but he fought it aside and looked ahead. Ryan stood in the center of the grounds, staring back at Jared.\r<br>\n\"Ryan...Ryan Lee Romarc!\" Jared stuttered. \"But h-how? How did you survive? You fell off that cliff three years ago!\"\r<br>\n\"We Romarcs are a tough breed. Haven't you learned that yet, Jared?\"\r<br>\n\"Your mother and father weren't so sturdy.

He hadn't learned that, either.\"\r<br>\nShalar sat up slowly, carefully rising to his feet. \"Ryan,\" he croaked, then coughed and recovered his voice. \"Ryan, forget him. Let us finish this fight. Then whoever loses can call him out. At least one of us can have our vengeance early.\"\r<br>\nRyan looked shocked. \"You would be satisfied with Jared's death though Kane still lives?\"\r<br>\n\"You have prior claim on him. If you cannot catch him, I will chase him to the ends of the earth and beyond, but I give you first shot at him.\"\r<br>\n\"Very well, Shalar.\"\r<br>\nBronze blade met steel one over the center of the Arena, while Jared looked on in fury. \"Let us finish this bout, so that we can finish our quests.\"</span></div></div>",

Too late, Ryan moved to block it, but only drew sparks from the strangely curved shoulder blade as Shalar's claws hit him, spinning him to the ground. A swift kick rolled Romarc another few feet.\r<br>\nPainfully, Ryan stood again, bringing his sword up. Carefully, he approached Shalar, clearly favoring his right leg- the same one to bear earlier damage. <i>Still, that should not bother someone like Ryan so badly. As he said, the Romarcs are a tough breed.</i> Whatever the reason, Ryan was attacking mainly from the left foot. However, the attacks lacked the power and agility of his earlier fighting, and was unable to block the backhand that smashed into his jaw, spinning him yet again to the ground. He made as if to rise, but sank back down on one knee, staring sadly at the ground.\r<br>\n\"This fight is over, Shalar. You have won.\"\r<br>\n\"Thinking like that will certainly make it so, Ryan,\" Shalar said in confusion.\r<br>\n\"You wish to continue until death, Shalar? I know Romarcs do not give up easily, and admit even less freely when they are beaten, but I cannot win this fight- not without a cost to myself that I am unwilling to pay.\" Ryan looked up at Shalar, who was momentarily taken aback by the emptiness that had consumed Ryan's expression. \r<br>\n<i>He truly is a broken hero,</i> Shalar thought, respect and pity leaking out over his face.\r<br>\n\"Find him Shalar. Find Kane and kill him- before he kills my family. They're all I have left in this world.\" Ryan reached out, grasping one of the long bronze claws Shalar held to him. \"Kill him for me, as well as Rievus. And for all the others who were lost in that war.\"\r<br>\nShalar bowed his head and pulled Ryan to his feet.\r<br>\n\"I will indeed. For everyone.\"</span></div></div>",

No, he wasn't there when I was getting patched up, and he won't be there now, I'm sure of it.</i> As he expected, he spotted Ryan at a table in the mess hall, and paused only long enough at the line to grab two cups of ale.

Glowing red cracks spread out below him, widening as the earth shattered. Fire leaked out between the rifts, sending tendrils of smoke up into Shalar's face as they lifted skyward. <i>Oh no!</i> Shalar thought, and flung himself off that patch of ground. An instant later, a tower of flame ripped through the ground, showering both Siph and Shalar with burning dust and ash. Seeing that Shalar had escaped that bit of magic, Siph released his hold on the column. Instantly, the whole flaming mess collapsed in a shower of fire that drenched everything in its heat.

The cascade ended, but he did not even have the chance to straighten himself before Siph was on him. \r<br>\nThe demon's claws tore at him, undoing what the healer mages had accomplished after his fight with Ryan, and opening new wounds in the process. <i>Whatever things may be said about Siph's appearance,</i> Shalar thought briefly, <i>harmless isn't one of them.</i> He lashed out with his claws, but only succeeded in opening his chest to another wound. <i>This has to stop. Now!</i>\r<br>\nShalar brought his tail around, knowing Siph would automatically dodge it, and swept his claws together.

You've just sent him to the underworld!\"\r<br>\n\"He is a demon- he belongs there.\"\r<br>\nSlowly, Ressek released Shalar from the ground. \"He is unhurt, you say?\"\r<br>\n\"Except for what harm came to him in the fight here.\" Shalar dusted himself off,\r<br>\npointedly ignoring the eager expression on the Arena master's face, and the\r<br>\ndisgusted, hate-filled one that replaced it as Ressek let him up. \"You wish to\r<br>\ngo after him, don't you?\"\r<br>\n\"Siph and I have been friends for a long time, Shalar. Even if he came from\r<br>\nhell, he no longer belongs there.\"\r<br>\nShalar blinked, gold light flashing in the shadow of the Arena's walls. \"Take\r<br>\ncare, Ressek. A demon may belong in hell, but even they have a hard time there.\"\r<br>\nWith those parting words, he left the Arena's bowl. Soon after, Ressek\r<br>\nfollowed.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

One part skill, two parts luck.\"\r<br>\nRyan shrugged, still somewhat surprised that Tyger had not objected strongly to\r<br>\nhis presence in this room. After all, half of it was hers. <i>I wonder- how\r<br>\nclose are Shalar and Tyger?</i> Ryan shook his head. Even if the thought wasn't\r<br>\nas rediculous as it sounded, it was still something he didn't want to\r<br>\nconsider.\r<br>\n\"Ryan, I'm more puzzled about how you plan to kill Jared.

Always before, the\r<br>\nresult was the same- the dragon had torn them apart, be it mage, swordsman, or\r<br>\ndemon. But this time, they had something new- a creature most had not seen\r<br>\nbefore, and one to which humans had yet to place a name other than his own-\r<br>\nShalar. Those who had seen his premature ending with Krath said he was vicious.\r<br>\nThose who booed as he let Sarah walk away untouched said he was compassionate.\r<br>\nNot one had a true idea of who he was.\r<br>\nThe sun had just passed noon, hanging high in the sky, when Shalar entered the\r<br>\nArena for the last time. <i>This is it- the big finish.

They wish for a new hero.</i>\r<br>\nThe thought soured the joy Jared had felt moments earlier, but he forced himself\r<br>\nto continue.\r<br>\n\"And the challenger to our Great Dragon, Shalar!\" He made his voice as full of\r<br>\ncontempt as he could, trying to sway the feelings of the spectators against the\r<br>\nbladed creature. The attempt failed miserably.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nCalarith landed in a swirl of dust that stirred the fleshy tassles on his wings\r<br>\nand headfins. No triumphant roar, no showy gout of flame. He relished the fight,\r<br>\nthe fresh challenge. Tournaments lasted but a few days- however, months passed\r<br>\nbetween these sessions as the new competitors worked their way up the chain of\r<br>\npit-fights outside the Arena's walls. And Calarith was tired of waiting.\r<br>\n\"I have waited long for a challenge such as you, bladed one,\" Calarith rumbled.\r<br>\nThe words were not just show- he was as happy for the fight as he was that\r<br>\nShalar's presence here annoyed the Arena warden.\r<br>\n\"And I have long feared it,\" Shalar admitted. \"But they say the first step in\r<br>\novercoming your problems is admitting you have them. I will overcome you,\r<br>\ndragon. Somehow, I must find a way.\"\r<br>\n\"You are either very brave or very stupid, Shalar, to speak to me in such a\r<br>\nmanner.\"\r<br>\n\"I am both, or I would not be here.\"\r<br>\nJared cut in, releasing the combatants to each other. \"Let this fight\r<br>\ncommence!\"\r<br>\nThe red cloth fluttered in the air, caught a current, and landed square in the\r<br>\nmiddle of the Arena's bowl.

The sound seemed lost in the silence and the\r<br>\ncrackling flames below. Then all hell broke loose.\r<br>\nTrailing flames from his blades, Shalar broke through the fire.

Then he was\r<br>\nrunning, dashing hell-bent for the Champion that stared coolly at him from the\r<br>\nfar end of the Arena. Another gout of flame shot out, but Shalar rolled easily,\r<br>\nand the would-be pyre missed him by several feet.\r<br>\n\"Damn you, Shalar, hold still!\" Calarith demanded, but of course, did not expect\r<br>\nit to be so. <i>I asked for a challenge- it is I who must over come it.

Instead of latching on, however, he dug his hooked claws deep\r<br>\nand began climbing Calarith. Trying to dislodge Shalar, the Champion snapped at\r<br>\nhim, but seeing the dragon's head close enough, Shalar leapt from the leg\r<br>\ntowards Calarith's face.

Several of the weaker-minded onlookers\r<br>\nscreamed in fear. And perhaps they had reason to.\r<br>\nFire leaked from the walls, running in thin lines to form a circle around\r<br>\nCalarith. Shalar dodged aside as one strand of flame rushed by him on its way to\r<br>\njoin the growing bonfire around the dragon. More strands leaked in, fueling the\r<br>\ncircle of fire. The floor of the Arena began to look like a fiery spiderweb,\r<br>\nwith Calarith in the middle, silently summoning his ancient powers as the\r<br>\nflaming walls rose higher around him. Slowly, a wind stirred, picked up, whirled\r<br>\naround the hollow walls of fire as they grew taller, spinning the flames into a\r<br>\ntornado. The top sealed over Calarith's head, and still the flames grew\r<br>\nhigher.\r<br>\n<i>That fire must be fifty, sixty feet high!</i> Shalar thought in amazement.\r<br>\nThe top narrowed, and began bending over. Flames spurted backwards, and then the\r<br>\nwhole arrangement became clear- a giant dragon's head, formed of fire, on a long\r<br>\nserpentine neck. Calarith roared with triumph from inside the base of the\r<br>\nflames, and two bright white flames flickered to life where the fire-dragon's\r<br>\neyes would have been.\r<br>\n<i>I've got to do something, now! Before it's too late!</i> Then a thought\r<br>\ntickled the back of Shalar's mind- the same one that he had thought of on\r<br>\nearlier occasions. <i>I have to try, the alternative being a fiery death...</i>\r<br>\nConcentrating, he unleashed the gold tendrils again. \r<br>\nCalarith laughed, his burning white eyes seeing Shalar far below working the\r<br>\nsame pathetic magic he had tried earlier. With a roar like all the fires of\r<br>\nhell, the flaming dragon's visage descended on Shalar.\r<br>\nShalar's magic shot up, wrapping around himself and pulling him under. The\r<br>\nground sealed above him with a flash of light- instantly lost in the draconic\r<br>\ninferno that crashed down on the spot a split second later.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nCalarith stood in the center of the Arena, his flaming web burning out and\r<br>\ndisappearing. Small fires burned all over the spot where Shalar once stood.\r<br>\n<i>Flaming bits- all that's left of him.</i> Then the ground rumbled.\r<br>\nThe shocked and dismayed looks of the spectators turned to expressions of awe as\r<br>\nthe ground where Shalar had disappeared cracked wide open.\r<br>\nRising from the rift, protected by a crackling sphere of gold lightning, was\r<br>\nShalar. His eyes snapped open, their gold light disappearing, and fixed on\r<br>\nCalarith.\r<br>\n\"No...how is that possible..?\" Calarith wondered out loud. A few brave onlookers\r<br>\nchuckled at the dragon's shock, but their laughter was lost in the tension that\r<br>\nburned in the Arena's bowl.\r<br>\nAgain, the gold light spread from around Shalar, but instead of pooling beneath\r<br>\nhim, it spread out in a ring. As it passed over the earth, it bleached the dirt\r<br>\nto a bone white, leaching all color and energy from the dry soil. Flickers of\r<br>\ngold lightning twitched across the widening circle, their brightness even more\r<br>\ncontrasting with the bleached soil. The net around Shalar brightened as well,\r<br>\nflashing occasionally with a discharge of lightning as it struck the soil or\r<br>\nair. One burned a chunk of rock from the Arena's wall. And still, the circle\r<br>\nwidened.\r<br>\n\"You were wrong, Calarith. The earth is far more ancient and powerful than the\r<br>\ndragons that roamed it in the old days. It gave you your powers, your form, your\r<br>\nlife. It supports all creation. And it can take it all back at will.\"\r<br>\n\"Whose will, Shalar? Yours? You will not kill me.\"\r<br>\n\"No, Calarith, I would not. But the earth does not take kindly to those who\r<br>\nboast of being more powerful than their creators.\"\r<br>\nCalarith's eyes widened in shock, though whether that shock stemmed from being\r<br>\nlectured by someone so small, or from simple fear of his fate he could not say.\r<br>\nIt mattered little now.\r<br>\nThe earth shook again, rumbling angrily as it thrust tall pillars of stone\r<br>\nthrough the Arena's floor. Three, four, five- the pillars kept coming,\r<br>\nsurrounding Calarith like a cage. He looked around in fear- they were taller\r<br>\nthan him! And still they grew, shooting up from the earth like spears thrust\r<br>\nthrough flesh. The last fell in place, eight in all, and Calarith took the\r<br>\nmomentary silence to attempt flight. But then it was Shalar's turn.\r<br>\nThe pent-up energy he harbored flew from him in one massive bolt of gold\r<br>\nlightning, splashing over the octet of stone pillars, linking them together with\r<br>\nelectric gold fire that danced between the eight columns, then out across the\r<br>\ntops of the stones, forming a gold net, a stone-and-lightning cage that Calarith\r<br>\ndared not touch. The earth rumbled again.\r<br>\n\"What will happen,\" Calarith asked, a tremor in his usually haughty draconian\r<br>\nvoice.\"\r<br>\n\"A year of solitary confinement. <i>Very</i> solitary.\" The ground buckled under\r<br>\nboth Calarith and the stones, and Calarith trumpeted in alarm as the whole\r<br>\nassembly sank beneath the ground. \"Goodbye, Champion,\" Shalar said. His words\r<br>\nwere soft, but with a power that made them echo from the Arena's highest\r<br>\nterrace- the one Calarith used to occupy.\r<br>\nThe color faded back into the ground, restoring the dusty brown of the dirt, or\r<br>\nthe hard gray of the stones. The magic faded, the stone portal in Shalar's mind\r<br>\nswinging shut. Gold light showered the ground as he closed his eyes, sinking to\r<br>\nhis knees, and with one last glance around, hearing Jared's angry words declare\r<br>\nhim Champion of the Arena, he lost himself to unconciousness.</span></div></div>",

After testing his theory during the fight with Calarith, he\r<br>\nknew he could gain a lot of ground per day- faster, even, than a ship.\r<br>\nUnfortunately, he would not be able to maintain that pace for more than half a\r<br>\nday.\r<br>\n\"You say you can travel through the earth, Shalar? Tunnel your way to Kane?\"\r<br>\n\"Not to Kane, specifically, but it will let me move faster if I travel\r<br>\nunderground.\"\r<br>\n\"I do not understand that, but if you believe so strongly in your newfound\r<br>\nabilities, who am I to say different?\"\r<br>\nShalar shook his head, unwilling to bring up the next subject, but not callous\r<br>\nenough to let it go, either. \"Ressek wishes that I transport him the way I sent\r<br>\nSiph. He has no thoughts of how to return to our world, though. I think he hopes\r<br>\nSiph will know the way back.\"\r<br>\n\"There have been times that I wondered how demons entered this world. Should I\r<br>\nmeet Ressek again, I should ask him.\"\r<br>\n\"Ask Siph, when I bring him back.\"\r<br>\nRyan and Shalar turned to see Ressek and Tyger leaving the shadow of the Arena's\r<br>\ngates.\r<br>\n\"What are you two doing out here?\" Tyger asked.\r<br>\n\"Plotting the downfall of our enemies,\" Ryan answered. Shalar was not sure if it\r<br>\nwas meant as a joke, but it drew a laugh from Tyger.\r<br>\n\"And that involves Ressek?\"\r<br>\n\"Enough. I leave tomorrow- I do not wish to leave you two clawing for each\r<br>\nother's throats when I go.\"\r<br>\n\"Selfish, Shalar, but fair enough,\" Tyger said. \"Some day, Ryan, you and I\r<br>\n<i>will</i> have to settle this matter.\" She shrugged and sat down with the\r<br>\nrest. \"And what of Jared?\"\r<br>\n\"Ryan has already determined that Jared dies tomorrow night- the night, in fact,\r<br>\nwhen he is expected to announce with all due ceremony, my new title of\r<br>\nChampion.\" Shalar grinned. \"A fitting end to his unpleasant business here.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe next day dawned bright and clear. The small scrub forest at the Arena's\r<br>\nborders seemed almost as welcoming to Shalar as the forest he had once called\r<br>\nhome. <i>And now, it is time to leave yet again. Run as fast as you want, Kane.\r<br>\nYou won't escape me now.</i> With one last look back at the Arena towering\r<br>\nbehind him, Shalar set out into the morning.</span></div></div>",

He needed to check the battle roster to see where he would be, but it didn't really matter that much to him. The killing would start soon. He had almost separated himself from battles, making it a duty. He took no pleasure in it, only did what was necessary to get out. Tyger though, she scared him. She scared him because he recognized her from years ago, before he had changed, before he had left Harac. But that was another story, and one he tried to block out.\r<br>\nHe picked up his sword on his way out, not even bothering to close the door.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTyger strode away from Shalar, angry that she had let him get to her like that. It was true what she'd said. Ryan was a Catalyst, just like the man who'd murdered the rest of her clan. But she had killed him long ago, and soon she would kill Ryan as well. \r<br>\nShe rested a clawed hand lightly on the hilt of one of her dirks. She had to win this. She would prove that she was the best, and no one, not Shalar and not Ryan, was going to get in her way.\r<br>\n<i>'Besides.'</i> she thought with a smirk. <i>'If they try, then I will simply kill them.'</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSiph stared at the floor as he walked toward the roster posts. <i>I got Ressek into this, whether I like it or not. I suppose I'll be the one to get him out.</i> As he reached the rosters, he noticed Ryan standing beside him. <i>So many in this fight against their will. Ryan, David, Ressek, Krath...If- no </i>when<i> I defeat Calarith, I'll have them all released.</i> Siph sighed. <i>But that means they must survive the fighting. And with so many determined to kill each other, that's a real problem.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nElise walked back up the stone steps towards the main level. She couldn't shake her anger at Raven, and in part, didn't want to. The little dragonette had caused her a lot of pain and heartache, while she wasn't even sure if he had meant to or not.\r<br>\nIt had been only a few years ago, back when she had been but a girl. He had lured her out into the field, squawking excitedly. She had thought she was needed, or that he'd found something.\r<br>\nIn truth he had: slavers. They had taken both her and Raven, and she blamed the dragonette for it all. But now was her chance to escape. She would win her match, and in the end, he would die.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRaven stirred excitedly in his cell. The orderlies beyond his bars were holding keys, and that meant food. Then he remembered- <i>the fights begin today.</i> He would have to fight his food, hunt it down and kill it, before he could taste its blood, its flesh.\r<br>\nHe stopped pacing and squawked excitedly at the orderlies, who paused in their work to regard him warily.\r<br>\n\"That one's gonna be a real fun fight to watch,\" commented one dryly.\r<br>\n\"Fun? It's gonna be a bloodbath, you mark my words. I don't think even Krath is going to stand up to him for very long...\" The other orderly chuckled. \"Then again, that's not saying much...\"</span></div></div>",

There was no need to push his way foreword. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nTyger walked past him, and paused, narrowing her eyes. \"You will die at my hands, human.\" she said stiffly, before continuing past him. He followed her with feirce eyes, but said nothing. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs the warriors thinned, he walked foreword and glanced at his name on the roster. <i>'Damn.'</i> he thought, seeing that he was first.

He had to return to his family, or else they would suffer a painful death.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe turned to the entrance of the Arena, gazing out at the large dustbowl that he was to fight in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan felt the a familiar numbness. It came to him in all battles, sweeping in with a thunderous ferocity that brought both a measure of pleasure and an eerie calm.  It was the pleasure that he despised.  He told himself that he had no hatred for the creature that stood before him, that he felt nothing as she issued her enraged battle cry and came toward him across the sand covered floor of their battle ground.  But he did feel something, and that something was the thing that kept him awake at night.  That something brought the nightmares of the fire and the burning and the blood that had encompassed his being so long ago.  He had been death's fiercest warrior, slaughtering without pity, without mercy. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThat same something made him fear for his family and their fate if he did not win this match and the others after it.  He knew well the horror of war, the diseases of the battle engorged mind.  He knew that to murder women and children, entire families was nothing for a warrior who had even a small taste of what he was feeling right now.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe came at him with the fury of one depraved.  There was something about her movements that lacked caution, even common sense.  They were movements inspired by the fury that desperation lent.  She hated him.  He had recognized that instantly.  He had a hazy picture of her and her kind somewhere in the back of his mind, the image smelled of blood and death.  The image shamed him.  He knew that he had wronged her deeply, somehow, or at least she felt he did.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe pitied her, but he would show her no pity in battle.  She had her agonies and he had his, and this is where fate had taken them. There was no mercy, no pity in the arena, and Ryan did not believe in self sacrifice, even if he deserved nothing more than to lay at the ground at her feet in a pool of his own blood.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nNot today.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nToday he would fight.  Today she would die, her wrongs, sadly, unavenged. The lives of his family depended on his survival.  He did not dare think on anything else.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe checked herself, got control of her hatred and the slitted yellow eyes of the gargoyle followed him as he moved to circle her.  \" You will die today murderer of children,\" she hissed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe slashed at him suddenly with her tail.  Pain exploded in his shoulder.  The tough gray-green skin cut like metal, opening his flesh up, exposing his blood and thick white muscle to the sun.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe crowd roared.  \" First blood,\" they shouted, frenzied.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe laughed, triumph riding in her yellow eyes.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was not rage that Ryan felt when he dipped low and came at her suddenly, nor was it a quest for revenge for the scar given, or the humiliating screeching of the crowd at the sight of his blood.  He had many scars, from many battles, far too many to count.  He cared nothing for what the crowd of blood thirsty hounds seated above them thought.  No, it was a simple desire to win that propelled him.  The desire to end this battle and begin the next and the next after that until he stood with his foot upon Calirith's bloody, oozing skull.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe slashed at him with the dirks she carried, even as his sword cut across her mid-section and thinly opened the flesh there.  Her guts strained against the broken encasement of her flesh.  He brought his sword up again, ignoring the pain of the twin wounds she had opened on his chest.  He went for her throat, meaning to do her in and be done with it.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe saw him coming, saw his intent and kicked at him with her strong legs and clawed feet.  He stumbled backward just a little but it was enought for her to put some distance between them.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRyan watched her, feeling the blood oozing thinly from his body.  Above them, the crowd went mad.  His world became the all encompassing howl of their many voices combined.  His opponent stepped sideways, shifted in the dirt and sand.  She eyed him cautiously, hatefully. Then she howled and came at him again, the dirks crossed at her chest, the tail darted in and out all around him, tearing at his face and head.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe was strong and when she crashed into him it took every ounce of his strength not to fall backwards.  Falling would have meant his death and he was not going to die here today.  He steadied himself and sent his sword in a slashing arc that connected with her shoulder and took her arm off above the elbow.  Black blood rained upwards and clouded his eyes as she screamed and fell to the ground before him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe barely noticed the agony of the dirk that was stuck, maybe an inch deep, in his right thigh.  They had healers and magicians in the arena for such pains.  The main thing that a contestant had to do was stay alive, as long as one was breathing then the healers could fix any wound, no matter how bad it was, for the next fight.  It made for good business, the people paid more to see their favorite fighter fight again and again and again . . .\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe towered over her and she scrambled back in the sand, slashing at him with her tail and the tiny jewel encrusted dirk she held in her one good hand. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" FINISH IT!\" the crowd screamed, the crowd shouted, the battle was his.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRyan . . .  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

So long ago...what had happened why had he forgotten? His true family he had never met. Sarhuekey, the gargoyal who had taken him, protected him...loved him! The rist band on Tyger's paw glittered with black stones, symbolizing her clan. Sarhuekey's had done the same...\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTyger (or rather, Sarhuekey) felt the last of her strength leave her, \"At the hands of my only family...or rather X-family...\" she spit at Ryan, a little puddle of greenish slime landing on the ring upon his hand. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRyan glanced down at his only posession of value, a silver ring with encrusted black stones, now covered in gargoyal spit...what had happened? how had he and Sarhuekey been seperated? Why had his 'godmother' turned against him?\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTyger's eyes opened and gazed at Godknowswhat. Her dirk slipped away from Ryan's throught.

She frowned, though used to his actions. He was withdrawn, though not unfriendly, and not at all like the person she had remembered from their youth.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen they were younger, Ryan and her brother had been the best of friends. Ryan had always had a darker mood to him, but could make her laugh.\r<br>\nThe man she now knew was nothing like that boy. He had been broken again and again until he had nothing left to live for but his wife.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe tried to keep from feeling at that thought. In their youth, she had imagined that he would eventually marry her. After all, it was only she and her brother that he ever spent time with. \r<br>\nBut after Mack had died, Ryan had taken off. She assumed that he had joined the war, but knew little about what had happened to him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnd now he no longer spoke to her as openly. He was a battlehardened warrior now, dedicated to the sword and all that it meant. He had magic too, something ancient that she couldn't understand. She could see pain in his eyes sometimes, but other times she saw only the emptiness, which was so much worse.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I think I need to speak to Shalar.\" Ryan said suddenly, startling her out of her thoughts. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh.\" she said, smiling and jumping off of the top bed. \"Well, I'm hungry. See you later.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRyan nodded, caught up in his own thoughts as well. Finally he stood, still holding the dogtag. He had tried to live by the words inscribed on it, not only to honor the memory of a dead friend, but to perhaps find out what it was that he did believe in. The war had been simple in the very basic sense; Kill your enemy, protect your friend.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe walked out into the hall, wondering who it was they would have fighting when the morning came. The fights for the day were over, and he had won both of his. More would come though.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe sounds of voices came from the mess hall, for some of the local pit fighters came as well. He only glanced in, looking for the bladed-warrior. He spotted him easily, sitting at the same table as Ressek and Siph, though he did not speak.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe walked over and nodded.\r<br>\n\"Shalar,\" he said, sitting down opposite of him. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShalar looked up. \"Come to gloat?\" he asked wryly. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRyan managed a small smile. \"Not exactly. But if you don't mind...\" here he winked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So the catalyst has a sense of humor. Wonderful.\" The jovial mood faded. \"So, what is it that you <i>are</i> here about?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRyan's smile was gone now, only the sadness again. It was a look most who knew him were familiar with. His gray eyes went out of focus as his closed fist opened. Shalar noticed the sparkle of metal, still bright, though it seemed old.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Here,\" Ryan said suddenly, tossing it to the other warrior. \"I no longer need the memories this thing holds. Besides, I think you find its words to be wise.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWith that said, Ryan left the table. Shalar opened his hand, readin the inscription.\r<br>\n\"Tis better to die for what you believe in, than to hide behind what you don't.\"</span></div></div>",

Ryan nodded, though secretly his heart leapt. Her? Would she...no. She had no idea where he was or even if he were alive. It was better if she didn't. Saying nothing he followed the guard. What was the point of trying to converse with a slovenly beast like this? This part of the arena he had not seen before. The passages were clean of blood, and whitewashed. Probobly a place for offices or some such. The door that was opened was bound with clean, shining iron and was stained cherry. The room beyond was surprising, above ground. A small window was set in the wall, though it was barred. It was dusk outside, and the sun setting. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You may leave us, sir.\" The two people in the room stood by the window, cloaked, and by the folds in at their sides, armed. \"He is no danger to us.\" The one talking was obviously a woman, by the voice and skirts. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"er, allright, but if he gives you any trouble, just call.\" The guard nodded and shut the door behind his exiting, he would not be far off. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ryan...Am I right?\" The woman let her hood fall, as did her male companion. \"Ryan Lee Romarc?\" Her face was unfamiliar. Brown hair falling in a braid to her elbow. Green eyes studying him carefuly. She had pale skin, and was pinked by the sun. Of Short stature, though. Her companion was much taller, though bore the same features.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"How do you know my name?\" He asked, he was guarded, careful. He had no idea what they wanted.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Good, then you are who we're looking for.\" The man sighed and sat at the table in the room. \"Do you know how hard you are to track down? It wasn't until we got into the city that we heard jabber about you, the Catalyst they said...could only be-\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Who sent you?\" He asked, cutting him off.

To be free again...<i>Her raven hair spilling over the covers as she slept soundly in his arms, lips twitching in a sweet smile to some sweet dream.

That gives me more hope still.\" He knew it was almost useless to hope, but new determination rose in him. He would not give up so soon, not now. He was close, he could beat it. He could win his own freedom. He could have a thousand nights and more with her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her nothing.

He would never give in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her I am alive, that I will return, but I am held against my will. Tell her nothing whatsoever about the Arena, for my honor.\" He paused, hoping they would do that for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you crazy sonnofabitch, but we'll probably be back.\" She snorted, reaching into her satchel on the table. \"She asked, if ye be well, that you at least write her a note for evidence.\" She pulled out a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a quill that was broken in half, but would suffice. She pointed to them insistantly and he took his seat once more, staring at the blank page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he write? After all this time...wishing he could speak to her, write to her, have any communication at all...and he could think of barely a word. What could he say? He could promise nothing. He wanted to promise her that he would be home tomorrow, but he couldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" He pushed the articles away. \"Just tell her I will make it home. Soon. I promise it.\" He wouldn't let them say anything more to sway his mind. He was almost out of the door when he stopped a moment, saying quietly, eyes downcast though her face flickered before him. \"Tell her I still love her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, fine, stubborn...\" The woman called after him, temper probably egged on by the sunburn and the heat. He sighed. Knowing Kopri, and her mother, he would be seeing those two again. He shouldn't have even spoken to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought back to the common room, though many people had gone for an early bit of shuteye, but he resumed a seat in the corner, mulling it over. Could they keep his whereabouts a secret? How long would it be before Kopri got it in her head to come looking for him herself? No. Her mother could hold her back, and she would never leave the children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, leaning his head against the wall. Another day, another fight, another scar, another day closer to release. </span></div></div>",

Cheering broke out and they chanted LIve, live, live. THe guard looked around him unsure as to what to do next. He looked at the shadowed seats for assistance. THe crowd's voice's slowly died down and the gong rang out once. THe crowd cheered again and clapped and yelled loudly. Elise starred defiantly at the guard and stepped past him and walked towards the doors that would lead her back to the other slaves. Despite her defiance, she had been given permission to live. </span></div></div>",

He only just missed getting skewered, as the dagger shot past him and buried itself in a chink in the stone wall, several paces behind him.

It had been a brutal fight, Ressek had heard it all from Siph who still carried a wound to his right eye that kept it closed.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe fight going on now was the first fight for both Marr and Elise.  Their fight had been postponed due to a trick played by Marr to try and escape.  But they had found him and he was forced to fight.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRessek watched Elise use magic to try and freeze the bog wraith, but nothing was working.  Marr kept on lashing at Elise, causing a new deep scratch every time he did.  Ressek leaned back, closing his eyes. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Rethik, watch thith.\" Siph said, intrigued by the fight.  Ressek opened his eyes and watched as Marr consumed Elise.  Her screams echoed through out the arena and when the wraith had moved past her, all that was left was a pile of bones.  The mage had been brought down to nothing but bones. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's horrible.\" Ressek whispered. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nSiph turned to him and Ressek looked into Siph's orange eyes.  \"You okay Rethik?\" He asked. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRessek nodded.  \"I hate the fighting Siph.\" Ressek said, rubbing his reptilian eyes. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nSiph curled his mouth.  \"I know Rethik.

The dragonette's claws raked bloody furrows down David's chest as it struggled to get at him. With a final, mighty effort, David brought every ounce of strength he had into another pommel blow. With a traumatized squeak, Raven released his hold on the lycanthrope and rolled away. Shaking the dust off his black scales, Raven stood, watching David rise to his feet, his sword leveled at the dragonette. Predator's instincts ran through the veins of both combatants, and an instant later, they were at each other again. David slashed low with his sword, but the dragonette leapt above the blade. It snapped at David as it came to eye level, but Talis again brought the pommel of his sword up, smashing Raven in the jaw. The dragonette chirped and threw itself at David, who sidestepped and slashed him along the flank. Dragon's blood splashed the ground.\r<br>\nAngry and frustrated, the dragonette spun on David, but the human kept his head clear, and ducked under the leaping dragonette. His sword drew another slash in Raven's black scales, and he landed painfully behind David. Not one to give up, Raven leapt again.\r<br>\n<i>Enough of this. I'll be picking him apart all day.</i> As the little dragon left the ground, David sidestepped again. Already in the air, his wings too weak to use, Raven chirped angrily.\r<br>\nTalis grabbed Raven's left arm, and the dragon seemed to curl up at him, trying to reach David with his legs and teeth, but the effort was wasted.\r<br>\nPivoting, David threw Raven bodily towards the wall, using every shred of strength he could find. The thrashing dragon struck the Arena's wall and slumped to the ground.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnathan had known, undeniably, that this time would come.  He steeled himself against the aching pain that threatened to shatter his soul.  What would he become, in the ring, to murder his own father?  He imagined an image of himself as a wolf, a mirror of the creature his father was.  He imagined both of them circling in the ring, teeth gnashing, huge bodies twisting in a dance of raw and bloody death.  He told himself that he would not fight but he knew that he would, once he had changed he became the thing he had changed into completely.  There was simply no Johnathan left.  If he turned into a dragon then it would be with that dragon's lust for blood that he tore into his father.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe shuddered at the thought.  To have come all this way just to mangle the man he was trying so desperately to save, or be mangled by him.  It was a thought to terrible to bear.  His mother's face swam on the edges of his mind, her wide blue eyes begging him not to answer the bell that was tolling in the stands above, not to heed the call to the arena battle.  In the shadows of his mind he turned away from her.  I'm sorry, his soul called.  He knew both he and his father lacked the discipline necessary simply NOT to kill each other in battle.  In their very being lay an uncontrolled sympathy with the creatures that they became.  There was no mind in the monsters that sprouted forth from their bodies, only the mindless urge to to be whatever it was that they were and completely. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHis father could no more deny the bloodlust of the wolf than Johnathan could control whatever thing sprouted from him on the wings of his rage and fear at the prospect of battle.  Whatever he became, whatever manner of winged and fanged beast his body deemed necessary to win the battle ahead, he would fight to the death and with no remorse. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe bell called again, drawing him toward the fight.  Already his body was churning in answer to the call of blood so readily offered.  He looked at the weapons pooled for those who did not bring their own and chose a blunt stick.  It wouldn't matter what manner of weapon he carried into battle.  He would never use it.  His body would change and he would sprout whatever manner of weapon, claw, fang, tentacle, it deemed necessary to survive.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe strode toward the light of the doorway that would lead to the battle ahead.  His body smelled the blood from previous battles and his cells did a dark and happy dance that called for a swift change in form.  His body began to feel less and less his own as he stepped into the golden ligh of the arena and his feet swept across the floor made of golden sand and sawdust.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHis father was on the other side.  Even from across the arena Johnathan could see the shadow of the wolf in his eyes.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" You should not have come!\" David howled miserably, his voice was already deep with the change.  The wolf was coming, unbidden and his father was helpless to fight the beast when the smell of blood and death was so ripe and rampant in the air.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohnathan felt his own body changing.  Dark hair sprouted from his body.  His worst nightmare had come true.  He would meet his father, wolf to wolf on the battle field.  Those that had paid their well earned coin to view the battles in the arena today were going to get their money's worth.  The carnage would be legendary, made worse by the fact that those watching knew that the battle was between father and son.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn the few moments where Johnathan was still himself he heard his mother scream his name.  Then she was gone, along with the rest of his mind.  A terrible pain roared through him as his version of the wolf came, in the distance he could see his father, bathed in the unnatural sunlight that he loathed, as did all creatures who bore wolf's blood.  The unnatural change, the day change was well upon him and the beast within would be all the more fierce for having to face the sun.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohnathan, the thing he was becoming anyway, felt the horrible agony of his bones breaking in his legs, turning backwards and then binding again.  He screamed.  The crowd in the arena howled in pleasure as the two combatants writhed on the ground in dark agony.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe thing that stood up in Johnathan's place was covered in a thick matting of darkly silver fur.  It had a ebony streak on its broad back.  It was well over nine feet tall on two legs, and it had large, yellowed fangs coming from its wide and snapping jaws.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe other monster wolf was inky black with slitted golden eyes that watched the creature standing across from it with a cruel and calculating intelligence born of its disconnected human brain.  The David wolf was ten feet tall, broader than its oponnent, with long inky black claws ready to rip and tear into silver fur and the flesh beneath.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe came at each other on all fours and met in the middle of the blood splattered, saw dust covered arena.  The Johnathan creature threw its head back and howled as the David thing tore at it with inky claws.  Blood flew from the wounds in Johnathan's silver chest.  He backed away and came at his father again, enraged.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOlder and wiser the David thing watched the pup coming and turned suddenly, so that Johnathan passed him.  David reached behind him with sharp claws and tore much of the fur and skin from the pups back.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohnathan the wolf howled in agony.  He whirled on his opponent quickly and tore at the other creatures throat with his sharp yellow jaws.  He had a hold but the black on fought furiously, pain came from everywhere, as the creature tore into every part of him that was availabe and sought to rip him open in several place.  Johnathan did not let go, he snapped harder until he had what he wanted the most. The creatures pulse beat strong beneath his teeth.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe had only to bite down to end this, and feast upon the warm blood and flesh beneath the skin.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHigh above, in the stands, nestled in the treasured place created only for the wealthy or politically important Calirath watched, his golden eyes mad with the desire to join the beautiful crimson fray playing out on the ground below him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe smiled with sharp, golden fangs.  The pup thinks he's won, Calirath thought, amused, but the older one, he's crafty, going for the heart . . .\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe dragon wondered what it would be like to face the two of them at the same time, visions of blood danced like raw meat in his eager brain.  A blood bath, he thought, envisioning his hard fought and well one victory.  His smile widened as the silver wolf yelped, just now beginning to feel sharp claws digging into the the fleshy cage of meat and bone that protected his heart.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" Well fought young one,\" Calirath whispered to himself, \" but now it is time to die.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohnathan howled in agony and bit down on David's neck hard enough for sweet and salty blood to flow into his waiting jaws.  He  tried to shake himself free of the other's grasp and save his heart from being ripped free of his body.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe wolves stilled in the arena, each one held the power to kill the other instanly, the crowed drew back in silent awe, watching, waiting . . .\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey . . .  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

He is trying to win his freedom in order to return to his family before they are murdered by the man who put him in the Arena. While here, he is known as Michael Ryan, for his own safety.<br>\r\n<b>Siph:</b> A fun little demon, who is in the Arena to be the Champion. He is quick, dangerous, with an almost mischievous look, and deadly horns.<br>\r\n<b>David Talis:</b> David is a werewolf who was enslaved and put to fight in the Arena just after an eighteen year war. Now he only wishes to escape and return home for a well-earned respite.<br>\r\n<b>Johnathan Talis:</b> John is David's son, who ended up in the Arena when he was looking for his father, ironically enough. Now he is fighting to earn them their freedom. He is a changling.<br>\r\n<b>Raven:</b> Raven is a small dragonette. Though not as powerful as a full-grown Dragon, he is still powerful enough. He is in the Arena of his own choice, for he loves the blood.<br>\r\n<b>Elise:</b> Elise is a mage, in the Arena to prove herself and to kill Raven, who she has sworn revenge upon. Her most powerful attack that she favors is a deadly black fireball, which burns the soul.<br>\r\n<b>Tyger:</b> She is a gargoyle, in the Arena for the challenge. She lives to fight, and does so fiercely, using her tail and twin dirks as weapons. She carries a grudge against Ryan for her own reasons.<br>\r\n<b>Ressek:</b> He is a saurian martial artist. He originally came to the Arena to stop his friend, Siph, from joining, but was conscripted.<br>\r\n<b>Krath:</b> Large and stupid are most used to describe this huge monstrosity. He is from a desert in the Southlands and uses his many blades to fight. He is in the Arena as another slave.<br>\r\n<b>Marr:</b> Captured during the same eighteen year war as David, when he slew an entire company of the enemy's troops. He is a bog wraith from a swamp at the foot of the Dragon Mountains.<br>\r\n<b>Sarah Nicolshki:</b> Sarah was the sister of one of Ryan's friends at an early age. She is a thief, a warrior, with Shadow blood in her. This sometimes makes her <i>very</i> difficult to see.<br>\r\n<b>Shalar:</b> Shalar is in the Arena to avenge his brother, Reivus, who was killed by Harac's troops during the eighteen year war. His long, hooked blades reach from almost every joint in his body.<br>\r\n<b>Calarith:</b> This Dragon is the current champion of the Arena. He is the final opponent, if they survive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck and enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"56\" style=\"position:relative;\"><div style=\"position:relative;\"><a rel=\"awardlightbox\" title=\"...
