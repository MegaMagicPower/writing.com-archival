Well let's go back to where this entire story begins. Her parents worked at a science company and one day they brought their daughter to work when they were experimenting with some new DNA sample, somehow an accident occurred and the sample tube broke right on Matilda. Suddenly, she ended up growing to gigantic height and was able to breathe fire as well. At first the entire population of Diamond City was terrified, but they soon grew to adore and like her when she showed that she was still friendly and such, and now she helps out with construction works, demolitions, and other things across the city as a creature known to all as Matildgon. She is also a huge Japanese giant monster fan, so she does act, roar, and stomp around like a kaiju all the time, but thankfully is careful where she goes and lands her stomps. She is going through some issues like being forced to live in the mountains (although the scientists grow foods and her swimsuits as clothes as the others don't work for some reason), having to wear a bikini all the time, being homeschooled, etc. <br>\r\nAdditional Info: None<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do you wanna do with her?</span></div></div>",

The scientist plan was to use the young kids and turn them into giant monsters that would help him rule the Earth. He used various technologies to make the children monstrous, but also teach them how to speak and such... just when he made his entire army of several giant children girls with powers to attack Shinzo, Japan... he was arrested by the government and was sent away to a prison. However, the girls were already turned into monsters, and there was nothing they could do to reverse the effects. With a little bit of hope, one person in the government of Japan came up with an idea where the girls can live as giant monsters in Shinzo, Japan. They made buildings not far from the main city that the girls can live in, and provide many activities that use their monstrousness in very creative and fun ways. Several girls have buildings in the heart of the city in an area where they can burst out of a human size building and come into the real city to hang out. There is a lot of things I can get into about this city, but let's just say they love the giant monster girls so much, they want to have the experience of having monsters in the city, that don't destroy of course. And there is even a theme park where the people can play with the giant monster girls, and even see them rampage in a virutal city.<br>\r\nAdditional info: Koyuki is a total monster and appeal nut, so she dreams of being the greatest giant monster icon in the world, a girl who can bring terror to cities, etc. She is the pure opposite of Helga, want to be seen as a monster, loves being in bikinis, etc. But she is a kind girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we start with Koyukizilla?</span></div></div>",

She was initially shocked and scared for others' safety when she grew like this. No known cure was available at the moment. Authorities found the scientist and placed him in charge of the girl. The scientist, Manami, and her family moved to a gigantic island near the city where she lives to this day.

It seems that the love of the giant monster girls was so great, that the city of Japan decided they needed one more. Now how they did this, with a contest to see which girl has the most desire to become the biggest and most monstrous girl of them all. Well it turns out that this little girl name Soya has won that contest. She has been an avid giant monster and giantess fan when she was just young and her mother introduced her to their movies over the years, but her favorite was the crossover Shinkzukazilla vs Harukagon as her two favorite monsters battle it out in Tokyo, and immense destruction was cause. She loved it so much that she desired to be the third monster girl, and the most monstrous of them all. Well the government saw that so they used the formula created by both Haruka and Shinkzuka's DNA (at their approval) to make the girl into a giant monster as well. The city also really celebrated having another monster girl so they gave her the monster treatment (we will get into that in future chapters.). There is so much that I can get into this character that we will just have her just being started just to give her character depth. Not much but enough to get started. Shinkzuka is glad to have another giant girl to be a monster with, and while Haruka likes having another friend, she does feel the love for the giant girls is getting a little bit overhand so she tries to teach her the more easy things. Shinzuka is going to make Soya into a real monster however.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: She has big breast for a girl her age, and she is in training so accidents will occur like crushed cars and what not. Also, Haruka and Shinzuka are big parts of the story so refer to them as well. Now we got 3 monster girls now. She is also the most monstrous of the 3 girls with her roars and immense strength. The whole city will know her as a true monster.</span></div></div>",

Maybe we should save the energy bursting thing for later for now let's just focus on the easy stuff.\" Shinkzuka said firmly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,right okay first thing pretend you're in a populated city stuffed with people who just noticed you appearing over the horizon and they just started running and screaming now what do you do?\" Harkura asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Try and convince them that I mean no harm?\" Soya said both other girls exchanged eye rolls <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no! You can do that a big later!

I thought you guys were going to teach me something really useful about this whole 'Kaiju' thing?\" The other girl spoke up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are! But we're starting at the bottom of the barrel so to speak so you can get the hang of it now as Harkura said following a few stomps and a couple of roars to spook the crowd a bit then you want to unleash a few fiery blasts at buildings and.........\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.....\" Said Harkura clearing her throat <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean just continuing walking down the street scaring the folk for a bit then just for fun unleash one or two fire blasts......\" But once again she was interputted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering for a while now girls what exactly does a Kaiju do? I mean what is the purpose?\" Soya asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er you take this one I'm not sure how to explain it!\" Shinkzuka said to Harkura \"After all she's your trainee isn't she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding right? You watched plenty of Godzilla movies haven't you? You've been a fan of our work(gesturing to her and Shinkzuka)? There's a lot more to being a Kaiju or giant monster of any kind or species than just rampaging and destroying stuff we can be good or evil or a mixture of both depending on our personalities so in other words we can either choose to be the city or town's savior or destroyer now as for our powers well it all depends on the source of our origins or creations basically we can possess every type of power or super-power under the sun okay? You understand the basics of what it means to be a Kaiju now?\" Soya nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess so alright after the rampaging and roars and energy blasts what happens next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's normally around the time when the military shows up and a stand off begins between the Kaiju and them being that you're a Godzilla fan you probably know what happens then either we can surrender to them or resist and try and destroy them in the process or often ourselves.\" Harkura explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's it?\" Soya asked feeling a bit let down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah pretty much unless we forgotten something did we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope I don't think so....oh wait one more thing if another giant monster shows up and a fight breaks out between the two the best thing to do is to either fight like mad or just try and get out of there especially if the other monster is more experienced than you but that's always not the case remember that bigger doesn't always mean better or stronger!\" Soya nodded understanding <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I think I got everything crystal clear! Now what can we do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about.....\" Shinkzuka suggested......</span></div></div>",

A loving family, a great school, and a great city that she loves to visit. It seems everything was perfect for her, well here is one thing that makes that a bit difficult. She is a 9 year old 200ft bikini clad kaiju girl with King Ghidorah like powers. How it happened though, well her father and mother where both military scientists that were trying to make a kaiju be used as a weapon, and an accident caused the DNA to hit the mother who was pregnant. She then gave birth to a girl name Haruka, and she seemed to be normal for a few years, but during those years she begun developing powers and her height. At age 6 she was called Queen Haruka or Harukagon for her powers, and the people seemed to fear her and such, but she was a nice and gentle soul, so their issues were settled. The city of Japan help made the city livable for her, like letting her still go to school outside as her hearing lets her pick up important things and such. She also helped the city in many other ways, like demolition, modeling, and such. She couldn't fit in her home, so the government made an island near Tokyo be her home where she has a virtual city and many other things. It was known as Haruka Island.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: She has C-Cup breasts and her bikini also reflects her looks. She also takes her studies seriously before she plays or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

Today, she is just wanting to have a nice and quiet day, away from all the people giving her alot of buzz for her looks, her immense size, powers, and monster icon. As a matter of fact, it is a bit of an issue that she suffered when she became so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, for starters, she had to wear almost swimsuits entirely as making clothes for Haruka would take alot of supplies and money, and while it could be worth the effort, it was just decided to be simple and just have her be in a swimsuit all the time, just covering her private parts. This was a bit of an issue for Haruka as she isn't used to being exposed all the time, every day, and eventually it became an issue for her. Boys would easily tease her for her big breasts and dressing. She can get pretty embarrassed most of the time as a result. Luckily a time where she isn't embarrassed when she wears bikinis is during monster movie shoots and modeling, and that leads to another issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is always being seen as a giant monster icon, and that is why she is always called in public Harukagon, and sometimes Queen Haruka, because of her abilities and size being that of King Ghidorah. People view her essentially for that and not for the gentle and kind soul that she is, though she doesn't mind them calling her that, she just wants to be called Haruka inspite of it. Sometimes people call her a monster so many times it makes her conflicted, and while she doesn't go on a rampage at all in Tokyo, she can only imagine herself doing that if she ended up snapping at the present time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least one time that she is able to be of total use for the government is testing for the Tokyo Monster Exterimination Unit, as they can test various weapons on her to determine their effectiveness, and she actually likes it, as she wants to help them. Perhaps she wants to find a weakness in her so it can prove she isn't invincible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a doorbell rings and Haruka opens the door, she sees that it is....</span></div></div>",

Has also wore other clothes her followers made and what not.<br>\r\nPowers: Similar to Sakura and Luna with near immortality (never aging what not), but can shoot lasers from her eyes that can cause massive destruction, roars, regeneration, but she is really well known for her destruction powers, as she can destroy buildings and stuff with ease with her body better than anyone. Not really a power, but a certain talent she has. Her actual goddess ability is influencing and having control over people of her city with her towering presence, as she feels like a true goddess.<br>\r\nWhere they live:  Tokyo, Japan<br>\r\nBio: Soyumi Loza is a Japanese model and actress that really makes headlines at a very young age for surprisingly her slim body and huge DD breast for a girl her age, starring in many commercials promoting clothes, but she was also a movie actress, with her favorite roles being giant monster movie roles where she plays as the giant monster. She just loves the feeling of towering over buildings and interacting or destroying them in various ways, and this was particularly inspired by the Goddesses that live among them in Tokyo. She is a super fan of Sakura herself, and even takes some of her methods into account former acting. So Soyumi was just one day a normal young mega hit actress, and then suddenly the next day... she was then in a towering height of 200ft tall and then discovers she has Goddess powers. Suddenly everyone was then really noticing her being gigantic for real, and at first she was confused at everything and that is where Luna and Sakura came in, and soon she understood why she is a goddess, and the goddess of influence and power. She would then have a full on blast with her new life being pampered by like a full on goddess, so much so that her legal name becomes Soyumizilla. She still acts, etc, but now on a big scale, and the people would do anything to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional info: She is going to be kinda of a tsundere character as she takes on her goddess role full on, acting and stomping like a monster full on, with almost every routine like waking up, entering the city, traveling through the city, etc being monster like, but she is otherwise a gentle soul once she gets used to everything, and that is because she is a goddess in training, so she is bound to cause accidents, but no one is killed. She is a really great friend of Sakura an sometimes they both act like monsters for their fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a link to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1845671-ATypical-Life-as-a-Kaiju-Giantess/map/1552\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/it...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wanna start?</span></div></div>",

She has enhanced vocal cores that lets her roar like a monster. Also, her roar can cause EMP waves. Finally, she can fire an atomic breath from her mouth like Godzilla.<br>\r\nWhere they live: in the mountains not far from Denver, Colorado<br>\r\nBio: Molly had a very special life growing up, and I mean a very special life. You see, she was cursed by an evil witch when she was a baby to her very rich parents, that she would grow up one day to be a titanic destructive monster that would ravage the earth. The parents did something to the witch that she didn't like, and also wanted to take over the world. Over the years, the child begun to grow to immense heights, and developed monster like abilties. Her parents was for sure frightened, as many of the people were, but they would do anything to help her once they found out the gentle and nice soul that she is, and also playful as well. She was for the early years kept in a military base when her powers were discovered, and during that time, scientists and the public all help to make Molly's life as a monster a good one. Molly actually is a fan of giant monster movies, and she could imagine herself as a good monster to the public. Roaring for her fans, destroying buildings for them, etc. It takes alot of people to help her, and of course she has a normal teenager life, like high school where she sits outside the school, romances, etc. All that typical stuff. She made lots of friends, but she made a very known friend in Kei, a friend she grew up with when she was only 6. Kei was a friend to Molly, and loves it when Molly acts like a monster, and the two developed a close friendship, and it might just be a romance one day. She lives in the mountains of Denver, Colorado in a private built home that comes with all her normal teenager life stuff, and even a virtual reality game where she can protect the city, or be a monster and destroy it. More on that in the story...<br>\r\nAdditional info: She is a really nice person, and doesn't mind at all the people calling her all those giant monster name she like Molly the Meance, and Mollzilla, actually she kinda likes it as she is a powerful force of nature. She can though get pretty defensive at times if she feels violated and she isn't afraid of using her immense size and powers to prove that. Tough on bullies for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wanna start?</span></div></div>",

You see, before she became the famous giant and even kaiju, she was already that. Her mother was an actress and model for magazines. Her mother in a very young age introduced her to her career and she was a major child star. Not just in family movies and such, true Japanese Kaiju movies... as the Kaiju. She has several series where she plays a giant girl who rampaged Tokyo (Attack of the Giant Schoolgirl), a goddess where she rules over people (The Titaness Child), and her most famous role, a young girl who lives in Tokyo as a size of monster (A Kaiju Life). All of them has giant monster related elements, with her being a giant in the city, and occasionally causing destruction to miniature city. She was a major icon in the monster industry and life was really good, until one day a small meteor hits her and covers her with some sort of alien like energy. You know how this goes, she grows massive and gains powers. Obviously the people were terrified at first as she was a true Japanese giant monster icon and could go all monster on them. But she was still a kind and gentle soul, and soon the city got used to having a Japanese monster living with them. She helps with demolitions, plays with children all the time as the monster she is, and is seen as a Hero rescuing people from various accidents, all while roaring like a monster, moving like a monster, and even being a monster. Even to the point from her private island she goes into the ocean and rises from it and roars like a beast. The city of Tokyo soon adjusted to her and even gave her a virtual city to play with. She even became a landmark and icon in Japan. One thing she is wanting truly in life is to be the best monster in the world that the people want, so she practices her monster movements every day and what not. She is also trying to get love, and other stuff. Well we will get into that story later. The fact is... she is a true monster. She also is still awesome in the movie industry.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: She is a total giant monster nut so she acts like a beast all the time. She also adjusts height when fans want her to and such. Also since she is a monster but, almost everything on her island is a Godzilla miniature city to where she can be a monster one and have that monster feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's do this.

There was actually quite a bit that had to be destroyed, from the smaller businesses that is virtually dead from all the empty buildings, to the larger warehouse and business buildings. It was quite a bit of work for the great Asukazilla, the young bikini clad green hair teen kaiju to pull off, but she doesn\u2019t have a problem. Currently she was just using her feet to stomp all the smaller buildings, flattening them like a pancake with no issues at all, and she loved using her feet to crush stuff. Perhaps out of all of the things she had with her kaiju powers and size, feet crushing was her favorite of all. Besides when she stomps around the city, she makes the city rumble, letting everyone know of her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was just a few bigger buildings left after all the smaller buildings were crushed, and Asuka just uses her laser beam breath to blow up the rest of it like Godzilla himself. As soon as that was done, Asuka turned to her little adorable fans, and she gave out a sexy kaiju like roar just as she stomps right over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much folks, glad I was able to help you out and give everyone a nice show.\u201d She smiled just as she bows down to the fans. Suddenly coming through the crowd, we see the mayor of the town, who was also smiling at her, and had a microphone on him to tell her something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really is great having you around the city. Besides, tons of people come to this city just to see you, they even mention you as a tourist attraction.\u201d He smiled just as Asuka giggled. That was a true statement, people would come to Kayuko City just to see Asukazilla around if they were on vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, anything you needed to discuss with me about?\u201d She asked just as she noticed that he had some documents to share with her, well someone would have to explain this to her given she is tall and cannot see paper given it is small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts actually really good.\u201d He tells her.

We plan to have more kaijus living with you and you will be showing them the ropes around here and how we do things. Don\u2019t worry, we will still live here, but we will have more of you, so you won\u2019t be lonely.\u201d He smiled to her, and this got Asuka actually quite happy and interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there is more than just me that is a monster? That is nice to know.\u201d She replied back, curious to know who is gonna be living with Asukazilla. With major plans to have Kayuko City a kaiju tourist attraction, Asukazilla wouldn\u2019t be the only one going for. She remembered that the city actually was able to experiment with her DNA just for research purposes after the accident, which she agreed to to help them out a bit. Maybe they used her DNA to make the girl into a monster like her. \u201cAnd after doing extensive search, we found a girl who will be agreeing to learning under you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, who is this girl?\u201d She wondered. Suddenly by the ocean, the waters were shifting violently just as a huge being was coming for the area. Asuka and the others come to the beaches to see the kaiju arise from it. When it did, it was revealed to be a girl that look like the age of 10-11, and actually had short maroon hair and brown eyes. She had a slim fair skin body that was cute all things considered, and was wearing a two-piece blue bikini outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis here is Mayl. (Only using the name and appearance from Megaman here as reference) or as she wants to be called as a kaiju... MAYDORA!\u201d The mayor said, introducing the giant girl just as she stomps right over to her, beaming happily and smiling. \u201cHi their Asukazilla, it is an honor to become a kaiju like you and to learn under you. My name is Mayl Keioha, or Maydora as I will be call here.\u201d She said just as she blinks with her eyes and has her hands on her hips. She is slightly shorter than Asuka herself, by about 20 or so feet, but other than that, she is good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is nice to meet you Maydora, and I think we will get along great.\u201d She smiled to her new giant sized friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mayl Keioha<br>\r\nKaiju name: Maydora<br>\r\nAge: 11<br>\r\nAppearance: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/megaman/images/a/a7/BM789.png/revision/latest?cb=20140416161652\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mega...</a><br>\r\nHeight: 160ft<br>\r\nClothes: two piece blue bikini<br>\r\nPowers: Unknown at this time<br>\r\nBio: She has been a big fan of Asukazilla ever since she lived in the city when she was young, she was amazed of the raw power that she had and how she can bring joy and happiness around her. So much so that she dreamed of being just like her, and the city had a contest to see which young girl would become a kaiju like Asukazilla. It was a lottery as the DNA from Asukazilla had to be compatible, and incredibly hers was. They had a blood sample donation thing which she did, so they knew. One day she and her parents were invited to the research facility on an remote island that learns about Asukazilla, and she agreed to take the DNA transplant. She ends up being a big kaiju herself and she and her parents couldn\u2019t be any happier. Now she is learning under Asukazilla, so perhaps she can learn a thing or two about being a happy kaiju.<br>\r\nAdditional info: She is a student of Asukazilla so she is learning from her. Perhaps some accidents happen, and she is just awestruck of the power she has, so she acts sometimes just like Asukazilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?</span></div></div>",

The Sector Z is basically a bunch of buildings that has been abandoned for a very long time, along with a small neighboorhood like area that also needed to go. It was such in bad shape that they just needed to just demolished it down and replace it with something much nicer. The grounds rumble like always just as Asukazilla and Maydora appeared before it, both looking down on the area with a smile on their eye. Maydora especially, as she has always been a huge monster movie fan just like Asuka, and actually got practicing with her small miniature sets and just watching over the years how Asukazilla would always act like a monster. She was also beloved by children for a good reason, and also why Asuka got her name Asukazilla, but May was also a kid then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearing in the sector, Maydora looked to see how all those buildings are roughly either her height or smaller, and smiled just as she stomped in face, shaking the ground for the fans below her nearby in the barriers with Asuka.

Stomping!\" Asuka told her noticing how she was making craters on the ground with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marooned hair giantess smiled just as she noticed the ground had cracks on the ground. \"Well good point to see right before that I am causing destruction with the road. \"Perhaps this bad road could also use redoing as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is what I suggested to them awhile back.

I just, wanted to test something out.\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was vague, but it didn't Auska any, she loved surprises. \"Okay.\" she then began to back away. \"Show what you got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaydora nodded vigorously.

It made the Kaiju girl curious as well as the bystanders behind her. Just what did her fellow giant have up her sleeve?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rookie Kaijue dug her feet into the ground and bent her knees to get lower. She wanted to make a good first impression and if she could pull this off then she'd really be able to impress her hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there was only silence, nothing but the wind and surprisingly a tumbleweed.

I know Asukazilla has a monstrous roar, but Maydora might just take the cake here.\" the mayor said, amazed by that destructive power of May's roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Asuka was completely impressed.

During this time, Maydora was just stomping smaller buildings and roaring at the bigger ones, destroying them in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everything in the area was trashed, and it was all because of Maydora's roars.

Like right now as she sat in the park while her peers used her as a jungle gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled brightly as her fans used her hair as a rope swing, or tried making her leg into a slide. Honestly it didn't get any better than this. Just nonstop laughter and happiness. The way it should always be.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAuska even did her famous roar for them as she knew they'd love it. Unfortunately her self proclaimed number one fan  Mayl Keioha wasn't here. Normally the girl was at the park whenever she was around, but today she was surprisingly absent. Maybe she was out with her family or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, maybe she could set-up some personal hang out time with her the next time she saw her. Out of everyone she enjoyed her company the most when playing. The two of them could talk for hours on end about monsters and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuska was broken from her thoughts when she felt something poking her foot. She looked down to see another one of the children smiling at her. \"Auskazilla!? Will you play hide and seek with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved hide and seek. \"Sure. The usual rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded. \"Mmhmm! You count to a hundred while we hide. The big oak tree is home base!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on.\" Auskazilla cheered as the last of the children rolled down her body like a slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" The girl smirked. \"We'll all win this time! Everyone... SCATTER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that everyone ran off in different directions as Asuka closed her eyes. She was undefeated at Hide and Seek and wasn't about to let her record be broken. There were ten kids in all, and she would find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all toast!\" Asuka hammed. \"The big bad monster is gonna getcha!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her size is a curse bestowed upon her before she was born as a result of her father putting a sorceress on blast for being a fraud on live T.V. He later found out she was the real deal. Now Diana just tries to live her life while the people around her either shun her shy away.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: Diana occasionally puts her size to use for the community and has earned a very small pool of fans.

One again she managed to accidently crush some poor unfortunate soul's car underneath her massive foot. No doubt that'll be another lawsuit for her parents since the city stopped insuring people for any damage she accidently caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavigate the city at your own risk the mayor said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had become the man's slogan over the years. It was literally plastered over most of the billboards across town. That didn't do much to help her image. She was broken from her thoughts at the sounds of car horns down below. Apparently she was clogging up the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it will ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got places to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're feet are blocking the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went without saying, the people didn't like her. \"Sorry.\" she apologized before taking another step. As she did the shockwave of her footfall obliterated the windows of the nearby buildings. Again she sighed. No matter how hard she tried she would always break something every time she ventured into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh how she missed the days when she was younger and shorter. 15ft tall might've not been very normal, but at least she could still fit in the buildings. Now, such a thing was a complete impossibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it freak! You almost stepped on me!\" another civilian raged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Diana repeated. Sorry, might as well be her favorite word. She certainly said it often enough. \"I'll just get out of your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man watched on angrily as the giant stepped over him and continued her trek through the city. \"Freak.\" he cursed. That giant bimbo crushed his freaking hot dog cart. It was as flat as a pancake. If she weren't so damn big he sue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana tried her best not to wince when she heard the sounds of crushed metal, shattered glass, and curses down below. They were all unavoidable things that came with the territory of being a giant. She didn't like it, but she accepted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each and every step shook the ground and more than a few car alarms blared as a result. Not to mention the honking of annoyed drivers and angry rants of civilians persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm walking here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just smashed my window jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you even still come through here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last comment really struck a nerve, though she hid her wince well. The still came through the city because it was her home, she loved this place despite how the people felt about her. She didn't want to leave, she wouldn't, she couldn't. Even though her parents suggested doing just that she was against it. She knew they loved this city just as much as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo all of them would simply endure. It was selfish, they all knew that, but this was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana simply ignored the rest of the rants and carefully tip-toed her way through the streets. FYI, it did very little to mitigate the property damage. The smashed motorcycles parked off to the side only confirmed this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Bike!\" A biker cried, coming out of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pride and joy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the hell out of here you freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana didn't need to be told twice. She picked up the pace and kept moving. Eventually she spotted what she was looking for. A small shopping center with an empty parking lot. Hallelujah! Empty parking lot meant less destruction. The giant carefully stepped over the cars and people down below and into the empty parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she had a little room to stretch her legs. It also helped that the buildings here were small and gave her more than a little elbow room. It felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes then scanned around area and fell upon her target... the Book-It Books store. It was one of her favorite places to frequent as it more often than not had every book she came looking for. Because of her size she couldn't read books anymore so she relied on her parents to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came here so often in fact that the city put a pop off skylight in the ceiling so she could shop here without accidently destroying the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Diana carefully knelt down in front of the bookstore, taking extra care not to let her legs bulldoze the little shop. The last thing she wanted was extend the property damage bill her parents would receive any further than she already had. Money might not be an immediate issue due to her parent's line of work, but it could still dry up eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a steady hand, Dian reached for the glass skylight and carefully dug her nail under the side to pop it open. The whole set-up honestly reminded her of a pop top can or a pickle jar, minus the twisting. She could still remember when she was smaller and her father would struggle to open the pickle jar and ask her to do it. She would make it look so easy too and her father would try to save face saying her loosened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a happy memory from a simpler time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back in the present she carefully popped the skylight off the building and gently put it off to the side. It was also her job to put it back when her business concluded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside the stores owner groaned behind his desk when he felt the familiar tremors approaching. The mutant was back again. Old man Sonny hated when Diana came around as it would ward off any potential business. No one wanted to come to a place frequented by a circus act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe of course kept these thoughts to himself however as he didn't want to risk pissing off a woman that could reduce his place of business to rubble. Add to that whenever she did come around she was a heavy spender. Money was money after all and he didn't mind taking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he merely grumbled as toughed out the constant footfalls and watched as his skylight was popped off. Thank god the city had enough sense to listen to his request to get the damn thing put in. He didn't want his livelihood to accidently end up like Town-City fitness center. He shuddered at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Gleason?\" Diana began as he watched her from the open skylight. \"I'm here to pick up my order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" He mumbled before reaching behind his desk and pulling out a large and heavy bag filled with books. It took everything he had to sling the bag over the desk. He wasn't as young as he used to be. He just turned 60 for crying out loud. \"Will you be paying with cash or credit!?\" he wheezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Credit.\" she answered. Sonny watched as the giant girl raised her arm up high, exposing her armpit before she used her free hand to run a fingernail up it. She then lowered that fingernail down into the shop where the foul stench of sweat hit his nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana unfortunately didn't have any pockets and so she had to stash her normal sized wallet somewhere she'd be able to find it. Her mother suggested this method and she didn't bother to question her on the matter. If it worked than it worked she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonny on the other hand was trying his best not to gag. He spotted the young woman's wallet in the a pile of built up dirt and sweat from her armpit. Powering through the stench he reached into the woman's fingernail and plucked the wallet before taking out her card and swiping the purchase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as she paid he'd be applicable he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the wallet back where he found it. \"Alright. You're good to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nodded and scraped her nail against her pit again before plucking the bag of books from the desk. \"Thank you.\" she smiled. She knew old man Sonny didn't like her, but she appreciated the fact he never voiced his discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Just remember to put the skylight back.\" he waved off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nodded and did just that. With the skylight back in place and her purchase made, she stuffed the bag under her pit and continued her trek through the city. </span></div></div>",

Without thinking she scrapped her foot along the ground, which in tern caused her to punt a defenseless through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash that fallowed brought her attention to what she'd just done. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be more careful next time you dame klutz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of the road!\" Another driver honked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, is the mean giant gonna kick us too!\" a child asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't look at her Billy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around her Diana could hear the negative statements beginning to pile up. Oh the news was gonna have a field day with this one. She could already see this moment added to their, ''What has Dianazilla Destroyed Today'' segment. Talk about adding insult to injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices continued to insult her until the blaring of sirens caught everyone's attention. The police! Were they there for her!? She was too big to be arrested hence they never tried, but who knows, maybe they figured out a way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned their heads towards the sound only to see the red Dodge Charger speeding by with three squad cars in hot pursuit. They weren't there for the giantess, they were after criminals that could actually fit into a prison cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing everyone heard was the sound of gunfire. The individual or individuals in the Charger were opening fire on the police!? In broad daylight no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana saw all of this transpiring thanks to her size and wondered if she should intervene. She'd never tried to aid the police before and that maniac behind the wheel was swerving all over the road like a drunken roller-skater on ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she did stop them, then would the people look at her different? Would they accept that she did something good for them? She did work construction and deconstruction jobs from time-to-time. So just maybe... </span></div></div>",

The parents have always loved Diana in spite of her sizes, and they did everything they could to help her. I mean they sow together her dress from many different clothes for an 80ft girl all things considered. Her parents constantly have to deal with all of the lawsuits and everything that Diana\u2019s destruction unintentionally causes, but that is also why they were lucky to have good jobs and that Diana actually has her supporters helping her whenever she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after much further walking, and sadly more crushing of stuff, she reaches the airport where she sees her parents waiting by the door.

I mean, all the harassment you get, especially from your school, that ended up making you leave.\u201d The father added as well, but also it was true sadly. During Diana\u2019s years, she was always teased for being big and massive. Other than a few friends, and her early years at school being pleasant, the remaining years gotten to be a huge problem for her. People mock her clothes, the damage she causes, and among other things, they were just jerks to her.

It couldn't be helped given her 80ft stature, but as parents it still took a lot to not yell back when someone said something derogatory about their child for things beyond her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the walk wasn't long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would've been an hour long trip from the airport on foot was only about five minutes for their daughter. One of very few benefits of being a giant. Eventually the family of three made it to the city outskirts deep within the mountains. Diana kept walking until she reached a large cave the surprisingly enough she was able to just walk into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside said cave was a lot of room for her to maneuver and what appeared to be a very large blanket that served as her bed. Beside that, perched atop a large rock was a small mansion. This was their happy home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana lowered her hand onto the rock for her parents to get off. \"Final stop, home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents said their thanks before getting off. There was no place like home. Ever since their daughter's massive growth spurt it became impossible to live in the city so they used their vast resources to hire some people to cut a cavern within the mountains and build them a home. They've been here ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels good to be home.\" Diana's father stretched. The plane had been  so cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean.

I'm... I'm sorry! I'm so, so, sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean! How is what happened to me your fault!\" Diana asked, her voice slightly raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man hung his head in shame. \"Years before you were born I used to work as a journalist for the Town-City Chronicle. I was doing a report on a woman who claimed to be a legit sorceress and of course like a lot of people I thought she was a fraud. Oh how wrong was I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana listened intently and her mother looked more and more concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame Ruby her name was, and to think I thought she was another con artist looking to exploit the weak minded. I wanted to teach her a lesson she'd never forget so I cut a deal with the Town-City News Network (TCN). I was going to expose her in front of the whole world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana could feel her fists tightening as she listened on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She came in ready for an interview and as soon as the cameras were rolling I called her out. I put her on full blast for the whole world to see and made her look like a fool. I called her names, insulted her craft, and was a complete shit heel. She actually ran out of the studio crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana's mother hung her head now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the segment was over my superiors told me I did a good job and I left to go to my car. When I made it the parking lot she was there with some weird kind of diamond encrusted skull. It started leaking some kind of red mist that she blew in my face and cursed me. She said I'd bring misery to my family should choose to have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was biting her lip now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she was full of crap and told her to never come near me again. A few years later I lost my job and met your mother. After couple more years we got married and you were born. The rest as they say, is history.\" her father finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was silent. The long stretch of quiet was maddening. That was until Diana broke it. \"Why didn't you ever tell me before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilt mostly.\" her father answered before looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please understand, Diana. We didn't say anything because we didn't know how you'd handle it. And also because we spent years trying to track Madame Ruby down.\" her mother tried explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana didn't know how to handle this information overload. It was too much. Way too much. Her parents knew why she was an 80ft freak and yet chose not to tell her. This was her life, she had a right to know. Worse yet her father was the one who caused it and let her believe her situation was her own doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how was she supposed to react.</span></div></div>",

Her mother was starting to worried that this information getting to Diana the way that it has now is gonna cause some issues now. Diana was unbelievably shocked of what she has learned. That her dad has caused her growth somehow and that he didn\u2019t tell her until now, and that she had to suffer her entire life because of his actions. The father was depressed and in tears, knowing that the curse has indirectly have caused him to ruin her life. \u201cDiana please... he didn\u2019t...\u201d her mom tried to say, but Diana was long gone by the time she got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was just walking through the streets being careful, but also getting the usual hatred that she gets among the city with the total near accidents and what not. Then it all started coming to her, the way she had to live her life the entire time because of her father. Being called a freak at school and in the city, the lack of decent clothing, and such... was all because of her father mocking a witch on TV and then being cursed. She couldn\u2019t handle the truth, and was then suddenly running, heading far off deeper into the city and assuringly heading towards the forest area. She felt like she had to get out of the city, knowing that there is no place for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this entire time, she was currently in tears, crying her own soul out. Many people continue to call her a freak just as she runs into the forest after running far enough in the city. During this, several cars were crushed, but luckily no one was injured. Diana ran as far as she could in the forest, perhaps hoping to get away from the city as far as possible. She decided that there was no place for her in the city, so she would run as far off as possible in the forest and live there, so she would always be alone, and no one would have to ruin her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she finds a nearby empty cave her size, and proceeded to enter in a little ways, and there she breaks down on the ground, crying and crying. \u201cWhy did my life had to be always this way? WHY?\u201d!!!!!!!!! She cried in anguish just as her soul was completely broken. She just learned why she became a freak, and decided it would be better to live alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Slowly he creaked open his eyes, only to immediately shut them again in discomfort. The light was so damn bright, and why the hell did his head hurt so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny, wake up!\" the hazy voice ordered. He knew that voice, it was his wife Demi. Said wife eyed her husband with worry as he laid across the couch reeking of booze. In fact, the whole living room was filled with bottles. \"Dani please wake up!\" she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desperation in her voice seemed to rouse him again. He turned to face her with squinted eyes, it was then he noticed she was fully clothed. \"What's going on? You going somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you're coming with me! Now hurry up and throw on some shoes!\" she said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel took note of her urgency and struggled to sit up. God his head was killing him. \"Demi? What's going on?\" he asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Diana! She didn't come home last night!\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat woke him up. Suddenly the events of last night came back to him in full force. The plane ride home, the walk home with Diana... the truth, and finally that look of betrayal in her eyes and sadness in her voice. He'd hurt her and she walked off to be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of going after her like he should have he threw himself on the couch and drank until he passed out. He cursed himself for his own cowardice. This was all his fault! He should've done something! His only daughter was hurting because of him and instead of trying to ease the situation he looked for solace at the bottom of a glass. Pathetic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the splitting headache he felt at the moment, he got to his feet and threw on some shoes. \"C'mon, it'll take a while to reach the city, even by car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi nodded sadly, \"Right.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to reach the city by car, but when they did they were surprised to see so many police cars and yellow tape. Not to mention people arguing with officers about the closed off road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think...\" Demi began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No question.\" Daniel sighed from behind the wheel. This was no doubt Diana's doing. Who else could completely tear up a road and smash as many cars Diana? Answer: Nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's go around and fallow the carnage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to back up a tomato of all things hit his windshield. \"What the hell?\" Demi panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your freak of a daughters fault!\" a man shouted. This drew the attention of the rest of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Because of her I'm gonna be late to my sons baseball game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a doctor, I can't afford to be late to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bitch crushed my car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last one got both parents pissed, but they knew two against forty weren't good odds. Instead, Daniel merely scowled and used his windshield wipers before backing away. He didn't have time for these clowns. He needed to find Diana and tell her he's sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi continued to shoot death glares at the crowd and the police who were conveniently looking the other way. \"Bastards.\" she whispered. She then looked back her husband as he turned the car around to fallow the destruction. He put on a tough front for the crowd but she knew the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, he was hurting.</span></div></div>",

It looked like it was going to packed since it was monster move night and the sun appeared to be going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of her size watching normal TV was out the question, but giant movie screenings were something she could do. It also helped that the drive in was more than large enough to accommodate her 80ft frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana? Why don't you put us down and go find a seat while I pay for the flick?\" Her father suggested, to which she obliged.

They were even some fans that were there to gets some pics and record this little \"rampage\" that she is gonna be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good grief, another destruction request, it always makes me feel more like a monster than I care to admit, but its also one of the very few positives of being a giantess.\" she told the worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but hey, you saved us alot of supplies and money also. Why have our workers go through the trouble when we could just have you do it for us, and besides, this is one of your favorite things to do at times.\" he also replied back, but also being understandable as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's just get this over it, as I got places to be. So what will I be destroying today here?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is \"Dianazilla\" gonna destroy?</span></div></div>",

A dark blue skirt and a black strapless top<br>\r\nPowers: Regeneration. Her regeneration causes her to require a high caloric intake when she does regenerate. Craves protiens cause thats what her body needs.<br>\r\nWhere they live: Family lives in a suburban town, Serania. Stephanie is at a goverment facility for now.<br>\r\nBio: Read on to find out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Stephanie is sitting inside what can be best described as a warehouse. It has some of her basic needs, a place to sleep and a bathroom. But the biggest problem is that she can't stand up straight because of the thirt foit high ceiling, a problem because she is fifty feet tall. Het shirt and skirt are just large pieces of clothe that are wrapped around her body. Beingbtold that better accomodations are being made for her. But when she asked about shoes for her bare feet, she was told it was too expensive to produce shoes in her size. So she has to go barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stephanie sighs as she pulls her legs up to her chest, missing her husband and her daughter. Unfortunately, the government wants her to have limited contact with them until she has a better understanding of her fifty foot stature. She understands, as she is able to cruah a car like it was a paper cup, not to mention that it is very easy for her to step on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie looks down at her, curling her long, thick toes. When she was five feet tall, her feet were already sizeable at a woman's thirteen and a half. Now, at her current height, they are ten feet long, On her first trip over, she accidentally stepped on and crushed two cars. Thank God no one was in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie thinks back to when she first changed. Even though it was only a week ago, it seems like so much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Stephanie was walkingbdown the street with her fourteen year old daughter, Becky. The day was nice, so a walk was very enjoyable. The next thung she knows, she hears tire squealing as a truck is losing control. She instinctively pushed her daughter out of the way as she was coverd in a chemical mixture. She expected to suffer third degree burns, but instead jt just felt warm. Then that's when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembers how her clothes started to feel tight on her body, her shoes feeling snug on her feet. Then shebsaw her daughter, who should have ben eye level with her, but wasn.t She was shorter.The moment her sock clad toe burst through the fronts of her shoes and the buttons of her blouse started to pop of, she knew what was happening to her. She was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer capri pants started to grip her legs, almost like a second skin, the seams tearing as her flesh bulged outward. Her shirt fared no better, tearingbalongbthe back as her widening body pushed it outward from th inside. Once her shoes gave way, her socks started tearing, her long toes protuding through the fronts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As Stephanie's clothes fell away, she covered her ample, size F breasts with her arm, while she covered her womanhood with her free hand. As she rose up higher and higher, people continued to stare, as her daughter called out to her. Once she stopped growing, they all stood and watched, wondering if she would rampagenot not. Their minds put at ease when she sat down in the road, uxing her legs and long hair to preserve her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hoir of waiting with her daughter, her husband rushing to her side fifteen minutes after her growth, the Kaiju Specialty Forces, or KSJ for short, arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general approached Stephanie, the thirty year old woman, drwarfing Stephanie's six foot tall husband by a foot and a half. She made an offer, supplyinng stephanie with all her basic needs and relocating her family so they can still be together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt been a week since then, and Stephanie's progress has been slow. Sha has been codenamed Momzilla, since that is what everyone has been calling her. She looks over as a door opens up, as General Alice walks in. She wonders what kind of training she will endure today.</span></div></div>",

Luna and see that two of them are young boys no older than 10, and the youngest one of the group was a girl at the age of 6. (I know it isn\u2019t much kids, but figured that a group doesn\u2019t always have to be so many.) They were wearing the standard school uniforms that their high end schools provided them, and just seeing them before her, she could only leave with a bit of a soft smile as cold as she might see to be. She is still a bit cold, but she leaves a bit of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi little ones, just coming to see me.\u201d She said, slightly annoyed, but softer than her other responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Luna, just coming to see you. Anything up lately?\u201d The young girl then asked her, hoping to cheer her up a bit. \u201cYou look so down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that is true, maybe I am just homesick or something. I mean, being big and powerful surely doesn\u2019t leave you a lot of opportunities to have fun or be useful, unless you are Soyumi, Sakura, or those others who seems to being monsters all the time with monster names that y\u2019all call us. I swore someone call me Lunazilla, but I just wanna be called Luna.\u201d She said a bit down, but smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you just wish you can be useful at your massive height with your powers?\u201d One of the boys asked. \u201ci think you could make an incredible superhero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I think I could. That is actually a great advice there. But let me ask you all this, especially the girl. If you were this big and everyone sees you like a monster, how would you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that depends if they are scared of just love me.\u201d The girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you have a point there... I mean, I just want to be useful for a change around here. But... I wish they can see me for the real me, and not just some towering monster sized girl like they do with Sakura and Soyumi and many others, and if by some means y\u2019all were giants, don\u2019t you want to be seen for the kind person that you are, or just some monster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOurselves.\u201d They said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Remember they are no male giants, but I figure I state a question here for them in order to get Luna to teach a good lesson.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, you should go out every so often and try being more open?\u201d the girl then said, hoping to get Luna to go out for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it succeed? </span></div></div>",

Her age changing abilities also affects her clothes as well, allowing them to adjust.<br>\r\nPowers: Near invincibility like Luna, fire breath, monster roar, regeneration, and also age adjusting, also body manipulation of her breasts and butt if she wanted to<br>\r\nWhere they live: Just like Luna, Tokyo in Japan, but also tends to visit other cities in Japan as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Sakura is currently a descendant of the goddess of destruction and beauty who has recently went on to the next stage of their goddesshood, She is next in line and has prepared her whole life for this moment. Deep down she wants to be a friendly and helping, but also an awesome goddess who will take their rightful place as rulers, but let\u2019s just say she is going to have a blast while she does it. She and her mother over the young years have watched plenty of monster movies like Godzilla and Gamera as she imagine herself as a kaiju and wants to take a spin on her time as goddess while also still being friendly as well. Her mother is extremely supportive of her and being a fan of the Goddesses herself, she can see why she is one day hoping for that. Then one day it has finally happened, and Sakura became a goddess herself and awakens her powers. But one power she finds interesting other than her giant monster like ones like roars and fire breath, is how she can adjust her age and body appearances, letting her change her height as well in the process. She imagined her self as a kid one day and then suddenly she is then a kid again in appearance and height wise, getting her dream in the process. Then she adjusts back at her own choice, and it does. Well, the rest of the story comes soon so let\u2019s get into the writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional info: She is a really fun loving girl, but is lucky to be careful with what she does as a goddess, but a part of her fun is acting like a giant monster attacking the city. So she stomps around and roars like kaiju a lot, and even rises from the ocean or makes big monster openings as well. She currently has lots of fans, especially children who she is a sucker for as she wants to bring joy to the world, and sometimes uses her younger forms to be like a kid monster to them. She does plenty of favors around the city also, like demolitions and stuff,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig note, this story takes place in the same universe as Luna\u2019s, so refer to this link here for more details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1845671-ATypical-Life-as-a-Kaiju-Giantess/map/1551\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/it...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do you wanna start?</span></div></div>",

The streets were bright and was busy with all the usual traffic that you would expect in a major city like this, but there is something that now heads this way that is going to make their normally boring day a true site to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the ocean, there was a sudden shift of water as it seems to be a figure heading toward\u2019s the city. Even the ground was rumbling really hard as the figure was actually underwater, stomping towards the city. Under the water was Sakura herself in her adult form, ready to give the appearance of a life time. Sakura was smiling just as she approaches the city that she calls home, as she was going there today to have some giant sized fun, and as a goddess, she comes here regularly to visit, and luckily all the people were nice to adjust their roads and everything to allow the goddesses to roam the city, and soon the appearance of her would been seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome kids were playing at recess by a school near the ocean when they see the waters rapidly acting up, and then a kid who was just a young girl turns her attention to the ripples in the water. \u201cHey fellas, look at this.... Sakura is about to appear.\u201d She shouted. Suddenly, all the kids and their teacher who was happy then turn to see the figure begin to rise out of the water. First revealing brow in hair, along with the white face with brown eyes. She was smiling just as she rises from the water, revealing more and more, like her bra and panties just as she awakens. After she was fully out of the water, stomping right near the school and a random area at 300ft tall, she then emits a kaiju like roar in the area, and it was so loud and defeaning that many covered their ears, and it sounded monster like. It lasted for a few seconds before suddenly she turns to see the kids there, and she smiles. \u201cWell hi there little ones, I am the mighty Sakura, Goddess of Beauty and Destruction.\u201d She roared! And all the kids cheered for their goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

This story is only mention to be for entertainment and to only be treated as such, so don\u2019t take anything here too seriously. I have had people come and tell me that on this type of stuff, so I do encourage y\u2019all not to be those types of people. Yes they are kids in this story, but don\u2019t think that this is a pedophile story. I am only making this interactive for entertainment, nothing else.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, sometimes life is extremely tough for everyone, and sometimes life is like given to you on a silver plate. Well in this new giantess story, you get to see a new side of life that you have never seen the girls before. The girls by some means grew to gigantic monster like sizes and you would think they would become good or evil, but in actually, they are just trying to go through the same thing we do in life. Go to school or work, learn or work, go to bed, sleep, etc. Well imagine having to do all of that as a giantess with giant monster like powers and is known to the people as a giant monster, either accepted and loved by the public, or feared and trashed by everyone. The difference in this story is that they don't go suddenly on a huge rampage and kill everything and everyone, here they are trying to solve this life problem without violence. Hence the title of this new giantess kaiju interactive... \"A Typical Life as a Kaiju Giantess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow of course it ain't all typical, sometimes they can be well known and liked as a celebrity. But the difference in this kaiju giantess story is that they are going through life issues, but on a whole another scale, one that is gigantic sized. And also they have other issues like how to get around the city without destroying stuff, clothing they were, where they live, and etc. I kinda want to go for that type of feel in this new story. Slice of Life Drama Sci-Fi Fantasy kaiju adventure. Who knows, maybe some romance even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, all of the giant girls in this story will have a kaiju name, and if you want to be simple, just add a Zilla at the end of the name. The government will register that being as a kaiju.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, time to get to the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Male Giants<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Vore since this is not an evil story as I am focusing on life issues on this one, and other stuff, don't want this turning into an eating story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sexual content for the younger than 13 crowd, please, I will get in real trouble for this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo unbirth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo switching genders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo nudity<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease make your additions at least a paragraph long, as I will delete those who break this rule<br>\r\nNo scat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can make more than one giantess in a route<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeave more than one option for the other guys so they can make their characters when you use the open slots (which will be made soon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe format must be completed in its entirely for the character to be made, now if you have a photo of the girl you want to use, you can ignore the hair style, skin, eye color, and clothes part, just put a link of the photo at the end, and make sure it's workable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScale-wise, 12 inches is a foot.
