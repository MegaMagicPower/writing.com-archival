The last time he saw Sev was a year ago, and the young templar that he knew had...aged very much, either due to stress or just his position. Then there was Faopaw, and Kronous had not seen the furry leader over a decade. He would indeed wish to find Leon and Nikki, but something told him to find the others first. He thought this was due to the fact that they could feel, or detect any kind of evil. Kronous wished the old man was alive to see this, but he shook his head. Andersdon would've been proud, and most likely would've joined in.<br>\r\n   \"I believe,\" Kronous said,\" we should find Sev and Faopaw first. If there was anything wrong, they of all people would know.\"<br>\r\n   \"I agree.\" Kaneda said, \" Sev has a knack for finding evil, and Faopaw is able to sniff out unnaturaul things...literally.\"<br>\r\n \"And maybe,\" Kronous thought aloud, a familair glint in his eyes,\" we'll be able to aquire the help of my friends.\"<br>\r\n   \"Maybe Darion will help.\" Hikari agreed, but she added,\" but I'm pretty sure the other two would weigh us down.\"<br>\r\n    \"Well,\" Kronous shrugged,\" we just need one, and Darion will do just fine. He has really improved with his blade, and even I am a little iffy to fight him.\"<br>\r\n Hikari shrugged, indicating she was satsified with the results, and Kaneda nodded, approvingly. Kronous turned to his daughter, the glint in his eyes was still there.<br>\r\n    \"What of you, lil' shadow?\" Kronous asked Serena with a chuckle,\" will you care to join?\"<br>\r\n    \"I don't really have a choice if Aunt Kaneda isn't going to be here to watch me,\" Serena said with a smile,\"it would be nice to see the world beyond the city.\"<br>\r\nKronous grinned. He could already tell that this would be quite intresting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSev stood with one of the captains he knew so well, discussing a strange occurence that had happened in a desert, and Sev couldn't put his finger on it, but he had felt this strange energy before.<br>\r\n    \"This could either be good,\" Jorm said, talking to Sev,\" or bad. You say you felt this energy before. Was a good aura? Or bad?\"<br>\r\n    \"I... Can't remember. I recall experiencing it years ago, but I can't pin point when.\" Sev said, putting his fingers to his temples,\" but I know it was an acient power.\"<br>\r\n    \"Progress!\" Jorm exclaimned,\" well, we know it's ancient now. But--\"<br>\r\n Jorm was cut off by a horse galloping up to Sev, a courier on the back who looked beyond exhaustion due to riding great lengths.<br>\r\n    \"Speak, courier,\" Sev said before the messenger said anything.<br>\r\n    \"Vice-captain....of the sixth....has asked of you to meet with him,\" the courier said, taking deep breaths,\" at... D.c.\"<br>\r\n    \"So the slayer of evil wants to meet again,\" Sev said, finding himself smiling,\" very well. I'll be there in a day or two. But rest, courier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Faopaw was sniffing around, his nose picking up a familar scent. It smelt of fear, evil, and hate. Growling Faopaw stood up, looking around. What could discharge those kind of sensations? Faopaw had felt and smelled it before, but couldn't really remember how or where.<br>\r\n    \"Corh, Fel!\" Faopaw said in a gruff voice, turning to the two guards who were with him,\" let us head back. Something is not right with the wilds.\"<br>\r\n The two werwwolves merely nodded, dropped to all fours, and ran off quickly, Faowpaw following close behind. Still wondering what made the smell, Faopaw would have to send a long runner to Avelwind, a druid who has long protected the wilds. However, when they returned, there was a long runner waiting for him.<br>\r\n    \"Speak, brother,\" Faopaw said in a commanding gruff voice.\"<br>\r\n    \"The one-shape slayer has requested for you to meet with him in D.C.\" The long runner said, standing up.<br>\r\n    \"Aha! A perfect chance to seize this oppotunity to warn others! Long runner, go to Druid Avelwind and tell him to meet me in D.C.\" Faopaw said, rubbing his paws together,\" it will be nice to see the slayer again.\"</span></div></div>",

And believe me, we may have another major problem.\" Kronous said, agreeing.<br>\r\n    \"My only question for you now is,\" Faopaw muttered, looking around,\" where is Darion?\"<br>\r\n   \"Eh, he sent me a message saying that he'll be here in a couple days,\" Kronous waved a dismissive hand,\" one thing is for sure, Darion is going to be more than 'over joyed' to see us all.\"<br>\r\n Faopaw snorted, which told Kronous what Faopaw thought about that, yeah right. Kronous gave a shrug and turned to speak with Sev. Faopaw barked orders to his escort, who seemed to just nod their heads. <br>\r\n   \"Bad things are going to start happening,\" Sev said,\"and when they do, we bettered be prepared.\"<br>\r\n Kronous nodded in agreement. The rest of the night was spent on catching each others lives', challenging to duels, and dinner. Afetr all that, they went to bed to catch some sleep.</span></div></div>",

Leo reached around the tree, but his arm was pined by a blade. He looked over and saw a grinning shadow. The shadow grabed Leo by the neck and tossed him away from the tree. Then Leo heard gun shots, and blades clashing togater. Damn the shadows came back, and fast too. They berly felt them by the time they got there. Leo looked at the shadow, it darted into the darkness. He hear two sets of feet on his left and his right. Pulling out his 9mm, he started fireing to his left. But by the time he got over to his right he felt a blade rip tru his body. He hear the shadow say \"Killing Sen-Lee was a bad idea, Kosa wants you dead, but by his scythe\". Leo growled \"You can go to hell\", the shadow pulled out his blade from Leo. And smaked it ageanst his face. Every thing went black.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nFaopaw sent the othe two werewolves out to differnt places. A trail has to be some where. But then he smelled blood, comeing from the camp.

Kronous thanked Faopaw silently for his intervention, which could not've been planned more perfectly. But, Kronous knew that sooner or later, he'll need some help pushing back the shadows, which varied in forms. However, something disturbed him creatly. The fact that Avelwind still had information on the three insane ones had not cormforted Kronous a bit. Kronous knew what he had to do: to seek out Anderson's spirit, whom gave him advice in the form of a riddle.

Of course, he had given up using on that cursed axe, for it was starting to feel like a lump of metal than the great weapon he used. But, when he finally relinqushed the axe, he obtained two runeblades, which he called Rage and Desire. It was suiting, considering his nature. Darion thought about it on long, boring days, but now, he is able to cut down an enemy faster than he was able to with a axe.<br>\r\n    \"Where are you guys?\" Darion shouted, quickly scanning his surrondings,\"Just keep fighting! I'm sure we'll meet up!\"<br>\r\n  Darion again lept into the fray taking out two more shadowbeings with him. He heard a visicous howl close by, and knew that Faopaw and his furry freak brothers were nearby. The other two he was looking for would be the most difficult, for they're only human. Sev was a good fighter, able to heal himself, as well as others, while Kaneda, that's what worried Darion the most. Kaneda was just human, but skilled assassian, able to use diffirent items at her disposal. Darion shool his head, and began to carve his way towards Hikari and the druid. Kronous trusted the former death knight, and Darion would not fail him. Could not fail him.<br>\r\n   Darion inhaled again, and charged in again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Kronous had made his way to the graveyard, where he, Sev, Darion and Faopaw carried Anderson's casket to the grave. And now Kronous came now seeking advise from the dead old man. The reason he entrusted Darion with protecting the group was that he knew Darion could get the job done, and that Darion is like a brother to him. Pushing those thoughts out of his mind, Kronous slowed his pace. Anderson was killed defebding me, Kronous thought as he approached an altar, there is no way for me to repay him, since he's dead. Kronous kneeled down, muttering a prayer, and then stepped back, a blue ghost materilizing, no definite shape yet.<br>\r\n   \"I know why ye've come here.\" The ghost said, features now becoming more distinctive,\" and I truly wish I could help you.\"<br>\r\n   \"Give it to me straight, Anderson,\" Kronous said, sighing,\" are we able to stop this?\"<br>\r\n   \"Each day, they get more powerful and closer to their goal,\" Anderson replied, stepping close to the slayer,\" but they are not cooperative. They fight each other everyday.\"<br>\r\n    \"Really? This could help us greatly then--\"<br>\r\n    \"But, the dragon has the most influence. His madness drives his power.\" <br>\r\n    \"Great. So, if we got rid of him, we could possibly- Kronous was interuppted.<br>\r\n    \"You'd need a blade that has his very essence in order to defeat him. But, in order to get his essence, you need a scale of his.\" Anderson explained,\"perhaps the blade Darion has planned for you will be a viable condiut. But, I must go, one of them lurks near here.\"<br>\r\n    \"Wait, Anderson!\" Kronous said, reaching out to the incorapeal form,\" will we be able to defeat them?\"<br>\r\n     \"Time will tell, and let your heart decide, lad.\" With that, Anderson disappeared.<br>\r\n  Kronous stood there, taking in what Anderson had said. The old man may be right, Kronous wondered, but when was the old man ever wrong? <br>\r\n    \"Your time has come to en end, slayer. Prepare to join the ranks of the undead.\"<br>\r\n  Kronous whirled around, seeing a dark-robed figrue, surronded by undead.<br>\r\n    \"Come get some, necromancer!\" Kronous roared.<br>\r\n    \"Allow me to introduce myself, I am Alec the Reanimator, and I have come to claim your soul for our greet lord!\"</span></div></div>",

You cannot NOT, and will NOT, interfer with our plans. Your quest is going to end prematurely.\"<br>\r\n  With that, Alec raised his hands up chanting. A few moments later, a huge skeleton climbed out of the ground, brandishing a rusty broadsword. Kronous took his own weapon, and charged the undead, and by the command of it's controller, it ran to meet him. It swung the blade with skill, but lazily it seemed to Kronous, and that what gave him an advantage over the undead giant. <br>\r\n    \"Your big,\" Kronous remarked to the giant,\" but I've fought bigger.\"<br>\r\n  The skeleton responded by uttering a roar that sounded very dark. Closing the distance between them, the giant swung his blade. It made contact with Kronous's arm, causing the slayer to stagger back in pain. Roaring again, it contiuned toash out at the slayer with more power, accuracy, and speed. Everytime, Kronous would barely get his sword up in time just to deflect. Then the unthinkable happened.<br>\r\n   Right before his very eyes, his sword snapped in two.<br>\r\n  With nothing to defend or attack with, he attempted to move forward to attack Alec. But the giant intercepted the slayer, knocking him to the ground. Knowing his time had finally come, he clsed his eyes, awaiting the executing blow. It did not come though.<br>\r\n    \"For the Light!\"<br>\r\n  Opening his eyes, Kronous saw Sev leap towards the skeleton, then caving the skull in with a solid blow from his hammer.

Leave well enough alone, and you will not get killed...maybe.\"<br>\r\n   With a slight hissing sound, the necromancer disappeared into thin air.

Leo felt the pain again, but this time it was fowled by a burst of rage. Leo grab the guard\u2019s leg and threw him into the wall. Getting up, he heard the guard\u2019s heart start to beat fast. Leo looked at the guard and rage built back up in him. Then his human eye turned to that of a vampires. Glowing at him Leo ran over to him and bit onto his neck. Drinking the guard blood quickly Leo got up and looked at the open door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to get out of here\u201d Leo said. Running out of the room and into the hallways Leo wonder where they taken him too. He turned a corner and saw a human in a scientist coat. With out thinking Leo took him to the ground and bite in to his neck. \u201cThe vamp kid  is out\u201d Leo heard a guard yell. Then ten grads busted thru some door at the end of the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck him up\u201d said a guard and bullets started flying. Leo ran at the guards, the bullets that was hitting Leo couldn\u2019t fell. Because of the state of blood rage he was in. Breaking necks, and ripping out others. After  Leo was done with them he busted thru the doors at the end of the hall. Leo saw a dark figer in front of him. \u201cGood now be my pet\u201d reaching out his hand. Leo felt his head throb and whispering in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark figer closed his hand, Leo yelled out in pain as the throbbing got more and more intense. Falling to his knees and grabbing his head. The whispering now was yelling. \u201cBe my pet and you shall feed as you wish\u201d the figer said clutching his hand tighter. Leo felt his mind give way and he felt the figer grab onto it. \u201cGood\u201d he said grinning. Leo was breathing heavily and he look up at the dark figer who said \u201dGo attack Leon and the others\u201d. Leo got up and walk away,he was joing by shadows. He tried to stop be he had no control over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon was looking in the fire when Nikki walked up and said \u201cLeon I am worried too\u201d. Leon sighed and said \u201cSomething is going to happen, they want him for something\u2026\u2026and Serena for that matter\u201d. Nikki could see that Leon was in a dark state. \u201cLeon is there something I should know?\u201d Nikki asked. Leon look at her on said \u201cno\u201d then he look back into the fire. \u201cDamnit Leon quit hiding what ever it is because me, Kronous, and Sen-Gie already know your hiding something\u201d Nikki yelled. Leon turned his head and said \u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u201d</span></div></div>",
