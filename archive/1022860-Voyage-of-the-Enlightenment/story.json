Had she, personally, just a nobody lab assistant, made first contact with an alien race? It was staggering; beyond staggering! Until today she had never even believed that there really were alien races!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   When the radio message came in, she'd dismissed it as a prank, but as she was working late and alone had played along to relieve the boredom. Extraterrestrials? Uh-huh. Ship in distress? Naturally. Of course I\u2019ll help! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnybody with half a brain knew that popular fiction was guff. Einstein\u2019s laws of relativity, the most famous equation in the world, meant that it was physically impossible to cross interstellar space in anything close to a lifetime. Reality had a speed limit. Nothing could travel faster than the speed of light. And there were a lot of light years between here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Karla spoke to the 'aliens' for some time learning more of their story. . They were from a starship called The Enlightenment which had run into trouble in our solar system. They claimed to be refugees from some terrible war on another world. Their solar system was home to two life bearing worlds and the other world had, motivated by religion, declared a war of genocide against them. These people, the Alieth were generally peaceful and lacked the military strength to defend themselves and consequently had been forced to evacuate, braving the dangers of space over certain death at home. To this end, millions of people were packed into crowded ships. The majority were left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   On Karla\u2019s prompting, the mysterious voice on the radio explained in laymans terms how they were able to traverse the vast gaps between stars. It made little sense to her though. It seemed they got around the physical laws of the universe by leaving it! This improbable sounding feat was accomplished by the ships drive unit which projected a field around the entire craft shifting it out of synch with our reality and into synch with another, known as The Ether. There are points which intersect in both realities but the distances on either side are completely different. However navigation is extremely difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was this difficulty which led to The Enlightenment being seperated from the rest of the fleet and re-entering normal space-time in a totally unknown locale. Near Earth, as it turns out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Isn\u2019t that rather a coincidense that you happened to appear near a populated planet?\" Karla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No,\" he explained, \"We were lost in the Ether and noticed a flare of activity near a crossing point between realities. We were desperate, so we headed for it. <br>\r\n   \"Bad mistake. Whatever it was crashed right into us as we were emerging causing a hull breach. That\u2019s when we sent out the distress call. Which you somehow received on the equipment you were working on there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was just static. The voice was gone. Karla just sat alone in the lab and wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She picked up a biro and scrawled the word \"WOW\" in the margin of a sheet of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was fortunate, because as she glanced up she saw something which was to be a turning point in the lives of millions! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table in front of her there were a series of blue white glows of energy which blazed brightly and then faded. When her eyes adjusted to the change in intensity she saw that on the exact spot where the lights had been were maybe two dozen of what looked like insects. They were maybe three milimeters long and two high and now that she was looking at them they really didn't look quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, they hadn't been there before the lights!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer normal reaction on seeing ants or any other insect would be to kill them, but the weirdness of events made her pause and watch instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved oddly, almost with a purpose. And.... She leaned in closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were no insects!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking at what she now felt sure were the very alien beings she had just been in communication with! When viewed close up they had six legs and two human-like arms. They had a head with actual hair and light coloured skin and faces.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared, and after a minute one of them seemed to finish working on a barely visable device. He raised it to his face and spoke! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Karla Brown looked at the crew of the starship Enlightenment again and for the hundredth time struggled to come to terms with what had happened today.  She, personally, just a nobody lab assistant, had made first contact with an alien race. It was staggering; beyond staggering! Until today she had never even believed that there really were alien races!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   And yet here they were.<br>\r\n   But that wasn\u2019t all. There was their appearance. If, in an idle moment Karla ever thought about the possibility of alien life, she had always just assumed that they would look rather like they did on TV. That is to say, short big headed bug eyed ashen faced foetus gnomes with weird fingers. As she didn\u2019t place much faith in the idea, she really hadn\u2019t given it much in the way of independent thought. These aliens did,\u2019t look like that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Looking through the magnifying glass, their faces were startlingly human-like, although the colour wasn\u2019t quite right and the feeler like antennia were definitely inhuman. Everything else was utterly bizarre. They had eight limbs! Six legs and two arms with all kinds of odd jointing arrangements. (\u2018It must take alien kids years to learn how to even walk with all that lot\u2019, she thought.) The hands were long and slender but otherwise humanoid and able to manipulate objects like we do. The overall result was that they were constructed a little like a centaur, with a long horizontal leg section with a humanoid torso protruding from the front end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a disparity between them, as some had filmy fairylike wings, whilst others did not. She would later learn that the wings were vestigal and in the modern species never functioned. The species had abandoned flight in favour of tools, it seemed. Some races had wings. Others did not. Throughout the history of their world this difference had sometimes been the cause of conflict and war.<br>\r\n   Of course this all paled into insignificance, compared to the most striking difference of all. Not natural, she would learn, but rather part of a terrible accident. Karla peered again through the magnifying lens. <br>\r\n   They were small. Very small indeed. There were about two dozen extraterrestrials on Karla\u2019s desk, each one about the size of an ant! If it hadn\u2019t been for the faint glow around each one as they arrived and the communication device they used Karla was sure she wouldn\u2019t have even noticed them!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   The communicator produced a truly bizarre effect. It both amplified the voice of the lien spokesperson and translated into English whatever language they were speaking. The overall effect was quite disorientating. The voice was still small, but far too large for the creature making it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Even with the communicator, contact had not gone smoothly. After she first looked closely at the tiny beings Karla had recoiled in shock and was reliably informed that she\u2019d \u2018squealed like child\u2019. After curiosity had gotten the better of her things had proceeded in a more orderly manner, although it was a far cry from Close Encounters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u2018My name is Karla,\u2019 she stated and then asked the spokesperson\u2019s name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u2018My name is Conrad,\u2019 he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Karla almost collapsed into peals of laughter. \u2018Conrad!\u2019 she repeated, \u2018Sorry. I don\u2019t mean to offend you, but that doesn\u2019t sound very alien to me\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u2018It shouldn\u2019t\u2019 he explained, \u2018Our translation devices replace our true names with an equivalent in your language. There would be little point in giving you a name which you couldn\u2019t pronounce.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It made sense, although it would take some getting used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla spoke to the aliens for some time learning more of their story. She discovered that although smaller than humans, Conrads race were not usually this small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all because of events after the earlier communication. As the starship Enlightenment had begun to break up, an evacuation had been oredered via the ship's teleportation system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Does that work through the Ether?\u2019 Karla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u2018No,\u2019 Conrad explained,\u2019 Totally different. The teleporter essentially transforms you into energy and beams you to a specified destination where it rebuilds you from complete readings taken at the moment of departure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u2018As you can see, it went wrong. The ship was damaged. There are safeguards in place to protect the structural integrity of those being sent. However the ship was damaged and the device was never intended to send so many people at once. I\u2019m hypothesising here, but it must have not had enough power to reconstruct us all. It has to protect each individual person, so it just reconstituted us to the same plan only scaled down\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Karla let this sink in. It was too much to handle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   \u2018So you\u2019re telling me that the transporter couldn\u2019t handle\u2026\u2019 She did a quick count, \u2018\u2026twenty three people?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Conrad paused. \u2018You misunderstand, Karla, This was a rush transport. We arrived dead on target but others have been scattered apparently.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u2018How many?\u2019 she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u2018This was a colony ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u2018More than two million people.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She desperately wanted to know more about these mysterious little people, and recognised that they had to get together an organised plan to recover the other colonists but before there was time Conrad had interrupted. He had made radio contact with another group of colonists. So Karla had secured her group in a plastic box and placed them on the passenger seat of her car, held steady by her handbag. It was still a bumpy ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is worse than space travel,\u201d Conrad\u2019s vibrating voice yelled. <br>\r\n   The other group of colonists were on a \u2018vast white plane\u2019. However, given their small size that could be anywhere. Probably an interior floor somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cHey, Conrad. If they managed to radio you does that mean they can talk to humans like you can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. They just have regular coms with no extra amplification. I\u2019m ship\u2019s crew. The device I\u2019m using is designed as a public address system! I\u2019ve got it on full power. It\u2019s really hurting our ears down here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u2018The signal\u2019s intermittant, but I\u2019ve got a lock on the source. Wait! They\u2019re coming through again. I\u2019ll put the com near my amplifier.\u201d<br>\r\n   Karla heard a staticcy but recognisably female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    (All Alieth names and language are translated into English equivalents.) Jacki was relieved to hear a friendly voice at the other end of the radio. She was no adventurer; just a librarian and mother and the desolate immensity of her surroundings made her nervous. She had the com, but it didn\u2019t look like there were any ship\u2019s crew here. Just a couple of hundred  passengers milling about. Her two daughters clung to her, wide eyed. Scared, and who could blame them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke again, \u201cHello? Hello? Are you coming? I don\u2019t know where we are. I don\u2019t know what to do. My girls are scared.

Judy padded across the tiled floor, unaware of the almost invisible crowds in her way. The Alieth were like tiny specks of dirt to those massive feet.

We are the Alieth and we need your help,' called Tamara, a poetess.

Then in a second a huge foot hundreds of feet long covered dozens of them with it's shadow... and heedlessly trod down.

They couldn't even see her impassive face not looking down at all, nearly 6000 ft above, just immense crushing feet so big, even her toe nails were above them, her big toe nail was 27ft up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a wave of hope as the immense woman glanced down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She sees us!' cried Polly, 'We're saved!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distant huge face distorted in obvious disgust. 'Ew. Ants! Disgusting, filthy little shits! You've got all the world to be dirty in. I've told you before not to come into my house!' She put her hands on her ample hips and sneered down at the now frantically screaming begging crowds and her terrifying toes wriggled. 'I think you need to be punished.

She watched in horror as one of the young girl's feet landed on a group of colonists just inside the room. The girl looked huge, wearing a very tight t-shirt and shorts, she was also wearing a very deadly and all too real pair of trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to blank out the thoughts and images of what she had just witnessed. Maybe twenty or so of her fellow travellers, instantly snuffed out of the universe by a gigantic girl's trainer. She couldn't even imagine what it must have been like for those underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she nearly found out just a few moments later. The second of the blonde girl's feet lifted high into the air and crashed down just in front of her and her now screaming daughters. The blast of air that came from the touchdown knocked her backwards, and also knocked her daughters out from her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting gingerly back up she looked around the floor for her two children; there! Cassie had been blown backwards some distance but was still moving, her other daughter, Sammy, had been blown backwards to her side...only she wasn't moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she noticed the shadow looming over her begin to move again...</span></div></div>",

She was in her mid-twenties, not exactly tall but with short blonde hair in pig-tails and a smile that could melt hearts at twenty paces. Fortunatly for the Alieth she was currently not around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd been in the room for a short time now, and the majority of them had rather sensibly hidden underneath the bed, out of sight and hopefully safe. Jacki herself had thought it was a good idea to stay under there, but somebody had to check out their surrondings - and though she wasn't brave or fearless herself, she decided to join the group of ten Alieth tasked with checking the area out. Her two daughters also tagged along with their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering into the light from underneath the large structure above them, Jacki glanced around at the other large objects around her. There was more large objects made of a smiliar material to the one they'd just been under; large and imposing these things stretched high into the sky with large round devices on them. A wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a small wooden chair; nothing out of place to a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, who'd volunteered to lead the small group suddenly brought them to a standstill. He was one of the older and wiser members of the group, one who had seen the war on their homeworld in much more detail than some of the others, and right now he was sensing all was not right. He looked at the others around him and shouted just one word - \"Hide\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group split up instantly, Jacki and her eldest daughter ran back towards the bed, her youngest, Cassie, ran and hid inside a large item made of an unknown fabric that was laying on the floor, or as any human would have told them; a sock. Tom and the rest hid behind some other items on the floor; a book and a solitary Nike trainer that had tipped on it's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacki screamed and shouted to her daughter, urging her to leave her hiding spot and join them back under the large structure; but her words went unoticed when a loud thudding noise outside the room they where in caught everybody's attention...</span></div></div>",

Then maybe she would be able to convince them that they had other little creatures trapped within their home and hopefully rescue them before anything too terrible happened to them. After all it was a mighty big world to people who stood less than half a centimeter tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over she picked up the plastic sandwich holder in which she'd placed Conrad and his group. Oddly she wondered again what the extraterrestrial's true name was. She'd seen his face looked human enough, but being a lab assistant she knew a bit of trivia info, and one of those bits was that the sound of the voice was created within the speaker's throat, though it was helped by the shape of the mouth. The Aleith might not even have vocal cords for all she knew. Heck they might even communicate through scent in their natural state like real ants, and that would make saying their names quite a chore for a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head to clear the errant thoughts away Karla opened the door to her car and caught an odd scent in the air. She realized then that the house she'd come to was right on the edge of town, and just a few yards away was the forest, and all the dangers therein. Even for a normal human the forest was dangerous right now with migrating herds, and the predators that followed them, and for the miniaturized Alieth it would be a death trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a renewed sense of urgency Karla ran up to the door and looked around for a doorbell. Finding an open slot with wires on the side of the door she was quick to determine that the doorbell must have been taken off years ago, and that whoever lived in the house probably didn't want any visitors. Not a good sign when she was about to try to talk her way into the house. Sighing and bracing herself Karla knocked on the door three times loudly enough to be heard anywhere inside and then stepped back. She was surprised when the door opened almost immediately to reveal the form of a...</span></div></div>",

A wicked smile crossed her face as she saw the expression of the girls face as she stepped into the box. Then she saw it on the floor. The little ants where scurryin around like mad. She deliberatly stepped onto some of the tiny insects which seemed to have fallen out by the impact. Standing over the box, her hands on her hips, she pondered what to do...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would set the puny \" aliens\" down in her garden and then grind them under her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But then her enthusiasm began to wane. There were hardly any of the little bugs left as she'd already squashed most of them anyway. There were only about five left and no matter how much of a show she made of it, it wouldn't be much fun knowing she could just end it in a second by treading on them in one step. Huh! Although it was stupid, she actually felt a little disappointed.She could go and look for more ants outside, but that wouldn't be so much fun, as the whole point was that the silly girl thought these ones were special! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The silly girl... She was still sobbing outside; Judy could hear her! Unbelievable! A really crazy thought occurred to Judy. She wouldn't normally care, but with the kids away, nothing on TV and no man, she was really bored. The insectavist was a tiny little thing and posed no threat to her; perhaps... Maybe she could pretend to be sorry and find more of these special forbidden 'alien intelligent' ants to use, or even mess with her some more...

But she seemed friendly and she, Jake her lover, Jill, the poetess and others tried to calm the crowds and gather them together. If they were to survive on this alien world they had to try to adapt and make allies even if they were terrifying, and she knew Conrad., their comms officer and though she wasn't a good friend of his he had always seemed like a good man. They gathered themselves together on the vast alien plain between what it now seemed where giant feet and not craft, a crowd of hundreds of refugees from a terrible war far away. There was crying of children and even adults at their new situation. Meri had to do something.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Judy looked down smirking at the mass of ants gathered between her boots. It seemed they were intelligent after all... at least enough to coordinate themselves into committing suicide! Stupid ants! She still couldn't wrap her head around the idea of alien invaders from space or talking bugs and it was annoying her. Bugs were stupid things she stepped on, more like dirt than living beings. They weren't supposed to talk and act smart! <br>\r\n  Well, she's figure it out later. For now there were a bunch of ants just asking to be squished and she had her boots on ready to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeri stood firm, Jake beside her and shouted up. The alien would have comuncations equipment and would hear! <br>\r\n\"Greetings and blessings, oh divine self! I am Meridith of the Ali...\" <br>\r\n  She got no further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy suddenly raised her right foot and swung it over the terrified Alieth and stomped down! Jake, Jill and a hundred others died then, crushed beneath the dirty white treads of Judy's boot. Meri lay on her back, one of her legs crushed, between the treads along with others who were trying to run along the tunnel made by the shoe's sole. \"BEN!\" she shouted at the man nearest, \"Help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy scraped her foot back and then stamped again and again, twisting her sole. She liked these boots for squishing bugs as they sometimes escaped by hiding between the treads. It made it more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's head was smashed in by the wall of hard rubber and then Meri screamed as her tiny body collapsed, her bones breaking and skull crunching as her brain was pressed almost flat. Her tiny ruined body stuck to Judy's sole along with so many of her friends and family only to be shaken loose and then squashed and picked up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy smiled as she twisted her foot back and forth. Her good deed for the day she always thought when she dealt with bugs. She'd done lots of good deeds today! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she had to think. She walked back to the living room and ignoring the 'voice' box and oblivious to the many alieth bodies she ground further into the soles of her boots with each step, she slumped down on the setee and put her boots up on the coffee table. It was either a damn good hoax or an invasion of actual ant people. Hoax probably. Jeremy Beadle was dead (rest his soul), but that didn't mean the TV types wouldn't try to do a new prank show. There would have to be an inside agent... so Tasha and Sarah (her daughters). Staying round a friend's would be a perfect cover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr... real alien ant bug gross invaders. No-one would believe that and she'd have to deal with them herself. If it was true it was a good thing she liked ants. Ever since she was a girl she'd enjoyed stomping and pouring boiling water on them. Maybe God chose her? No, silly concentrate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCall the girls or accept that it's a real invasion?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOn the other hand  </span></div></div>",

A few had communications devices and were able to coordinate the evacuation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  They were disoriented and most could not grasp the reality of their enviroment, believing themselves to be journeying across an alien plain.

The entrance to the ladies toilets was one of the most trodden on pieces of floor in the cafe as most of the women who visited used it at least once.

This whole thing was silly, but wondering if they might be little aliens was more fun than watching TV on her own. Judy wondered how the stupid bug girl was getting on and felt like teasing her, so she took out her phone and called the number Karla had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello? Judy?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yeah, hi. I went to the cafe. Everything's fine there, but you might want to go and check in case I missed any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh thankyou!\" Karla cried, \"Did you have any trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, no trouble.

They were everywhere. Everyone was treading on them. I must have stepped on a few dozen trying to sort things out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Judy could hear the stupid little girl sobbing and had to struggle not to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Please try not to... hurt any more of them, Judy. Please!\" The poor girl was in tears. \"Every one of them is a living feeling person! Please try to save them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I don't like being spoken to like that. I didn't have to help. I have things to do. If you're going to be ungrateful then I'll go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Judy almost walked into somebody as the girl gasped and said \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry Judy! Please don't go home! We need you! Thankyou for helping! Thankyou Judy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know if I care. I was going to go to the other location, but I'm not sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Please go there! PLEASE!

They are very small and we don't all have tiny feet like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Karla was frantic. Judy would tread on Alieth. Maybe dozens, but there were so many more who were in danger! And Conrad's girlfriend was probably there. But was she going to doom her or save her? \"I won't be angry if you tread on some of the Alieth, Judy. Just please help all you can.\" The words cut coming out of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So it doesn't matter if I tread on them while I'm gathering them up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please ne careful! Please! They are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think I'll go home.\" Judy hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She walked and a few seconds later her phone rang. She let it rang for a while and then answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry! I'm so so sorry, Judy! Thankyou for helping us! We need you! Things are bad here. They were all nearly killed! Please. It's okay that you crushed all of the other Alieth and if you manage to save most of the other Alieth and some have to die it's okay. You can crush as many as you have to, just save the rest? Please? WE got a call from the other Alieth and they need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This got better and better... \"I'm not happy about this.

And Thankyou Judy! Thankyou!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy felt a wave of satisfaction run through her body at how helpless this pathetic little girl was compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay then.

The others at the lab had regularly been known to compliment the boy's genius, while at the same time insulting his people skills, which were in truth lacking quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No visitors today,\" he said gruffly, not even looking up from a small sheet of paper he held in one hand. He was about to close the door in her face when Karla stuck her foot in the way, stopping the door short. Twice more did Jon attempt to close the open portal before finally being forced to look up from his paper to find what the problem was. Upon discovering the offending appendage he looked up and seemed about ready to start shouting at Karla, before he suddenly stopped and looked at her with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know you?\" he asked, fingering his square beard and staring at her with a gauging eye. Karla for her part wasn't sure whether to be relieved that she'd been recognized or creeped out by it, as Jon's stare was not exactly friendly in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do. I'm Karla from the lab downtown,\" she said, offering him her free hand. The man took a moment to place the name, and then nodded before turning away without taking the offered hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Well I'm very busy today so tell those scifi dropouts that they have to deal with their own problems today.

Or more exactly these people need some help,\" she said, holding the container with Conrad and his group forward. Jon, who had been walking away sighed as he turned back ready to face a whole herd of intruders, but was surprised to see that the girl was still alone, holding some lunch box thing forward. Stepping closer he looked down into the container and glimpsed a few small dots running about inside. Jumping back in surprise the man waved vehemently for Karla to take it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't do anything for bugs my dear lady. I have nothing to do with them at all. So if you would take that flea circus and leave,\" he said, pointing at her car in his drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not bugs!\" complained a new voice, and Jon looked around, wondering which one of his creations and visitors he'd have to punish for speaking in the girl's presence. Surprisingly he found the source of the new voice to be not one of his people, but rather the bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Suns of Arrakis! The bugs can speaks,\" he swore, moving closer to get a better look at the bugs. His sight was well enough that looking down he could tell the creatures contained inside were not of the insect family, though what they were he couldn't say precisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not bugs Jon. They say they're called Alieth and they're from another planet,\" she told him, holding the container forward even farther.  Jon seemed to react to the name and went back to his sheet for a second before staring into the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're name good sir, wouldn't happen to be #@!&amp;?\" he asked, his mouth making sounds that Karla couldn't identify at all, but she knew they had to mean something to Conrad as the tiny alien audibly gasped through the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that name?!\" he demanded, and Jon ignored him for a second going over his sheets again. Karla, now that Jon was closer, could see that the sheets contained lists of names and numbers some groups of which looked English, and other's of which didn't even look human. After consulting the sheet for another few moments Jon looked up and then stared at the container again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know many things #@!&amp; and I would be happy to share with you, but not in front of the girl. Send her away and we can talk,\" ordered Jon, looking venomously at Karla.

She saw security officer Emiliana and called her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down and safe!\" the flustered young woman reported, saluting like an idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At ease, officer.\" Alice sighed. This was rough. Suddenly plunged into an alien enviroment on little notice with who knew how many dependants. She wanted to be somewhere else, home would be nice,but responsibility was hers because she was cursed with being good at this sort of thing. She wondered where Conrad was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emiliana, I need to know how many of us are in this group, and a full recon of the local area and a danger assessment and I need it very very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Miss.\" The young officer rushed off looking for suitable people to help. This was the Alieth way. They had no word for delagation as to them everything simply fell into patterns of people telling the people who could best help about how they could help, and as nobody ever refused things just fell into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice saw Eszti over behind a group of panicky girls and behind the stalk of one of the alien trees, scratching under her crapace with her hind leg. \"Eszti!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAARRGGHH!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. 'bit disoriented. Okay now, promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. We're all a bit unnerved. But you have a special skill I need!\" Alice looked hard at the young woman. The young woman flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Eszti, are funny and likeable and there are a lot of scared people here. I hereby appoint you Morale Officer of Enlightenment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. However you aren't and we need that. They all need it. Look around. Find people who can help and cheer everyone up! What's the point in escaping Alia if everyone's unhappy here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked up past the towering trees to the strange alien sky and never suspected that those trees were blades of grass in a meadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  **********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Are you ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien shrugged. He was nearly ready, though he was still getting used to this. He'd been with Sabine for a few weeks but taking his shoes <i>off</i> to go out still seemed weird. But his new girlfriend loved walking barefoot and with woods and meadows so close by he'd started to enjoy it too. He smiled at his raven haired beauty and pulled his socks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Roughly two thousand  people of all ages trekking through rough terrain and now bad poetry too. No radio contact with anyone either. How could this get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien and Sabine walked along the pavement heading out of town. It was a gorgeous day and both of them drew glances. Sabine was a pretty girl, about five feet four with jet balck hair which hung around her shoulders. Her boyfriend towered almost a foot taller than her and she looked admiringly at his powerful long legs as he... sort of looked around enjoying the sun. Oh well. She grabbed his arm and kissed him and he kissed her back and all was right with the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody was bothering them for walking around without shoes or yelling \"Hippy!\" at them as Damien had feared the first time they did this. Perhaps it was being two people rather than one. Perhaps it was being a big bloke well over six feet tall... It felt good though. Great girl. He was glad he'd met her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did like him a lot and even if he didn't love her yet it was early days. Maybe he would and maybe she'd enjoy the trip. 'Journey, not destination,' she reminded herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh gosh! She looked down and saw a whole swarm of tiny ants around a crack in the pavement . She loved ants! They were so smart and she'd read about... and his feet, his big size 12 feet were heading right for them. She loved the little ants and hoped those big ugly feet would miss them but... she loved those big feet too and how powerful they were. She bit her lip. He glanced down and then planted his right foot on the whole mass of ants and carried on walking, leaving frightened ants scurrying amidst all the dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine gasped and grabbed him and kissed him. As she did so an ant scurried away only to be squashed out of existence by her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had only been walking for half an hour but there were already reports of two skirmishes with huge alien monsters with armoured carapaces. They had been driven off with no casualties, luckily. One of them had been like a bright red tank with black spots on. This planet had to get better than this. At least it had a sense of humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine and Damien walked into the small wood on the way to the meadow. They didn't talk much. They didn't, in trurh, have much to talk about. She hated football and cars and he had no interest in crafts. They did both like some sci-fi but different sci-fi. She liked Doctor Who and Lexx and he liked Star Wars. Not much, but perhaps she could work on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime she was watching his feet. <br>\r\nIn the meantime he was casting sideways glances at her tits and trying not to be too obvious.<br>\r\n She loved how big they were compared to her own feet and the way they pressed down onto the ground. She could see the dirt stuck to the ball heel and down the side of each foot. They rose and fell and rose and fell and rose... It was almost hypnotic.<br>\r\n They were pretty small but also pretty much perfect. Just big enough to jiggle a bit as she walked. It was almost hypnotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine saw a ladybird crawling along in front of them and tried to count the spots but his foot covered it leaving only it's broken messy remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         ******************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, are we going to be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stroked Justine's hair. \"Yes. We fought off those aliens so we can survive here. When we've found a safe spot everything will be fine. There's nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice! Alice!\" It was Emiliana. Alice looked up from the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, the scouts found a new tree! It's huge! More than two hundred feet tall with gigantic flowers on it's upper reaches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyou, Emiliana. Let's head for that. It might cheer us all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   ************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabine loved this walk and had been on it many times but this was the first time she had taken Damien with her. Ahead she saw a patch of wildflowers she recognised. She loved their tiny delicate white flowers and wondered if he would notice them. She watched as his left foot trod down on them, seeing the mud and stalks press up between his toes and then his foot lifted leaving most of the plants squashed into his muddy footprint.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was better. Then she let some water in the tub. She reached behind her to undo her bra, as she saw something on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimbob and the other alieth just ran for their lives. They knew, that they just had a chance if they stay together. At least this was their tactic on their own world. The feet of the Giantess where dangerous and they could just crush them. They knew that and that is just what happened. The giantess took another two steps and the heel of Sylvias heel just impacted behind some of them, so they flew up in the air and where dazed so they could not move. A second later the sole came down on them and they just vanished under the gigantic object. The others just kept on running and didn't even looked back. That was also alieth. In times of danger everyone was on his own although they where a group. With the next step the giantess was in front of them and then she stood still. Of course the alieth now tried to run into the other direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\", Sylvia asked the ants playfully. \"You know that you shouldn't come here unless you are in a suicidal mood.\" She finished undo her bra and sat down on the edge of the tub to take of her shoes. The ants where just running near it. \"Let me get a little more comfy, than I'll deal with you.\" She lifted her foot on her knee to loosen her sandal. Then she placed her now naked foot in front of the ants. Immediatly all of them turned around and ran into the other direction again. Then she undid her other shoe and placed this foot ontop of the group. all of them dissapeared under her ball. Then without another thought she got up to take of her string. As she stepped out of it, she checked if she have killed all of the insects. They looked like crumbled up ants. To make sure she ground her foot on them about two more times and then got into the bathtub to relax. She had a rendevous this evening. That was far more important than the insects she just now crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran and ran and then the awful sound started again. Some seconds later there was a wall of flesh just in front of them. \"The other direction!\", somebody shouted And so they did. The gigantic object, that made the noise was now standing next to them. And then there was a shadow. The Alieth tried to run faster but without avail. They where hit and buried under the massive human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity but finaly the pressure lifted again. Jimbob was injured, but still alive. He made it into the ditch. As he looked around, he saw that his comrades havn't had this much luck. Most of them where just crushed flat. Some few one suffocated or died from shock. A great Red band was falling behind him. A second later there was the shadow again. He still was in the ditch and hoped to survive but soon he felt his body move while he was pinned. That wasn't good. It hurt and scratched and before he could feel his body seperate, he passed out.</span></div></div>",

But.....' She halted, afraid to say something whgich might make her seem insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Well, 'said Mandy smiling, ' I've seen them too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla stopped. 'You have? I mean...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mandy laughed gently. She was blonde, perhaps a little above average height, though no giant, and dressed in casual clothes, as her job required no uniform. A strappy pink and white stripe top and jeans, above light turquoise flip-flops worn through constant wear on her feet. Big feet, to Karla's mind, though she didn't seem to care. Mandy wore a variety of footwear but, as often she would kick them off and walk barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was far more outgoing than the mousey Karla, and perhaps for this reason the two got on; Karla provided a counterpoint to Mandy's verve and Mandy enlivened the bookish Karla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There are ants EVERYWHERE today! I mean, really,; it's hot but this has to be a record. I guess you had your head in the clouds as usual and just got a shock when you finally noticed. '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't helping. Karla grappled with the lump in her throat which was smothering the words. 'They.....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes?' Mandy was being comforting, holding Karla's hand. Perhaps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They.....  spoke.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry, babe, what?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They,' Karla screwed up her courage. It was all now seeming more and more ridiculous. 'Mandy, I thought I heard them.... talk to me....Really! I'm not crazy; you know me! I'm not! I....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy leaned in and hugged Karla, 'Oh, babe... It's okay... I don't think you're crazy. Look, it's okay. It's like... You ever have a waking dream?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla nodded. When she was a kid, she had a recurring nightmare about a green faced witch, and once after she'd woken up she's seen the leering face staring at her. 'Yeah.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's like that. You look tired, and the mind plays tricks. All these ants about at the moment.... Look there's more about my feet now. '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarla began to be won over by her friend's warmth. 'I guess you're right. Thanks Mand. ' Karla smiled weakly and Mandy stepped forward onto yet more Alieth and put her arms around Karla, then stepped back. 'There's just an ant invasion then?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, I noticed at clocking off time last night. I was wearing my stilettos all day and, my feet were killing me! '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WHY do you wear those things?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They're sexy. Although I think I'm going to be walking around barefoot as much as I can today... Anyhoo, I pulled my trainers out of the locker and started putting them on. I was hopping about on my right foot when I saw it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Little moving specks inside my left shoe! There were ants in my Adidas!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's weird. I wonder why they were in there?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know, maybe they had a foot fetish!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'What did you do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy looked witheringly at Karla. 'Karla, I'm not scared of ants! I mean they were like the little tiny brown ones that don't even bite! I just ignored them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh.' Karla paused then, 'But you were putting your shoes on!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And I slid my tired foot into my comfy sneaker'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mandy! That's horrible! Those poor creatures!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I hate seeing you upset, Karla, and I know just what to do about it.

Names of beloved ones. Names of family members and friends who had been lost by almost everybody. He knew that they where just roughly aimed at an target location somewhere outside of the massive oceans of this planet and so he could just hope that Alice was ok. He knew that the survival of the ones who made it here was more important than his single fate - or that of his love so he got up and tried to help as good as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in some kind of jungle.

Tools and even a few machines who had been also teleported here had helped them to survive and to settle here. There are four towns existing that he knew off and he had found a new job in herding one of the alien lifeforms named mice. They gave milk, meat and the fur helped keeping them warm. They where also great for transporting about 12 Alieth at great speed which was a great step forward in scouting the area and building up new cities. Although they where almost 10 times as big as themselves they found ways to catch and to tame them. Learning from their former mistakes on their old homeworld they tried to live together with nature and not fighting it down. Of course there are Alien monsters they had to deal with and weapons they had to invent against them but intelligence and chemistry with a potion of luck made them even fight back the giant feline monsters which now avoided their areas and their cattle. But although all their success most of them are still grieving over lost friends and family members - so did Carl who lost his love Alice. He hoped that she was still alive since she wasn't under the corpses they managed to identify but still there have been so much of his folk whos body had been destroyed beyond identification by the powers of the teleport and the sudden loss of energy. Nobody disbelieved that there are other colonies of scattered Alieth somewhere within thousands of miles around their location but they just scouted a small area since everyone had to work together to establish a new social structure and make life worth living again. Besides of the dangers which waited outside the defensive perimeters they have set up. Birds, rats, wasps, moles and other monsters which simply used them as food. As he thought about it all of them where lucky that the felines where the biggest creatures in their perimeter. </span></div></div>",

Metal seemed to be an known substance to this creatures and they knew about the secrets of the wheel. It semed that this things where vehicles. Four wheels, metal axes but nothing that could make it move or open it. The engine was primitive and has been made of one full piece of metal which was kind of useless. The scientist where sure that this was just a fake. A model maybe to create something similar. A design Prototype which wasn't ment to work but it was clear that these unknown aliens where scalable now. They where smaller than the mice they herded but bigger than the bees which they still tried to tame to conquer the air. Maybe this race hasn't been deceased yet and it could be helpful to find allies in this strange world. This was one good reason to keep on scouting and looking for these aliens and simply hope that they where peaceful.

Miss Smith scrunched her face at the sight of the gnats and gave a quick puff of air at them to blow them away. The tiny alieths saw her slightly wrinkled lips purse into a frown, and then open and blow a hurricane force puff of morning breath at the tiny gnat sized vehicles, sending them flying and disintegrating them. \u201cEW..

Suggestions are welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror: The crew of the Enlightenment find themselves on the most dangerous world of all: Earth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasic rules apply: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) rit proper! People adding one sentance idiotfests will be ridiculed to hell and back unless the story really needs it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)Continuity. Please read the preceding chapters before adding. Sudden changes of scene with no explanation or out of character moments will be rewarded.... with deletion!<br>\r\n3) It's the magic number. Please feel free to write whatever the hell you like no matter how sexually explicit, violent, illegal or depraved as long as it fits in with the story.<br>\r\n4) New addition. Yes, anyone can die! There are a lot of interactive stories on here where the author specifies that nobody can ever die. It's interactive! If they die, go back and choose again! All the best classic interactive books were littered with instant death and that feeling of danger is a good thing. Kill away! I'm even fine with all death cul-de-sacs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story revolves around tiny aliens who are a cross between (roughly) humans and ants. They have been shrunk to various sizes, have four legs and two arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are lots of different groups at different sizes in different places, so the story can change scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story goes where it goes.
