Since there was nothing to do, he decided to do just that. Nothing. A few minutes after sitting there, he lied down and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, sirens blasted the city with ear-piercing noises. It seemed the police, fire department, and the 911 operators got called to do their job Sonic was already speeding through the city, leaving a blue-blur like trail behind him. He followed the sirens' screech to a burning building; a bank to be exact. \"Heh,\" Sonic laughed, \"Who is in trouble <i>this</i> time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had already burst open the doors, and a shadowy figure stood where the entrance once was. Chaos Emerald in hand, the anonymous person sent most of the surrounding police officers flying with an unseen force. The criminal had shown its face by accident, but no one saw it...except Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was the criminal?</span></div></div>",

He sees that there are many buttons labeled on it. One of them was labeled: ON. \"Seems like the dude forgot to turn on his own invention,\" Sonic chuckled to himself. He could turn it on, or maybe let Tails take a look at it. Then again, he could keep it in his pocket, for later. Or just press them all at once.</span></div></div>",
