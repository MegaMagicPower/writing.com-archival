Since there was nothing to do, he decided to do just that. Nothing. A few minutes after sitting there, he lied down and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, sirens blasted the city with ear-piercing noises. It seemed the police, fire department, and the 911 operators got called to do their job Sonic was already speeding through the city, leaving a blue-blur like trail behind him. He followed the sirens' screech to a burning building; a bank to be exact. \"Heh,\" Sonic laughed, \"Who is in trouble <i>this</i> time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had already burst open the doors, and a shadowy figure stood where the entrance once was. Chaos Emerald in hand, the anonymous person sent most of the surrounding police officers flying with an unseen force. The criminal had shown its face by accident, but no one saw it...except Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was the criminal?</span></div></div>",

He sees that there are many buttons labeled on it. One of them was labeled: ON. \"Seems like the dude forgot to turn on his own invention,\" Sonic chuckled to himself. He could turn it on, or maybe let Tails take a look at it. Then again, he could keep it in his pocket, for later. Or just press them all at once.</span></div></div>",

Bark! Bean! Where are we on getting that vault open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bean is setting the last of the dynamite now Nack.\" Bark replied. \"It'll be about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30 seconds!\" Bean yelled before taking cover behind the reception area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNack and Bark quickly took Bean's lead and hid with him, covering their ears. But when 30 seconds passed, no explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the kaboom?! There was suppose to be a bank shaking kaboom!\" Nack yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean these?\" Came a voice they were very familiar with. They peeked from their hiding spot and saw Sonic at the entrance, a bundle of dynamite with their fuses pulled out laying at his feet. \"Strange way to make a withdraw guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr. Get him!\" Nack yelled before pulling out his gun and firing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic yawned as these guys were predictable. Nack would keep firing until he ran out of ammo, Bark would try using brute force to distract him while Bean secretly lit one of his mini bombs and tossed it into Sonic's blind spot right before he got distracted by the shiny pen on the desk. After knocking out Bark with a well placed chop to the back of the neck, he kick the bomb behind the counter, Nack quickly ran while Bean was caught in the blast, leaving a burnt, passed out but still alive duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not stopping us from a good haul this time hedgehog!\" Nack sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I already did weasel breath.\" Sonic replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see you crack jokes after I pull out the equalizer!\" Nack said as he pulled out a Chaos Emerald. \"Chaos... Control!\" The emerald glowed for a minute before going dull. \"What the?!\" Nack waved the emerald up and down. \"Chaos control! CHAOS Control! CHAOS CONTROL! WHY ISN'T THIS BLASTED THING WORKING?!\" Nack suddenly felt all air leave him as Sonic gut punched him, the shock forcing him to drop the emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Nack, but you were just embarrassing yourself. Now to tie up some loose ends.\" Using his speed, Sonic got Nack, Bark and Bean up near, sitting up and tied with a few velvet ropes. \"Now to let the police finish the-\" He then took note of the Chaos Emerald Nack had. This was a different color than the usual 7 Sonic had seen. \"Looks like a Chaos Emerald, enough to fool Nack. But I need to make sure.\" Sonic then sped out of the bank and away from the city, not without leaving a note on one of the police cars, letting them know it was clear to go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Sonic go see about the Emerald?</span></div></div>",
