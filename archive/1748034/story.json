            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura Friedman sat in her room admiring the view. Her window faced the beach, and she watched as throngs of people laid out their towels on the sand and splashed in the ocean. Though the summer had been particularly hot and the sand literally began at her porch step she hadn't gone down to the beach herself at all this year. The very thought of having to wear any kind of swimsuit turned her stomach; she was 18 years old but could have passed for a 12 year old. Her figure was straight, curve-less and boyish. To make matters worse it was her body that made her the runt of the litter, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister, Vanessa, was very much the opposite of Laura. Vanessa was tall, 5' 10\", with long shapely legs that fed into rounded hips and a slim waist. But the real curves Laura would have killed for sat high on Vanessa's chest. Vanessa wore a 38DD bra and her mouth watering breasts were her trademark asset and she loved to show them off at every opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, Laura's oldest sibling, was an amateur bodybuilder who, over the past few years, had grown his physique to a truly impressive size. He frequently mentioned that he'd likely get his pro card before long. Greg, at 6' 2\", towered nearly a full foot taller than Laura's 5' 4\" and weighed well over double her 105 pound pipsqueak frame. Greg was a 225 pound bulging mass of muscle who never missed a chance to show off his vastly superior strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it was Vanessa and Greg who had followed in their parents genetic footsteps. The heads of the Friedman household had been pinnacles of perfection in their own day as the quintessential cheerleader and jock sweethearts. All of this just made Laura feel more and more out of place as she made her way through her pubescent years awaiting a growth spurt that would never come.  Both her mother and father constantly assured her that her time would come and she would emerge an eventual swan, but by the time her 18th birthday had rolled around it was painfully obvious to Laura that she'd just have to settle with her flat chest and string bean limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now as she surveyed the packed beach her eyes drifted from hot body to hot body and everywhere she felt the sting of envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis,\" came a deep voice from her doorway. She turned to find Greg filling the door frame with his muscled form. \"Nessa and I are headed down to the beach for a bit, would you like to join us?\" Greg was wearing his swim-trunks which were taut over his 30\" thighs. His tank top struggled to contain his 58\" chest, but perfectly showcased his massive shoulders and bulging arms. For a moment Laura wondered what it must feel like to have a body like Greg's; to tower above others and perform feats of strength with ease. Laura craved the kind of power Greg's magnificent muscles brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura snapped out of her reverie and did her best to smile, \"No thanks, I'm just going to hang here for a while today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Greg said, \"If you change your mind you know where to find us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stepped aside and Laura saw that Vanessa had been right behind him, eclipsed by her buff brother.  Again Laura wondered what it must feel like to possess an incredible set of curves, this time the more feminine sort. Vanessa's supermodel quality face was only slightly hidden behind a pair of dark, designer sunglasses, her naturally blond hair swooped down from her head in gentle waves before cascading over her shoulders and down her back. She wore a purple bikini that was covered in glittery sequins, the sort of swimwear that had never been intended for swimming. Her bikini top did very little to cover her large DD cup breasts.  Tied around her hips was a white silk sarong that was shear enough to be see-through. The fabric of her wrap hung loosely down to her luscious legs which were long and flawless with just a hint of muscle tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you don't want to come, Lulu?\" Vanessa asked. Laura used to enjoy this nickname, but lately it served only to point out how she still looked like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" Laura said then turned her attention back to her window trying not to stare at anyone in particular and instead focusing on the ocean in the distance. She waited until she heard the footsteps of her siblings vanish down the hall then she balled her fist and slammed it down on her desk in a combination of anger and frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could look like them,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer on her desk sprang to life displaying an email for an app in the iTunes store.  \"That's odd,\" she said, \"I was pretty sure I turned the computer off last night.\"  She was about to hit the power switch when she noticed the selection in the iTunes store was for an iPhone app called \"Alterations.\"  Her eyes glanced over the short and cryptic item description which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Have you ever wanted to make some alterations to your physical and mental form? Well now you can.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck does that mean?\" she asked aloud before clicking the link. She was brought to the App Store page for the app and she started scanning the user reviews:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Mike B. says: Incredible! Works like MAGIC!!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">sxydiva13 says: I now have the bangin body of my dreams!!! Thank you Alterations!!!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Monster Muscle Man says: DOWNLOAD NOW!!! I was a skeptic until I added 200 POUNDS OF SOLID MUSCLE!!!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't know what to make of this, but decided she at least wanted to see what the heck these people were talking about. She hit the download button and plugged her iPhone in so she could add the app.  Once added she unplugged her phone and tapped the Alterations icon (which looked like a measuring tape and scissors) to launch the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small box appeared on the screen and below it were the words: PRESS THUMB TO BOX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart sank a little since she knew the touch screen had no way of really gathering any kind of fingerprint information, but frankly what did she expect? That feeling vanished however when she touched her thumb to the box because the screen lit up with the words: THANK YOU, LAURA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to dismiss this as the app just pulling her name from her personal info on the phone when a 3D image of her own body appeared on the screen. To make matters more bizarre the Laura on the screen was wearing the exact same clothes that she herself wore, denim pants and a green t-shirt. Laura's heart was racing as she saw a number of buttons surrounding the 3D image with names like \"Height\" and \"Muscle Tone. The bottom of the screen had tabs labeled \"Physical,\" \"Mental,\" \"Misc.,\" and \"More.\" She was currently on the \"Physical\" tab. The top left corner had a red button that read \"Apply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura played with the 3D model finding that she could turn it around and view herself from all angles.  When she pinched out the view zoomed into specific areas of her body which also caused the buttons around the edge of the screen to change.  When she zoomed in on her midsection the buttons read \"Hips\" and \"Waist\" while numbers popped up showing her current measurements (both 30\"). She panned up to her chest and found exactly what she had hoped: a button reading \"Bust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura zoomed out again and clicked on the \"Misc.\" tab.  This brought up a menu with a host of things like \"Hair,\" \"Accessories,\" and \"Tattoos\" amongst other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give myself tattoos?\" The \"More\" tab included an \"Options\" menu and a search function that looked like it would allow her to make changes to others.  She punched in her brother's name and instantly found herself looking at a 3D model of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was simultaneously excited and cautious. As amazing as this app seemed it couldn't actually do what it said it could... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she would...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura went back to the 3D image of herself. After examining herself a little more, she began to randomly zoom in and out different sections on her body. As she came across \u201echest\u201c though, she paused. Laura looked at the close-up image of her plain torso, and the two pitiful measurements the \u201eBust\u201c-button displayed: One in numbers, and one displaying her current cup-size. As she put her thumb on the \u201eA-cup\u201c symbol, a tablet appeared on the screen, showing the whole alphabet from A to Z. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit hesitant, Laura pressed \u201eC\u201c, and then \u201eSave changes\u201c on the bottom. The iPhone loaded a moment, before going back to the 3D image of herself. Despite before however the model sported a small, but noticeable bulge on her chest, straining her green T-shirt a little. 'C-cups', she thought 'Not really large, but still rather decent - probably what most women would like to have.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued to stare at her altered image for a while, smiling a little. With each second that passed however the corners of her mouth sank a little lower, and she began to tap nervously on her iPhone. She zoomed in on her chest again, and called up the menu for cup-sizes. With a shaking thumb, she pressed two times on the \u201eD\u201c, and quickly clicked on \u201eSave changes\u201c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later and an even bustier version of Laura appeared on the screen. Her breasts now were a lot more dominant, and stretched her top so far for her belly to look out. \u201eThere, double D!\u201c, she exclaimed \u201eThe same size as Vanessa! That should do it.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn\u2019t even take a minute before she was back at the cup-size-tablet, this time putting her finger on the \u201eE\u201d. When the image of herself appeared, she could see her chest was a little larger than before, and her shirt had wandered slightly higher. \u201eE-cup, a slight hunch above Vanessa. Something I\u2019d absolutely be happy with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at her blown-up 3D model for a moment. \u201eAh, screw it!\u201d, she finally said, changing her cup-size to double H. The iPhone needed a little longer to load this time. As the image of herself appeared again, it showed Laura with breasts larger than her head, covering the sight on most of her upper-body. Her shirt had risen up to her bosom, showing a massive under-cleavage, while the fabric lay skin-tight on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping a little, Laura turned the 3D model around. From the side, her breasts were twice as wide as the rest of her body, although her shirt constrained them a little. Even from the back view she could clearly see her vast bustline. Laura tilted the image a little further, looking at the rift between her boobs from below, before going back to the normal view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking on some other regions she made a few more changes to herself \u2013 a slightly slimmer waist, some more curves on her lower end \u2013 before placing her thumb above the \u201eApply\u201d-button. \u201eNothing will happen\u201d, she assured herself \u201eWhat do I expect to happen anyway?\u201d She could barely hide her excitement though when she put her thumb on the touchscreen, watching as another loading screen popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Laura sat in her room, impatiently waiting for something to happen. When the loading symbol disappeared though and she still looked the same, the hope inside her gradually faded. \u201eI\u2019m so stupid\u201d, she sighed, putting her iPhone on the table. \u201eDid I really think there was an app that could-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a strong sensation surged through the young woman. Feeling uncomfortable on her chair Laura quickly stood up, her whole body prickling from the inside. Glancing down on herself Laura\u2019s eyes nearly popped out when she saw a hump forming beneath her shirt, stretching the fabric a little. \u201cOh my god!\u201d, she screamed, almost falling unconscious from the shock. \u201cOh my god, oh my god, oh my god! It works! It really, REALLY works!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she felt the soft mounds filling out her shirt she noticed the other changes she applied also started to take effect: Slowly and steadily Laura\u2019s waist was diminishing, her new slimness soon causing her pants to sink down a litte. Each inch she lost on her waist seemed to be added to her hips as they were flaring out, stopping her falling trousers. At the same time her legs were also gaining a bit more sex appeal, making her a bit taller in the process. Achieving a quite feminine curvature, Laura also felt her inconspicuous buttocks blowing up inside her pants. The feeling of her firm rump pressing against the fabric teased Laura to pinch herself, but another sensation occupied her attention already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing to grapefruit-size, her breasts steadily conquered the space inside her shirt. Laura noticed not only their size was rising, but they were also getting more sensitive. Feeling urges she never had before Laura blushed, moaning softly as her bosom filled out her top. And they filled it out nicely, cause alongside sensitivity and size, the firmness of her meat buns was increasing as well, just like her butt\u2019s. Growing to full spheres her breasts slightly fell on her body, but kept a solid stand despite the lack of a bra. Her shirt was rising up her belly just like the iPhone picture had shown it, Laura fighting her arousal down a little as she felt a great event was about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she watched her breasts grow out from her body, she also took a quick look at what was going on beyond it: The process on her lower end had mainly stopped, leaving Laura with a form that stood in no shame to her sister\u2019s. Her pants were in a little misery, as on one side they were too small for her new waist, which was resting perfectly on the line between \u201cslim\u201d and \u201cmeager\u201d. At the same time however, they were also too small for her endowed hips and butt, their struggle not to break emphasising Laura\u2019s new curves quite nicely. Her pants had still sunken deep enough to uncover a part of her white panties, and as it was stretching her undergarments a little, also a small excerpt of her firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at herself Laura then eagerly she noticed her breasts were entering the DD-area. \u201cCome one\u201d, she whispered, shaking her fists in excitement. Her firm mounds took their time however, slowly straining her top as they grew larger. Laura thought an eternity had passed before the moment finally arrived she had been waiting for. \u201cYes! YES!\u201d Laughing like a maniac she began to jump up and down, the jiggling of her bosom causing her top to stretch even more. \u201cI am bigger than my sister! I am FINALLY bigger than Vanessa!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot startled by their owner\u2019s behaviour, her breasts continued to expand. Overcome by pleasure and joy the young woman shivered in arousal, each additional pound of body mass increasing her excitement. The weight of her milkjugs began to drag on Laura\u2019s shoulders, though its firmness still lacked competition, even from lower weight-classes. Her entire belly had been uncovered by then, and her shirt was losing the contact to her body as her breasts dragged it up. The free room was quickly filled out though, and by the time they reached the size of her head her breasts had taken up the whole shirt, pushing its fabric to the limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt her shirt being pulled over her sensitive bosom, revealing it in all its growing glory. She knew if she opened her mouth now she would moan, so she quietly watched the last phase of her growth, her sight on the ground steadily diminishing. Leaving G-cups behind they blew up to volleyball-size, though the tightness of her skirt now hid their true size a little. The squeeze inside the fabric was additionally tearing her willpower, Laura really having trouble not to fall into a loud ecstasy from the sensations her balloon bust caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her body was a perfect duplicate of her 3D model the expansion finally ended, leaving Laura with an impossibly proportioned body. With wide eyes the young woman gazed down on herself, carefully putting her hands on her breasts. Part of her hands were touching its bare parts, and as she came into contact with her skin, Laura was really struggling to keep herself still. \u2018Does Vanessa have those problems, too?\u2019, she wondered. She refused to let go of her monstrous bust however, giggling a little. \u201cMy god, I can\u2019t believe this is real. Please let it be real! And if this is a dream \u2013 let me never wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past her vast bustline Laura then spotted her iPhone, lying peacefully on the table. She was already darn happy with what it had done for her, but also knew she had just scratched on its possibilities. With such a powerful device in hands, what will she do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura lifted her breasts, feeling the weight of her new chest. Smooth skin matching the soft fabric of her shirt, Laura was in heaven. Running her hands over her boobs, she glances back to the table. The iPhone rests where she left it, before the transformation began. Laura walked back to her phone, taking it to examine the program again. The model resembled her, waiting for more modifications. \u2018I wonder what some of the larger sizes would look like,\u2019 she considered while scrolling through the menu, searching for the \u2018Bust\u2019 button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHH cup became the default. Laura looked down at her chest before returning her gaze to the screen. She pulled the slider back to her original A cup. The chest on the model shrank down, allowing the shirt to rest against her, covering her chest and stomach. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I used to look like, so what about this?\u201d She moved her finger past H, past J, past L, and past O. Moving her finger cautiously over the letter P, she presses it three times. The program takes a few seconds to load; then the chest on the model begins swelling, growing bigger and bigger. The top stretches, clinging like a second skin, as the 3D Laura\u2019s breasts continue to grow. Eventually they stop, resting against her stomach, supported by her shirt. She moved her thumb over the \u2018Apply\u2019 button. \u201cAlright girls, let\u2019s see how you like this?\u201d She pressed the \u2018Apply\u2019 button, and a loading screen appeared. \u201cOh, I guess I\u2019ve got a little bit before they grow again,\u201d she mumbled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands back on her chest, Laura looked at how her shirt was holding out. Her breasts were filling it out, but the neck was still pretty tight. She pulled down on the bottom hem of the fabric, pulling it tighter on her tits. Cleavage pushed out of the neck, but it would not stay down. At the other end of the table was a pair of scissors. Laura picked them up and began some alterations to her top. The cotton was easy enough to cut through; taking a handful and pulling it away from her skin and placing the scissors carefully to the fabric. The scissors rested gently in her bosom, the pressure from her chest pushing the scissors into the shirt. It made Laura think that her breasts were urging the blade to make more room. Closing the blades and slicing the fabric, her chest accepted the extra room, swelling gently from the release in pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put down the scissors and placed her hands on the bottom of the shirt once more. Pulling down, Laura could easily position her shirt, moving the exposed skin to the top. \u2018Now,\u2019 she thought, giving herself an inch hanging down and several inches of exposed cleavage, \u2018that\u2019s better.\u2019 Admiring the alterations, Laura begins to feel the tingle returning to her body. Looking at her phone, the loading screen has finished and Laura knows what\u2019s coming next. The increased sensations cause her to fall forward onto the table, resting on her chest. Her boobs flatten out against the surface, jiggling from the inertia of forward motion. As she comes to a rest, Laura notices her boobs are still moving, but more outward than inward with every pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her body off the table, Laura runs her hands through her hair. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it. Bigger. Grow bigger!\u201d Her chest took the extra inch she made in the shirt back as it continued to grow. Her swollen melons inched forward, deepening the gap between them. \u201cI\u2019ve need make more room,\u201d she grabbed the V in her shirt and began to tear a few more inches. Her breasts began to hang slightly, cradled in her split t-shirt. A small bounce threw Laura backward, bracing her body against the table. The sensations that ran through her made her eyes roll backward, breathe heavily, and caused her heart to beat faster. \u201cAlright, *pant*, almost done\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the growth came to a stop, there stood Laura, with breasts that could be mistaken for small beachballs. She placed her hands over them, still wishing that she could believe this. The green cloth stretched, becoming much thinner. She could see her skin through the fabric, and only imagined that she would be able to see her nipples right through it. The feeling of the material added to her sensation: as it pressed her orbs together, as her nipples stretched it outward, and as it molded her flesh into a vision that would make any man weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, I used to be tiny. Then I trimmed my waist, filled my butt, and grew my breasts till I was almost twice my sister\u2019s size. Then I pumped my breasts even bigger. I guess the next thing I should do is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Laura was not disappointed when she saw the virtual boobs grow. They grew and grew, causing her cut-up shirt to completely rip and expose her boobs, where her bra had already snapped. She was hesitant to click apply at first,but once she saw how gargantuan they would become, she clicked apply in a heartbeat. The sensation she felt before returned, and they grew massively. Laura began to feel aroused by their size, but she realized she could do SO much more with her body when they were done growing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Triple P was one hell of a cup-size, and her slightly bulkier rump did those little beach balls more than justice. So, Laura decided to settle with her current sizes(for now, at least). As she looked at her plain green shirt though and the simple jeans that covered her curves, she found this kind of clothes wasn\u2019t really suiting her anymore, no matter how tight they were and how much cleavage they displayed. No, somebody as hot and sexy as her deserved more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Laura moved her top-heavy body around, looking for the phone. She had put it on the table before taking the scissors, but now that her sight was\u2026 slightly handicapped it took a while before she found it again. Carefully Laura took a step forward, leaning backwards to keep herself from falling forward while reaching her arm out for the phone. Just as she was about to lose balance she grabbed it, and quickly returned to her original position. Waggling around Laura tried to bring herself back into balance, her breasts bouncing as much as her constricting top would allow them. Once she stood relatively secure again Laura wanted to put the phone in front of her face, but realised that handling it this way would be a bit tough now that her breasts almost reached up to her chin. Turning her head she looked sidewards on her phone, trying to maintain her balance as she navigated through its menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the section for \u201cAccessories\u201d she finally found a clothes option. \u201cKind of a weird place for it\u201d, she murmured, clicking on it. Several tabs appeared on the side of the screen: in fact, it were so many that her phone was barely able to still show her 3D image, shrinking it down to half the size. At first, Laura couldn\u2019t make much of the options: They were reading stuff like \u201cstitching\u201d and \u201ccolor\u201d, but it seemed she couldn\u2019t click on them. When she pressed her thumb on her 3D image the tabs suddenly shrunk and it grew to its original size again. Also, her clothes had gotten a white line around them, and there were also lines on the place where her panties were located. She clicked on her top, but again, nothing happened. As she held her thumb on it for a bit longer the tabs on the side grew again, and the image of herself shrunk except for her top. After a while she finally realised she had to drag the clothes from her body to one of the tabs on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Laura walked over to a nearby chair, balancing the piles of flesh on her front. She bent her upper-body forward as cautiously as possible, her slightly hanging breasts dragging her cleavage deeper, before she filled out the chair with her bonny buttocks. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u201d, she said to herself, trying to lean against the backrest. Her bust slightly fell on her labs once she sat relatively straight, Laura still having to hold the phone next to her as she continued to play around with it. With her thumb she moved her top over the tabs until it was hovering above the \u201ccolour\u201d option. Releasing her thumb a large image of her shirt appeared on the screen, and beneath it a box in the same colour. As she clicked on the green box a large colour wheel popped up, alongside a regulator for brightness. She changed the colour from green to pink, then pushed the brightness up to the maximum. Clicking on the box in the bottom again the settings disappeared, and the image of her top had become glaring pink. \u201cNot bad\u201d, she told herself \u201cBut how can I give myself a new top?\u201d Going back to the menu she played around with some other options, changing the material from \u201ccotton\u201d to \u201clatex\u201d, and slightly increased its size. Finally she found what she was looking for: Under the section \u201ctrim\u201d she found two tools, a scissor and a needle. With the scissor, it seemed she could remove any part of her top just by moving her finger over the screen, while in the same manner she could add fabric with the needle. Practically, she could change her shirt into anything from a winter jacket to a bikini top \u2013 Laura would have preferred a simpler tool where she could just pick the kind of clothes she wanted, but then again was she really in the position to complain about an add that had just been magically downloaded onto her phone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she knew how the tabs worked Laura couldn\u2019t wait to get seriously started: She loved being creative, and becoming a famous designer had always been her dream. Going back to her 3D image she first erased all the clothes she currently wore by dragging them onto a tab called \u201cDelete.\u201d After adoring the image of her naked, massive self she clicked on a small button in the bottom left that read \u201cNew\u201d, and a plain white T-shirt appeared on her body. \u2018I should start from the scratch\u2019, she thought, and began to move the shirt through the individual sections. After a lot of editing she had changed it into a frilly black bra, its massive cups looking like they could actually hold her mesmerizing mammaries. Putting it back on her 3D image the bra automatically adjusted itself, lying snug on her model\u2019s bust. A bit later and she had also created a pair of fitting panties (or rather a thong), an extremely tiny white mini-skirt hanging deep on her waist, a tight sleeveless red top that showed no cleavage but her whole belly, and a pair of brown leather boots which went up to her knees, just so nothing of her firm thighs would be hidden. Laura looked at the image of herself, examining it from all ankles. \u201cI look like a whore\u201d, she giggled \u201cA  super-sexy whore with damn huge tits!\u201d She wanted to play around more with the phones settings, but then her current outfit would be gone. As if it had read her mind a large text box suddenly appeared on the phone. \u201cTo save your settings just click with your thumb twice on any free field of the screen.\u201d A bit confused by the sudden pop-up Laura did as it told her. Another text-box appeared and asked if she wanted to save her current settings. Laura pressed \u201cyes.\u201d The phone needed a small moment to save, but once it was done a small load-tab appeared on the bottom right corner on the screen. Upon clicking on it Laura found she could return to that outfit any time simply by clicking on it. Also, as there were two empty boxes next to the one with her slut-suit, she guessed the app was able to save three different settings at once. Laura, still dressed in her old torn clothes thought for a second if she should just click \u201capply\u201d, but decided she should first see if she could come up with something better. \u201cOnly the best is good enough for my babies\u201d, she smirked, patting her bust. A pleasurable tingle erupted from the place where she touched herself, Laura softly stroking her bosom as she continued to play around with the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had almost sunken below the horizon when she was finally done. Her eyes were itching from looking at the small screen for such a long time, but she still proudly admired the results of her work: For once, she had made a few more adjustments to her whore-outfit with the help of some other functions. She had given herself some make-up and lip-sticks as well as a pair of earrings, bracelets and a chain tied around her waist. Also, her skirt was even shorter than before, and she had crafted a gap into the front of her top that was held together by four straps, only slightly obstructing the view on her cleavage. Her bra she had changed so that it wouldn\u2019t be seen through the rift, but still support her humongous milkjugs. After looking at the slinky picture of herself a bit longer she clicked on the load button, and examined the next outfit. Her 3D image was now dressed in a tiny black evening dress with matching high-heels and stockings. If it was even possible the skirt was even shorter than that of her other outfit, ending just below her butt so not the slightest of her thighs would be covered by it. No holders were lying on her shoulders, neither from her dress nor from a bra, the lack of support clearly visibly at the nipples that proudly shined through the fabric. As it was only held by her bust her dress left a large amount of cleavage to look at, slightly pressing into her skin without demolishing the roundness of her breasts. The fabric firmly underlined her voluptuous curves as well as the slimness of her waist.  Seeing herself in the dress Laura shook from head to toe, and hardly rubbed her bosom. No matter how much she marveled at her mammoth of a chest, she just couldn\u2019t get enough. Setting her eyes back on the screen she then loaded the last outfit she had prepared: An orange bikini with a yellow flower pattern that took her hours to create. From all her outfits it was the most revealing, not just because it was a bikini, it was even for a bikini quite revealing: The top of it didn\u2019t cup her breasts like a bra, but just covered two small triangle-shaped areas around her nipples, which were  shining through even stronger than through her dress. The bottom part meanwhile could be hardly considered as clothing anymore, being just a string between her ample buttocks held by a string around her waist, with a small piece of fabric covering the front.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling upon her work Laura checked the time. Greg and Vanessa hadn\u2019t returned yet, so she guessed they had gone to the hotel\u2019s bar by now. After years of standing in their shadows Laura wanted to rub their noses in her new curves as soon as possible. The question was just how she would present them? It was allowed to enter to the bar inside a bikini, even if it was as slinky as hers. Of course she could also proof a little more style and walk in with her sexy black cocktail dress. Or should she leave all grace aside and just enter as a big, busty slut? Sunken in such thoughts Laura looked through the outfits she had created, trying to make a decision. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura picked up the iPhone and viewed the app that was still on the screen. The image idling waiting to be modified again, the buttons begging to be pushed. Laura set down the phone and unbuttoned her jeans. She tried to pull them down, but they were very tight against her thighs and butt. Struggling, she finally manages to get her bottom out of her pants, leaving the round rear covered by her white panties. Laura threw the jeans over toward the bathroom and picked up the phone once more. The image changed, with it\u2019s Laura in a green top and now white panties. The jeans were no longer in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumbing over the sections, she finds the lower section selection tools. The image on the phone zoomed toward her lower body, framing from her waist to her feet. First she adjusted the bar associated with her butt. Her thumb working it\u2019s way forward, as the image swelled out, inch-by-inch. Trying to find the right amount to balance her impressive chest, Laura stops after she adds ten extra inches. She looked over the picture and like the size, \u201cbut it looks like I\u2019ve got a weird ass?\u201d Moving to the thigh selection, Laura adjusts the slider, widening her hips along with them, rounding out below the waist. The modification was looking good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pressed the \u201cApply\u201d button, waiting for the curser to pop up. It processed, and thought, and made it\u2019s little noises. She put down the phone and sat in the chair next to her. Laura leaned back and rest her eyes for a few minutes. The few minutes lasted longer than she imagined, and Laura is brought back by the feeling of her butt starting to expand. She tried to look past her swollen chest at her now swelling butt. It lifted her an extra inch off the chair, still spreading outward. Laura smiled as her cheeks passed the edge of the chair, spilling off to the sides. She stood up, grabbing both cheeks and squeezing them. Her fingers adjusted her panties, trying to cover as much of the swelling flesh. The feeling from the growth caused her legs to go numb, as she stumbled forward, landing on the couch face down. Her breasts splayed to either side, making her arm movements more difficult as she tried to reposition herself. Her ass was almost there, just a few more inches to go. She still tried to keep her panties over her cheeks, but by now it was no use. Her butt just pulled them in, and the waistband was beginning to be pulled downward. Eventually her underwear was doing very little to cover anything. The growth slowed and came to a stop, leaving her ass sticking almost two feet away from her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to stand, Laura felt the added weight from her ass pulling backward. She landed back on the couch. \u201cOh no way! Well this sucks,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to fix that\u2026\u201d Her finger hovers over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tThe breast button. A heavier chest will help balance her.<br>\r\n2.\tThe muscle button. Some increased strength will help her with carrying her bigger curves.<br>\r\n3.\tThe breast and butt buttons. She needs to be bigger all over. She\u2019ll get the size right eventurally.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With some struggling, Laura managed to stand, staggering a bit as her frontal and <br>\r\nrear curves wobbled and jiggled about wildly.  She grinned at the sensation of all <br>\r\nher newly bloated flesh, reaching her hands back to her near beachball buttcheeks <br>\r\nand squeezing them, her milky, warm ass-blubber bulging out from between her <br>\r\nfingers.  \"Niiiiice,\" she said aloud, supressing the urge to do a booty-wiggle, <br>\r\nremembering her equilibrium issues.   She took a few small, experimental steps, <br>\r\ngasping mousily at the new sensation of her thighs rubbing together with the <br>\r\nslightest leg movement; there was a growing wetness between her legs, as well.  <br>\r\nBeing big felt _awesome_.   She couldn't wait to show her brother and sister what a <br>\r\n_real_ woman looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, still, she couldn't do so if she was falling over with every other step. Laura <br>\r\nthen nearly fell backward again, having to bend over and wave her arms about wildly <br>\r\nto avoid slamming onto the floor with her uber-rump.  She opened up the iphone, and <br>\r\nbegan to think, gently swaying her widened, fleshy hips from side to side.  \"Maybe <br>\r\nI just need more front-weight,\" she thought, grinning--even if it didn't solve her <br>\r\nbalance issues, being bustier was hardly something she could see herself <br>\r\nregretting. With that,she set her \"bust\" setting up several cup sizes, thumbing the <br>\r\n\"plus\" button several times and hitting \"apply\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pleased grunt, she felt her breasts engorge, going from soccer balls to <br>\r\nwatermelons, and beyond.  Her green top begean to tear down the middle, her now <br>\r\nnearly shotglass sized nipples poking out from the material loudly.  The sensation <br>\r\nof growth was delicious; a tingly, slightly numbing feeling, followed by a <br>\r\ndelicious, heavy weight, all of which was her own body.  With a soft moan, her <br>\r\nbreasts finished bloating, stopping at small beachball size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was sweating now, still sporting a happy, euphoric grin on her face as she <br>\r\nreached forward to grasp her re-expanded tits.  \"There, balanced,\" she thought, <br>\r\nflushing out the nagging, likely-true suspicion that she'd just used this as an <br>\r\nexcuse to blow up her boobs more.  She took a few more steps forward, finding that <br>\r\nshe was now leaning back a bit to avoid falling _forward_ now--not to the mention <br>\r\nthe flesh tsunamis that every footfall caused were now an issue to her staying <br>\r\nupright.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few poses in the mirror and a few attempts at walk at a \"brisk\" pace, the <br>\r\nbloated Laura flumped backon her bed; tit, ass, and thigh flesh sent jostling and <br>\r\nrippling, making her moan out loud at the delicious sensation.  After tucking an <br>\r\nerrant super-tit back into its place under her failing top, she decided she needed <br>\r\na different solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the iPhone, she found the \"muscle/strength\" options.  After a <br>\r\nminute or two of searching through sub menus, she found back strength and leg <br>\r\nstrength, upping the available settings a few times, before finding an \"appearance\" <br>\r\noption, settling on the \"padded/Sumo\" category. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes something,\" she said, clicking \"Apply\".   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral rubbery, swelling noises rang out through her body; her thighs swelled <br>\r\nslightly, becoming firmer and harder underneath the layers of womanly pudge, her <br>\r\nback following suit.  Even her arms got in the act, becoming slightly thicker and <br>\r\nbulkier; it was like being worked by an expert masseuse; only a _lot_ more <br>\r\npleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, she attempted to stand.   And flipped up onto her feet <br>\r\neffortlessly.  Her tit and rump flesh still danced and rippled deliciously, but now <br>\r\nshe felt confidently limber, even cat like supporting all this new weight.  \"Oh <br>\r\n_nice_!\" she said aloud, prancing stupidly about the room first, then doing an <br>\r\nimpromptu booty-dance in front of her mirror, watching her mega-ass jostle and <br>\r\ncheek-clap beyond even rap-video caliber expertise.  Laura was _strong_ now; her <br>\r\nthicker thighs still bore that jello-like chub, but beneath several inches of that <br>\r\nwas swollen, rock hard and powerful muscle, and lifting her new 20 something pounds <br>\r\nof tit-meat was effortless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was now ready to show off at the beach, but wasn't entirely sure she was done <br>\r\n_just_ yet...it wouldn't do to be recognized by her now not-so-big sister and <br>\r\nbrother, so she decided a few more alterations were in order to make herself <br>\r\nunrecognizable...maybe even some mental changes....<br>\r\n15 minutes later, vanessa and Greg (along with all their friends) looked agog as a <br>\r\nmassive stranger strutted and jiggled onto the beach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.  Laura made herself over six feet tall, darkly tanned, and with big, bulging <br>\r\nporn star lips, calling herself \"Marissa\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.  Laura gives herself several trashy tattoos and adds nipple piercings, perhaps <br>\r\nunwisely changing her personality to be aggressive, shameless and an overdrive-level-<br>\r\nlibido.  She calls herself \"Juleen\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC.  Laura bumped up her T and A even more, gave herself a nerdy pair of glasses, curly blonde hair, and a deep Southern accent, with a slight bump to her shamelessness level.  Her new alias is \"Misty\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura nimbly walked her massive frame across her bedroom and sat down at the desk. The chair creaked and groaned under the weight of her added feminine bulk as Laura continued to fine-tune her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with the height slider. <i>What\u2019s the point of being the biggest if I still have to look up at people?</i> She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura watched intently as the model version of her on the screen changed. The added inches pulled her skin even tighter. Even on the small iPhone screen Laura could see the bulges of powerful muscles lying just beneath her soft, supple curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped at 6\u20192\u201d, the same height as her brother, but soon pulled her finger further to the right as a mischievous grin crept across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Better go a little bit taller</i>, she thought to herself. <i>Can\u2019t wear heels on the beach, after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura then tapped the skin tone menu, ready to give herself a golden tan and end her propensity to blotch and burn once and for all. When she opened it, she saw a subsection for tanlines. Laura couldn\u2019t put it in words, but she found the teasing suggestiveness of tanlines to be downright erotic. With a few taps and drags her breasts and groin obtained a rich Hawaiian Tropic tan while the rest of her skin continued to darken to the color of Turkish coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout noticing, Laura had reached around her mammoth breasts, slid her hand to her crotch and begun fingering herself with one hand while she continued the work the app with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her building orgasm as a guide, Laura meticulously went through every slider and sub-menu, crafting each and every aspect of herself into a veritable sex goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blonde hair lengthened to the small of her back and changed from wispy and fair to a thick, lustrous mane the color of pure gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZooming in on her new face, Laura saw her cheekbones push out and her nose taper as she took on the looks of a genetically gifted supermodel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips swelled and pouted to sensual perfection without the lumpy, bloated look of plastic surgery. She even made her tongue a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept editing her appearance, Laura\u2019s lust for herself grew with each stroke of her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Laura came to the last section of the app\u2019s long list of changeable attributes: personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m a whole new me,\u201d Laura said trying to hold off her climax a bit longer, \u201cI might as well go all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute Laura had completely rewritten her behavior. She set her demeanor to highly dominant and pushed the confidence slider all the way up. Already feeling more like her new persona, Laura tweaked the compassion slider to give herself a slight dose of cruelty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in one final change, she set the libido slider as high as it would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more Laura Friedman,\u201d she groaned in overflowing pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me Marissa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura mashed her thumb on the apply button, bucking and writhing in the orgasmic rush of complete physical and mental transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell is Laura,\u201d Greg bellowed in annoyance. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that said we should go to the beach today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa rolled her eyes and tried her best to ignore her brother\u2019s complaining. He was probably coming down to the beach anyways so he could be fawned over by giggling teenage airheads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa scanned the shore looking for anyone resembling her sister. She soon noticed a sizable crowd gathering at the boardwalk. The two walked closer and saw one of those gaudy Hummer limos pulled up on the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back door swung open and out stretched the longest, thickest legs Vanessa had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd audibly gasped as more and more of this goddess revealed herself: Hips and ass like an oversized fertility idol. Breasts larger than most of the inflatable pool toys littering the beach. An impossibly voluptuous shape further accentuated by a deep flawless skintone and tanlines that draw the eye past the unbelievable roundness of her breasts above and point like an arrow down to her pussy below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a gorgeous face capped by perfect blowjob lips and a shimmering mane of pure gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd stared on in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman wore a vinyl string bikini in a bright pink color that perfectly complimented her dusky skin; with lips, eyelids and nails to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny suit would\u2019ve looked daring on someone even Vanessa\u2019s size, but on this woman it was almost obscene. Her ebony areola shown all around the edges of the cups, which were tented by erect nipples bigger than her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, she wore an assortment of expensive gold jewelry an even a large gemstone than hung from a pink patent leather choker pulled tight around her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a cross between a comic book super heroine and a porn star dominatrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarissa surveyed the awestruck crowd while she straightened the straps on her diminutive swimsuit. Before the beach, she had hit a few of the ritzy boutiques nearby. With her forceful personality and raw sex appeal she was able to coerce people into giving her whatever she wanted; including several hundred dollars in jewelry and limo service for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarissa grinned as she spied her prey and walked over, parting the swarm of mesmerized gawkers in her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa froze in her tracks and found herself shying away as the mystery woman came closer.

She had done her personality alterations first, <br>\r\nwhich led to more and more brazen changes--not the least of which was her libido <br>\r\nand her modesty--or, currently, utter lack thereof.  \"Juleen\" had grown herself to <br>\r\nnearly six feet in height, given herself hoop-style nipple piercings on each <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthumb-thick nip, a tramp stamp tattoo above her brobdingagian butt, and various <br>\r\ndragon and flame tattoos on her upper back, not to mention a huge tattoo of fire <br>\r\naround her crotch--which was apt given what she's done to her libido; her sex felt <br>\r\nfeverishly hot and wet--the objective segments of her brain could now do little to <br>\r\nreign in her new, overwhelming desire to get laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remnants of her original personality giggled a bit--she would never, even with <br>\r\nthis feminine monolith of a body, been such a harlot--Juleen bounced, jostled and <br>\r\njiggled proudly down the beach, attracting stares from _everyone_, male and female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She's hastily put her long, blond hair in a high ponytail,  to make herself appear <br>\r\neven taller and more imposing.  The magic iPhone had conjured up for her new <br>\r\npersona a very, very skimpy black bikini, the top barely covering her enlarged <br>\r\naureola, and made obvious the presence of her nipple rings; the indentations <br>\r\ntenting obscenely against the fabric; her bottom was a ringed thong little number, <br>\r\nthe metal ring at the top of her ass crack and the decency-ensuring triangle <br>\r\ncovering her sex where just about the only evidence that she was wearing _anything_ <br>\r\nbelow the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiloting this new body and new personality was a bit like being on partial <br>\r\nautopilot; no feelings of shyness came when Laura would have expected them to, and <br>\r\nthe strutting and foul-mouthedness(as well as foul thoughts) just flooded in and <br>\r\nflooded out, as if she was a kind of spectator within her own body.  It just felt <br>\r\n_natural_ to be this way, and it felt _good_.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Vanessa and Greg among the oggling audience, and grinned squarely in her <br>\r\nbrother's direction.  \"I'll give that meathead somethin' to stare at,\" she thought, <br>\r\ncatching herself oggling him back--and strangely, no feelings of disgust at the <br>\r\nsensation of finding him hot and fuckable--he was, after all, the biggest, beefiest <br>\r\nstud on the beach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura/Juleen wobbled and smacked her way up to Greg, stopping with her tits only a <br>\r\nfew inches from his face, the heat coming off of her beachball sized milkers no <br>\r\ndoubt palpable against his face. \"Hi, cutie,\" she said, \"Hope you don't mind if I <br>\r\nlay down here.\"  Before Greg could nod an approval, Juleen put down her towel next <br>\r\nto the pair, obnoxiously close, and flopped down on her front, her monstrous <br>\r\nsuper-tits bulging lewdly out from either side of her torso.  She smiled; a casual <br>\r\nglance confirmed Vanessa's envious stare.  That smile turned into a full out grin <br>\r\nas she reached back and undid her top, making her bulbous tits ooze out even more.<br>\r\nShe turned to Greg, handing him a bottle of suntan lotion, \"Oil me up, stud?\" she <br>\r\nsaid, again without waiting for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juleen,\" she said, smiling as she felt greasy hands slop on her back and work it, <br>\r\n\"I'm Juleen--be sure to get my ass, too,\"  Laura wiggled her overstuffed rump a <br>\r\nlittle.vanessa was still staring, flabbergasted, as her muscly brother oiled up the fleshy <br>\r\nbehemoth, hands drifting timidly southward, blinking as the swollen newcomer egged <br>\r\nGreg on almost immediately,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work my huge butt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More oil, c'mon, it's a _big_ fuckin' ass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deeper...get into the crack, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deeper, stud...it's not gonna eat yr hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was resting his conspicuously tight speedo against her plush, warm cheek now, <br>\r\nand taking pains not to grind against her rump-blubber;  Laura then spied her <br>\r\nsister rolling her eyes in a look of disgust that could only be born out of envy; <br>\r\nturning over on her beach towel to look away from the the huge Juleen-monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.  Laura rolls over, \"accidentally\" pinning Greg under her butt, and smothering <br>\r\nVanessa under her naked tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.

Juleen grinned, and popped out her Soothsayer, resting it on her bulging, chin-smothering cleavage.   \u201cTime to go all-out nasty,\u201d she thought, bringing up the sliding meters for personality, and toggling all the lascivious ones all the way to the right:  Libido.

Everything that even looked liked it would amp up her already obnoxious personality was maxed out, and then she clicked the \u201cExecute\u201d button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuleen blinked, eyes wide, as her brain seemed to gurgle and rumble, her lips slowly curling into a broad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna go into the changing stall and fuck?\u2019 she asked, casually, bouncing her butt impatiently in front of Greg\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErh\u2026what?\u201d he murmured, blinking\u2014oily butt-rubbing stopping for a moment as he paused to make sure he\u2019d really heard her request right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuleen groaned impatiently, and stood up, her bare breasts rippling and jostling in the sun.  \u201cI asked ya if y\u2019wanted to go into the changing room and fuck me, dumbass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuleen stepped closer to, and then over her now not-so-big brother, jiggling about her immense bust and rump with even the slightest movement, and then forcibly squatted down, and sat on his crotch, his swimtrunk-concealed erection slipping lewdly into her vast rear-cleavage.  Half the beach had, by now, noticed the topless sex-titan, and were staring at this sluttishly over-tattooed, over-endowed blonde hussy, some of the male-half of her audience offering up wolf whistles and lewder calls of encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr,\u201d she said, grinning down at her pinned, muscly brother, \u201cWe could just fuck right here,\u201d she reached a hand behind her back, and managed to snag the waistband of Greg\u2019s shorts, pulling them down enough to make his erect, hot and hard member flop out.

Work my ass with y\u2019r tits, or maybe I could eat you out while I ride y\u2019r brother..\u201d  She shivered, and pumped Greg\u2019s impressive length twice more, her juice loudly spraying about either side of his hips.  \u201cUp to you, shortie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to slowly, torturously pump her hips up and down, fucking Gregg in the most elongated, show-offish manner possible, keeping the embarrassed hunk aroused and hard for as long as possible, smiling happily at the stares she was attracting from the other beach goers..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuleen flipped open the phone for a moment, riding the high of euphoric hyper-arousal and brazenness, toggling the height dials to seven feet, five inches, the bust dial from beachballs to beanbag chair-size, and simply hitting the \u201c+\u201d button on the hips/butt field until her thumb felt fatigued.  Before hitting \u201cexecute\u201d, she spied another options box containing a control labeled \u201cpheromones\u201d, and pulled it to the 80 percent max spot before jamming the enter button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.\tJuleen grows larger, as does the pornographic scene she\u2019s the centerpiece of\u2014large enough that the police are called.

She had always dreamed about becoming stronger than her sibling, in fact she had always dreamed about being equally as gifted in terms of muscles as she was in terms of breasts. Adjusting the sliders, she pressed the 'Apply' button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sensation started to fill her body. A sensation that felt SOOOOOOO GOOOOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, Vanessa could hear the ominous sound of her shirt starting to rip as first her breasts, shoulders and then her upper arms were growing. All Vanessa could do was moaning as she felt her bones and muscles expand. Looking down her expanding figure she could see her calves and thighs sported a lot more of definition already and had gained about twenty-five percent in mass. Another deep moan escaped her full lips, this was amazing to watch. She was rubbing her swelling body with wanton lust and everything her hand brushed across seemed to expand at her touch. Her breasts were swelling like mad and firm, toned muscles expanded over her arms and legs. She felt her already enormous breasts grow even larger, as her finger-tips felt her already fit abs were now also gaining more definition and seemed to get harder by the second.<br>\r\nVanessa chuckled satisfied, before grunting as her back hardened and enlarged. Her already perfect butt firmed and toned even more while her by now sizable biceps swelled still larger.<br>\r\nThe blonde bombshell giggled in joy as she crossed her arms under her prodigious breasts and watched herself, and them, swell even larger, her succulent orbs were becoming even larger in proportion. Her toned body was gaining even more muscle and her considerable biceps were pumping. And still their growth continued.<br>\r\nVanessa watched in wonder as her already impressive figure only ballooned further. She gasped and moaned as her head rocketed upward and her wonderous breasts seem to avalanche outward were growing so large that the space between them was quickly narrowing. Her hips didn't become much wider, but her legs toned up to amazing degree.  Her body was far from being done with growing. Even faster than before her legs were gaining size and definition, with thighs and calves taking on true bodybuilding proportions. Her shirt was pushed to the limit, as her by now massive chest muscles and breasts expanded further. Finally, the shirt was torn apart, as Vanessa\u2019s torso continued to expand in all directions. Another deep moan escaped her, as her thighs were taking on gargantuan proportions as muscle group after muscle group expanded. There was a short break, right before the last and strongest growth spurt. Forced into a kneeling position by the waves of growth pleasure, Vanessa felt untapped power flooding into her body, the torn remains of her clothes became smaller and smaller in proportion to her tremendous body. After 30 seconds the spurt ended and Vanessa let out a lusty sigh. The torn remains of her shirt fell on the ground, her skirt was a small line of fabric around her waist, unable to conceal the glistening folds of her womanhood and the neatly shaved strip pubic hair that identified her as a natural blonde. Slowly she stood up and marvelled at herself in one of the mirrors. Finally, after the end of the growth spurt, Vanessa had become a massive, awe-inspiring behemoth of a woman. Staggering eight feet tall, she would loom over every other human on the planet. From the rock formations that were her pecs sprang forward her humongous boobs and below them were the chiselled valleys that were her abs to her sculpted legs, each of them proportionally long but as big as the trunk of an old oak tree. Proudly putting her hands on her hips and spreading her legs, the waistband of the skirt tore, too. Gloriously naked, Vanessa smiled at her awe-inspiring mirror image.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She altered her complexion slightly, making her skin a little more pink toned. She turned her hair color to blonde and curly, draping down her back. She also programmed some large, square frame glasses. As she looked in the mirror, Laura couldn\u2019t help but laugh. She looked like some kind of Nashville country singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat idea gave her a thought. She searched for accents, and found she could alter hers for any in the world. She checks for Southern American, and adds it. After the phone processes, she tries out her new accent, \u201cWell, hey y\u2019all.\u201d She covers her mouth with her hands. It didn\u2019t quite sound like her, but it did fit the new look. She could have easily passed for any country showgirl, or Dolly Parton impersonator. There was no way Greg or Vanessa would even dream this was their sister; but if she was going this far, why not push it even further?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turns back to the body page brings up the stats on her ass. She swing out the slider and pushes the thigh bar even further, and hits accept. She groans as her hips begin to fatten, growing thicker and wider. Laura bites her lip as one of her hands squeezes her ass as it passes beachball size. It plumps up, more and more flesh, pushing outward, until it stops short of four feet from her abdomen. She smiles, rubbing her behind and thumbing through to the breast page. \u201cAnd now, to make sure I\u2019m the biggest on the beach\u2026\u201d she slides the bar further and further, then presses the \u201capply\u201d. Laura drops the phone on the ground and places both hands on her beachball size breasts as they begin to inflate. Her breasts fill up her arms, reaching for her head. She slides them down, letting them hang past her stomach. They drooped, settling at her waist. They stayed at their lowest limit, but soon began swelling away from her body. Laura turned her profile to the mirror and watched her breasts swell from two feet, out a few inches, then more, and more, raising and inflating like big balloons. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d Laura gasped as her chest rose higher and higher. It stopped just at where her chest started, just over two feet from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned her body to face the mirror, she couldn\u2019t see either nipple, only cleavage. She turned to one breast, and saw her fat nipple like a cork popped from a wine bottle. \u201cAlright, no one can top me now. Just one more thing.\u201d Laura turned her personality page, and repositioned her shamelessness up a bit. Since she had a body like this, there\u2019s no sense in not flaunting it. \u201cAlright, lets see what they think of Misty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was resting on a towel on the beach as her brother came in from the tide. She was resting in the sun, when Greg walked up to her, but his attention was turned to where the mob was. Vanessa turned over on her blanket to see a woman with big rimmed glasses, curly blonde hair tied up in pony tails, and enormous breasts, easily a foot or more on either side, cradled in a tiny checkered red and white bikini top. The only thing that could compare to their size was the size of her ass. This woman didn\u2019t need a chair; she could just use her own butt. She sauntered her way over and introduced herself, \u201cHowdy. M\u2019 names Misty. Just moved in town and wanted to see whut the fuss was about? Is this where all y\u2019all hang out?\u201d Greg couldn\u2019t speak. Vanessa just scowled and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tYeah, but I\u2019m afraid yokles don\u2019t really fit in.

If I'm going look like a I Country singer I need some appropriate clothing\" her fingernail \"ran\" quickly on the screen, passing hundreds different outfits. \"Mmm ... it looks good\" Laura said, looking at a strapless mini dress, that nicely revealed her round and large breasts, her Broad shoulders and her long legs with a small glimpse of white panties. \"Fabulous!\" Laura giggled and started changing colors and patterns on the dress. She stopped on the Confederate flag, \"ha ha it's perfect! Just add a wide-brimmed straw hat and large, round glasses, to strengthen geeky look! Mmmm ... I missing something ... I know,\" Laura was looking one of the tools and She started looking for good tattoos. Laura finally chose a tattoo of the Texas borders on her right breast. \"My heart is with the Lone Star State\" Laura giggled in her Southern accent. \"Hmm, that doesn't sound so good, I need a Texas accent, very deep Texas accent and let's see if there is anything that could give me a good talent for singing\" Soon Laura give \u200b\u200bherself a deep Texas accent, very heavy and is her voic Was a combination of the voices of all the voices of the greatst Country singers of the United States. \"YEEEEE-HAW!!!!!!\" Laura laughed and was Ready to push the Apply button when her eye she saw one tool which she ignored.</span></div></div>",

Laura pushed on the MuscleStrength tool and she gave her character the appearance of an athlete woman. \"The truth...  these squares look pretty good on the belly ... honesty they look very sexy! Let's see some more muscles.\" The figure grew very fast growing from an athlete size to the size of professional bodybuilder, which deals in a row at least twenty years! And life only on steroids! All the muscle and bracket of her body was swollen to the peak, the pink skin (which she immediately after that she gave it a light tan) was almost torn apart, it was drawn so tight over the hills that rose out of her body. All body fat melted, the belly was a solid block of eight cubes of muscle that stood out through the dress. Calf muscles were twice the usual size of a woman or a man, huge breasts jutting into the sky, gating a support that no bra can provide. The neck thickened and large veins stand out from it. Shoulders were so broad that she didn't believe she could ever go through an ordinary door. The Biceps were monstrous. She had no words to describe them, mountain ridges of power that grew out of her arms, each in the size of Malone, a network of veins covering them like a cobweb. \"Holy Mother!\" Laura almost shouted. \"It's so sexy but so gross at the same time!\" She looked in amazement at the figure on the screen and felt heat and moisture spread in her crotch. Part of her wanted to click the Apply immediately but some other strongly objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if I could make it more feminine ...\" Laura whispered and looked on the screen with her eyes, looking for any option that could help. Fortunately she found one, one click and the muscles were adjusted to the feminine body structure. While she was still a mountain of muscle packed into a Confederate flag cocktail dress it was very feminine  muscular mountain, gentle and soft. After that she played a little with power meter, giving herself enough power to crush SUV and face a nine-millimeter bullets. \"Hmm ... It looks like  something is missing ....\" Laura thought to herself. She played a little with the various tools and finally she gave the figure a very naive look . Laura smiled to see the character she had created, a character full of contradictions, muscular but feminine, sexy but Pious, seductive but innocent. \"God is great! Just to arrange a suitable personality to the new me and I am Finish,\" Laura giggled and began playing with various personality Possibilities. She decided opposites will work well here too. She Increased her dominating side to Level of Madness but she was allso naive girl, her confidence will be in the sky but with a bit shyness, humble-minded and virtuous but not ashamed to walk with exposed dress, sweet and gentle but sinister. \"It's huge! classic Southern belle with the scent of buff train robber!\" Laura laughed. \"Well just add cowboy boots and cowboy gloves and everything is perfect. Good, in the place that Misty failed Carrie Molly Stephanie Suzy Dolly Davis will be a huge successl!\" She screamed and pressed Apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot! I feel like a twister runing in me! and it feel Fucking GOOD!!!\" Laura moaned heavy in her deep Texan accent. She felt her panties becoming wet and very quickly was filling with thick fluid, hot and tirery. \"Yippie ka-yay!\" She screamed and rubbed her changing body. Her body jumped quickly into the air, her clothes become liquid that was stretching across her swelling and growing body. The Breasts shoot to the air, like a pair of inflatable balloons and Were supported by a pair of square muscles who grew up and became more hardened than steel. Her Ass was hardened, becomes a heart-shaped steel butt. Her hips Stood up and rise, the legs lengthened. Her platinum hair fell to her butt. Her Liquid clothes wrapped her upper body and turned to dress, a drop of liquid climbed to her head and turned to hat, two drops covered the hands and became cowboys gloves and two more drops became a cowboy boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura threw her hands in the air and stretched her body, the dress was stretched more than the limit. \"Oh, yeah!\" She moaned and opened her blue almond eyes, staring into the mirror on the wall. All that Laura saw was the bottom of her enormous breasts and four blocks (pack) under them. \"Look at me!\" Laura said her heavy accent and grabbed the pair of breasts in her palms, she raised them, squeezing and pushing them against each other. She couldn't stop laughing and moaning with pleasure. \"Back in Texas, we called breasts like thous overly oversized Mutant 5 liter Coke bottles !\" She lowered her gaze to her breasts.  The Nipples hardened and sticking out through the fabric. She took a long narrow tongue and licked her full lips. \"Perfect!\" She whispered, stroking the tattoo on my right breast. Laura left her breasts and let them fall and bounce as she tucked Her biceps. \"Shoot! Looks at them,\" she laughed and looked at the mountains that grew out of Her arms. \"It's so great ... and solid!\" She moaned as she stroked one of Her muscles \"I'm hotter than a hickory smoked sausage!\", she felt the moisture spreading between her legs again. \"I'll have time for that later,\" Laura moaned, \"now time to go for a ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He called Misty as fast has he can and set to meet with Misty, at eleven at night, at his home. Adam couldn't wait any longer, he became a bundle of nerves from waiting to the Texas Venus. Adam could not stop imagining her enormous pair of breasts, which jutted proudly from her muscular chest, provoking gravity. Saliva dripped from his mouth as he imagined the impressive breasts, his hands were in the air, feeling the imaginary breasts. Suddenly the doorbell rings and a Adam jumped in the air in horror, waking up from his dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not mean, sorry!\" Adam shouted in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked scared on the living room. The bell rang again and the Adam warily approached the door. He reached his hand nervously and slowly opened the door. He opened the door and his tongue fall to the floor, in front of him he saw eight concrete blocks, barely emerges out of the lower blocks a gold earring. He looked down and saw a pair of long, muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy little partner!\" Adam heard the sweet voice with a heavy Texan accent of Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked up and almost fainted at the sight of Misty cute face that smiled at him from between the giant breasts that she pushed sideways to avoid blocking her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M... Misty?\" Adam muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can came in my cute little Blueberry Pie?\" Misty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... yes, yes obvious, Please come in!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIsty bent down, she cupped her huge breasts with muscular arm, crushing it against her chest muscles and with great effort pushed her huge body through a small door into the house. When she manages to get insied she straight stretched herself up. But the hall was too small and her head hit the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot! Looks like I am to big to this place.\" she laughed and Massaged her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked mesmerized by Texas muscle giantess in front of him. She was bent over, her head pushed down by the low ceiling. To Adam  it looks like she has grown more since the last time they met. \"How the hell she got SO big\" Adam thought to himself as his eyes \"run\" on Misty sexy and muscular body. She had changed since the time of their previous meeting. She wore a red strapless coctail dress with a cut along its long abdomen, exposing her solid 8 pack and her impressive buff, long lags. Her long smooth, long red hair fell gently on her steel butt. She wore no jewelry and her pretty face was covered with little makeup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're not going to offer a lady a drinking?\" Misty said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam invited her into the living room. and while his couch crushed under the weight of huge muscle girl he ran to bring her refreshments. He sat in front of her and stared at her huge breasts what danc while she talked and talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you God!\" Adam prayed over and over in his head. He was thankful that god summoned to him this buff Venus. \"Oh god please God, make her let me touch her \u200b\u200bbreasts or her huge biceps. Please I will do everything you want, just please let me touch her \u200b\u200bdivine body.\" He prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Misty or more precisely Laura was enjoyed the power it has on the little guy sitting in front of her. She knew  that he was not really listening to her nonsense and that all of his mind was concentrated on her enormous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, this is so great!\" she thought to herself. \"Now it is time to move to the second stage, I'm so horny, I hope he does not die\" She erased and moved to get up when suddenly a loud voice shouted inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Laura froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Laura thought in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am you\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Laura was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we are Misty Molly Stephanie Suzy Dolly Davis, and what you have in mind is not something a southern lady should ever be imagined.\" the voice spoke in a heavy Texan accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty Molly Stephanie... what? Who the hell are you? I am Laura not Misty Molly... all that stupid names!\" Laura screamed in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking, we always were Misty Molly Stephanie Suzy Dolly Davis. We born in Texas to good and respectable family and always, from the moment we were born we were polite, nice and good girl. We never had such bad thoughts! How can you think to harm this cute Blackberry, let alone make intercourse before marriage. What's everyone think of us in Texas, What minister say? What Mama Say? What god will think of us? do you know that the thing you want to do is a sin! Our soul is in danger!\" the voice with the heavy Texan accent spoke again with great concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you talking about? On which mother are you talking about? I've never been to Texas not to mention that I was not born there at all! I go out of my mind!\" Laura yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go to church now and ask for forgiveness from God for those bad thoughts, And ask God to help stay humble, modest and virtuous\" the said, gating stronger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humble, modest and virtuous?\" Laura laughed \"I do not remember who opposed the dress I'm wearing now, you know the dress that exposes everything and don't leave no room for imagination!\" she said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be a silly goose\" the said giggled \"Mom always said that we gift from God to this world and our beauty makes everyone feel good. It will be evilness to hide it from the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Mom never said ... I was not even this body five hours ago!\" Laura grabbed her head in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty are you O.K.\" Confused Adam asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need... I need...\" MistyLaura murmured in pain \"Toilet where the toilet?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam pointed to the bathroom and huge muscle girl tried to go there but she swayed as if she was drunk. Adam  jumped off the couch and tried to support muscle mountain in the middle of the living room. His hands grabbed her bulging muscles arm, he felt as if he touches stone,  a very hot stone. Misty was boiling heat and Adam falt like is hands was burn. She was also heavy, so heavy that Adam afraid that if she fell she would smash him.  With great difficulty he managed to get her to the bathroom she came in and slammed the door behind her. She fell on knees, shaking the house and grabbed the sink. Fingers cracking the porcelain but she did not notice all eyes were focused on the mirror in front of her.</span></div></div>",

Her long fingers broke the sink and her hands fell to the floor, breaking the floors, creating two craters in the form of her hands. She tried to breathe but could not, she tried to scream but no sound came out. Her IPhone dropped  from her bag and App jumped immediately on. The App started to run automatically, rearranges the entire history of Misty/Laura. Laura's head spun quickly, her all her life ran in front of her like a movie but slowly began to change themes. New memories and old were gone. Her house image was replaced by a huge mansion in the heart of Texas, her parents changed from a pair of high-tech workers to Southern aristocratic couple. Her father Changed from programmer to a multimillionaire Texas oil tycoon, and her Mother Changed from a secretary to an aristocratic housewife, graduate of one of the most prestigious universities in the United States, which underlines her time volunteer for social and religious activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe images continued to run and to change in Laura head. Her memories of her sister Vanessa have change, now she remembered that her sister Vanessa Veronica Ava Maxine Jennifer Davis (20) loved her more than anything and always love to play and hang out with her. She began to study at a prestigious university but took every opportunity to return and spend time with her \u200b\u200blittle big sister. her brother, now Greg Johnny George Archie Wayne Davis (24) is a graduate of West Point, an army officer, who loves his little sister more than anything and always, since she was little, he defended and protected her, even though at the age of six she was taller than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd than the memories on herself began to change. She was born big and muscular, she weighed nearly twenty pounds when she was born, all muscle! Her body was growing rapidly fast, at age six she was nearly six feet hight and her breasts have already started to pass the measure C. At the age of 12 she could lift a car over with both hands and at sixteen she only need one hand. Her muscles swelled and grew regardless of her physical fitness. Actually she was quite a glutton and hate exercise. But no matter how much she ate she continued to grow and strengthen. She was always wise for her age and at school she was always ahead of the all the other pupils. She is a gifted musician and she know to play in ten different instruments and sing like an angel. She always led the singing in church and she was head of the school lenient. She was a great cook and love to volunteer. She won every badge in the Girl Scouts. Despite all her physical abilities She not go to Sprott, although all groups begged she join them, because she was shy and afraid of competitiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked frozen into the mirror, her new memories was still settling in her mind instead of the deleted old memories. Suddenly, a ring wake up Misty. She looked down and saw her IPhone. She picked it up and examined it, she close the strange App and look in her Contact List, everything seemed fine, the image next to her sister phone show a beautiful girl dressed in modest and prim dress, her brother was wearing a uniform and next to the phone of her old from Girl Scouts she kept their photos in the Girl Scouts uniform. She looked up at her reflection, she waved her red hair, soaked with sweat and looked at her face. Her eyes fell on Tattoo above her right breast. She ran her long fingers on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it on Mary's birthday, she made \u200b\u200bme drink and I became drunk\" she whispered. \"Mom was so angry in the morning when she saw it and Dad laughed \"At least she tattoo the greatest country in world\", mother suggested surgery to remove the tattoo but I am so afraid of needles that just left the tattoo\" Misty look at her tattoo quietly and suddenly burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! oh my!\" she laugh \"What a strange dream I had! I dreamed, that I thought that I am not me!\" she laugh and suddenly she stopped. It to her a few seconds to realize where she is but once she realized she jolted her hands to her mouth and tears burst from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" she cry \"I am a bad little girl, bad, bad, bad little girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clasped her hands and while crying, she began to pray, ask for forgiveness and mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God forgive me, please, please I beg you, do not mean to hurt little bear, really! He is so small and cute and I'm so big and strong. I just want to protect him, not hurt him. But sometimes bad thoughts pop into my head. I know that the devil is trying to get me to use the gift you gave me to do bad. I know you gave me such a beautiful body to gives happiness to mankind. Please God give me strength to resist the devil, I promise to make up the little Blackberry that I wanted to hurt him. Amen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty... are you O.K.?\" Adam muttered in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty turned and slowly opened the door, careful not to ruin something else. Adam looked shocked on the crumbled bathroom. \"What happened here?\" He asked anxiously. \"I apologize tiny teddy bear, I just felt bad and I could not control my strength,\" she said in tears. \"You do not to cry Misty\" Adan said to muscle girl that look like a huge mount that springs burst from his head. Misty dropped to her knees so that she and Adam would be more or less the same height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look man, I must tell you I wanted to meet with you because ... Because ...\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"because of what?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're so cute, sweet small teddy bear, sweet blackberry. I felt a great warmth between .. My legs whan I saw you and just wanted .. Oh my! please forgive me Adam!\" Misty cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean sex?\" Adam muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Adam! Please do not use this word, it is so dirty. Yeah Adam I wanted .. You know what? I know I should wait for wedding for this. But sometimes the devil is so strong\" she said. \"I asked for forgiveness from God, Adam. Now I ask this from you, please forgive me Adam, I know I wanted to do you harm. Please find a place in your heart to forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty opened her purse and took out five hundred dollars. \"Please Adam, this for the damage I caused to your bathroom,\" she said shyly. \"If there's something else that will make you forgive me, please tell me, please Adam I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam look on the giant muscle girl and whisper....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looks like I'm a little hungry,\" she said \"I will catch them later\" and started looking for a restaurant. After some searching she found what she wanted, a nice little western restaurant. \"I need a good Texas meal\" Laura said and walk to the restaurant. Laura stood facing the door and smiled with embarrassment, \"I have a little difficult to enter,\" she thought, looking at the door, which was shorter and too narrow for her breasts. Laura looked at the door for several minutes and after her stomach gurgle strengthened She put her right  hand on her breasts and pressed them hard against her body. She approached the door and with great effort managed to walk through the narrow opening. She released her breasts and twisted her body, pushing her breasts with outward force against the fabric \"YEEEEE-HAW!!! It was hard,\" she murmured, and when she opened her eye, she could not help smiling shyly staring at the diners. \"Howdy y'all!\" Laura said in her heavy accent shyly and walked three big steps over to the desk. She waddled over to the salesman who barely reached her breasts, revealing to him a pair of huge mountains, broad valley across them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy my little blueberry pie, I just starved like Puma that was eating lettuce for a month! I really want Chicken fried bacon, some Chili con carne, Mashed potato and for dessert Apple pie with ice-cream and Banana split\" Laura said in a sweet voice to the clerk. The young man looked dumbly at Texas Venus in front of him or rather on the very real breasts that he saw up close and drooled. \"By the way partner my name is Carrie Molly Stephanie Suzy Dolly Davis\" Laura Said in Super Speed \"But you can call me pumpkin, All my friends call me that, I have no idea why\" She slipped her hand under her breasts, crushing them and sticking them, \"I don't look like a pumpkin, right? I mean I there is anything in me that resemb a pumpkin, right?\" She asked innocently stretching her back and pushing her breasts out. \"Actually I can think of two things that look like a pumpkin, like a monstrous pumpkin\" The clerk whispered, \"What did you say partner?\" She asked, \"Nothing, I swear in Texas\" he murmurs, \"Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain!\" Laura She said, with angry look and then burst out laughing, the salesman joins her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then the price goes ...\" He began to calculate and Laura looked for her purse. She quickly discovered she had no money. \"Doggone it!\" She said \"I forgot my wallet and I'm so hungry,\" she patted her belly. \"Look partner, there is a chance that I could pay next time? Promise, oath of a Texas damsel\". \"It's okay the lunch on me\" the shopkeeper said. \"Thanks partner\" she smiled and kissed him on his forehead. \"Wow,\" he muttered. \"What did you say partner,\" she asked, \"haa find a comfortable place and I will bring you the food,\" he whispered and ran to the kitchen. Laura turned the restaurant until she managed to find a table, that she was able to force her way into it. The chair screamed in agony whan Laura's huge buttocks sat down on it. The food arrived quickly and Laura ate with relish. She studied her surroundings as she ate. She could see the cinema that the red-haired girl run to with a Adam, a group of boys who were always harassing her old self and karaoke machine.</span></div></div>",

Pushing her huge body forward, moving her swollen, buff arms forward, stretching the strapless dress more and more, throws her long legs forward so every step ostentatiously shakes her enormous bunz of steel, that was sticking out like a cliff from her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to play? what to play ?...\" She muttered to herself while she moaned forward, causing her tight mini dress to climb up and expose to all the crowd in the restaurant, that was drooling because of that, her mighty ass and her Texas flag panties that was tense and sunken between her Titanic buttocks. And delved into the electronic display looking for a good country song. \"Shoot! what a poor selection...\" she sighed, \"Not even one good country song. Back in Texas, we called Karaoke machine that does not have at least all songs of Shania Twain, Guy Clark, Charlie Daniels, Steve Young, Dolly Parton and Townes Van Zandt Adjusting Sights target! Shoot they don't have even one of Uncle Ted songs!\" she cry. \"What song they expect me to sing, what they have here? God forbid! Lady Gaga, I throw up just from is name, what kind of a man is wearing women's clothes and sing before an audience? Pink? I'm too sexy for her songs. Kitty Perry? When her breasts will be as half of my breasts maybe I will consider. Shakira? Shake your pathetic ass away from me. Britney Spears? An aging prostitute. Rihanna? Christina Aguilera? Mariah Carey? prostitutes. What's that... Madonna! Don't you dare offer me this old worn, ugly whore that think she has a charming British accent. I want to throw up just from seeing her name. No real lady would not dare to say that name on her lips.\" She thought to herself, as her deep voice suddenly claimed that she once loved these singers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked them?\" She murmured, surprised by the voice in her head. \"Nonsense!\" She shook her head, she always hated them and she is sure of that, like her name is Carrie (Misty) Molly Stephanie Suzy Dolly Davis! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this thought Laura eyes opened in surprise. \"My name is not Carrie (Misty) Molly...\" she murmured in confusion and shook her head in dismissively. \"That was weird ...\" She whispered, and returned to search for a song. Without Laura knowledge suddenly appeared on  iPhone screen, which lay in a secret pocket in her dress, a loading screen \"loading new memory\" appeared on the top of the screen in the bottom the number five percent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's a good song \"I need a hero\", not that I really need one\" she giggled and looked with delight on her monstrous block of muscles which grow from her feminine arm. \"Well now just insert same coins ...\" She murmured and found to her surprise that she do not have a wallet or money. \"Doggone it!\" Laura said and turned to the the restaurant, where the customers (men and women) were sobbing in sorrow on disappeared of the bunz of steel. but immediately returned to drooling when they found that the dress, when the Texas buffed Venus stand up, also stretched over in the front and exposes the lower front, showing a panties that were stretched herd by two giant packs which stretched down from the crotch all the way to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy y'all!\" She smiled at the crowd who was drooling on the floor, \"What a silly little me! I forgot to bring my wallet with me. Someone can lend me some money to the karaoke? I love to sing. I promise to return the money, when Big ol' girl like me lend she always returns it on time!\". All the hands the restaurant immediately rush forward with money. Laura smiled with pleasure at the sight of all the little people that without an argument give her what she wants. She took a step forward and stood over a shy redhead boy that, a little nervously, handed all of his wallet to her. \"You're so cute!\" She giggled and ruffled his hair red. Immediately his face was redder than his hair. She took the money and winked at him, memorizing his face and hint to him to wait for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K!! Let's get started!\" Laura yelled as the music began to emerge from the speakers. She sang in perfect harmony, her voice soft and gentle as the sound of gentle bells but deep, aggressive and sexy at the same time. The audience was mesmerized by the Titan siren that sang before them. Soon she could not control herself and started dance, the earth shook, the windows break, cracks appeared in the walls and in the street cars overturned. But Laura did not notice that she was self-absorbed in her dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laura open her eyes she saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wondering how she would look with bulging muscles Laura tapped the \u201cback\u201d button and was once again looking at the model of herself. She tapped the \u201cMuscle Tone\u201d button and was greeted with a pair of sliders. The top one read \u201cMass\u201d while the bottom one was \u201cDensity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her finger on the \u201cMass\u201d slider and began moving it to the right. Immediatly Laura\u2019s rendered body began growing larger going from skinny waif to the look of an olympic sprinter. She pushed further watching as the 3D model\u2019s clothes became tighter and tighter over its increasingly bulging muscles. By the time she resembled a middleweight female bodybuilder her green top began to split around her expanded shoulders and chest. This only encouraged Laura to push further. Seconds later she\u2019d changed the virtual Laura into a world class heavyweight female bodybuilder at which point the top had been shredded and disappeared. Now it was her shorts that had to succumb to her massive glutes leaving her clad only in her pink panties. And still Laura pressed on. With every additional curve and bulge she became more excited, more turned on and the more she wanted those muscles to be hers. A digital counter at the top of the screen told her that her growing body was now passing the 200 lb. mark, shortly after that she was passing Greg\u2019s 225 and still growing. The model\u2019s shoulders continued to expand while its chest thickened into a shelf of muscle that extended well beyond the tip of its chin. Its thighs were so thick the were pressing into each other and its arms were so thick that Laura guessed her biceps were bigger than her head, and they weren\u2019t even flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued to pile the mass on until the model was bigger than any other human being in history. The indicator showed that were she to grow to that size she would weigh 355 lbs. even though her height was still 5\u2019 4.\u201d She looked like a monster but an incredibly sexy one. Laura felt a tingle in her crotch and found that her panties were soaked through. She wanted that body and wanted it badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger began to move toward the \u201cApply\u201d button when she noticed that next to it was a \u201cScheduled Application\u201d button. When she clicked on this one she was shown a chart and graph that would allow her to slowly transform over a set period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused her to wonder which would be better. One the one had she could have the body of her dreams right now and enjoy instant gratification; the downside, of course, was that she would not be able to explain how she added 250 lbs. of muscle instantly. On the other hand she could set the growth up to slowly increase over a long time and then pretend to hit the gym while she gradually added mass and outgrew her brother and the rest of the world; the downside here is that she would have to be very patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura carefully considered her options and decided she would...</span></div></div>",

She had thought it impossible to surpass the first waves of pleasure\u2026 she had been wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere I go!\u201d she moaned deeply, when her arms started to get thicker and thicker. Her legs too, were quickly increasing in circumference and slowly started to struggle with her denim pants. Joyfully Laura realized the growth was happening all over her body, big muscles were appearing everywhere. The seams of her increasingly too small clothes popped open, fabric was torn, overstretched material protested loudly. By now Laura was a veritable bodybuilder, with a well-defined abdomen and sizeable arms\u2026 but she still wasn\u2019t done growing. Another incoming spurt made her first wince in anticipation than moan in pleasure. Her already incredible thighs showed no mercy to her pants and shredded them effortlessly. Her T-Shirt followed swiftly when her abdomen continued swelling, blowing up, almost as if every molecule in her tremendous body was exploding. Her hips grew so wide even her panties popped off and fell to the floor. Half dazed by pleasure Laura watched her incredible biceps swelling larger, becoming bigger and bigger.  Just when she thought they wouldn\u2019t get any bigger, they actually got bigger\u2026 and bigger, until she had surpassed any male bodybuilder in human history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura marvelled at her mighty body. Her formerly ordinary body was covered with muscles that seemed to be chiselled out of rock. Slowly she approached her mirror - noticing the protesting ache of the wooden floor beneath her, struggling with her new weight - smiling at the goddess smiling back at her. Then she made herself as big as possible, and flexed, imagining that hundreds of people were looking at her.<br>\r\nStriking a double-biceps pose she moaned deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow these, my esteemed guests, are muscles!\u201d</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been right; she would never be able to explain this amount of gained muscle mass\u2026 Well, she was honest to herself. This hadn\u2019t been difficult to foresee. But why stop here? Laura was now the most massive being in human history, why should she even bother about explaining anything to anyone. After all there were still some very interesting sliders left. With thunderous steps she approached her desk again and retrieved her phone. The female juggernaut knew exactly what she would do next. Satisfied she mustered her incredible pectorals, their volume had increased at the same ratio like the rest of her muscles, but they actually \u2018overshadowed\u2019 her breasts to much in Laura\u2019s opinion. And she actually could think of no reason for being left behind by her older sister in the \u2018big breasts\u2019-category any longer. How often had Vanessa shown off with her marvellous assets and made Laura fell underdeveloped? And why should Vanessa look down on her any longer? It was time to correct those things.<br>\r\nWith surprisingly nimble strokes she opened the according sliders, starting with her breasts.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s give Vanessa a taste of her own medicine!\u201d Laura said smiling. She wouldn\u2019t just catch up with her sisters\u2019 cup-size, she would overtake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all I have the required back muscles for a really voluptuous bosom!\u201d Laura stated non-chalantly. <br>\r\nShe felt small drops of her own juices tickling down her inner thighs. This was so hot. Seeing her virtual images\u2019 bust grew with every slider movement and knowing it would happen to her too was indescribable. Setting the sliders for a breath-taking 42 K-Cup bust, she switched to height. Vanessa would no longer tower over her\u2026 Neither would Greg. <br>\r\nThe apps\u2019 design was thoughtful, next to the \u2018size\u2019-slider was a check box \u2018adjust to keep proportions (muscle/breasts)\u2019, quickly Laura activated it.<br>\r\nLaura worried no longer about explaining the changes. She would no longer owe explanations to anyone. The hulking woman would present the world with a fait accompli and there would be no alternative but to accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith high expectations she pressed apply. And the app delivered promptly. Again the height of intensifying pleasure, the agonizing moments of emptiness and finally: the overwhelming pleasure of pure growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later her breasts had doubled in size and kept growing. Satisfied she noticed the sensation filling her muscles again, preparing them to grow to accommodate her new size, and finally she started to grow in height too. Moments felt like minutes of undiluted pleasure to Laura. In a flash she shot up at least two inches, so fast that Laura had to fight off a sudden wave of vertigo, while she watched her room \u2018shrink\u2019 in front of her eyes. During all of this my breasts - already ample compared to their previous state, which was admittedly not very difficult. After 18 years of being almost completely flat-chested, the growing extra weight and warmth against Laura chest felt indescribably awesome - were still growing relentlessly. And even as fast as her titanic frame was expanding, they were growing much faster. Unable to articulate her feelings except for deep moans, Laura marvelled at them: They were freaking enormous, and felt incredibly good against her broad chest. It was awhile before Laura realized that this time she wasn\u2019t able to hold back \u2013her hands were eagerly touching them. Rubbing, fondling, squeezing, stroking, caressing - while she stood there in the middle of the room, whimpering with pleasure, secretly asking herself how long she could do this without finally losing it.<br>\r\nHer body answered the question for her and with a loud scream she came forcefully. With a last mighty spurt, which accompanied her orgasm, Laura gained another foot in height, leaving her at the towering height of 8\u20192\u2019\u2019. The checkbox had worked flawlessly; her muscles had grown too and accommodated her new staggering size, like her perfect, sumptuous medicine ball-sized and perky breasts. <br>\r\nStill panting heavily, Laura explored her body with her fingertips. The app was great.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

His muscles had always been impressive but now her's were mind blowing. Laura's 5' 4\" frame was so packed with bulging muscle mass she looked like a cartoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura extended her arms and slowly curled her flex back in. She watched her immense biceps recede then swell back into mountains. She felt power crackle within them. In fact, she realized that the heat that had accompanied her transformation was still raging within her body. She recognized this as the feeling of power and strength and despite the fact that she had more than tripled in weight she felt lighter than air. Every movement was graceful and effortless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she dropped her arms and twisted her torso to the side relishing the feeling of her wide shoulders swinging around like a ship trying to turn tightly. Clasping one fist in the other hand and dipping her body down slightly Laura hit a side chest pose like she'd seen Greg do countless times. Though her brother could only dream of hitting a side chest like this. Laura's eyes drank in the sight of her own body: her shoulder, her arm, her pecs, her abs, her thigh. Her thigh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Laura said once spotting the unreal leg that she was sporting. Releasing her upper body flex she ran a hand down the huge quad all the way to her knee then inserted her fingers into the many grooves between the shredded muscles and felt her way back up to her hip. A shiver ran through her body and goosebumps erupted across her flesh. \"This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I can't believe this is real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was suddenly overcome with the need to get outside and show off her new body. She wanted to turn heads, she wanted to inspire lust, she wanted to scare people with the sheer impossibility of her size. Were there even clothes in this house that would fit her now? She bent down to pick up the clothes she had grown right out of but found them missing. She turned around to see if they were behind her but her shirt, shorts and underwear were just gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laura realized that her room was different. A new collage of photographs was pasted to one wall, her posters had all changed (gone were the movies and new there were bodybuilders watching her), her bed had grown and there were large weights piled in one corner. She walked over to these and lifted the heaviest among them, a 40 pounder, in one hand. She noticed a thin layer of dust on it from lack of use and she could instantly tell why: it was light. She quickly curled it a few times laughing at the realization of what this all meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That app didn't just change me it changed the whole world!\" Another realization occurred to her and she rushed to her closet. Inside she found a whole new wardrobe fit for her enormous body. Inspired she went to her dresser and opened the top drawer where she found exactly what she needed right now: swimsuits. There were tons of them and she pulled them out in a big jumble and began sorting through them. Her head was swimming with the reality of this new world the best part of which was the fact that she didn't have to explain her impossible size to anyone, at least no one she already knew. Selecting a lipstick red bikini with black trim and a matching thong bottom she wondered if she was famous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled the top on over her head then stepped into the bottoms and pulled them up struggling even to get the stretchy material around her bulbous thighs. Finally dressed to impress Laura sprinted for the door and ripped it open. Never in her life had she dared wear something so revealing but now she couldn't wait to show off as much skin as legally allowed. She rounded the landing and bounded down the stairs to fast she thought her huge body was going to put holes in the floor. She was moments from dashing out the front door into the hot sun when something caught her eye and she stopped short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV in the living room was on and a pair of guys were watching an anime. She instantly recognized one of the guys as Jason, she'd recognize her best friend anywhere. The other guy was a mystery, though. He was about as tall as Jason and just as scrawny but she couldn't place him. It wasn't until he turned to look at the source of the giant thuds that she began to piece it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lulu,\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg?\" Her whole life her big brother had been\u2026 well, big. A natural athlete even before he'd started bodybuilding he was musclebound at a minimum before becoming downright huge. This guy, though, was a wimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heading out to hit the sand and show off your bod?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only now that she noticed that Jason had a caught in the headlights look on his face that resembled the one he would give Vanessa when surprised by her presence. <i>He has a crush on me</i>, she thought. She was about to answer her brother's question when a voice behind her spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without me, she isn't.\" Laura spun to find Vanessa exiting the kitchen. While Greg's physique had been reduced Vanessa's has been increased. The blonde bombshell was no where near the size of Laura but had turned herself into quite a beefy babe in her own right with broad shoulders, shredded abs, prominent arms and pumped up legs. She was wearing tiny, loose fitting shorts and a tank top that likely served as pajamas. \"Give me a minute to get my swimsuit on and I'll join you. Unless you're looking to strut your stuff alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole host of possibilities filled her mind. Part of her did want to hit the beach on her own, free from anyone else's influence, free to be whatever sexy powerhouse she wanted to be. At the same time, though, having a partner could be good. Not only to have some companionship but to see if she could get a little history of this new world. There was even a part of her that wanted to stay behind and hang out with Jason and show off her muscles for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end she decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure thing, 'Ness. I'll hang here while you get changed. We'll set the beach on fire together.\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa bounded up the stairs and vanished into her bedroom. Laura sauntered into the living room where Greg and Jason were watching TV. Well, Greg was watching TV Jason had his eyes locked on Laura. She pretended not to notice while keeping her eyes on the TV. Laura found it strange that now that she and Jason weren't friends Greg had taken up that spot. She had Jason had fallen in as friends because they were the same age and shared a lot of classes going all the way back to grade school but Greg was 6 years older than Jason. How did they start hanging out? Why didn\u2019t Laura befriend him? Maybe they'd been close once but had a falling out. So many questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura reached her arms out and stretched her body tensing and flexing tectonic shifts across her upper body. She tried not to show her smile as Jason shifted uncomfortably in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here to make fun of the nerds and their stupid shows?\" Greg asked without turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was hurt. She would never do that. \"Of course not,\" she said, \"this is one of my favorites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg turned his head and gave Laura an annoyed look. \"Not funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, I've seen this whole series four times through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's expression looked as if she'd just told him she'd just gotten back from the moon and had seen packs of wild dogs in spacesuits there. He looked even more confused when he saw no malice in her eyes. \"No you haven't. I hate it when you tease us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura knew she had to cut her losses. \"Sorry, big bro,\" she winced slightly at her use of this term but kept going anyway. \"No harm meant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned down over the back of the couch and wrapped her arms around him in a hug. \"I still love you.\" She still couldn't believe the role reversal between the two of them, her arms were bigger now than his had ever been and she never would have been able to reach around his chest the way it had been before.<i> I wonder exactly how big my arms are now?</i> Laura wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg patted her elbow a few times the gave a reassuring squeeze to her triceps. \"I love you too, Lulu. But you're a pretty nasty bully sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStung by Greg's words Laura stood and wordlessly backed out of the room into the foyer. She glanced up at Vanessa's room but the door was still closed. How long does it take to put on a swimsuit? Getting impatient Laura glanced around the room. She spotted a small table at the base of the stairs that had a junk drawer in it. Opening it she found what she was looking for: measuring tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jason,\" she called out. \"I was wondering if you could help me with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Greg and Jason exchange a look then Greg shrugged. Jason sighed and stood walking to where Laura waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" he spoke so quietly Laura almost didn't hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura held out the measuring tape. \"Can you help me measure my arm? I'm sure I could manage on my own but it's much quicker and easier if someone helps me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to speak but no words came. Instead he just nodded and took the tape. Laura giggled and loved how girly she sounded, still feminine despite all this muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her body slightly so her back was to him then looked up over her right shoulder at him with eyes she hoped were sultry and longing. She'd never had cause to attempt to look sexy but right now she wanted to use every tool at her disposal to drive Jason wild. \"Are you ready for this?\" Jason was sweating and she didn't wait for his response, which didn't seem to be coming anyway. She raised her right arm and curled her forearm up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Jason went to work. Laura could feel his hands shaking as he pulled the tape all the way around her huge arm. At one point he flubbed and dropped the roll and Laura let out a disappointed moan but he quickly recovered and completed his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it say, stud?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 uh\u2026 25\u2026 um\u2026 25 and a half inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow</i>, Laura thought,<i> there's hardly a man alive that can claim to have arms that big. Even fewer that don't cheat with synthol or something.</i> Still she let out a sad groan. \"Is that all? It's so small. Maybe I should try flexing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not flexing?!?\" Jason was too shocked to remember he was shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \"That's right, now hold on tight because here we go!\" Laura began slowly tightening her fist and bicep. The huge muscle awoke and began swelling pulling the measuring tape apart. Jason tried to hold it but it slipped from his fingers and fell to the floor. No longer even pretending it was a priority Jason simply wrapped his hands around Laura's expanding arm. He could feel the muscle fibers hardening, thickening, pushing his hands apart and spreading his fingers. She saw Jason's eyes nearly pop from his skull and he began breathing faster. She astounded herself with how much she was able to flex larger and larger even though she had witnessed her mass minutes earlier in her room. She reached what felt like her maximum then pumped her forearm out and in a few times finding a few extra centimeters of size. The peak of her bicep was a like half a softball atop a giant melon and Jason cupped this cap with his palm while he ran his other hand down the side of Laura's arm. He squeezed everywhere he went but aside from her thin layer of soft skin everything felt as hard as steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura purred. \"That feels nice, big guy, but don't get distracted. You have a job to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason reluctantly removed his hands from Laura's muscles and scrambled for the tape measure on the floor. He returned quickly and pulled the tape around her enormous arm. He shook his head at the result and readjusted the tape to make sure he had it right. Still he remained silent and disbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't leave me in suspense.\" Laura said breaking Jason from his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30 inches. Well\u2026 uh\u2026 actually almost 31.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grunted and squeezed her arm as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"31 and a quarter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura dropped her arm back to her side. She was beaming with pride but still trying to conceal her excitement since she was supposed to be used to being this massive. Instead she just grinned and turned back to face her helper. \"I appreciate it,\" she traced a finger down his chest and stomach to the waistline of his pants. She grabbed him by the belt and pulled him close to her; he was 8 inches taller but she was clearly the dominant one. \"I'm sure I'll be able to repay you sometime. Perhaps measure something of yours for you.\" She let go of his belt and sent her hand further south finding his erection. She felt Jason's throbbing cock through his pants and moved her hand down towards the end of his shaft. Then down, and down more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up at Jason with excited alarm. \"Does this thing ever end? It's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could reach the tip she heard Vanessa's door open at the top of the stairs. Jason's expression turned to one of terrified panic and he vanished into the kitchen. With a chuckle Laura turned to greet her sister as she descended the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was wearing a white bikini with fringe dangling from the top as well as her hips. These tassels swayed in a group as she moved in a way that was hypnotic. Vanessa in Laura's old reality was a knockout but this new version before her was something else. Her legs were just as long and her breasts were just as big and round but her physique was expanded from merely fit to fitness competitor. Her body fat was nearly non-existent (aside from the very large deposits on her chest) and her modest muscles stood in stark relief bulging from her frame. Laura guessed that her sister could muscle up a decent 14 inch bicep which was impressive even if it was no where close to her own arms which were over twice as large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa walked down the stairs, her thighs pumping into sensuous masses that shook and hardened before going soft and supple once more. She adjusted her top squeezing her boobs together and amplifying her cleavage. Laura noticed that Vanessa had applied a light layer of oil to her body and her shredded muscles shone even in the dim, indoor light. Her round hips swayed side to side causing her abs to dance and beg to be caressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing talking to the creep?\" Vanessa asked pulling her long blonde hair over one shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jason, a creep?</i> \"Nothing, just chatting.\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa gave Laura a look that wasn't too different from the one she got from Greg earlier, then she shook her head and held up a bottle. \"You seemed to have forgotten something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to take the bottle of oil from Vanessa but the older sister just moved in and began applying it to her skin for her. Vanessa moved with a speed and deftness that told Laura that this was a regular occurrence for them. She offered her body to Vanessa and enjoyed the feeling of the slick oil being massaged into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to have the use the rest of the bottle on you. Do you plan on slowing down on this whole endeavor?\" Before Laura could even think to answer Vanessa continued, \"Oh, and I called around to see if anyone else wanted to join us. Sounds like Sara and Nikki are in. Sara should be here any minute and Nikki said she'd meet us at The Stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026 okay. Sounds good.\" New friends? Laura didn't know anyone named Nikki but the bodybuilder version of Greg had been dating a girl named Sara. That could be the same girl. Laura hoped so, not only would it be a somewhat familiar face instead of a stranger but Laura had always liked Sara; she was very sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa finished oiling Laura's body and stood tossing the empty bottle into a nearby trashcan. \"Alright you sexy beast, let's get out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded and turned to discover what lay outside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura and Vanessa walked out into the bright day, Laura could feel the hot sun baking her skin and it felt good. The pair walked a few houses down to a path that cut through to the beach. Stepping onto the hot sand Laura found herself surrounded by people. Beautiful people that once she would drool over with envy but now they were all looking her way. A pair of hunky guys were pointing and whispering at her and Laura noticed an awkward erection in both of their shorts. One guy ran into a trash can and fell to the ground because his eyes had been locked on Laura's stupendous body. Several girls were staring at her with disgusted looks but Laura knew enough to understand that many of them were jealous, one was looking down and flexing her own well developed arm as if begging it to be bigger. Laura's stomach fluttered and she beamed with excited pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got past the all the looks she was getting Laura noticed that everyone around her was extremely fit. In the past she had complained about this sort of thing but even then there was a big mix of body types prowling the sands ranging from giant bodybuilder to fat slob, but now there were exclusively athletes. Even the least developed person she could find was sporting a six pack. Everywhere she looked she found hardbodies and muscle-heads. She felt like their queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can just hang here. Sara was just getting home from the gym when I talked to her. She should be here any second.\" Vanessa said. \"So, why were you talking to that dork?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason,\" Laura asked looking up at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know you shouldn't give that creep any attention or he'll never leave you alone. I think that guy is even more into muscle than you are, if that's possible. I'll bet you he's in our bathroom right now jerking off to the thought of you.\" (She was right.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned. Jason was her friend and she didn't like him being bullied or made fun of especially by Vanessa. \"He was fine, we just said a few hello's back and forth and he ran off when he heard you coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" a tiny voice interrupted. Laura looked down and found a girl of maybe 11 or 12 years old. Even she had the tight muscular body of a gymnast. She held a glossy photo and a marker up to Laura. \"Can I have your autograph? You're my hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a surprised laugh that was too loud and awkward. She quickly snatched the photo from the girl and scribbled her name on it. She took a quick glance at the image before passing it back to the girl and saw herself in a bejeweled bikini similar to one a pro bodybuilder would wear in a competition. She was standing in a white room flexing her stupendous muscles. Laura was pretty sure she was a good 30 or 40 pounds heavier now than when the picture was taken and she wondered how old it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl thanked Laura for the signature and bounced away. Once she was gone Vanessa scoffed, \"What, you're giving those away for free now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just a kid,\" Laura shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a kid? Are you going soft on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anything about me look soft to you?\" Laura smiled at her own comment and puffed out her chest for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa rolled her eyes then directed Laura's attention down the sand. \"Here comes Sara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned and saw that the Sara in question was the one she knew from her own reality as Greg's girlfriend. Laura had always thought of Sara as beautiful but here she was radiant. Somehow her \"girl-next-door\" beauty had been transformed, the girl Laura would have called adorable was gone and in her place was a diva who she strut with the confidence of goddess making even Laura feel nervous to be around her. Just like nearly everyone else in this world Sara's physique was expanded meaning she was a bit more developed than Vanessa but on a frame that was the same height as Laura making her look like a powder keg primed to explode. Her platinum hair was in a pixie cut and she wore a white one-piece swimsuit that was so thin, and so tight that every single detail of her torso was visible, the outline of her shredded abs, the shape of her perky breasts, all was on complete display with only her nipples and crotch granted extra padding for concealment. The girl also wore an interesting amount of jewelry for a beach trip giving her pale suit and pale hair gold highlights with a gold necklace, bangle and even a gold and diamond anklet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up bitches?\" Sara said as she arrived amidst her friends. \"You're both looking big and bad as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more Laura had a sinking feeling about the sort of people she and her friends were in this world. The Sara she knew was sweet and demure while at the same time sexy and powerful; not brash like this new version. Things were beginning to spiral out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you'll never guess what Ms. Monster over here just did.\" Vanessa said to Sara. \"She just gave out an autograph for free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of shock on Sara's face was complete. \"What. The. Fuck. Money-Mad McMuscles? I don't believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed. \"I saw it with my own eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same girl that chased down a family because their child squeezed her thigh? And when they refused to pay for the pleasure of touching her she ripped their car door off as they tried to get away?\" Sara wasn't laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded gravely but her eyes were sparkling. \"The same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's stomach sank further,<i> I did that?</i> Then another thought occurred to her: <i>I <b>can</b> do that? How strong am I?</i> So much was a mystery to her, based on her size alone she shouldn't be capable of such feats as Sara had mentioned but perhaps the phone had boosted her strength beyond what her size would suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated and intruded at the same time Laura glared at Vanessa and Sara, \"Can we go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls got quiet immediately telling Laura that they were intimidated by her despite being friends. The trio marched across the beach as Laura mulled over her situation. She loved her new body and apparent power but she was not a fan of the fact that her life had changed so drastically. She sighed to herself thinking that if she had only known that the crazy app was going to change her entire history she would have been more careful. Heck, she hadn't even really expected it to work and now here she was. She'd lost Jason as a friend and turned her, Vanessa and Sara into jerks. She was pretty sure, in fact, that they were full blown bullies. This was further punctuated by the fact that everywhere they went they drew stares, but not the kind Laura wanted. The looks they were getting wasn't of allure or lust but fear. People were afraid of her and her gang and Sara and Vanessa seemed to be basking in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio walked in a silent strut all the way to The Stage where Laura found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Stage was so called because that's what it literally was: a stage. Rows of elevated bleachers faced a platform on which it looked like plays would normally be performed but instead a sort of gym had been installed. The equipment was huge and loaded with tons of oversized weights: steel plates the size of bus tires, refrigerator-sized concrete blocks wrapped in chains, even a huge pile of mangled scrap metal off to one side. Half a dozen men and two women were on the stage using the equipment, but few seemed to be utilizing its full potential. Most stuck to more standard weights, but lots of them. Everyone on the stage was built bigger than anyone Laura had ever seen in her life but somehow she was still the biggest of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far right side was a giant of a man standing 6' 2\" and tipping the scales at around 300 pounds of super jacked muscle. He was standing in the squat rack with a huge bar across his shoulders. From her vantage point Laura surmised that he was the closest to her in terms of bulk but the fact that she outweighed him by more than 50 pounds at nearly a full foot shorter made her look far more developed. As they got closer Laura could see that the giant was someone she recognized. His name was Eric and in her own reality he and Greg had been friends in High School both playing on the football team. The two had drifted apart after graduation with Greg getting into bodybuilding and Eric falling out of athletics altogether. In this reality it seemed the two had switched places with Greg the smaller of the two by far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is fat fuck squatting over there?\" Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm\u2026,\" Vanessa thought for a moment counting in her head, \"Looks like about a ton, I'd say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to blurt out some shocked explicative but held her tongue and good thing because the next words out of Sara's mouth were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Does he really think anyone can compete with Laura here? She could do twice that without breaking a sweat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed then added, \"On one foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's stomach fluttered and she was, once again, left wondering just how much raw power was contained in her beastly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio got closer to the stage they were able to see more and more of it and now they could see a woman working the bench press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check out Nikki,\" Vanessa said. \"She's looking to show off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar she was pressing was like nothing Laura had ever seen before. It held a full compliment of plates but that was only the beginning. A steel frame had been built around the plates on both sides atop which were a couple of chairs which were occupied with huge men who were both holding even more weights in their laps. As if that wasn't enough a concrete block the size of a microwave dangled down from below each side of the bar. Despite this incalculable weight the woman, Nikki, was pounding out rep after rep with furious speed and ease while the huge men held on for dear life. By the time Laura counted 25 she could see Nikki begin to slow but still she persisted through another dozen or so reps before racking the bar and sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like everyone else on stage this girl was a behemoth like Laura had never seen before. She leapt to her feet and curled her giant arms into a mind-bending crab flex while roaring for the crowd. Even from a distance Laura could see the insane vascularity and crazy detail in this girl's pumped up muscles. To add to the fact that the 5' 7\" girl was a muscle monster she was also gorgeous with fiery red hair, dazzling green eyes, and a smile that even made Laura's knees weak. Nikki strut her way to the front of the stage and went through a series of poses that made it look like her overstressed bikini top was going to pop right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura spotted Eric rack his 1 ton bar and step out of the rack shaking his thunder thighs and giving a few flexes while nodding with pride. And Laura thought he should be proud, he looked amazing. She wanted to jump up on the stage and give those quads a good squeeze, she wanted to ask Eric what he was doing later. Was he seeing anyone? Did he like big girls? She wanted to know what it would feel like to rub her muscles against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later she saw Nikki, apparently finished with her posing routine, strut over to where Eric was and say something to him. He looked a bit hesitant at her words and looked like he wanted to turn to leave but couldn't for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Look at her go!\" Vanessa said. \"She's gonna take him down a peg or two!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was ecstatic, \"Yeah, it looks like he wants to back down. YOU KNOW THE RULES, FAT ASS!! NO BACKING DOWN FROM A CHALLENGE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed and slumped his shoulders. Nikki turned to the crowd and got them cheering the both of them on. The pair walked over to an arm wrestling table and stood on opposite sides. Nikki pumped her 25 inch bicep several times driving the people in the stands crazy before posting up and waiting for Eric to do the same. Finally he took her hand after a countdown began pushing with all of his might. Even from a distance Laura could see veins on his neck, arm, shoulders, even his chest bulge like crazy while his skin flushed. Yet despite all his effort Nikki's hand never budged and she threw her head back in a haughty laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki made a motion with her free hand as if telling Eric to bring it on even more and so he did now using both of his hands against her one but still he couldn't move her. Nikki held strong against him looking like she was having the time of her life while sweat poured down Eric's face. Finally she put him out of his misery quickly and smoothly pushing both of his hands back until they touched the table. Nikki put her hands in the air in a victory pose while Eric slunk off to the back of the stage and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was going wild as were Vanessa and Sara. Laura just felt sick. She knew that macho attitudes were a part of the bodybuilding scene but she'd never really been around it that much since her brother and his friends had always been so grounded and nice. Now, not only was she surrounded by mean spirited jerks but she was apparently their leader. It was enough to actually make her want to head home and use the phone to get her old life back. But what if she couldn't? Maybe it was better to stay here and use her influence to get everyone to be nicer. Maybe she could just straight up ditch Vanessa and Sara and find better friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa and Sara left Laura's side to join Nikki on stage and congratulate her on her domination of Eric. Alone on the sand Laura decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

She lost her train of thought however when Nikki spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the guy couldn't have Gina far at his size, we should be able to hunt him down right Laura?\" Said Nikki as she turned her head over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura weakly retorted by saying \"isn't it late though, maybe we should rest up and go at it when it's daylight\".

She set the target time of completion at 1 year. She knew that this was still very fast for anyone to add that much size, but decided there was no way she would be able to wait any longer and it would allow her to show off her dynamite physique on the beach next summer. She set the growth to happen very slow at first adding only 5-10 pounds a month for the first few months then slowly cranking up the growth faster and faster until the last few months in which she\u2019d be packing on the pounds like crazy until reaching her target weight of 355 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura decided that she wanted to add a little bit of height to her body as well, and while she wouldn\u2019t be able to really account for that sort of addition from working out at the gym she figured it would give her impending muscle more room to breathe once it had been added to her frame. She backed up to the main alterations page and selected height, then added 5 inches bringing her to 5\u2019 9\u201d. She wanted to go farther, but realized she\u2019d have enough trouble explaining those inches she\u2019d already added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping on the \u201cScheduled Application\u201d button once more she was greeted with a second line on the graph, this one representing her height increase. She made it a straight diagonal line from the start date and 0% growth to the end date and 100% growth so she would get taller at the exact same rate for the full year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were sweating with excitement as she placed her finger on the button marked \u201cBegin Scheduled Alterations\u201d and initiated a process that would change her life forever. Once the button had been pressed Laura could feel a warmth enter her body, and she knew that feeling would be with her until the same day the following year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and examined herself in the small mirror on top of her bookshelf and said goodbye to her old body and hello to the new Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do next?</span></div></div>",

As people walked by she couldn't help but get excited at the prospects of what were to come.  Some day she'd be able to come to this beach and turn heads just like her siblings did.  Watching people go by she noticed, too, that the ladies on this beach seemed to be fitter than usual, with most sporting defined abs if not an outright six-pack.  This was odd to her.  Had she just not noticed? She was usually too shy to come down here after all, she could have just missed it. Or maybe that's a new trend? Both plausible answers, but for some reason it piqued her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that she had been staring at group of girls admiring their physiques and was suddenly awash in embarrassment.

She had begun to feel silly for even thinking the app would work, and the enormity of this place was beginning to intimidate her.  The floor was filled wall to wall with nothing but the sexiest of hardbodies, male and female.  Unlike most gyms, she imagined, there was nobody here that seemed to be out of shape in the least.  Well, nobody but her.  Every last man and woman looked as if they had been cut from marble and placed in a pantheon of bodybuilding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to chicken out and leave when the biggest of any of the specimens approached her. It was Greg. \"Hey lil sis.  You don't know how excited I am to see you here. I've been trying to get you healthy for so long.\"  He gave her a playful punch on the shoulder that almost knocked her from her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Greg.  It's pretty intense in here.  I feel out of place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, leave that to me.  Being head trainer has it's perks.  We can use the private weight room as long as it's not reserved, which fortunately it isn't for the next hour.  Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura followed her brother through the veritable museum of god and goddesses, making her feel smaller and smaller every step she took.  He led her to a door next to the locker rooms that opened into a small room that was noticeably better stocked than the rest of the gym.  Three of the walls were lined with mirrors while the fourth was made of one way glass so you could witness the rest of the gym without being seen yourself.  Currently there was a couple on the other side playfully trying to outflex each other, completely unaware that Laura was watching from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Squirt.  Today I'm going to put you through some simple exercises for each part of your body to get a sense of your baseline strength.  Nothing too intense today.\"  Greg may not have realized he was lying, but he was.  Laura struggled through every maneuver, most of the time using just a bar with no added weight.  By the end, she was exhausted and could barely sit up straight on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Laura.  We've got a ways to go, but I'll have you pushing some serious iron here in no time.\"  He smiled and mussed her mop of sweaty hair before leading her out of the gym.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After leaving the gym Laura drove home stinking of sweat. She couldn't believe how stressful her workout had been despite the fact that she'd only been using the most minimal weights and settings. Greg had been very sweet and not commented on her severe lack of strength but had instead been a perfect trainer and encouraged her to push harder and harder. She could see why he was so successful in his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura arrived home and felt real fatigue setting in as she got out of her car. She'd felt pretty good for a little bit after leaving the gym but now her muscles were tightening up and she was beginning to really feel sore. Ascending the stairs to her room was actually painful and she had to stop halfway. By the time she got to her room Laura felt like something was very wrong, her entire body was on fire and it really hurt. She couldn't make a single move or even breathe without hurting. She peeled off her damp clothes, turned on her TV, and lay down in bed. It was only 6 in the evening but Laura drifted off to sleep and didn't awake until late the following morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was awoken by her cell phone ringing and based on the fact that it was her Doctor Who ringtone she knew it was Jason calling. She sat up and looked to her bedside table but her phone wasn't there. She climbed out of bed and searched around for the source of the ringing. She found her workout clothes still in a pile on the floor and her phone was still in her shorts pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answered the phone just before it went to voicemail. \"Jason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" He was certainly in a good mood. \"Are you still coming over today? I found my old Nintendo 64 and I thought we could play some old games together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \"Yeah, that sounds like fun. Let me just get ready and I'll be over in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hung up her phone and suddenly realized that she was naked and remembered arriving home tired and sore from her workout. She smiled when she realized that every bit of soreness had vanished from her body and was replaced with energy. She felt completely refreshed and, surprisingly, stronger than she'd ever felt in her life. She looked to the mirror that hung from her wall and examined her body. She decided it looked pretty much the same as it had, but when she ran her hands over her chest and stomach she found that much of the softness she'd grown used to was gone. Now she felt a lot more solid and even downright hard in some places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let loose a string of giggles as waves of excitement charged through her body. It had only been a day and already she was finding changes. She picked out some clothes to wear and practically skipped to the shower. She got her shoes on then sprinted from her house to Jason's. It wasn't a very far run, Jason's house was only a few down from her own, but usually even a short dash was enough to leave Laura winded. Instead she arrived at Jason's brimming with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Laura played video games and chatted for a few hours though Laura spent much of the time distracted. She kept imagining the monstrous body she was growing into but even more than that she wrestled with a brand new feeling: she was horny. Really, really horny. A couple of times she found herself touching Jason on the shoulder or the leg in the hopes that he would reciprocate or even escalate. Laura was still a virgin and had always kind of assumed that her first time would be with her best friend but somehow that had never come to be. Now she was trying to subtly cash that check but to her frustration Jason remained oblivious to her intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about the time that Laura couldn't take it anymore and was going to really launch herself at Jason full force she received a text message. It was from her brother and read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">Hey Sis! You still comin to the gym today? Don't quit on me yet!! I can fit in a session with you at 6 tonight, good?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that smile for?\" Jason was asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't even realize it but she was practically glowing with excitement. \"Oh, nothing. I'm just making arrangements with my personal trainer,\" she said as she sent a text back agreeing to meet Greg at 6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personal trainer?\" Jason asked. \"What's all that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled, she could see Jason was trying to hide excitement. \"Oh yeah, I decided I wanted to get into shape. Maybe even pack on some muscle. I just got started yesterday and I'm already feeling great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jason continued to act nonchalant but Laura could see that he was only playing. Was Jason turned on by strong women? This could be great; she decided to push further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Can't you picture me with huge muscles? Wouldn't that be awesome. Like, what if I were as big as Greg? Or even bigger?!?\" She stood and pretended to flex enormous muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess so. But I seriously doubt you'd ever be able to get close to Greg's size. You'd have to be the biggest woman in the world for that.\" Jason was adjusting in his seat and Laura realized that she had discovered something about her friend she had never known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that's what I'll be,\" she said plainly. \"I've got to go get ready.\" She shot him a wink and left even though she still had 2 hours to kill before her session with Greg. She decided this was a perfect time to end the conversation with Jason and though she still wanted to jump all over him she decided that she'd leave him wanting more. Maybe she could even get him to come on to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hung out at her house for a while before getting into her workout clothes and heading to the gym. Today she felt less intimidated by the pantheon of muscle gods and goddesses that surrounded her on all sides even though she appeared no closer to matching their size or strength she knew she was on her way. Greg took her into the private room in the back again and they began working through a few routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly Greg was shocked by how much stronger Laura was. She had added nearly 15 pounds to most of her lifts and over 20 pounds to any exercise involving her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have been holding back yesterday,\" Greg said. \"I've never seen anyone, especially a beginner like you, tack on so much weight overnight. You sure you're not pushing yourself too hard? I don't want you to hurt yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel great,\" Laura said, and she meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg didn't have another client until 8 so she was able to work out twice as long as she had the night before. Once she left, though, she was regretting it and the pain and the soreness returned in full force. Laura once more collapsed into bed, this time not even able to take her clothes off first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little after 9AM Laura's eyes shot open and she leapt out of bed. Just like the previous morning all stiffness was long gone and she felt amazing. Glancing in the mirror once more she examined herself and decided that she still looked pretty much the same. She wasn't sure but perhaps her waistline was a little trimmer and maybe she had lost a tiny bit of fat on her thighs and arms but when she felt herself there was no doubt that her muscles were responding to her workouts. It felt like there was a layer of rock beneath her skin and though it hadn't shown through just yet she knew it would any day now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura found her phone and opened the Alterations app to get a look at the image of herself at full size. As soon as she did, however, she was met with a message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><div align=\"center\">WARNING!<br>\r\nBaseline stats have changed.<br>\r\nTarget stats will be recalibrated.</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow when she was shown the avatar of herself as she'd be in a year she noticed the weight had grown to 410 pounds. Laura frowned, why had that changed? She noticed a small icon in the warning message that would give her more information and she tapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><div align=\"center\">When long term goals are established the body enters a state<br>\r\nin which it becomes more pliable and responsive to outside<br>\r\nstimuli. As such it is recommended that one should abstain<br>\r\nfrom activities that could alter the established goals as<br>\r\nthis can cause unexpected changed to occur.</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my workouts are suddenly supercharged which is why I'm getting stronger so fast and that's affecting what will happen to my body at the end of my transformation.\" She thought about this for a moment before she was interrupted by a text from her brother:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">I have an opening earlier in the day today. Meet me at noon.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responded back with a quick message telling Greg that perhaps she should stop working out. She said she wasn't sure that weightlifting was right for her. Instantly her phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even say hello Greg was speaking, \"Oh no you don't! I've seen this before. You can totally do this and you're coming to the gym if I have to drag you there myself. And you know I can do it. The way this works is you go for three weeks at least before you're allowed to quit. By then you'll know for sure if you really want to. Noon, be there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that he hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura thought for a minute about what she should do. On the one had it made sense that she should stop her workouts to avoid \"unexpected changes\" but on the other hand she was becoming addicted to the feeling of strength that was growing inside her. She looked at the avatar and decided it didn't actually look any bigger, perhaps it was just gaining density and getting stronger. That was ok, wasn't it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a thoughtful smile, Laura nodded her head at the idea of becoming even stronger than she had expected while still growing huge muscles.  Giggling lightly at the prospects, she decided that working out was too much fun to stop.  After all, she only had two workouts in and she was already seeing some dramatic changes.  With Greg pushing her and the idea of Jason enjoying her with strong bulging muscles, Laura finally laughed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf working out is accelerating my strength gains, then I can hardly wait to see what this week holds.  This really is going to be a blast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura decided to hit the books for the classes she had that week at the community college so she could get her homework out of the way before noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next week, Laura kept up her routine and just as she expected, her gains were phenomenal, especially her strength.  Greg was excited for her, but after a week was already wondering how it was possible for his little sister to continue to grow substantially stronger every day.  Her body was transforming rather quickly as well, along with her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura spotted a familiar text from Greg indicating there was another late morning Saturday opening and she gleefully texted back her confirmation.  The dead tired feeling after each work-out was waning, but she was still taking naps after each workout and waking feeling better, bigger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Greg had an opening, depending upon her class schedule, Laura was there.  She hadn\u2019t hooked back up with Jason, but since this was a Saturday morning work-out, she figured to drop by later this afternoon.  Putting on her ever tightening work-out clothes, Laura had to practically tug her top over her enlarged back and chest.  Shaking her head at the realization that she was truly growing bigger she was just a week ago, she skipped to her car to drive over, thinking that if the post work-out fatigue continued to decrease that she might start running over.  Reaching the gym, she walked in, heading back toward the familiar private work-out area.  Instead of slumping back in near shame Laura nearly strutted as she walked through increasingly familiar faces.  Entering the workout area Greg was there waiting for her, finishing up a quick workout of his own.  He sat up from doing some bench presses and smiled at his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually look happy to be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smirked, \u201cWhat, you hadn\u2019t noticed my changing attitude?\u201d  Laura cocked her hip out with her hands on her hips, pushing her burgeoning chest outward.  While she was still no match for her sister in that department, the added muscles across her chest were pushing her small assets out further than ever.  Greg gave her a look that she had never gotten from him before.  He was clearly impressed with her physique, even though it was still not quite up to fittest women in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer strength, however, was another story.  Laura took a step forward, looking at the weights on the bar.  \u201cSo how much do you have on there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stood up and turned toward the weight.  \u201c240 pounds.  Nothing too heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded.  \u201cWell maybe I can start with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nearly choked.  \u201cWhat?  You were nowhere near that two days ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \u201cNot the weight silly, the workout.  I can start with a bench press.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, not used to being knocked off guard like that, but clearly showing that he was unsure of just how strong she had grown, let out a sigh and turned toward the bar to start removing some weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when we did the bench press last you were at 95 pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, reaching the other side and removing some plates.  \u201cRight.  So let\u2019s try 135 today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg paused.  \u201c135?  Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg knew she had been growing stronger every day, but in the back of his mind he was having a hard time admitting it.  There was really no logical explanation and every time he asked Laura she shrugged her shoulders or giggled, giving him all the credit.  She had guffawed when he mentioned steroids and gave him a quizzical look when he mentioned human grown hormones.  Could this really all be happening naturally?  It seemed improbable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled as he paused.  \u201cWell, yeah, to start anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding back another giggle, Laura fixed up her side as Greg shook his head and did the same for his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sat down, scooted herself back and reached up to the bar as Greg spotted her.  Giving Greg a quick grin, Laura concentrated and reaching up, pulled the weight off the rack as Greg held on, allowing her to control the weight.  Laura let out a sigh as she could feel the heaviness, but was sure she could handle it.  Nodding her head, she slowly allowed the weight down to her chest and holding the bar down as it touched her pectorals, she breathed in and out a few times and then slowly began to push upward until her arms locked.  Smiling now, she held the weight there for a moment and allowed the weight back down, moving toward a second repetition.  As Greg watched from above, Laura moved through a set of 12, only struggling a bit at the last one as he helped her rack the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sat up quickly and pulled her arms back and forth to stretch her chest.  \u201cThat felt great!  I\u2019m pretty sure I could bench more than that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg paused so he didn\u2019t stammer.  \u201cWell, we\u2019ll follow a routine here.  Three sets, larger weights if you can handle it, the last set to failure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a breath, now fully into her workout regiment, she followed whatever Greg recommended.  \u201cSounds good.  Let\u2019s keep going.  You told me we had a couple of hours so I want to make the most of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was astounded when they increased her bench to 145 for another set of 12 and then on to 155 pounds, where she did ten repetitions before she couldn\u2019t continue.  Only a week ago she couldn\u2019t bench press the bar 12 times.  This kind of strength gain was beyond incredible.  And she just seemed to keep on growing stronger.  Every station saw an increase in weight and Laura seemed to be able to bull through anything he had to offer.  Finishing with some curls, Greg gave her more weight than he thought her capable of, just as a test, and she STILL was able to push through 6 repetitions with each arm using 80 pounds!  He began to wonder if he was actually holding her back!  He was no math expert, but he figured that if she kept up at this pace she\u2019d be nearly as strong as him in a couple of weeks!  As Laura finished her curls, she looked into the large mirror and flexed up a double bicep that caused Greg\u2019s eyes to widen.  Her biceps were nearly the size of baseballs!  Laura released her flex, panting.  Grabbing a towel she wiped the sweat off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, thanks Greg!  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be sore by the time I get home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg simply nodded as his apprentice packed up her gym bag and headed for the door.  Laura turned toward Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, same time tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled, trying not to feel a bit intimidated by his little sister.  \u201cYeah, if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a breath and smiled back.  \u201cYou know it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking toward the car she could feel her muscles start to cramp a bit and pulled out her water to take another drink.  Climbing into the car she drove home and was able to make it up the stairs without too much effort, but was still happy to reach her room and find her bed.  Laura woke when her phone toned with an incoming text.  Yawning, she reached over to see it was from Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you coming over tonight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled.  She was looking forward to seeing Jason after her week of muscle growth.  She then noticed a warning symbol at the top and pulled it down to see it was from the Alternations Ap stating that the baseline stats had changed again.  Opening the Ap, she saw her weight was up to 420 pounds, only increasing by 10 pounds.  Looking over other stats she saw that in fact her muscles in her final form were a bit bigger than before, but not by very much.  Curious, she saw another blinking warning symbol at the bottom and pressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrength stats increasing dramatically due to outside stimuli. Recalibration of physical make-up now being pushed outside of established human capabilities.<br>\r\n Unexpected changed expected to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura closed the Ap and paused.  What exactly were these unexpected changes going to be?  It was clear she was growing stronger every day.  What was going to happen when she became stronger than Greg?  Stronger than anyone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off her concern, she texted Jason back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bet.  See u at 7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she looked up at the ceiling, imagining what she would do if she did grow stronger than anyone.  And what Jason would think when her muscles grew bigger than Greg\u2019s.  She began to wonder.  Should she let Greg know what was happening?  No, not now.  He would likely just want to use it on himself.  What about Jason?  Could he keep her secret?  If her gains continued, could she?  Sitting up, the soreness was gone and her energy levels rose.  Laura stood up and stretched, talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething to think about as I get ready.  I\u2019ll have to come up with an explanation for Jason I suppose.  Or maybe just play coy.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura lay staring at the ceiling for a while, thinking about what was coming, smiling.  She was looking forward to it, even with all the awkward explanations she was going to have to make.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stripped and looked herself over in the mirror.  Her body was definitely changing.  Her shoulders were a little wider and looked solid, and she could feel the beginning of a six-pack on her stomach, just under a thin layer of baby fat, which seemed thinner than it used to.  Her legs were firmer and shapely with sculpted muscle and her butt was ... whoa, very nice.  She already looked like she had a body people would describe as 'athletic'.  She flexed a bicep and smiled at the baseball sized lump that swelled up in her arm.  Maybe a little more than athletic.  Even her breasts looked larger, as she stood with her hands on her hips and rotated her torso left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped on the scale and saw she weighed 111.  Somehow she was disappointed with that, a gain of six pounds didn't seem that impressive compared to all her other changes, but she realized it was almost a pound a day, right on schedule to put on 315 pounds in the course of a year, especially if most of the growth was back-loaded.  She was sure she'd lost some fat too, so her muscle gain was probably more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe admired her changes for a little longer, getting more and more excited about what was coming, but eventually she threw on her robe and walked down the hall to the shower.  She washed herself slowly, exploring the new shapes of her body with delight.  The differences were more obvious by touch than by looking in the mirror, all over her  body bulges and ridges of hard, solid muscle were growing just below the surface of her skin.  She felt them all, rock solid and beautifully shaped.  She could almost feel them growing and swelling under her hand.<br>\r\nShe explored her new body for a long while, but eventually she cut her shower short when the water started to get cold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to her room and dressed quickly, pulling on a tight pink t-shirt that barely fit anymore, and some shorts.  It was early, just after 5, but she was bored and starving so ran downstairs to raid the refrigerator, then head to Jason's early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful day and she decided to take her bike over.  She had totally recovered from her workout that morning and felt restless and full of energy, the thought of cycling over sounded perfect.  It felt so good to push her legs hard against the pedals, accelerating quickly.  Greg had worked her whole body that morning, legs included, but she didn't care, it felt great to push them hard.  Soon she was going very fast, keeping up with traffic fast.  She'd never rode this fast before, except maybe down a steep hill.  It was scary, but exciting, especially the thought that her muscles were propelling her with this amazing speed.  She reached her hand down to rest on her pumping thigh.  She could feel the muscles in it bunching and flexing as she pushed the pedals around, like a powerful caged animal under her skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time she was pulling up into Jason's driveway.  There were no cars, he was probably home alone, but the front door was open, and she'd been there a thousand times so she let herself in and walked up to his bedroom door.  Surprisingly that was locked, and as soon as she tried to turn the handle there was a burst of noise and activity from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... Just a second!\" Jason's voice came through the closed door and she heard what sounded like someone jumping around frantically behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's just me, I came a little early, let me in, you dork!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L... Laura?\" replied Jason from behind the door, a note of panic in his voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is your door locked, loser?\"  She banged on it again.  \"Come on, let me in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of thumping and shuffling sounds she heard the lock click on the door, and let herself in.  Inside Jason was looking flustered and nervous, sitting on the edge of his bed awkwardly with a pillow in his lap.  He looked like he was about to pass out when he saw her upgraded physique stretching the fabric of her too tight t-shirt.  She smiled inwardly, remembering his reaction when she told him she was going to start working out.  Suddenly it dawned on her why he was locked in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew!  Jase!  Were you whacking off???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed almost purple and froze like a rabbit caught in an open field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!  You're disgusting!\" she laughed, not really offended, but not ready to pass up an opportunity like this to give her friend a hard time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's see what turns our boy on.\" she said, grabbing at his ipad.  His hand reached out to protect the evidence, and they both grabbed it at the same time.  Of course a tug-of-war ensued.  They had been friends for ages, and this certainly wasn't the first time they struggled to take an item away from the other.  Laura usually did fairly well at it, her speed, feisty nature and persistence making up for her being smaller and weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious very quickly to both of them that things had changed.  Jason had to grab the tablet with both hands to keep her from pulling it from his grasp.  He snatched it away from her, then stood up and held it away from her, up too high for her to reach.  He tried to keep her away with his spare hand, but she pushed his arm away easily overpowering his arm with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to something Greg had said to her at the gym that morning when she benched 155 for almost ten reps.  'A lot of guys can't do that, even after months of training.'  Jason didn't train at all, and he wasn't a particularly athletic guy.  Could she be stronger than Jason already?  Even thinking about how that might be a got her incredibly excited.  And she had to admit, it was really turning her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled wickedly and pushed him backwards onto the bed, following him, sitting on him and pinning his hands to the bed, the ipad forgotten for now.  She held his arms tight and felt him squirm, but he couldn't move!  She WAS stronger than he was!  She loved it, and even though he looked terrified, something told her he loved it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura!  Get off!  Let me go!\" he squealed as he squirmed and tried to knock her off of him.  Unfortunately, though she was certainly stronger than him, she was still only 111 pounds, and he was almost able to buck her off of him.  She grabbed him around his mid-section with her legs, squeezing to try to hold on.  His face went purple and his voice changed to a strangled wheeze, \"Laura... stop... can't ... breathe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let up on the pressure a little, and smiled, then reached for the ipad.  Panic crossed his face and he tried to slap it out of her hands, but she squeezed her thighs together a little tighter and deflected his weak efforts with her strong arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh.. I want to see what you've been whacking off to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the ipad and resumed the video he'd been watching.  A hugely muscular blonde woman, topless, was wrestling a smaller man.  Wrestling wasn't the right move, she was dominating him.  Torturing him and making him kiss and lick her body as she flexed.  She looked at the channel, it was all videos of muscular women, female bodybuilders, some of them working out, some posing, some wrestilng men, arm wrestling.  All of the women were ripped with thick muscle all over their body, all far more muscular and bigger than she was.  Than she was right now, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Jase.  You must really love it when I overpower you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up off of him slowly, a little stunned at her discovery, scrolling through video after video of muscular women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to distract her, change the subject, but with one burning question in his mind, Jason wheezed out, \"Laura, how?  How did you get so strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I started working out.\"  She flexed her bicep for him, nearly tearing the sleeve of her tight t-shirt.  He stood up from the bed almost in a trance and slowly reached a hand out to touch the muscle, caressing it gently.  She really liked that, she felt a shiver run all through her body.  Suddenly he leaned in to kiss the muscle, just like the guy in the video.  She pulled back and pushed him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK, not saying never, but that's a little to much for right now.\" she chided, teasing him.  It snapped him out of his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, bullshit Laura.  Nobody gets that strong that fast.  Whatever, you don't want to tell me, fine.  I thought we were friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and despite her best judgement decided to share her secret about the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK OK, don't cry about it.  You're never going to believe me anyways.  I found this iphone app.  It lets me change people's bodies.\"  She smiled a little, knowing how stupid it sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK fine, look you better go if you're going to be a jerk about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, I swear!  Look\"  she pulled out the app and brought up Jason's profile, then adjusted it so he was three inches taller, immediate change.  He shot up immediately, his jaw slack with amazement.  She had to admit the extra height looked good on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy!  Shit!  It works!  Laura, that's incredible!  Oh my God, you have got to do me!  Make me big, as big as Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for the phone to grab from her hand, but she shoved him back away from her, almost knocking him down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I know you want to wrestle again, but I'm pretty sure you aren't getting this phone away from me.  Chill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about her options as she talked to him.  She had to admit the thought of Jason as a big muscle god, bigger than Greg was definitely turning her on, especially now that she knew he was hot for her.  On the other hand, she loved being stronger than him, and the thought of how much stronger she'd be next week, or the week after that was driving her crazy.  Plus, the phone could do literally anything to him.  Maybe there were some other modifications she could have some fun with?</span></div></div>",

Give me big muscles too. We can be super buff together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth between Laura's legs was growing into a fire picturing her friend with a beefy body but she continued to hold back her base desires. \"Alright look. I can't just give you a huge body right now. Don't you think your friends, your family, everyone would notice if you went from a buck fifty to Greg's size overnight? People would know something was up and I don't want this secret to get out. Can you imagine if Jasmine got her hands on something like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shuddered at the mention of his twin sister. Of all the bullies that tormented Jason over the years the worst by a long shot was his jock of a sister. Jasmine, like Jason, was tall but she was also athletic, strong, beautiful and fairly mean when it came to her dorky brother. Jasmine seemed to give Jason a hard time simply because they were twins yet so different, as if she was embarrassed to be related to him and needed to distance herself as much as possible. Jason and Laura would always joke about their physically gifted siblings but it was clear to both of them that Laura's brother was far more supportive than Jason's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, fine. If Jaz got ahold of this it would be a disaster. But look at you, you're clearly bigger now and you got there much faster than you should have been able. How is that fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded. \"I set myself up to grow slowly for a whole year, but it turns out my workouts are messing with the program and I've been getting bigger faster which is also making my end goal bigger.\" Now Jason's erection was at full attention and he was even absentmindedly rubbing at it. Laura couldn't help but giggle to herself, <i>He's trying to imagine just how big I'm going to get.</i> \"I'm willing to put you on a similar growth plan but you need to stay out of the gym. Of course you'll tell everyone that you're working out to explain your constant growth, but don't really go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean that you're going to stop working out too?\" There was a bit of disappointment in Jason's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled wickedly. \"Hell no. I'm feeling way too good to stop. But I don't want your growth to get out of control. Besides, I'm willing to bestow some benefits on you for good behavior.\" She unlocked her phone and adjusted Jason's penis taking it from the already impressive 8 inch erection he was currently sporting to a full foot long monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the apply button and just as Jason was about to ask what she meant by benefits his eyes rolled back in his head and he began to moan. Now Jason's hand was all over his crotch feeling his member swell beneath his fingers. A second later the pressure inside his pants was too much to take and without even thinking he opened his fly and exposed his new penis which throbbed to the beat of his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" he said wrapping his fingers around his cock and giving a few pumps. The Jason that had been embarrassed to have been caught jerking off a mere 10 minutes ago was long gone and now he was brimming with confidence. His body would no longer be a thing to be ashamed of but rather a canvass to paint a masterpiece upon, a plaything to use for ultimate pleasure and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you like it.\" Laura said watching Jason play with his new toy. \"It's just the beginning. I can make it way longer, and thicker too. And not just that I can change anything, and I will. All you have to do is be a good boy and do as I say. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Sounds very good.\" Jason said. \"May I have some muscles too, please? I can deal with slow growth if that's the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Laura opened Jason's profile again and began increasing his muscle mass until he was a solid 300 pounder. She then programmed his growth to match her own: completion in a year with slow growth to start and quicker gains on the back end. She hit apply and grinned. \"In one year you'll be bigger than Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger?\" Jason gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way bigger.\" Laura confirmed. \"Now then, are we going to play some video games or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason begrudgingly tucked his penis back into his pants as best he could and turned on his TV. He and Laura sunk into their old routine quickly and hours went by without either one even mentioning their changes or the phone app. As the hours floated by, however, Laura noticed that she was still incredibly turned on. This was becoming a regular thing for her recently as her sex drive was strangely cranked up to 11.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time 11:00 PM rolled around the fire in Laura's loins was a full blown inferno and she knew that she either had to duck out of Jason's house or she was going to jump on him and put his new dick to good use. She looked down and saw that she was tensing her arms and chest so much that her veins had risen to the surface and her shirt looked plastered onto her torso. Her nipples had tightened and, since she was braless, showed through with enough clarity that she could even make out the small bumps on her areola. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told her rational mind didn't want to have sex with Jason, not yet anyway; she didn't feel ready. The problem was that her rational mind was slowly vanishing leaving only her pure raging id which was going to take whatever it wanted. She felt a bead of sweat roll down the side of her face and that was the last straw. Laura leapt to her feet and looked Jason in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, are you- whoa!\" Something about her appearance brought Jason's mind to a halt and he sat there waiting to see what the expanding teen's next move would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sucked in a deep breath and let it out slowly. Then, without a word, she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without a word Laura turned and ran out of Jason's room, down the stairs and out the front door where she jumped on her bike and peddled away. Her mind was practically a complete blank and she pumped her legs faster and faster propelling her and her bike faster than she ever thought possible, faster even than she had ridden to Jason's house earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her conscious mind began to return Laura found herself standing outside of the gym where Greg worked. The lights were out and there was no one around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing here?\" she asked aloud though she already knew the answer. She approached the door and fished her keys out of her pocket. Greg had given her a spare key in the event that she had to meet him early in the morning before official gym hours. She let herself in and went quickly to the back room and began an impromptu workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was five hours of the most intense and grueling activity Laura had even put herself through. Her body was overflowing with pent up sexual frustration and she needed to burn that energy off. She did this by moving from station to station and pounding out as many reps with as much weight as she could muster. She didn't even pay attention to how much she was putting onto the various machines and bars. All she knew was sometimes weights weren't heavy enough so she added more and more until she really felt challenged. She knew this was dangerous to do alone but she didn't care, it wasn't even a choice she just pounded out rep after rep until her body was dripping with sweat and she was screaming at the top of her lungs. Three hours in to her manic spree Laura realized that she was having an orgasm and had been for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, sometime after 4 in the morning Laura dropped the dumbbells she held in her hand to the floor with a thud and stood panting for a moment. She decided that she'd had enough and needed to get home. Unfortunately she hadn't taken more than half a dozen steps toward the door when the fatigue and soreness that usually held off until she got home attacked her body and made even the slightest motion agony. Perhaps it was because of how hard she had pushed her body or even the length of her workout but it became obvious very quickly that there was no way she was going to be able to take a single step more. Instead she simply collapsed where she stood and passed out on the floor of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke around 7:30 and actually felt good. Really good, in fact. She stood up feeling a new energy rushing through her body from head to toe. She looked around and saw that she was still the only person in the gym, but that could change at any second since the gym opened at 8:00 and the openers would be in soon to do their morning duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to leave then caught a glimpse of herself in the giant mirror to her right. \"Oh shit!\" she said then approached her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was noticeably larger. In fact her shirt, merely tight the night before, had ripped open and several 3-4 inch holes were visible along her sides beneath her arms and around her shoulders. Her shorts were painted on to her muscular ass and her thighs and quads were beginning to show some real definition. Laura raised her arms and flexed a pair of biceps that were now larger than baseballs, each having added at least a full inch to their circumference in a single night. As she tightened her flex her sleeves split open as her shirt was further destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to stop this,\" she said knowing she had no intention of doing so. As much as she dreaded having to explain her impossible gains to Greg or anyone else who asked she relished her power and size even more. Her body was incredible and literally getting more amazing by the day. \"Alright, I'll keep doing my workouts but maybe next time I get horny I'll just have sex instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laura heard cars parking behind the gym and she dashed for the front entrance which she locked behind her. She jumped on her bike and zoomed home covering the 6 miles in about 10 minutes. Less than halfway home she felt her shorts split open in the back but decided she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home she ate a large breakfast then went up to her room where she stripped naked and began performing various poses and flexes in front of her mirror. The posing led to touching of her various muscles which in turn led to masturbating and she had gotten herself so turned on with her own physique that she had herself coming in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began trying on various clothes to see what fit and what didn't. Laura had a blast flexing her way out of the clothes that were now too small; there were several shirts that she was able to pop the sleeves on and a few others that split open down the back when she spread her lats. The very fact that she now had lats to spread was hugely erotic and nearly sent her back into another masturbation session. Instead her phone buzzed and distracted her. When she checked it she found a text message from Greg saying that something had come up and he'd have to cancel their session for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today can be your rest day which is a good chance to recover and add some size to your muscles.\" the text read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \"You have no idea what you're in for.\" She responded back that she was okay taking a day off but that it had better only be a day, no more. In truth she was kind of glad to not go back to the gym so soon after her... episode from the night before. She decided instead that this would be a good day to cruise the beach and begin to show off her new body. She slid into a red bikini that she'd had for nearly 2 years but never worn and left her home through the back door and onto the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hot day and the beach was a very popular destination and everywhere that Laura went she could feel eyes roaming the burgeoning bulges of her body. Every now and then she would glance down to watch her quads shiver and harden with each step she took and she made sure to push her weight onto her toes to flex her calves. She grinned to herself when she saw one guy elbow his buddy and point to her. When the buddy smiled and nodded his approval Laura's heart soared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked quite a distance and realized before long that she was approaching Jason's house. This realization was followed by a sighting of Jason's twin sister Jasmine sitting in a beach chair surrounded by various hunks and bombshells. Jasmine herself was wearing a black one piece that matched her dark hair. There was a hole cut in the stomach of her swimsuit and the deep crevices of her six pack were clearly visible even at a distance. She was applying lotion to her long muscular legs which were powerful enough to make her a state champion sprinter and sexy enough to melt the hearts of any man who laid eyes on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine had a smug grin on her face as a bodybuilder type talked her up though it was fairly obvious she was hardly listening to what he had to say. That grin vanished from her face, however, when Jasmine set eyes on Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does she recognize me?</i> Laura wondered. <i>Or is she just intimidated by another athletic woman?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither possibility got Laura excited so she blew Jasmine a kiss, then waved and continued on her way. The dark haired beauty sneered back but Laura hardly noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or so later Laura felt a hand on her shoulder and she turned to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Laura continued to walk, she had thought that perhaps she had already reached Jasmine's size.  If that were the case she surmised she was likely stronger, which caused her to smile.  Thinking further about that, Laura was about to reach for her phone in her side pack when she felt a hand on her shoulder that caused her to jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell was that little kiss all about?  You think you're funny?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned quickly and the hand slipped away, but was quickly formed into a fist alongside a very fit body and angry face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at Jasmine and smirked.  She really must have done a number on her massive, yet fragile ego to cause Jasmine to actually follow her down the beach.  Jasmine certainly looked as stunning as Laura expected from her long distance glance.  At 5 foot 9 she was several inches taller than Laura and with her long, silky deep dark hair framing her hauntingly beautiful features it often seemed unreal that she was Jason's twin.  Jasmine's athletic muscles were all tensed as if she were ready for a fight.  Laura finally giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jasmine, don't you recognize me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's frown slowly moved toward a surprised look of wonder and then back to a thoughtful glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Laura?  What the'.  How did you get'..  What happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tried not to laugh, but still let off a quick guffaw.  'I've been working out.  Do you like the results so far?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled up her right arm and flexed her bicep, enjoying both the feeling of strength that seemed to flow through her body every time she tensed her muscles and the expansion that occurred when she squeezed her fist.  A large, rippling bicep rose to the surface that consolidated into a mass that to Jasmine's horror looked as big, if not bigger than her own!  Heck, she could see the split between the bicep muscles and the hardness made her jealous.  Jasmine could only continue to struggle to put together a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, yeah, huh, pretty good I guess.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked over at the impressive mound of muscle herself and nodded her own approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, it seems like I can build up muscles pretty fast.  Greg is training me.  He's a great coach.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded absently, still trying to process the impressive physique of his wimpy brother's once equally wimpy friend.  She swore when she saw Laura a week ago there wasn't any indication she had been working out.  Laura continued to revel in Jasmine's befuddlement and released her flex.  With Jasmine on the ropes, she figured to dig the knife a bit deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, and now Jason has started working out as well.  I'm sure he'll catch up to me soon enough.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pulled Jasmine out of her stupor and she spat a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That little worm?  He's more likely to lift a controller than a weight.  I wouldn't get your hopes up that he'll be joining you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura responded with a sweet smile, trying not to laugh as she knew that in less than a month Jason would be bigger than his twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we'll see I guess.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused, waiting to see if Jasmine had anything else to add as she kept her happy smile and stared into Jasmine's deep blue eyes.  Jasmine, lost in thought, finally shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, uh, I need to get back home to my guests.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head and placing her hands on her hips, tensed her muscles to give Jasmine a good look at her broad shoulders, thick chest, wide back, six pack abs, and rippling thighs.  Laura was sure she was a match for Jasmine and knew that she would quickly surpass her as well.  Jasmine's face appeared to be drained of color, which only caused Laura's smile to widen as it was clear that Jasmine was making the same conclusions.  Laura chuckled as Jasmine remained frozen in her spot even after indicating she was leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OK Jasmine, I'm sure I'll see you around.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded weakly and forced a smile she really didn't want to make and turned away.  Her walk was rather slow as if the wind had been taken out of her sails.  Which, Laura thought, wasn't far from the truth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jasmine was far enough away, Laura pulled her phone out and noticed the familiar warning from the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, yeah, working out will mess with stuff.  I get it already.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiping the warning away without reading it, she looked up at the now distant Jasmine and decided to pull up her profile.  She thought about messing with her, to maybe cause her muscles to shrink a bit.  But when she pulled up the Ap, an information icon came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura read it she was surprised to see'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I haven\u2019t even pulled her up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura read the information bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE:  Due to identical genetic codes, changes made to one twin will be shared by the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s heart leapt into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  That doesn\u2019t make sense!  They\u2019re not identical, their fraternal.  The ap is screwed up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a near panic, Laura pulled up Jasmine\u2019s profile and the image of Jasmine as she was now hovered above the screen.  Looking at the menu, Laura nervously found the button that indicated what she would look like after the program was complete and nearly dropped the phone.  Jasmine was gigantic!  Bigger than Jason would become, bigger than she would be!  Her muscles looked unreal they were so large!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, oh no, oh no.  I need to fix this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cleared off the hovering muscle beast and when she went to the menu quickly discovered that the profile was locked and another information bar popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChanges in process.  Profile cannot be altered until changes are complete.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gulped.  That wouldn\u2019t be for nearly a year!  Laura bit her lip, trying to figure out what to do.  Her already troubled thought only grew worse as she spoke out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if she works out?  She\u2019ll only grow stronger as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood there for a moment in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering her thoughts, she continued to work into the Ap to try and fix things, finally reaching a Help menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was surprised to find she could actually send an inquiry in and quickly typed that there was an error with Ap concerning twins.  She frantically typed in that fraternal twins did not have the same genetic code so they should not be locked together.  She nervously stared at the screen as the message was sent.  The sound of an e-mail rang and Laura quickly looked to see it was the Alternation Ap Helpdesk.  She opened it to see:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour inquiry has been sent to the helpdesk.  A response is normally returned within 3 business days.  Please do not respond to this e-mail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  She wanted more than just a response in 3 days. As she fiddled with Ap menus a bit more, she felt that there didn\u2019t appear to be anything she could do just now.  Her only hope for the moment was that in a few days she could fix everything and get Jasmine off the program.  Looking up at the beach and sniffing to herself about the irony of having the wind knocked out of HER sails, Laura headed for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Jasmine walked toward her house the angrier she grew.  How?  How on earth could that little pipsqueak grow so big so quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she reached her house, she sent everyone away and heading to her room, grabbed her workout clothes and drove to the gym.  She never needed a workout more than now.  Walking in there was no surprise that the gym was deserted.  It was the week-end and a beautiful day to match.  But Jasmine didn\u2019t care and looked around the gym like a hungry lioness.  Somehow she felt energized, emboldened.  Looking at the squat machine, she decided to start there, setting it up for 200 pounds.  She stood under the bar and letting out a few breaths, pulled the bar off the latch and moved down.  As she moved back up she noticed that the weight felt lighter than normal.  Smiling to herself, she had a feeling that maybe good things were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine went through a grueling circuit that would cause even the most hardcore bodybuilders to give up.  She grinned with evil satisfaction as she broke every lifting record she had.  And not just by a few pounds, but by 50 or 60.  Sweat rolled down her face and her athletic bra was not just growing snug but was drenched as well.  But she didn\u2019t care; she could only feel the overly happy, smug smile of Laura staring at her.  Taking a quick break to get some water, she glanced at herself in a posing mirror and pulled up her arm and flexed.  Her eyes widened.  Was her arm bigger?  Not just a bit larger due to the pump from a work-out, but noticeably larger and harder as well.  That bicep flexed up by Laura was no longer looking so impressive against her gun!  Whatever was happening, she wanted more.  She\u2019d show up Laura!  Looking up at pictures of the weightlifters, bodybuilders and gym records, her resolve renewed.  She\u2019d show up everyone!  Smiling wickedly she pulled in a few breaths and tore into the weights again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed and still Jasmine continued.  Every new circuit saw incredible weight increases, more than Jasmine would have ever thought possible.  She felt like a woman possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jasmine didn\u2019t know was that the Ap had been set up to give large gains to Jason, someone with small muscles and poor genetics who wouldn\u2019t need to work-out.  Jasmine on the other hand already had large muscles and was gifted with incredible muscle building genetics.  The program established by the Ap was like a super steroid to someone like Jasmine.  And along with her incredible stamina, Jasmine was pushing herself harder than anyone had ever pushed themselves before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter yet another circuit, the manager of the gym left, waving from a distance, knowing that Jasmine would lock up behind her.  Jasmine gave him a quick nod of acknowledgement and continued working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of her fourth time around the gym, Jasmine smiled as she stared up at the bar.  She normally knew better than to perform bench presses without a spotter, but she was in a zone and wasn\u2019t about to worry about safety when she just knew she was continuing to grow stronger.  Pushing the bar off the rack she smiled as the 650 pounds she was staring up at felt manageable.  The drenched material of her sports bra was already overstressed and ripped up the sides.  Jasmine cared little about that as the weight was slowly lowered and her chest pumped up to newfound levels of awesomeness.  Her pectorals bristled and grew ever stronger as the bar neared her pumped up tits.  She grit her teeth as the cold steel touched her hot breasts that had somehow grown larger as well, given incredible strength and power.  Laughing as the bar could only dig into her super boobs enough to make a small dent, Jasmine powered the bar back up, pumping her mighty pecs up 4 inches thick, shredding the athletic bra and fully exposing her mega muscled, awe inspiring chest.  Knocking out several more reps, Jasmine racked the weight with a loud clang and breathed heavy.  Jasmine sat up and wiped the sweat from her face, took a few breaths and moved on to the next station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two more circuits, Jasmine sat on a bench breathing hard.  She glanced up at the clock.  Six and half hours.  She had been working out for six and half hours.  Smiling, she stood up and walked back to the posing mirror.  She was topless and the shorts had torn up the middle.  Jasmine smiled as she looked at her body in the mirror.  Her large sprinter thighs now flexed out with hard, detailed rippling muscles with distinct quads bigger and more cut than any man in her gym.  Placing one foot forward she twisted her foot on her toes and smirked at the bulging calf muscle flexed up bigger than a softball!  Placing her foot back down she tensed her stomach.  Her hard six pack was now an awe inspiring 8 pack of thick bricks on a still narrow mid-section.  Detailed oblique muscles framed her magnificent abs, curving out toward wide, thick lats.  A quick turn and a flex of her upper body pushed out her pectorals and perfectly melded breasts out nearly a foot away from her torso!  Bristling, striated pectorals shelved hard, perfectly shaped breasts.  Jasmine\u2019s body was now a symphony of female muscles and her strength was now greater than any woman and nearing that of the strongest men.  Pulling up her right arm, Jasmine grinned wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!  That little bitch thinks she\u2019s got a bicep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine\u2019s bicep pumped upward, expanding up into a biology perfect mound of peaked up muscle!  She had added four inches to her biceps and they now bulged up to 16 inches of hard, raw power.  The size was incredible for a woman with her frame, but it was the strength she now possessed that would scare away most anyone.  With a satisfied sigh, Jasmine released her flex and turned toward the shower, the fatigue of the mega workout finally settling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was unexpected.  I have to wonder if my gains are somehow connected to Laura\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a devious smile, Jasmine headed for the showers.  \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet my brother knows something about this as well.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The icy water ran down her skin giving her goosebumps and making it so tight that it almost appeared as though her muscles were growing right before her eyes. After soaping and rinsing the sweat from her body she stood and lost herself to thought: she had to find out what Jason knew. Her first instinct was to just find him and beat the information out of him, she grinned as she pumped her mighty arms a few times and thought about how much easier it would be to out and out dominate her much weaker brother. Jasmine thought back to the 650 pound bench press she had just done and began to massage the warmth between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could lift that pipsqueak over my head with one hand no problem,\" she said to herself while rubbing her vagina faster and harder. \"Him in one hand and his wannabe friend in the other.\" She sucked her lower lip into her mouth and leaned her head back as the wave of an orgasm rolled through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine took a minute to let her breathing and her pulse return to normal before turning the water off and pulling clean clothes out of her backpack. She just managed to squeeze into her white halter top and denim cut-offs, but her shorts groaned with disapproval over the situation they were put in. Jasmine put on her flip flops, left the gym, and drove home with the full intention of waking Jason from his sleep and using her profound new strength to find out what was going on with her and Laura. When she arrived home, though, she had a different thought: what if the direct approach backfires and somehow Laura is able to get the drop on her? Maybe it would be better to gather more information first before revealing herself. Besides, Jasmine was feeling very tired all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged her body to her bedroom and collapsed into her bed falling asleep almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning Jasmine awoke at 7:00AM feeling completely refreshed. Also, she had a plan. Making sure Jason was still asleep she, quietly as she could, crept downstairs and out of the house. For once she was glad to have fallen asleep still fully clothed as she was saved a step, she needed to get out and back before Jason woke up. To avoid waking him she decided not to take her car since she was parked right outside his bedroom window. Instead she hopped on her bicycle and began peddling faster than she thought was possible. Her long muscular legs propelled her nearly as fast as the sparse surrounding traffic. As she rode she noticed quite a few heads turn in her direction, a feeling she was somewhat used to but not nearly on the scale she was getting now with her pumped up muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes after leaving her house Jasmine was arriving at the strip mall 3 miles away. She slid her hands over her rock hard quads and scoffed at how easy the ride was. \u201cI feel like I could go twice as fast all day long.\u201d she said before sauntering her way into the huge department store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine quickly found what she was looking for: a baby monitor. She took her purchase to the cashier, a skinny college kid who never once looked her in the eye and instead was mesmerized by her shoulders, arms and chest. Once her transaction was complete Jasmine called the kid out on his lack of customer service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must really like what you see, you haven\u2019t looked at my face once.\u201d Jasmine said with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier turned bright red and looked down at his feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019d better be sorry. You don\u2019t want to make me mad, I could crush your throat with one hand.\u201d To prove her point Jasmine raised her arm and flexed her 16 inch bicep. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll just rip your nuts off. Think you can stop me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just kidding with you,\u201d the buff beauty broke out in a fit of giggles. \u201cHere, do you want to feel my arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI.. uh\u2026 no, uh, no thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine\u2019s smile vanished and her face darkened. \u201cWhat? Now you don\u2019t like my muscles? I said touch it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified the cashier\u2019s hand flew to her flexed arm in an instant. Jasmine grinned when she saw the shock in his eyes over how hard her bicep was then she closed her eyes and purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow you do like it?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Jasmine took her purchase and left leaving the poor kid with a very uncomfortable erection to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home Jasmine was relieved to find that Jason was still sleeping allowing her to slip back into her room. She unwrapped the baby monitor then she waited for Jason to leave his room for his routine morning visit to the bathroom, a challenge since patience was not her strong suit. More than 2 hours ticked off the clock as she paced around her room listening through the thin walls for signs that Jason was awake. Finally after 10 AM she heard him leave his room and enter the bathroom across the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine snuck out of her room and into Jason\u2019s where she slid his bed away from the wall and plugged the monitor in then moved the bed back leaving the transmitter underneath. She returned to her own room and powered up the receiver. The found there was a headphone jack which she opted to use to make sure her brother didn\u2019t hear himself coming over the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason returned to his room and Jasmine was excited when she realized she could hear every move he was making in perfect clarity through her headphones. Now all she had to do was wait for Laura to come over and she would be able to hear their entire conversation. Jasmine was certain that this would allow her to discover the secret of Laura\u2019s and her own expanding muscles.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since she was back on waiting duty Jasmine spent the next several hours admiring her reflection in her full body mirror. She went through a variety of posing routines watching her incredible physique come to life. She'd always loved being strong but was afraid that muscles would make her look manly. Now that she was on par with a female bodybuilder she realized that not only did she look nothing like a man but she was addicted to power. She wanted so much more size and power and could feel a burning warmth between her legs just thinking about getting back into the gym and growing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went through her closet trying on clothes to see what still fit and what looked good on her new frame. There were many articles of clothing that couldn't hope to contain her expanded body and Jasmine took great joy in flexing he way out of or ripping these to shred which she piled in the corner of her room. This only fed into her power fantasy even more causing her to feel even more turned on. As she went through her clothes she found a few combinations of that she enjoyed and displayed her magnificent body her favorite being a simple tank top and mini skirt combo that highlighted every curve and bulge she had. To complete the look she retrieved her favorite pair of high heels which not only made her already long legs look impossible but also flare her muscles, especially her calves, to a ridiculous degree. Jasmine turned her back to the mirror and folded herself in half happily discovering that her flexibility had somehow increased with her added mass. She ran her hands over the monster bulge and chiseled cleft of her calf muscles overjoyed at their shape and hardness not realizing that she was going through the exact same routine that Laura had the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Jasmine, also like Laura, could stand the heat no longer. She stripped her clothes off and collapsed on her bed fingering herself and orgasming almost instantly. She continued to play with herself for the next hour and was interrupted only by a sound from Jason's room in her earphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened closely trying to make sense of what she was hearing. It was like a rhythmic bouncing or something. Suddenly Jason let out a quick gasp then a quiet moan and Jasmine realized she was listening to her brother jerk off. She quickly pulled the earphones out and tried to settle the queasy feeling in her stomach. She held no judgements regarding him playing with himself, clearly she had just done the same, but she really didn't want to listen to her own brother do it or even imagine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo pass the time and take her mind off things she checked through Facebook and text messaged her friends letting them all know not to expect to see her out and about as she had come down with a cold and was staying locked in her room. The kept her preoccupied for a while but before long she was bored. She decided to try some exercises for a bit and keep her muscles pumped and so began a routine of sit-ups and pushups that was shockingly easy. In fact she quickly switched from standard pushups to a single hand version and still felt no challenge. She very quickly lost count which was just as well because she was interrupted by Jason's voice outside her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey sis, you ok? I haven't heard you even leave your room today?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine kept doing pushups though her voice never betrayed her exercise and remained perfectly steady. 'I'm just not feeling well. I think I caught a cold.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, bummer. Did you need me to bring you anything?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just leave me alone and let me rest, pipsqueak.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure, Jazz, whatever you say.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, around 2 in the afternoon, Jasmine was about to lose her patience entirely and punch her way through the wall into Jason's room she heard his cell phone ring. She put her earphones back in and listened with glee as her plan was set into motion:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Laura'.. yeah, come on over, I'm not doing anything''.. No, I haven't seen her all day. She says she's sick, must be too her voice sounds all husky'.. yeah, ok'' bye.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Laura's voice appeared and Jasmine listened to the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJASON: Holy shit! You're way bigger already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLAURA: Oh, you noticed. What do you think? Here feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJASON: It feels like a rock. I can't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLAURA: How has your new equipment been working out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJASON: Great, I took it for a test drive last night then again this morning. Is it wrong that I want it even bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLARUA: If you're a good little boy I'm sure we can arrange something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJASON: I can't believe your phone was able to do all of this. It's insane but here we are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's head was spinning. A phone? Laura's phone had given her muscles and, so it seemed, Jason a big dick? She didn't know what to make of that but it was clear that she needed to get Laura's phone. There was just one problem Jason said that Laura was already way bigger now than the last time he saw her. Jasmine didn't know that Jason hadn't seen Laura since her marathon workout session and that Laura's body was still the same size as the when she'd seen her at the beach the previous day. Instead Jasmine's mind raced with images of Laura with muscles that would rival her bodybuilder brother, Greg. Then her imagination raced and inflated Laura even more. She knew she had no proof of this but she couldn't help but assume that she was already hopelessly outmuscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine assumed that getting the phone should be her primary goal but perhaps she should try evening the odds by going to the gym and pumping up first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jasmine paced around her bed, contemplating her next move.  She really wanted to see what was on Laura's phone, but her concern about Laura being much larger than her was enough to keep her pacing.  As Jasmine continued to listen, the two started watching one of their stupid Anime movies, throwing out stupid comments to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine sat at the edge of her bed and sighed.  If confronting Laura right now wasn't an option, then the only thing she could think of was to work out again and outgrow Laura.  A smile formed on her face.  The idea of pumping iron and becoming even bigger and stronger sent shivers down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Jasmine pulled off the headphones and looked at the pile of ruined clothes in the corner.  Stopping back at the mall to buy some clothes to grow into would at least get her out of the house now.  She really didn't want to head to the gym at the moment as it would be fairly busy.  Jasmine wanted another session to herself, seeing as she was still wanting to keep her growth a secret.  If Justin or Laura found out, then Laura would fix whatever mistake she must have made to allow these wonderful changes.  Jasmine flexed up her arm and smiled at the hard mound of ripped muscle.  Of course, if she grew even stronger then she could intimidate anyone in the gym to keep their mouth shut.  The idea of intimidating the biggest and strongest men in the gym sent another shiver down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding her head with a plan in place, Jasmine got up, put the only work-out clothes that still fit, an overstressed black stretchable ensemble and quietly snuck out.  Not wanting to start up her car to give herself up, she grabbed the bike again, and took off back toward the mall, once again enjoying the powerful feeling the peddling provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'''''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie hit a lull, Laura turned toward Jason with a thoughtful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I need to tell you something else about the phone and Jasmine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grew concerned based upon Laura's sudden shift in attitude.  'Um, OK.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed and filled Jason in, but not with everything, excluding the other warnings, and her own spike in strength.  Jason's eyes widened.  'So when are you expecting to receive an answer back from the help desk?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slumped.  'Two more days.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded his head.  'Well I'll make sure to get a look at Jasmine as soon as I can.  Let's hope she really is sick.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hummed an acknowledgement and turned back toward the movie.  She also decided that her best bet would be another all night work out session, even if she already had a brief work out with Greg before coming over.  She would have to throw caution to the wind and grow and fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'''''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled as she brought the oversized clothes to the checkout line.  The continued looks of astonishment she was receiving made her smile, even if she shot some of those looking a bit too long a nasty sneer that caused one man to jump.  The type of control she was already able to wheel was very satisfying.  Turning men on has always been something Jasmine enjoyed.  But being in control and making them fear her, well that was even better.  As she placed the clothes down she smirked as the eyes of the young man checking her out widened, gave her a quick once over and then dropped his stare and started to scan everything in.  As he finished and Jasmine swiped her credit card she paused as the approval took a few moments.  Leaning forward, Jasmine pressed her arms down, pushing her strong, thick pectorals and hard breasts against the thinning material.  Seeing as she wasn't wearing a bra, the tenting nipples were partially exposed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seeing as you've had such a good time checking me out, how about an opinion.  What do you think?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier nearly choked as he stared at not just the firm breasts and deep muscular cleavage on display, but the thick horseshoe triceps bulging out to seemingly impossibly dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, wow.  You must be a world class bodybuilder or something.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine laughed as she stood back up to sign the screen, glancing at the bulge in the man's jeans.  'Yeah, or something.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the bag and shooting him a superior sniff as she saw his arms shake, Jasmine turned to walk out, thinking about the work-out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping on her bike, she laughed at how quick she made it to the gym.  'Maybe I'll run next time just to see how fast I am.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking out the number of cars, she saw that there were several people there, although most were there for a quick after work exercise routine and the place would clear out within the hour.  Walking in, she signed in with nobody at the desk and headed straight for the free weight area.  There were only two men there and they appeared to be finishing up.  Both men recognized Jasmine and leered as she purposefully headed for the opposite end to avoid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to raise any suspicion, she started stretching, but was having a hard time not just tearing into the weights.  As she sat on the mat, one of the men walked up and leaned against a bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So Jasmine, how have you been?  You look, uh, good.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff, a large bodybuilder, was someone that Jasmine would flirt with a bit, but who never seemed interested.  And seeing as he was a bit older and didn't fall into her control like her other friends, her interest wasn't all that high either.  But now as both looked at each other, their thoughts were changing.  Jeff could see Jasmine was bigger and somehow even sexier, someone who he would consider to be a decent conquest.  Jasmine saw Jeff as someone to potentially compare to seeing as he was even bigger than Greg.  And also someone to potentially dominate if she continued to grow ever stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled up at the 6 foot 2 inch 275 pound mass of muscle.  'Thanks, I've been working out extra hard lately.  Do you like the results?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff's nose flared as his pulse raced and his face flushed.  An erection was quickly building, so he turned slightly in order to play cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, you're looking pretty buff.  Are you planning on working out now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine gave Jeff a smoldering look and blinked her eyes, hoping to pull Jeff in.  'Yes.  What about you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff shifted as his erection built.  'Well Paul and I just finished working out.  Don't you have a partner to help spot?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine licked her lips, sensing Jeff's growing desire.  'No, but I'll be fine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff scrunched his face.  'Well if you're going to be here a while, let me finish up with Paul, and head out for a while to run an errand.  I should be back in an hour or two if you're still here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine chuckled.  'Don't worry, I'll still be here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded.  'Good.  It may just be the two of us by then.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine continued to stare with her best come hither look.  'Yeah, I guess so.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff let out a breath and turned away and waved.  'OK, well I'll see you soon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded.  How perfect was this?  She'd have a chance to run through a few circuits and grow even stronger and larger before he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she saw Jeff and Paul leave, Jasmine headed for the squat rack, the place she started less than a day ago at 200 pounds and finished up near 900.  So with a satisfying smile on her beautiful young face, Jasmine piled on the plates until it was at 910 pounds, right where she finished up.  Standing underneath the bar, she let out a few breaths and backing away, nearly laughed.  The weight she had finished with some hard reps no longer felt so heavy.  As she back up and moved down the initial feeling was correct.  This was very manageable, almost light!  Moving back up quickly, the bar nearly jumped off her shoulders.  Nodding her head and thinking about the work-out ahead, Jasmine moved down again, excited at what lay ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine lost track of time as she continued on her weight lifting tear.  No man could hope to keep up with her pace, and now as she continued to pile on the plates for each set, there were few men, if any, who could keep up with the weights she was lifting.  As she finished a hard set of preacher curls with more weight than she had even been able to lift less than 24 hours ago, Jasmine paused to wipe off the sweat and check out her gains in the mirror.  Just like her work-out from yesterday her muscles were expanding with exciting, sexy bulges of ripped mass.  Pulling up her right arm Jasmine marveled at how much muscle was now piled across her feminine arm.  As she curled her slender fingers into a fist and tensed down her smile and excitement grew as the bicep continued to climb to new heights.  What had been a very impressive 16 inch bicep was over 20 hard, incredibly strong inches of female fury.  A pumping vein wrapped around the hard peak, across the deep bicep split and down the wide tricep belly.  Jasmine's muscle size was approaching that of some of the biggest men in the gym and considering she was 5 inches shorter than both Greg and Jeff, her bicep looked even more impressive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing as she released her flex and pulled a long drink from her water bottle, Jasmine surveyed the weights to start another circuit when she heard the door open to the gym and turned to see'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff entered the gym and nodded at the clerk at the front.  Jeff had changed into a pair of shorts and a tight blue t-shirt that accentuated his large pectorals and exposed his bulging arms.  He had waited long enough to expect Jasmine to be done with her work-out.  Walking toward the free weight area he turned around a large machine and found a smiling, massively muscled version of Jasmine staring back at him.  He froze in his tracks as his jaw dropped open.  Was she\u2026.bigger than before?  Much bigger?  And even more beautiful as well?  He stared at her with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were massive mounds of cut muscle nearly as big as his!  Her calves were bulging out on either side of her shins and looked even larger than his calves!  Jasmines quads were deeply separated and pushed out against thin skin to showcase incredible separation and feather, twitching muscled fibers.  The dark stretchable looked much lighter now as they were spread out across her monster thighs and muscular behind.  Her narrow midsection was a dense, cut 8 pack of wonder.  Never had he seen a set of abs that defined, that cut and that hard.  The damn things looked bulletproof!  And he shook as his eyes traced up to see a dramatic curve into her wider than wide lats with her large, bulging arms hanging down like two sides of beef.  Jeff gulped as he stared at her massive, impossibly muscular chest that was stretching her top to the breaking point!  Thick pectorals shelved a set of hard, strong tits with nipples that were clearly seen and ready to pop thru the top.  Jasmine smirked as she noticed where Jeff was staring and pulsed her chest up and down a few times in an intimidating dance that ripped the top in several places and caused Jeff to pant and finally look into the gorgeous deep blue eyes that centered her small nose, ruby lips, sexy smile, high cheeks, and narrow chin all framed by deep, dark raven hair that cascaded down her back and around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Jeff, ready to spot me?  I\u2019m heading to do some bench presses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff tried to calm himself as his shorts suddenly tightened.  \u201cUh, are you bigger than before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine chuckled as she reached the bench press bar and pulling off the locks, began to slide weights onto the bar.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff walked toward her.  \u201cYeah, I mean you look jacked.  Bigger than any woman I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine slid more weights on the other side and twisted the lock, smiling sweetly up at him.  \u201cOh, how sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff reached the bench press and his eyes widened.  Surely Jasmine couldn\u2019t be serious.  There was no way she could possibly bench this weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yeah.  What\u2019s going on here?  It looks like you have\u2026\u201d  Jeff paused to count as Jasmine sat down and pulled her leg over the bench.  \u201cOver 1200 pounds on there!  You couldn\u2019t possibly be able to bench that!  Hell, NOBODY could bench that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmines hummed with satisfaction as she lay down and skid back, reaching up to grip the thick metal.  \u201cI know.  Pretty awesome, huh.  Now are you going to spot me or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff stumbled forward, seemingly getting pulled in by the ridiculousness of it all, as if this were all a dream.  \u201cBut you won\u2019t even be able to move this.  What are trying to prove?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for Jeff to position himself above her, and knowing even he wasn\u2019t strong enough to effectively spot such weight, smiled as she looked up.  \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to prove, dear Jeff..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine pulled the bar off the rack before Jeff even reached his hands underneath and she pulled in a quick breath before slowly allowing the huge weight to head toward her pumped up pectorals and muscular breasts.  Jeff yelped out quickly and bent down toward the bar, fully expecting to try and save her when just as quickly Jasmine touched the bar to her rippling pecs, and pumping her muscles to new levels of thickness powered the bar back up, locking her arms with a hard exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that I\u2019m ALREADY stronger than this!  This isn\u2019t a max weight; it\u2019s what I\u2019m using to work out with!  And soon enough even this weight won\u2019t even be enough to give me a decent pump.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff pulled his hands back as true to her word, Jasmine pumped the weight up and down with machine efficiency, ripping the top in several places until she had completed a set of 12 and racking the huge weight with a deafening clang.  Jasmine sat up, breathing hard, but loving the feeling the pump gave her as she knew that she was only going to grow stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd not only that, tough guy, but these muscles are growing larger as well.  Check out my chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, Jasmine slid into a side chest pose that sent her pectorals dangerously larger, shredding the stretchable top like a ruined set of panty hose.  Her chest blasted up over her wide, detailed forearm with pectorals nearly matching his manly size all by themselves, but with her hard, perfect breasts melding into those striated pecs, her chest was even larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm, my pectorals look to be pretty close to your size already!  And I\u2019ve got lots of energy left!  I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jasmine released her mind altering flex and casually ripped off the rags of her top, his heart raced as his mind was heading toward tilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled with dominating intentions.  \u201cBecause, dear Jeff, I need to make sure that not only am I much stronger than you, but much bigger as well.  You think these lifts are impressive?  You think these muscles are large?  Well hang on to your dick, because this girl is just getting started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine laughed at the dumbfounded expression pasted on Jeff\u2019s face.  \u201cAnd then maybe we can have some fun, which is why I\u2019m sure you came back anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jasmine walked over toward Jeff and grabbing the collar on his shirt, pulled him toward the next station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the next bench, Jeff glanced back at the door.  Part of him wanted to run away, but the other part was filled with the fear of retribution if he did so.  As he watched Jasmine load up the bar, his mind churned and he decided to\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff\u2019s massive shoulders slumped a bit.  This girl had just bench pressed more weight than any man alive.  She was stronger than him by far.  Trying to get away didn\u2019t sound like the healthy option and her sexy muscles, gorgeous curves and beauty made his decision easier.  Giving Jasmine a weak smile, he moved into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHour after hour went by.  The young man at the entrance once again waved goodbye and locked the door behind him.  Jeff had desperately wanted to say something, but at this point he feared Jasmine too much for that.  How on earth could Jasmine be doing what she was doing?  Each routine only served to make her ever stronger.  Every lift added more and more muscle to her already incredibly large physique.  He could hardly believe it when Jasmine bench pressed a full ton of weight.  Heck he could hardly believe the bar could take it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood by, pretending he was really spotting her, Jasmine finished up a set of hero curls with weights that were pushing the limits of the cables as she was hefting 540 pounds with each arm!  And her biceps exploded with size that he could only imagine for himself!  She had forced him to flex his biceps to compare to hers and what seemed like a long time ago, she had reached his size of 23 inches around.  Now\u2026.  Jeff gulped at the shredded mounds of muscle bulging across her mighty limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the set, Jasmine huffed and grabbed another towel to wipe the sweat from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for another comparison?  I need to make sure that not only am I now nearly three times as strong as you, but more muscular as well!  Then nobody will be able to stop me from getting what I want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nearly shook as he knew he had to comply.  He stopped asking who and what she was talking about.  Lining up next to Jasmine, he flexed up his bicep and the familiar muscle rose up high and hard.  He was the biggest man in the gym, able to flex up 23 manly inches of bicep muscle.  He may still be the biggest man, but he feared what was coming next as he leaned down a bit and Jasmine moved behind him and pulled up her arm.  She was still much shorter and her limbs weren\u2019t as long, but when she tensed her fist, the massive muscle that rose up on her arm was outside even his class.  He watched as her bicep expanded into a literal mountain of muscle, bulging up higher and higher, eclipsing his peak with her fist minor tense along with a tricep that dipped even lower.  With a girlish grunt, Jasmine flexed harder and her bicep responded by expanding even further as her mighty peak distanced itself from his.  Her peak pushed up an inch above his, then two!  Good god, her bicep had to be over 28 inches around!  Jasmine laughed as stared at her incredible muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel my muscle Jeff, try and squeeze it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff released his flex and turned to reach up and place his hand on her massive lump of she-muscle, gripping it as best he could and the squeezing.  His eyes widened.  He squeezed again, even harder.  Jasmine\u2019s expression remained cocky bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Jeff, give it everything you\u2019ve got big guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff gulped and squeezed until his knuckles turned white, his arm shook from the effort and he thought he would cramp up.  He couldn\u2019t dent her muscle in the least!  It was like trying to squeeze solid steel!  He finally gave up and released his hand, staring at her magnificent, biology busting perfect mass of muscle with awe and wonder, causing Jasmine to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say that my muscle must be pretty hard, huh?  I mean if I can curl that much weight, my muscles must be pretty dense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine released her flex and sighed.  She glanced at the clock and saw that she had been just hit the 7 hour mark again.  Fatigue once again set in and she looked up at Jeff with lust in her eyes.  She may be done working out with iron right now, but she still had the burning down below.  A shower and some release were in order.  Whether Jeff wanted to or not!  Grabbing the perplexed but turned on Jeff by the collar again, she looked up to his worried eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, big guy, let\u2019s go get some release.  I\u2019m done with the weight room for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff followed Jasmine toward the woman\u2019s locker room, both concerned and turned on.  His conquest apparently wanted to be the conqueror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Laura had made it back to her gym and was pumping weights furiously, as her concern about Jasmine grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin had knocked on Jasmine\u2019s door a few hours ago and when she didn\u2019t answer, he looked around outside and found her bike missing.  Justin texted Laura the news and Laura grit her teeth.  Not knowing where she was or what she was doing only raised Laura\u2019s fear.  If Jasmine were lifting as well, could she really keep up?  Gains that days ago would have been exciting now seemed to not be quite enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a break, seeing as she was moving into hour five, Laura gave the ap another go.  There had to be something she could do to even the odds.  After several attempts, Laura\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Eep!\" Jason yelped as Laura grabbed his collar harshly.  She tried to pull him to his feet, but she wasn't strong enough to lift him by herself, not yet anyways.  And he was a little too slow to realize what it was she wanted and help her out, She grunted a little in frustration and shoved him backwards, hard, to his bed.  She fell on top of him hard enough to knock the wind out of him.  He felt a little roughed up and abused, but he loved it, like one of his fantasies come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on his belly and leaned against him, pressing her body against him.  She was hard, firm and solid, and he could feel her new muscle moving as she ground on top of him.  It was incredible.  She pushed her face into his and jammed her tongue into his mouth, even that was strong!  She kissed him deeply and passionately, roughly grinding her lips against his in a frenzy of sexual need.  He returned the kiss with all the intensity he could manage, but he didn't have a hope of keeping up with her frenzied lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe this was Laura!  But this wasn't the same old Laura he knew, not at all.  She was stronger and bigger, true, but also more confident, and commanding.  Dominant.  He wasn't sure what to make of it, it was all so different, but his magnificent new cock understood, and strained painfully against his shorts to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel him rising, getting hard against her tight ass and broke off her kiss, smiling like a predator as she rose to sit up higher on his hips.  Her hands reached down to take the collar of his t-shirt and tried to rip it apart, but she wasn't strong enough.  He could hear threads snapping as she tugged roughly at the fabric, but it didn't tear in half.  She swore loudly in frustration.  She wanted to be able to show off her incredible strength for him, not be beaten by a flimsy piece of fabric!  Awkwardly she reached down for the waist of his shirt and helped him pull it over his head, revealing his flabby, white body, thin arms and sunken chest.  He saw her examine him, her eyes taking him in but showing maybe a little less of the lust that she had earlier.  It wasn't slowing her down, though.  She closed her eyes and he knew she was imagining how it would all be different in even a few weeks.  She pictured his big, thick arms and the slabs of muscle she would build on his chest, all deeply tanned and cut to show ever bulging sinew.  She imagined caressing rock hard deltoids the size of cannonballs, thick, meaty pecs and down over sculpted, washboard abs and purred a little.  All Jason saw was Laura close her eyes, throw her head back and softly moan for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes she had the shock of returning to reality, but it was ok.  She knew what was coming, and it was going to be incredible.  And speaking of incredible, there was one body part she didn't need to wait for.  Humbled by her earlier attempt to shred his t-shirt, she didn't even try to pull his jeans apart.  He felt her hands go to the button of his pants, undoing it quickly and roughly pulling the waist open.  He lifted his hips as best he could with her on top of him and helped her pull the pants down, squirming his hips to help her get them off over the colossal bulge in his pants, then stripped her own shorts off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow naked, his cock stood up proudly in the dark room, hard as granite but throbbing with heat.  He had never been this hard, never been this ready to unload.  She smiled as she looked over her incredible creation and quickly pulled her own shirt over her head.  Her thick, increasingly muscular upper body glistened in the low light of the TV, still wet with perspiration from her hours of frustration and restraint.  Her small, pert breasts bounced slightly as she moved, and small nipples that looked hard enough to cut glass bobbed and danced.  Her growing muscles were tight and pumped from her hours of sexual frustration, and several small veins showed through her skin, a thick one down her biceps, more in her forearms, and some snaking across her pumped up delts.  A hint of things to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my little man likes this, doesn't he?\" she asked in a husky voice, slowly flexing her lats as she sat perched above him, bringing them out to make her seem wider than he thought possible.  \"This.\" she paused, leaving time for emphasis as she knelt straddling him, flexing her upper body, \"This is just the start.  I've been lifting for a little over a week.  Imagine what I'll look like next week.  Bigger, harder, and much much stronger.  Imagine what that will be like, when I make you do whatever I want and you can't do a thing about it?  Or the week after that?  I should look like a proper bodybuilder by then, someone who could step on stage at a national competition, flexing and strutting my outrageous physique.  I'll be as big as some of those girls you were jacking off to.  And a month or two after that I'll be bigger than all of them.  And I'll still have nine more months to grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speech was driving him to the height of desire, he lay rigid underneath her imagining everything she described.  When he felt the wave of bliss come over him it was too late to do anything about it.  The site of he exquisite body shining in the light, dancing over him.  Her words describing the goddess she was going to become, it was too much.  No amount of thinking about sports or math problems or ugly women was going to stop the eruption that was coming.  A wave of ecstasy washed over him and he felt his mighty cock shudder and twitch over and over as he came without her even touching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you?!\" she exclaimed as she saw what had happened, \"You have got to be kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god Laura, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I just ... I couldn't help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slumped down on him, laughing a little at the absurdity, her body pushing some of the air out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I don't have to worry about whether I turn  you on or not,\" she joked without humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he repeated again, wheezing slightly, feeling devastated.  He'd wrecked it, why couldn't he have had more self-control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, it's my fault.  I knew this wasn't right, I pushed it.\"  She rolled off of him a little to the side, looked over at him and pushed her hair from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... well you know.  A virgin.\" she said, somehow embarrassed to admit it, even though she knew he was too.  \"This is my first time, it should be special.  The first time is a big deal for a girl.  And come on, it's going to be so much better after we finish our transformations!  I mean, I think we should wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean wait?  Like until we're done changing?  That'll be a year!\" he protested with as little whine in his voice as he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's exactly what I mean,\" she said with a kind smile on her face.  \"I want it to be with you, Jase.  I always have.  But there are so many changes coming!  Our first time should be magic, perfect, not fumbling in the dark with thin pasty bodies.  We need to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... a year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she snapped, her commanding attitude back.  Not annoyed, but firm, confident.  Dominant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will wait for me for one year while we both grow into muscular titans like the world has never seen before.  We'll be god and goddess together.  And in the mean time you're really going to wait.  I gave this to you,\" she reached down and caressed his giant member lovingly, and felt it stiffen.  \"It's mine and you won't be using it on anyone else.  And no whacking off either!  I'm going to be ten times the woman any of those girls in the videos can dream of.  You need to save it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't say anything, but just looked at her in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't show it to another woman, unless she's your doctor, and won't touch yourself except in the shower, and just long enough to wash off.  And then when the year is up, we will take each other places we've never even dreamed of.  OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... a year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen!\" she snapped.  She sat up and straddled him again, sitting on his chest, her weight on his diaphragm.  She pushed his hands down roughly, holding him immobile against the bed.  She could tell he was rock hard again, but she didn't care this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think you have a choice in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Laura, I'm hard again.  I'm ready to go, I can hold back this time, I promi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut him off with a vicious glare.  He thought she might hurt him for a second, but a smile spread across her face.  She moved up his chest and higher, until she was straddling his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, little ... well not-so-little Jason is on vacation.  But there might be some ... other things you can do to please your goddess.  If you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear what she meant, especially as she lowered her bare bottom towards his face.  He began lapping at her slowly, lovingly, eagerly trying to please her.  She moaned happily as his tongue brushed against her nub, gently stroking her there.  He saw her hand reach out to the bedside table and pick up her iphone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little gift,\" she said in a sexy whisper between moans, \"for being good.\"  Suddenly he felt his tongue swell.  He almost thought of going for his epi pen, but then realized what she had done.  His tongue was longer, thinner, stronger and far more dextrous than ever before.  He smiled and went to work for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had no more experience with sex than Laura had, but he was a smart, horny young man in the age of the internet.  Which meant he had read countless words about sex.  Practical experience mattered, of course, but he had the theoretical side of an advanced degree in sex, with a major in cunnilingus.  He put his new tongue to good use to please his new goddess, and soon she was screaming out in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long time later Laura collapsed beside Jason, having cum dozens of times.  She smiled at him in the afterglow and said, \"You'll see, this is going to be awesome.  We're together now, I'm so glad my best friend is my boyfriend.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason awoke the following morning alone and with a sore jaw. He vaguely remembered Laura leaving early that morning with a kiss that warmed his cheek. He got up and went to the bathroom where he stood before the mirror and stuck out his tongue. It was noticeably longer, perhaps on par with Gene Simmons's famous tongue, and looked somehow muscular but otherwise fairly normal. He rubbed his jaw working the tension out, it was a good soreness especially when he thought about how effectively he had made Laura scream and writhe with pleasure. He began making his tongue do tricks, curling it and rolling it amazed at its dexterity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped back looking at his borderline sickly body. He flexed his chest and arms and saw no change. That wouldn't last long, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger than Greg,\" he said out loud. The very though made his enlarged penis stiffen and tent his underwear. He pulled the waistband of his briefs down and looked at the magnificent foot long shaft. He wrapped his fingers around it taking in the warmth of it. Then Jason remembered what Laura had told him the night before and he quickly released his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he felt somewhat sad. \"A whole year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo and a half months later Jason stood before the bathroom mirror once again but this time it was a very different reflection. As promised his body had grown slowly but steadily day by day and in the past 10 weeks he'd added 30 pounds of rock hard muscle. His new weight hung on his previously skinny frame in thick cuts of beef that made him look like a water polo player. Now when Jason flexed his muscles came to life in rippling waves. He was by no means a bodybuilder yet but his baseball sized biceps, six pack abs, defined pecs, and thick quads were turning heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdded to his increased size were several additional gifts that Laura had, from time to time, given him for his continued \"good behavior.\" She had evened out his skin and removed blemishes across his entire body while also removing the strange, uneven thin patch of hair from his chest. She had also given him a rich tan that made his burgeoning muscles look even more defined and cut. Laura had also made small adjustments to Jason's face, she'd hardened his jawline and softened his brow while making half a dozen other small changes that, on their own, weren't noticeable but added up to making Jason a gorgeous hunk. She had even increased Jason's height by 3 inches to 6 foot 3 (which also increased his target weight to 330 pounds, but Laura didn't mind that).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly Laura had made additional improvements to Jason's cock. Several week earlier she had doubled it's girth making it nearly the same circumference as a beer can then increased it's hardness by 50 times; a week later she had given him balls to match swelling them to the size of plums. Finally, a few night ago Laura had, in a fit of lust, added 4 inches to the length of Jason's penis effectively doubling his original 8 inch member. Now his ludicrous 16 inch cock stood at full attention looking completely out of place on his body. Jason laughed to himself, it would look out of place on any body except perhaps the one he was going to grow into in the months to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wrapped his hand around his shaft and smiled when he couldn't get his fingers to touch his thumb. He began to pump up and down grunting with pleasure. Jason had slowly returned to his old whacking habits despite Laura's mandate not to. How could he not? After all he had a girlfriend who was rapidly transforming into a goddess before his eyes and she wouldn't let him have the release he needed. He did his best to respect her wishes but one morning he awoke from a particularly pleasant dream to find himself already in the act so he decided to go ahead and finish. At first he was afraid that Laura would somehow know, as if her magical phone would alert her to him touching himself but days passed and she never mentioned it at all. Since then he had done it a few more times in hopes of achieving a sort of release but he still held a lot of pent up sexual frustration that was beginning to turn to resentment for the woman who ordered him around, no matter how amazing she looked. And she did look amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jason had put on 30 pounds of beef Laura had more than doubled his gains by adding almost 70 pounds to her petite frame. Laura now weighed in at 183 pounds of rock hard muscle and, true to her word, rivaled the women that Jason had been whacking off to previously and even surpassed a few of them. Laura was a monster who in the previous few weeks had shrugged off the assistance of her brother as a trainer and kept to her own routine packing on the pounds and increasing her strength daily. Her arms were 18 inches around and freakishly strong with her single arm curls hitting 200 pounds for multiple sets. Her pecs, shoulders and back had swelled so much that she could no longer wear any of her old shirts, though she did love trying to squeeze into them then bursting out like The Incredible Hulk. She would frequently do this before shoving Jason down and straddling his head so he could once again use his enhanced tongue to send her into wave after wave of orgasm. Her fantastic size and incredible strength had not gone unnoticed and Laura was beginning to garner a bit of celebrity which actually led to her canceling plans or even ignoring Jason from time to time which only made him feel hurt and angry. When she did come around it seemed the only thing she wanted to do was straddle Jason's head and have him eat her out for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura demanded oral pleasure daily, sometimes multiple times, and Jason both loved and hated these sessions. He truly enjoyed Laura's dominance over him and the fact that despite his gains in size and strength she completely outclassed him. She was his fantasy come to life and the fact that he could so effectively make her scream with rapturous delight was a badge he wore with pride. On the other hand he loathed the contempt that Laura held for his own needs. Sure he craved the physically superior and dominant woman, but that wasn't everything he wanted. The fact that every time she sat on his face and he gave her want she wanted while his magnificent 16 inch cock stood at full attention going unnoticed and untouched made him mad. Why should she get all the satisfaction and he be left with only frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night he has asked her why she had even given him such an amazing tool if they weren't going to put it to any use?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had giggled and said, \"It gets me so hot so think of the mega manly god you're turning into. Your cock is a symbol of the stud you're going to blossom into just like the rest of the gifts I've given you. Can't you see how amazing our first time is going to be when you've gone a year without any stimulation. I'll bet I make you come so hard you put a hole in the ceiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you could just touch it a little,\" Jason pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's face had become stern and almost angry. \"No! You'd better remember who gave you your body, your new looks and that monster between your legs. Any man in the world would give anything to have a tiny bit of what I've given you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now in the bathroom he had to admit she was right. He was becoming a muscle god to surpass any other man on the planet, waiting for sex should be a small price to pay. But he still found himself sexually frustrated to a degree that was becoming impossible to control, he needed some sort of release. Testosterone was raging through his body and making his animal brain rise to the surface and Jason felt powerless to stop it. He needed some way to let his excess energy out or he was liable to explode.</span></div></div>",

Push ups, crunches and whatever other exercises he could do in his room weren't doing much to take the edge off either. He needed a sure fire way give either his dick or his muscles the workout they deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason soon hatched an idea. Laura's workout schedule had normalized into a regular routine and there was another gym on the other side of town. He could get over there, burn off some frustration and be back in case Laura dropped by for more... oral tribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym was new and rather treadmill-heavy, but looked well-equipped and most importantly, wasn't crowded. The less chance this could get back to Laura, the better. Jason bought a trial membership and hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that such a well-built guy was so awkward and lifted so light earned him a lot of strange looks. But after a couple web searches he settled into a decent routine every other day. Enough time to get a good workout in and still get back home in case Laura came a calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had to admit it, Jason was slacking on his legs. He quickly learned it's a lot more fun to watch the various spandex-clad girls do squats than grind through them yourself. Besides, he loved the feeling he got when he pumped up his arms, and that took nearly a whole workout on its own. And he had to work his chest, and of course his abs. He didn't have much time for leg stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's lifts soon skyrocketed, adding considerable poundage every workout. In two weeks, Jason had put on 15 pounds of muscle instead of his usual 6. He was probably more turned on than before, but now he at least had an outlet for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Jason was on his last set benching 325 lbs. He grunted and squeezed his pecs marveling at how powerful he was becoming. He pushed out three more reps, careful to make sure his shirt covered up the salami-sized cock sticking up more than half a foot past his waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason racked the bar and looked over his pumped up chest to see Laura standing at his feet and she did not look pleased...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason left the bathroom and returned to his bedroom. He put on a pair of swim trunks and a tight tank top and decided to go for a run on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis perfectly handsome looks and his athletic body turned heads as he jogged along the waterline. He couldn't go 20 feet without seeing a bikini clad hottie that he wanted to just jump on top of and ram his record shattering dick into. That's when he realized another possible reason Laura had gifted him an enormous unit without intending to use it: it would be practically impossible for him to have sex with any woman without injuring her. The anger that came with this thought spurred him to continue running in an effort to try and clear his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly 45 minutes later Jason arrived at a pier he knew to be a little over 3 miles from his home. He was pleased by how calming his run had been as well as his new ability to cover such a distance with only minimal strain. He was covered in a thin sheen of sweat and a bit winded but otherwise felt like he could keep going. He noticed that his legs were burning in a way that felt really good and he waded into the ocean a bit to cool them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes passed Jason decided he should begin his run back home. He walked back up the sand just enough to exit the cold water and started his jog. Two steps later he stopped dead with his mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a woman. To say she was beautiful was the understatement of the decade. She was incredible. Spectacular. During his run Jason had spotted more than his fair share of huge boobs, curvy hips and round behinds but here was a woman who put all those other girls to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing with a small group of friends but had stepped away from them as if to make sure Jason spotted her. She was fairly tall, probably 5 foot 10 inches, with impossibly long legs that were shapely and curvaceous with muscle. Her whole body, in fact, was covered with lithe sinew that enhanced her already generous curves. This woman looked like the perfect cross between a supermodel and a fitness model. She wore the skimpiest black bikini imaginable over her perfectly round c-cup breasts with bottoms that rode high on her wide waist making her already long legs look even longer. And even though Jason was viewing this woman from the front she was turned just enough that he could see the sculpted perfection of her round ass that was so large and firm Jason would have guess this woman was Brazilian had her skin not been so fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was a study in girl-next-door perfection and her green eyes were lightning bright. Atop her head was a mane of wavy auburn hair that spilled down over her broad shoulders. And while all of this was amazing to Jason it was really the girl's smile that stopped him in his tracks. Ruby lips parted in a dazzling, sultry yet friendly smile that radiated a warmth that nearly brought Jason to his knees where he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jason found himself dumbly grinning back. Then she raised her hand and waved and Jason felt his heart stop. Suddenly he found himself walking towards her with no idea of what he was going to say or do. He wanted her so bad he could taste it; he wanted to suck on her lips, her tits were begging him to squeeze them, he needed her perfect thighs wrapped around him. And best of all he could have her. With the enhancements Laura had given him he was sure he could have this woman with a little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura. The image of his very buff girlfriend looking very angry appeared in his mind and Jason became very afraid of what would happen to him if Laura saw him talking with this girl. Before he could even think about what he was doing or talk himself out of it Jason took off running in the direction of his house. This time his pace was a full sprint instead of a leisurely jog and he covered the 3 miles in less than 20 minutes. It was a blissful 20 minutes in which he was able to remove the gorgeous redhead from his thoughts but it was only a temporary reprieve because as soon as he got home and went back to his room the image of her perfect body and mesmerizing smile took the forefront of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back in the safety of his home Jason stripped and allowed his thoughts to command his cock to attention. He looked down and noticed that his legs looked a bit swollen and the burning sensation was now a full blown fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be why Laura ordered me to stay out of the gym. Even a run is enough exercise to build my muscles faster.\" He said aloud. Then he sneered and added, \"What a selfish person she is to keep me from growing while she goes to the gym everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Jason's phone buzzed to let him know a text message had arrived. It was from Laura and it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">\"Hey baby!! Amazing news, I'm entered into a bodybuilding contest!!! It's just an amateur show but if I win there's a pro show a week later I can enter. My agent says no one has ever done that before but if anyone can it's me!! I'm so excited! I'm headed to Vegas tonight to work with a guy who will teach me poses and routines. I'm sorry I won't get to see you but I'll send lots of pictures of my pumped up muscles. See you in two weeks!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's phone slid from his hand and landed with a thud on the floor. He shook his head in disbelief. Going to Las Vegas? And when did she get an agent?! \"Bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dropped to the ground and began doing push-ups. It was the only thing he could think to do to keep his mind off of Laura leaving for 2 weeks on a whim. He focused all his attention on his exercise and lost himself in oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed and Jason kept going. He moved from exercise to exercise without even thinking about it. Sit-ups, squats, he even turned his bed up on its end so he could perform pull-ups from the leg of his bed frame. The more he did the easier his routine became so he began going faster or using one hand instead of two. Eventually, in the early hours of the morning, Jason lay down and slept on the floor of his room, his entire body tingling from exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason awoke from a dream in which the redheaded woman he had seen was giving him a hand-job. Her slender fingers worked his shaft sending shivers through his spine. Her brilliant eyes were locked onto his and she smiled her incredible smile at him. As his eyes opened his horse cock began to spasm and unloaded a torrent of come all over his belly and the floor. He got up, cleaned up his mess, took a shower then went back to his routine from the night before, needing to continue to turn his mind off lest he start thinking about Laura or the mystery woman again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason carried on this way for a week. He would wake up, work out all day pause to eat or play a video game for a bit, go for a run (in the opposite direction to avoid the redheaded goddess) then exercise again until he fell asleep. At the end of the week his body had definitely shown some improvement, though not as much as it could have with weight training. Still he'd added another 15 pounds to his body which should have taken him a full month. Now when he posed in the mirror he saw that he was just starting to leave athletic behind and enter the first stages of buff. And as far as he was concerned he still kept his word to Laura and never entered a gym as she had commanded. He flexed a pair of biceps that were nearing the size of softballs and grinned. Would Laura notice? He didn't think so, she was so caught up in her own transformation that he was pretty sure she'd forgotten all about him. He fully expected her to find some musclebound hunk in Las Vegas that she could dominate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his swim trunks on and got ready for his daily run opting to go shirtless this time. Everyday his body was garnering more and more attention from the ladies that lined the shore. Today he was going to fully embrace their stares and give them a real show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began his jog he started to go south as he had the past few days but then turned north towards the pier. He knew it wasn't likely that he would see the gorgeous redhead with the spine melting smile, but for the first time in a week he wanted to badly enough to actually look for her. Consequences be damned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura\u2019s stomach dropped when she spotted Jason holding her phone. Why has she left it behind? Sure her shorts didn't have much in the way of pockets but she could have tucked her phone in her waistband or something. Now Jason was holding the most powerful tool, reality bending in the world and grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Jason?\" Laura asked still frozen in the doorway. Jason was her best friend and she never dreamed that he would hurt her, but there was no telling what a person would do with the power to change just about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get this program?\" Jason asked ignoring Laura's question. \"It's incredible. I mean it's got to be magic or something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, can I have my phone back now? Please?\" She was beginning to feel the sparks of panic seeping into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason still didn't seem to hear her, though. \"I was able to affect an entire population with a few taps. Every female 16 or older within 5 miles received an increase to their strength and muscle mass. Except you, that is. I could have even set it to encompass the entire planet if I wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura realized that she hadn't been imagining things earlier when she'd noticed the fitness level of all the women around her. Then the last part of Jason's statement sunk in. \"Wait, why not me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says I can't make changes to your height or muscle mass because of the program you set for yourself already. I can change other stuff about you, though. By the way, amazing job. I can't wait to see you hulk out. I don't think I could be patient enough to wait a whole year, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, listen to me. You can't just make large scale changes like this. What happens when people notice that their muscles suddenly got bigger? What if people start to ask questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up from the phone screen and met Laura's eyes for the first time. \"So what? Let them ask. This phone has more than enough power to account for your worries.\" He looked back at the screen. \"Let me give you an example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather you gave me my phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled. He tapped a few more buttons then quickly slid the phone in his back pocket. \"Now, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to say she didn't feel anything. Then her face got hot and her heart began to pound in her chest while her breathing became more erratic. \"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything to you.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe changed himself? Then why do I feel this way? Laura examined Jason closely but didn't notice any changes. He was still the scrawny nerd he'd always been, but there was no denying that something about him was making her feel... hot? No, that wasn't quite it. Laura wiped her sweaty palms on her shorts. Then, without thinking about it her hand began slowly moving toward her crotch. When she finally realized that she was rubbing her vagina through her clothes she understood the feeling Jason now elicited in her. She was horny; she'd never been so turned on in all her life and she wanted nothing more than to have her way with her long time best friend. She took a step towards Jason determined to leap onto him and rip his clothes off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason raised his hand to stop her. \"No, don't come too close. Not just yet. I'm not sure you'd be able to help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ached for Jason. She needed to have him right now and his denial of her was agony. \"Why... why do I feel this for you? I want you so bad,\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I increased my sex appeal by five thousand percent. Probably overdid it by a bit, though since I imagine you'd jump off the roof if I asked you to, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded slowly. She would do anything for Jason, anything he asked of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you just have a seat on the bed?\" Once she did he continued. \"See, this is what I mean. Right now my body is pumping out massive quantities of ultra potent pheromones that make me the most desirable man that's ever lived. The fact is that pheromones don\u2019t even work that way, but whoever programmed your app was able to hack the source code of the universe to make things function differently. It doesn't matter if someone asks me about how I got huge muscles or why every man in the world that isn't me suddenly shrunk by two feet. This program offers a thousand different ways that'll keep people from even being able to think of those questions much less care about the answers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused to enjoy the look on Laura\u2019s face. Never in his life had any woman gazed at him with such desire and lust. He couldn\u2019t wait to go out into the world and command that look from every girl around. He could steal any guy\u2019s girlfriend with the slightest move. Which reminded him that he\u2019d need to make sure he could avoid getting the crap kicked out of him by disgruntled guys who were loosing their ladies to him. All in good time, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there was Laura. \u201cBefore I go on,\u201d Jason said, \u201cdo you think you could stop masturbating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hadn\u2019t even realized it but she\u2019d been rubbing her crotch this entire time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said meekly. She slid her hands under her thighs to keep them still then crossed her legs tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. I enjoy that I drive you wild.\u201d Jason was getting cockier and cockier. And speaking of which he had decided on the next change he wanted to make. He took Laura\u2019s phone out of his back pocket. \u201cNow, just to make things clear you\u2019re okay with me keeping your phone right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for you,\u201d Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jason began tapping the screen quickly making changes. Half a minute later he dropped his hands to his sides. \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to take this one change at a time. Tell me what you think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Laura didn\u2019t notice anything different but then some motion caught her eye. She looked to its source and found that the crotch of Jason\u2019s jeans were moving. It looked as if he had a balloon in his underwear that was slowly inflating but Laura knew the truth. Her breathing became deep and rapid until she spotted what appeared to be a snake sliding down the left leg of his pants at which point she stopped breathing altogether for a long moment. Jason was moaning deeply enjoying the feel of his cock and balls swelling to insane proportions. The outline of his growing shaft was clearly visible through his pants and Laura noticed that it was thicker than Jason\u2019s forearm. The head continued to explore further and further down his leg until it finally stopped just a few inches shy of his knee. His pants let out soft creaking noises for a few more seconds as his unit continued to plump up then it was done. Jason adjusted his pants one way then another but it was no use, there was simply no room to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a breathy whisper, \u201cBig\u2026.. oooooh god, big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \u201cYou think this is something just wait until I get hard. I\u2019m a grower, not a shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want it, want it, please, I want it I- just let me see it, please, I want to see it.\u201d Laura was rocking in place desperate for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, but if you\u2019re a good girl I\u2019ll let you do more than just see it. I\u2019ve got all sorts of plans for us, but there are a few things I want to do first. Things I\u2019ve been dreaming of for a long time.\u201d Jason slid his hand down the inside of his left leg where his new tool hung ready for action. He shivered with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stay here. You can do whatever you like but you can\u2019t leave until I allow it. Don\u2019t talk to or communicate with anyone else either, you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head violently. \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, anything you say. Of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAtta girl, I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Jason turned to leave thinking about how amazingly complete his hold on Laura was. Then he realized that it was probably too complete for the directions he gave. Just before he closed the door he looked back at her still sitting on the bed, legs crossed and hands under her butt. \u201cOh, you can go outside if you need to go to the bathroom, wouldn\u2019t want a mess in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled Laura\u2019s bedroom door closed then went to find his next victim.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason left Laura and was about to head downstairs when the living room door opened and Vanessa and Greg returned from their time in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole walk back the pair had been arguing about whether or not Vanessa has sprouted larger muscles in the last hour or two. Vanessa was positive that she felt stronger and had even grown a little bit as had many of the other girls around. Greg insisted she was crazy and probably just lost some body fat recently without noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg,\" she said as they approached their house,\" I did not have abs this morning. Look at this.\" Vanessa pointed at her tummy which was a well defined wall of bricks three high and two wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, maybe you dropped some body fat or water weight and it's making your abs stand out more.\" Greg said dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chunkhead, look at my thighs. My legs have never looked this good before. I'd be ecstatic  except I don't think any of my pants are going to fit me anymore.\" Vanessa watched her legs as she walked. She'd always thought she had nice legs, but now they were incredible; her thighs were thick and juicy and flexed with each step she took. Already she was imagining trying on various miniskirts and cocktail dresses to show off her new pins; and she couldn't forget some nice bare midriff tops now that her abs were showing through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg just waved his hand at Vanessa blowing her off. There was no way what she was describing was possible. He just wanted to get changed and hit the weights at the gym before his shift started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was still at the top of the stairs when Greg and Vanessa came in so he just paused and waited to see how things would play out, he was determined to have his way with Vanessa but he didn't want her older and much stronger brother to get in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair entered and immediately Vanessa stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it.... um... is it warm in here?\" She asked in a voice that trembled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned from his perch on the second floor. He was having an effect on Vanessa from a fairly sizable distance and she hadn't even seen him yet. Plus, to his delight she was wearing her purple sequined bikini which was a definite favorite of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg held his arms up feeling the air in the room. \"No, I don't think so. The air conditioning is on, feels nice in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Vanessa said with one hand absentmindedly placed on her right breast. \"I'm going to get some water.\" The blonde beauty slipped away into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shook his head and began ascending the stairs. Jason was about to move aside for the muscle laden behemoth when suddenly Greg's eyes landed on him and the big man froze in his tracks. A look of terror washed over Greg's face and he even took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!! Jason, I didn't know you were here, man! I'm sorry, I was just... you know... I was going to get changed in my room and get out of here. I mean, if that's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was confused, he and Greg were hardly friends, but the two would say hi in passing. Never before had Greg ever reacted like this. Suddenly Jason realized that it must be his sexual desirability. He was the alpha male specimen: he attracted female partners and repealed males. Greg had no choice but to be afraid of Jason even though Greg could pound him into the ground without trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo test his theory Jason furrowed his brow and took a menacing step towards Greg. \"You need to leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nearly leapt out of his skin. He turned immediately and nearly sprinted for the door calling back over his shoulder, \"You got it Jason, I'm sure I can get supplies and clothes at the gym anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed and Vanessa poked her head out of the kitchen to see what the commotion was about. Jason descended the stairs and walked right by her as if intending to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vanessa, have a good one.\" He reached for the doorknob but suddenly found a very sexy girl blocking his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Ja- uh, James- Jess- no... JASON! Um, you're leaving?\" She twirled a lock of hair with her fingers wile her other hand returned to her large breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I was headed home, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just, we've never gotten to know each other, you know. And I never noticed before but there's something, I don't know, exciting about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it the fact that you would give anything or do anything to fuck me right now? And how do I even know that? And why do I know about the fact that a little while ago you and all your female friends put on a little muscle? Is that exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm.\" Vanessa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down at Vanessa stomach. \"I have to say your muscles really are looking fantastic.\" He placed his palm against her trim tummy and slid his fingers through the slight ridges of her abs. It was was wonderful as he had always hoped. Her skin was astoundingly soft to the touch and held a very thin layer of oil from her time in the sun that his fingertips glided over. The tiny bundles of muscle beneath her skin were even more glorious and they moved with a pliable hardness as she breathed in and out. The feel was so incredibly erotic that Jason was glad he\u2019d given himself complete control over his new monster cock otherwise it would have torn through his pant leg right then. Suddenly Vanessa's breathing became erratic and she bit her lower lip while moaning sharply. She pressed into his hand harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's grin spread from ear to ear. \"Did you just come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Vanessa sputtered through labored breaths. \"Your touch it's- oh god I'm still coming! It's so amazing. Like electricity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jason put his other hand on her hip right above her bikini then slid it up into the concave of her waist. He squeezed roughly claiming her as his. This time Vanessa let out a short but lout scream and her eyes rolled back in her head. Another orgasm. What an interesting development.</span></div></div>",

Jason decided it was time to share the other change he'd made to himself with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to step out into the patio?\" he asked. \"Maybe show me your tits while we're there?\" Jason was becoming ever more brazen acting on his fantasy of power. He'd never been even close to a position of control like this and he was taking every advantage he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled a devilish grin and started leading the way to the deck behind the house that overlooked the beach. As she passed Jason he couldn't resist the urge to slap her hard on the ass. Her butt was surprisingly firm and the sound of a whip crack echoed off the walls. Vanessa wiggled her behind a bit as she glanced over her shoulder with a gaze that burned with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked she quickly pulled her bikini top off and held it up as an offering for Jason then dropped it to the floor keeping her back to him all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason followed Vanessa with his eyes glued to her legs and ass. The boost he'd given her physique made it look like Vanessa had been pounding out squats for the past several years and her glutes and calves were pumped. She seemed to know where his gaze was because she walked slightly on the balls of her feet flexing her shapely calves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patio was large and held several deck chairs, a picnic table, and a propane barbecue, but Vanessa knew that wasn't what Jason was interested in. She went straight to a cabana that shaded a queen sized mattress. There were pillows piled up on the back end of the bed which Vanessa\u2019s parents had placed to prop themselves up to watch sunsets while sipping wine or just relax with their feet up. Now Vanessa turned and, with an arm across her chest to hide her DD bosom, pulled one of the thin, white silk curtains aside to allow Jason to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lay down as Vanessa drew the curtains closed giving them some privacy, though only a little. She cupped her boobs in each hand and began walking on her knees across the mattress with her legs on either side of Jason\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached his knees Jason held up his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you since you've been such an obedient girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last Jason commanded his monster penis to harden and swell. Vanessa hadn't noticed the obscene bulge in his pants thus far but the motion drew her attention and she went wild. Vanessa began pawing at his tightening pants and moaning with anticipation. The head of his dick, which had been a few inches shy of his knee, had already extended beyond his knee and his shaft was so thick that his jeans were stretched to the limit. Fortunately Jason had programmed his new equipment to be incredibly strong so seconds later when the denim began to groan Jason flexed his cock and it ripped through his inseam and stood straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was frozen in awe for a moment taking in the glory of what was before her. Jason's cock was 25 inches from base to tip and as big around as a champagne bottle. His testicles were the size of navel oranges and were stressing his underwear.  \"How?\" she asked in a timid voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about how,\" Jason said. He wrapped his hands around the base of his dick and squeezed. He was hard as steel and that made him feel full of power; he was well on his way to becoming the ultimate male. \"Right now the only thing you need to worry about is making me come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa leapt forward and wrapped herself around Jason's penis. It was clear such a penis would never fit inside her so she set to work grinding her crotch on the base of his shaft. The softball sized head sat below her chin so she sucked, kissed and nibbled feverishly while at the same time wrapping her tits around either side of the body and smashing her cleavage around him. Next she began moving her body up and down to stroke his entire length as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was coming nonstop and was practically in tears from the exquisite pleasure flowing through her body. Jason, though, was using his control to hold back his own ejaculation. Though it was true that he had given himself the ability to come again and again he wanted Vanessa to earn the first one, and that's exactly what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed fistfuls of the sheets and grunted. He couldn't believe how amazing this felt and things were only going to get better and better. With each passing moment Vanessa was getting more desperate for Jason's release and was pumping harder and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spurred her on, \"You don't have to be gentle, baby. I can take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa launched her body forward and pressed Jason's cock against his chest. She was rubbing her vagina up and down the underside of his shaft with the full force of her weight behind it while her hands seemed to be choking the life out of the top. Jason took advantage and clamped his hands onto her breasts and began kneading them roughly. He'd longed for years to get his hands on Vanessa's breasted and now that he found they were even more amazing than he'd imagined. So perfectly soft yet firm and warm. Her body was coated in a mist  of sweat and somehow that detail made the experience even more visceral for Jason. She was really there working her ass off for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he was ready. \"Stand back, here we go-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa moved back just enough for his penis to once again point to the ceiling of the silk hut they were in but she continued to pump his shaft with her hands anxiously awaiting his release. Jason didn't disappoint and his cock erupted. The first blast of semen reached the roof that was 5 feet over the top of the bed (though Jason immense length covered more than 2 of those 5 feet) and more come flowed down around his member. Vanessa sat up and put her mouth over the tip of his cock eagerly awaiting the next shot and when it came Jason fired with such force that Vanessa's head rocked back so instead she aimed him at her chest right between her breasts and took blast after blast of Jason's seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued to be astounded at the pleasures his new abilities brought. He was able to keep his orgasm going as long as he wanted and somehow he never seemed to run out of come. He was like a firehose drenching Vanessa and flooding the bed. The mattress was soaked and a river of semen was beginning to flow off the side and pool on the wooden deck and still Jason fired shot after shot. After two full minutes he allowed himself to stop and his monster cock softened in Vanessa's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa collapsed onto Jason and locked her lips onto his. She wrapped her legs around his and squeezed his body against hers with her powerful arms. Jason could hear her moaning as she kissed him and he realized that contact with his skin was continuing to make her orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as it pained him Jason pushed Vanessa away. \"Go wash yourself off and get dressed. Something tiny and sexy. While you're at it get some shorts from Greg's room, maybe they'll be roomy enough for what I'm carrying here. Be quick, we have places to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded and ran off. Jason stood and pulled off his soaked shirt and torn pants making sure to take Laura\u2019s phone. He stood naked on the patio unconcerned about who may see his naked body. Yes he was achingly skinny (a fact he would change soon enough) but his cock was magnificent. Standing with it exposed and hanging down nearly to his knees now he really felt the weight of it. Moving one way then another sent tugging feelings through his entire abdomen and even his back and he judged that his penis alone weighed 20 pounds perhaps more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for Vanessa to return Jason returned to the cabana to survey the damage he\u2019d done to the bed. What he saw made him laugh uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally impossible for that much fluid to have come out of my body. There\u2019s some real magic going on with that phone, and not just the fact that it can do this.\u201d He slid his hand along the soft shaft of his mega cock. Then, just for good measure he commanded himself to an erection and instantly came yet again spraying even more sticky fluid over the scene. He chuckled again then returned to the side of the patio that overlooked the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Vanessa returned. Her hair was still wet from her shower and she had tied it back in a hasty ponytail. Per his command she was dressed in a black mini skirt and tube top. The top was fairly stretchy and was able to account for her modest muscle mass increase but the skirt was straining to contain her expanded rear. Lastly she wore bright red heels which added 3 inches to her height and put her just a hair taller than Jason. The shoes worked their magic to add not only length to Vanessa\u2019s amazing legs but they also framed her perfectly plump muscles so incredibly that Jason had to consciously keep his penis at bay. She wore no makeup but it didn\u2019t matter, she didn\u2019t need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTiny and sexy enough?\u201d she asked putting her hands on her hips and cocking one hip to the side. Jason\u2019s mouth watered at the sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll do,\u201d Jason said dismissively. \u201cMy shorts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said approaching where Jason stood. \u201cIt would be a real shame to hide such an incredible cock.\u201d As she got close she reached out to touch his penis but Jason made it go soft and Vanessa\u2019s hand closed on open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShorts. Now.\u201d He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked panicked, she rushed behind him to the picnic table where she\u2019d set a pair of Greg\u2019s workout shorts. Jason slid them on and cinched the waist as tight as he could. As loose as the shorts were it was still very obvious that Jason was hung like a bull and he was totally fine with that. He slipped the iPhone into the pocket then looked at the busty blonde before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Jason said putting his arm around Vanessa\u2019s waist and squeezing a handful of her behind. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some places to go and things to do. Our day is just beginning.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Vanessa had just finished having sex right below her bedroom window and now that they had left Jason was far enough away so that his super powerful pheromone scent no longer affected Laura\u2019s mind. Even after he\u2019d left her room and gone downstairs she could still feel an overwhelming desire for Jason, and the entire time she was listening to him bang her sister Laura was masturbating on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that Jason was gone so was his crazy mind control and Laura was just angry. Angry that Jason had stolen her phone. Angry that he had used it and messed with her mind. Angry that he had fucked her sister and made her listen to the whole thing. And really angry that she still felt a ton of residual horniness. She felt betrayed by her own body and mind and still she couldn\u2019t get Jason and his giant bulge out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura rolled off her bed and gathered some clean clothes. She got dressed in a pair of cotton shorts, an old t-shirt and running shoes then made for her door. She decided she\u2019d go find Greg and convince him and a few of his beefed up buddies to find Jason and kick the shit out of him. Then she\u2019d get her phone back and really make him pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she tried to exit her bedroom, though, she found she was stuck. That is, the door was wide open but she couldn\u2019t go through it no matter how much she tried. Her body simply wouldn\u2019t move. Somehow Jason\u2019s order that she not leave the room was still forcing her to stay put even though he and his mind altering scent were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! That asshole!! This isn't fair!!\u201d Laura screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began to pace around the room fuming with rage. She could still hear Jason\u2019s voice in her head <i>You\u2019re going to stay here. You can do whatever you like but you can\u2019t leave until I allow it\u2026. you\u2019re going to stay here\u2026 until I allow it\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a thought occurred to her. Before he left Jason gave one last command. He\u2019d said she could leave the room if she had to use the bathroom but he never said anything about going back. Maybe that would work! Laura went to her bedside where she kept a bottle of water and downed what was left. It wasn\u2019t much but it was all she had and would have to do for now. She\u2019d hadn\u2019t been to the bathroom since the morning, though, so hopefully her bladder would spring her soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Laura was still feeling an odd mix of horny rage, she actually felt like she wanted to masturbate again which just angered her further. Instead she decided to get her energy out a different way and began doing pushups. She was fairly weak and could only manage 8 so she switched to sit ups. She did slightly better and struggled through 12 of these. Still not satisfied Laura began doing squats; she found her legs to be stronger than her upper body and managed 25 before tiring at which point she figured her upper body had rested a bit so she returned to pushups. Interestingly she discovered that this time she was able to do 10 pushups before quitting. She then did 17 sit ups and 40 squats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued by her success she repeated the pattern again finding increases again. So she kept cycling through these sets, resting for a bit when she was tired, but finding that she was able to do more and more of each exercise each time. She didn\u2019t understand why her strength would be increasing but figured it had something to do with the growth profile she\u2019d programmed for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused to look at herself in the mirror. She didn\u2019t look any different but she was beginning to feel stronger. \u201cMaybe my body has become more prone to getting stronger or bigger. I mean I\u2019m only just getting my strength up to average. Maybe working out with weights will speed this process up.\u201d She said to her reflection, and now she wanted out of her room even more. She couldn\u2019t wait to find Greg and take him up on his offer to train her. Maybe she\u2019d be able to reach her goal weight early or even get bigger than 355 pounds. Then she\u2019d find a way to be around Jason without losing her mind so she could crush his head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of such size and power got Laura excited all over again but before her hand to make it to her crotch she dropped and began doing pushups all over again. She powered through 40 before stopping and marveled at how her strength had increased by 5 times in the last hour. She then did 60 sit ups and 150 squats before starting all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began her exercise routine a around noon and continued until a little after 3:00. At this point she was doing sets of 80 pushups, 125 sit ups and 300 squats at a go. She was actually a little worried that she was exercising her body too much but she felt so good she didn\u2019t care. And now she had to pee so it was time to see if her idea really did work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slowly approached the door that led out of her room then paused. Taking a deep breath she stepped forward and found she was free. She went across the hall to the bathroom then after rushed down the hall toward the stairs leaving her room behind. She really was free from Jason\u2019s command and she burst from her home at a full sprint using her newly enhanced legs to propel her toward the gym that Greg worked out at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran the full 4 miles to the gym and entered a bit out of breath but otherwise still hungry for more exercise to fuel her hungry muscles. Her thighs and calves were throbbing wonderfully and Laura imagined them growing harder and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a young woman behind the front desk that gave Laura a disdainful look as if she were naturally better than the plain looking girl that just arrived, and there were many reasons for the receptionist to feel that way. Her name badge read \u201cMarie\u201d and was pinned onto a white polo shirt that was intentionally too small for her large bust and wide shoulders. Marie\u2019s black hair was tied back in a ponytail and her makeup was immaculate. Laura could see that the girl\u2019s arms and forearms were perfectly toned and defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething I can do for you, dear?\u201d Marie asked with an expression that was just short of a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked forward and was about to ask about Greg but when she opened her mouth to speak but her vocal cords were frozen. Suddenly Laura heard Jason\u2019s voice in her head with crystal clarity: <i>Don\u2019t talk to or communicate with anyone else either, you understand?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! She\u2019d been stymied again. And now Marie\u2019s expression had dropped all pretense and gone to a full contemptuous grin. \u201cCat got your tongue, little bird? How about you fly on home, this place is for real women, not puny little brats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn\u2019t know what to do. She wanted to tell this bitch that she was an invited guest of Greg Friedman, gym employee and amateur bodybuilder, but she couldn\u2019t say a word. She pointed to the back area and began to take a step but Marie stepped from behind the desk to block Laura\u2019s progress. Now Laura could see Marie\u2019s whole body and the intimidation factor was ramped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist was 5\u2019 6\u201d which was only 2 inches taller than Laura but her body was built like a sprinter. Below the company uniform polo shirt she wore black skintight lycra shorts that revealed thick powerful legs. She crossed her arms under her cantaloupe sized breasts pressing them up even higher under her shirt and flexed her quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn around, little bird.\u201d She demanded. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly throw you out on your ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Marie!\u201d A deep voice called and both girls turned to find Greg approaching. He looked even more pumped than normal (though Laura realized that she\u2019d never seen him at the gym before) and wore loose shorts and a tight tank top that left much of his chest and all of his arms bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie\u2019s hard veneer melted and she became an entirely different person, one who actually seemed pleasant. \u201cHey, Muscles, how\u2019s it going?\u201d She approached Greg and pressed her body against his nuzzling her head against his round pecs. Greg wrapped his arm around Marie\u2019s back and hugged her tight. Laura even noticed that Greg squeezed a handful of the girl\u2019s tight ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg released Marie who stepped back and thrust out her chest. \u201cWhat can I do for you, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg pointed at Laura. \u201cThis one is with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer?!?\u201d Marie\u2019s sweet facade almost slipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, allow me to introduce my little sister Laura. I\u2019ve told you about her, remember? Laura, this is Marie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie extended her hand. \u201cCharmed,\u201d she said with a fake smile plastered to her pretty face. Laura took her hand which Marie made sure to squeeze harder than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Lulu, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d Greg led Laura back into the gym. \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tried to speak but she was still unable. Instead she placed her hand on her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg frowned. \u201cLose your voice? I just saw you earlier and you were fine. No matter, you\u2019re here to work not talk, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled. It was time to see what she could really do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg showed Laura around the gym giving her an overview of different equipment and introducing her to a few people. She was pleasantly surprised and a bit proud to find that her brother was among the most physically developed guys in the gym and she was further surprised to find that everyone she met was much friendlier than Marie had been. It was possible that they were just putting on a front for Greg but Laura at least felt their support and welcome was genuine. One nicely buff guy named Tom winked at her when he shook her hand and even offered to help Laura work out when Greg wasn\u2019t around. Laura blushed as she drooled over Tom\u2019s thick pecs and dreamed of being held in his pumped up arms. For her part, though, Laura could only smile at the sexy hunk. As they went around Laura felt bad about not speaking but Greg covered for her well and no one seemed to mind. She was really shocked by how nice they all were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the women of the gym were pleasant, though there was one that didn\u2019t seem to really pay Laura much attention. Greg introduced her as the beauty and beast of the gym rolled into one and Laura had to agree with this assessment; the girl was equal parts stunning and huge. She was about 5\u2019 8\u201d tall and built like a professional bodybuilder. Fiery red hair was tied back in a loose ponytail while a few strands lay across her forehead just above her emerald green eyes. She wore a tight black sports bra that contained perfectly round C cup breasts while her beefy legs were wrapped in skintight lycra from hip to ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, this is Nikki.\u201d Greg said as the big girl loaded a bar in the squat rack with massive amounts of weight. \u201cNikki, my little sister Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki extended her hand and gave Laura a firm shake and a quiet nod which said, <i>Nice to meet you, but I\u2019m all business right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say, Nik, you\u2019re looking extra swole today.\u201d Greg said. \u201cWhatever you\u2019ve started doing, keep it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki paused and looked down at her own body. She tensed her thick pecs grinning as her sports bra stretched and groaned. \u201cI\u2019m feeling extra swole today, stronger too. Feels good.\u201d Nikki raised her arms and flexed monster 17 inch biceps and Laura was reminded of the fact that Jason had pumped up every woman in the area with extra size and strength. She wondered if he\u2019d increased muscle mass by a percentage meaning girls like Nikki here grew by larger margins like those like her sister and if so what did Nikki look like this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean, I\u2019ve been feeling a lot stronger today too,\u201d Another incredibly fit girl stood next to Nikki. This one was not nearly as big as her redheaded sidekick but could easily perform among any fitness model in the world. She extended her hand to Laura and beamed a bright smile at her. \u201cHi! I\u2019m Courtney.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourtney and Nikki are practically inseparable. You\u2019ll always find one spotting the other.\u201d Greg explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook Courtney\u2019s hand and smiled back. This girl was an inch or two shorter than Nikki and not quite as pretty, though there were few women who were. Her hair was a platinum blonde and tied in pigtails and she wore a hot pink sleeveless shirt that was also torn off at the bottom to show off her sculpted abs as well as a pair of pink terry cloth shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki cleared her throat loudly and Laura saw that she was in position beneath the bar she had readied and was waiting for Courtney to spot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney chuckled at Greg and Laura then hurried behind Nikki and slapped her hard on the ass. \u201cOk, Giganta, lets do some squats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laura could figure out if that was a comic book reference Greg slid his arm around her shoulders and began leading Laura to some of the weight machines near the front of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start slow,\u201d he told her, \u201cI just want to get an idea of how strong you are then-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Greg stopped dead in his tracks. Laura looked at him and saw a strange expression on his face, one she didn\u2019t understand. He almost looked afraid for some reason. She wanted to ask what was wrong but she still couldn\u2019t speak so she poked him in the ribs. He didn\u2019t move so she went to poke him again when she realized that all activity in the gym had ceased; the room, normally a constant din of metallic clangs, jumbled voices, and mechanical drone, was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Laura felt something all too familiar. There was a warm buzzing in her head that also throbbed between her legs. In an instant she felt both horror and ecstasy knowing that Jason must be here, moments later horror slipped away and she was left with just her need for her best friend\u2019s touch, attention, anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura left her brother, still frozen stiff in his tracks, and rounded the partition that separated the front desk area from the rest of the gym. Just as she suspected there was Jason still wearing Greg\u2019s too big shorts but now he also had on a very oversized black t-shirt as well. Jason was talking with Marie who was out from behind her desk standing before Jason with her shorts around her ankles and only a black thong on her lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded approval. \"Ok, now turn around and let me see your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie quickly spun around and bent over slightly to accentuate her firm rear. She stood on her toes as well flexing her calves and rock hard glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Jason said, \"now we're talking. Don't you think, baby? Isn't that an amazing ass?\" He turned to Vanessa who had changed from her tube top and shorts into a lipstick red slingshot bikini that matched her red high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded her agreement though she hardly took her eyes off of Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you go stand next to her, I want to see your asses side by side.\" Jason gave Vanessa a little push and the busty blonde dutifully took her place next to the raven haired girl with the sprinters legs. Jason ran his hand over the giant tool beneath his shorts. \"God, you're both so amazing for different reasons.\" With her height and heels Vanessa's legs were far longer than Marie's, but Marie's muscular development was clearly superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small group of very attractive girls surrounding Jason, followers he'd no doubt gathered on his travels, and now he turned to them. \"What do you all think? Who's got the best ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single one of them was coherent enough to give a valid response, but Jason just nodded as if they\u2019d all spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, you girls are right. Too close to call. I'm so glad I'm the perfect male since I get to just claim you both.\u201d Jason walked up behind both girls and ran a hand across each of their butts; Vanessa bit her lip and squeezed her breasts through her bikini while Marie gasped, her face contorting with rapt pleasure and her breathing became erratic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed to himself then spotted Laura and stopped. \u201cWell this is interesting,\u201d he said.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m pretty sure I commanded you to stay put.\u201d Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura found that now that Jason was demanding answers she was able to speak again, \u201cYou said that if I had to go to the bathroom-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could leave.\u201d Jason cut her off. \u201cI never said you\u2019d have to go back. Clever, very clever. So you came here so you could, what? Get Greg to beat me up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn\u2019t answer, she just looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can tell me, be honest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted,\u201d Laura said with tears beginning to run down her cheeks, \u201cbut that\u2019s not what I want now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head. \u201cI was going to give you such great gifts, too.\u201d He strode past Laura to where Greg was still frozen in place, but now as Jason approached the big man began to take a step back in fear. \u201cNo you don\u2019t, you stay right there!\u201d Jason barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had no choice but to obey, he was terrified of Jason on a primal level. Even though Greg had the body mass of two Jason\u2019s, the scrawny wimp\u2019s alpha status was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you going to beat me up?\u201d Jason asked, his brow furrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg rapidly shook his head. \u201cNn..n..n. no, no way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to? Aren\u2019t you mad at me for making you feel so helpless? Do I make you angry?\u201d Jason asked. \u201cHow about now?\u201d He reached up and slapped Greg across the face. \u201cAre you mad now?\u201d He slapped Greg again, harder. Then again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- uh\u2026 heh, no, I\u2019m not mad, Jason.\u201d Now it was Greg\u2019s turn to let loose some tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason slapped Greg again then cocked his head. \u201cHmmm, you probably hardly feel that, don\u2019t you. Maybe there\u2019s something else I can do to get a rise out of you.\u201d Jason looked back at Vanessa and snapped his fingers. She hurried over to where he stood. \u201cGet on your knees, you little bitch,\u201d he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa knelt at Jason\u2019s feet and looked up at him adoringly. Jason reached down to the hem of his shorts and lifted the right leg unsheathing his monster tool. All the women in the gym gasped while the men whimpered. \"What do you think, Greg? I'll bet you've never seen a cock like this before, have you?\" Jason held his penis up and ran his hand up and down the length of his shaft and laughed. \"Of course you haven't, there's never <i>been</i> a cock like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shoved the head of his penis against Vanessa's forehead and began rubbing it around on her face, down her cheeks, around her jaw. \"Does this make you angry, big man? No? Then just imagine the damage I'm going to do to your own little sister with this thing. I'll rip her in half, you haven't even seen how big it can really get. I'll make her scream and cry and still beg for more.\" Jason grabbed a handful of Vanessa's hair and yanked her head back hard. He put his face right in hers and said, \"Isn't that right you fucking whore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled at her abuser. \"Give it to me, baby. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up at Greg. \"Still not angry enough to stop me? How about this?\" Jason held his dick around the base and, while keeping it soft, swung it while twisting his hips and smacked Vanessa hard across the side of her head. She lurched to one side then sat back up with the same dutiful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this piss you off, Greg,\u201d Jason asked. \u201cTo see me disrespect your little sister like this?\u201d He hit her again. \u201cTo make her love the abuse and beg for more?\u201d Jason sneered at Vanessa, \u201cDo it, bitch, beg me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggled. \u201cPlease, baby, give it to me again. Harder. Make me bleed, GIVE IT TO MEEE!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want it?!?\u201d Jason yelled, \u201cTake this!\u201d He grabbed the back of Vanessa head and shoved the apple sized head of his cock into her open mouth. He pushed with all of his might but the head itself hardly fit let alone the rest of his member. Still he shoved while Vanessa gagged and screamed, gasping for air through her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about this, Greg? Does this make you want to use those big, strong muscles on me? You could beat the shit out of me without even trying, I\u2019ll bet. So what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg couldn\u2019t say a thing, he was flooded with terror. Instead his bladder released a stream of hot piss down his muscular leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Jason said. He let go of Vanessa and helped her to her feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I baby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa moaned and draped herself across Jason\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOh, that felt so good. You\u2019re my king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled. \u201cYeah I am. Now let\u2019s show your brother here what real muscle looks like. Are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason slid the leg of his shorts back down putting his giant penis away for the moment then he stood up on a large stack of 45 pound plates surveying the room. \u201cFirst things first, we need to thin the crowd here a little.\u201d He looked over the crowd of 70 or so people who had been working out when he\u2019d arrived. About two thirds of the onlookers were men who all stood in silent terror brought on by the hormonal scents that Jason\u2019s body was pumping into the air. Each of them, despite their size and strength advantages, would do anything Jason asked lest they make him angry and end up like Greg. The remaining third were women who looked at Jason with very different eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Jason yelled out in a commanding voice, \u201cif you are a male and your name is not Greg Friedman then you do not belong here. You will leave and forget what you saw here today. Now MOVE!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a minute later Jason stood above Greg and a harem of just over 30 women. \u201cOkay, girls, come in a little closer. I want to get a good look at you. I\u2019ve got a lot of dick to go around but I\u2019m also going to be pretty selective. Only the best for me, the perfect male deserves it. Oh, and Laura, could you please stand with your brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stepped down off his pillar and examined the group of girls that encircled him. Truth be told, a day ago he would have begged for a smile from any one of the ladies there. Now, though he would only accept the cream of the crop. He began moving down the line examining each girl  closely and judging them on their sex appeal. Each of them had much to offer but unless they were truly outstanding he ordered them to leave and forget all they had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway down the line he had only accepted 2 more girls into his fold. The first was Jenny, an Asian beauty with perfect skin and thick quads who stood a mere 4 feet 11 inches tall and the other was Kristine, who was tall and a bit thinner than Jason usually cared for but carried an enormous set of breasts that easily overshadowed even Vanessa\u2019s perfect melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Jason came upon Courtney and Nikki. Courtney was looking timid with her arms crossed under her modest bosom while Nikki smiled confidently with one arm around Courtney\u2019s waist and the other on her own cocked hip. Jason looked right past the fit blonde at the super buff redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you smiling at, my dear?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re keeping me.\u201d Nikki said. Then she squeezed Courtney close to her side. \u201cActually, you\u2019re keeping us. Both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look at me,\u201d Nikki said. Her green eyes flashed and she ran her hand up her stomach over her large, round breast then flexed her giant 17 inch bicep. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here that even comes close to having a body like mine.\u201d She then released her flex and pulled out her hair tie letting her fiery hair fall in waves over her shoulders. \u201cBut Courtney here is easily the second best piece of ass you\u2019ll find. Even her curves have curves and several of her boyfriends have said that she can work a dick like no one else. She\u2019ll do things to that tool of yours you won\u2019t believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney turned bright red and glared at Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki only laughed. \u201cWhat? Be proud, did you see that thing he\u2019s carrying? You know you want to get your hands on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney looked back at Jason pleadingly. \u201cI do. I really do.\u201d She spoke in a voice that was hardly more than a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason threw his head back and laughed. \u201cOf course you do. Every woman in here does.\u201d He ran his hand over the bulge in his shorts as if he were a Bond villain stroking their lap cat. \u201cLucky for you I really like what I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved on allowing Courtney and Nikki to remain where they were. The rest of the way down the line he excused every single remaining girl and each one left obediently but with pain in their eyes, though they\u2019d soon forget that they\u2019d ever even seen Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gathered Nikki, Courtney, Kristine and Jenny around along with Marie and the small group of girls he had brought with him and sat them down between the free weights and a few of the machines. Jason pulled Laura\u2019s iPhone out of his pocket and began tapping on the screen. \u201cYou girls are going to get to see something incredible. You\u2019re going to witness the birth of a god.\u201d The excitement was evident on the faces of his audience, and more than one of them was absentmindedly touching themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to Greg and sneered. \u201cYou\u2019ve always thought you were so much better than me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked like Jason had just aimed a bazooka at him. He put his hands up and shook his head vigorously. \u201cNo! No no no no no no! Never! Jason- I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued his speech despite Greg\u2019s denial. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had the advantage of genetics and time, that\u2019s all. Now I\u2019ve got the advantage. You\u2019re going to watch me eclipse your hard work in the blink of an eye. I\u2019ve altered my very physiology and amped the effectiveness of my workouts ten thousand times. Roughly speaking a single repetition for me will be equal to about a year\u2019s worth of workouts for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of his girls were moaning at the thought. Jason looked back and saw that Kristine had a hand inside her sports bra and was tweaking her nipple hard while Marie was massaging the inside of her thighs right at her crotch. Nikki, though, was the exception. She sat perfectly calmly smiling broadly at Jason with her legs crossed in front of her and her hands in her lap, fingers laced together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls,\u201d Jason spoke in a commanding tone, \u201cI want your full attention. Stop touching yourselves, if you please. There will be plenty of time for such pleasures later. Nikki, since you\u2019ve been very well behaved I\u2019d like you to be my assistant. Vanessa, you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ladies joined him and he ordered them to load the leg curl bench with 200 pounds. \"I'm really anxious to pump up my arms and chest, but I'm afraid that without a good solid foundation I'll collapse under my own mass.\" Jason explained to Greg. \"You know how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason set his right leg behind the bar and began to push. At first the weight hardly budged but very quickly the effort became easier. As his lower leg raised his quads bloomed and when he fully extended his leg he flexed a thigh that was nearly double the girth that it had been just moments before. His onlookers let out a mix of gasps and moans at the sight of his muscle expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lowered his right leg and repeated the motion with his left so that he now had a matching pair of thick, juicy thighs with deep ridges and definition. \"Not bad for a single rep, eh?\" Jason grinned. He looked at Nikki and Vanessa who both looked hungry. \"More weight means faster size, girls. Let's triple what I've got here. It's time to get really beefy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa moved quickly to add weight but Nikki, being the stronger by far, tossed the huge plates around and finished faster. Once both girls were done Jason repeated a single rep with each leg finding the 600 pounds much easier to manage than the 200 had been now that he was getting bigger. Despite the relative ease, however, his muscles expanded by even greater margins expanding each of his thighs to nearly a foot wide. His once over loose shorts were now becoming snug, his massive cock now visible through the fabric on his left leg.Jason was pretty sure his quads were now bigger than Greg's but just to be sure he commanded the girls to add more weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTriple it again, let\u2019s really blast these quads!\u201d Jason ran his hands over the giant muscles marveling at how hard they were. And they were his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Vanessa loaded plate after plate on then stopped and frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s full but we\u2019re still 300 pounds short.\u201d Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I want you two sitting on top of everything. That should get me close enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls smiled and quickly obliged perching on the stacks of plates bringing the total weight Jason would be curling to close to 1800 pounds on a single leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason set himself once more and lifted his right leg. This time his super strong muscles felt no resistance at all yet they ballooned out greatly. The shorts that he\u2019d been swimming in upon his arrival now split open around a leg that was a good 15 inches across. A single rep with his left leg brought identical results only this time his penis was also freed. His giant unit finally looked like it belonged next to his titanic thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019ll do for now as far as my quads are concerned.\u201d Jason said excusing Nikki and Vanessa from their perches. \u201cLet me just take a second to even out the backside.\u201d Jason flipped over onto his stomach and ground out a few quick reps to rapidly inflate his hamstrings and glutes making sure his legs looked super pumped from all angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done he stood and watched his reflection in the nearby mirror as he began standing on his toes doing calf raises, his new mass was enough weight to give his lower legs a decent workout. It was as if he were working a bellows that was inflating his calf muscles. His first two raises alone were effective enough to add 6 inches to his calves a piece. The next several reps packed 2 or 3 inches at a time onto his lower legs. By the time he was up to 10 he was only adding a bit of mass at a time but it allowed him to fine tune his preferred size. When he finally felt he looked in proportion his calf muscles were a ridiculous 33 inches around, however considering his thighs were nearly 50 inches it was no wonder they had to be so big to match up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked ludicrous; his lower half was bigger and more pumped up than any bodybuilder in history yet his torso and arms were still skinny and feeble. \"Hmm, walking is going to be a challenge.\" He said as he approached Greg and Laura, his massive quads pressed against each other making his stride a little awkward. Also, while his legs were powerful enough to support their own mass each time he lifted one to take a step forward the strain on his lower back and abs were causing the muscles there to begin to swell. Jason lifted the bottom of his shirt to find a washboard stomach that was becoming more defined and solid with every step he took. He was filled with giddy excitement as he felt the ridges around each growing muscle deepen little by little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up,\" Jason told Greg. \"Let's see how I compare.\u201d He flexed his right leg and his insane quads spilled out in all directions audibly swelling and seeming to envelope his knee. \u201cNow you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stood slowly and though every instinct in his body was telling him to just run he had no choice but to obey Jason\u2019s command. He placed his once impressive leg alongside Jason\u2019s obviously superior limb and flexed. Jason was not only the clear winner his thigh was at least half again as large as Greg\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason roared with laughter. \u201cSit down, wimp. It\u2019s time to finish this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than 10 minutes later Jason was done, and he could have finished much faster if he hadn\u2019t spent so much time reveling in his expansion. He performed sit ups to bring his abs up to par, after 2 reps it was so easy he had to have Nikki and Vanessa sit on his chest so he could feel any sort of resistance. He bench pressed his chest to mammoth size exploding his shirt right off his body. He grabbed the heaviest free weights he could find to beef up his arms, back and shoulders and then still had to resort to using a fully loaded bench press bar as if it were a dumbbell. His muscles weren\u2019t just big they were superhumanly strong; Jason found himself holding a world record breaking bench press in one hand and curling it like it were nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood completely naked among his women and flexed his chest and legs with his hands on his hips admiring his own reflection. \u201cI feel like a god,\u201d he said. His expanded chest deepened his voice making him sound every bit the deity he claimed to feel like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to tower over Greg one more time. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask you to flex, there\u2019s no way you could come close to matching my size with your pathetic muscles.\u201d Jason flexed his own 36 inch bicep in Greg\u2019s face. \u201cNow you and every other asshole who fucked with me and thought they knew was strength was is going to deal with this. This is what real power looks like.\u201d He slapped the mountainous peek of his arm. \u201cBetcha wish you had been nicer to me, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg wanted to tell Jason he\u2019d always liked him, had never thought he\u2019d been mean. \u201cJason, I-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason swung a great arm and slapped Greg across the side of the head. The bodybuilder went flying across the length of the entire gym and slammed into a wall on the far side leaving a large indent in the drywall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg lay broken on the floor, blood streaming from his ear and mouth, his vision was nothing but a haze. A few moments later, though, that haze was filled with an enormous shape surrounded by several smaller ones. Greg blinked a few times and his vision cleared enough to identify Jason and his group of ladies. Vanessa was attached to Jason\u2019s hip and Jason had his arm around her, his hand under the strap of her slingshot bikini and squeezing her perfect breast. Vanessa\u2019s face was awash in ecstasy as mere contact with the skin of her muscle god was enough to send her into orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe world better watch out,\u201d Jason said. \u201cI\u2019m taking over.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Laura had to smirk as Vanessa was benching her set of 65 lbs when she herself had struggled with just the bar.  The difference was marginal and Laura knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, girls. That was a good first day to find out where we are.  Let's meet back tomorrow to really hit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura couldn't wait.  In the matter of a year, she'd be practically superhuman, but it shouldn't take long for her to overtake Vanessa's strength, and that would be something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>One Month Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura should be ecstatic.  The last month had added 20 lbs to her frame bringing her up to an athletic 125.  She was actually getting regularly checked out in public now, a feeling she had rarely experienced before.  Not to mention she was pretty sure her long time platonic friend Jason was practically in love with her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lifts had improved too.  She was going to be damn strong when this ended.  The first month alone had upped her bench (her favorite lift to track her strength) from struggling with the 45 lb bar to full sets with 100.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura should have been ecstatic because she should finally be surpassing Vanessa at something.  Somehow, though, Vanessa was actually progressing faster than Laura.  Yet another example of the Friedman genes being uneven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa had added a six-pack under her Double-Ds, and none of the fat loss had come from her chest.  Vanessa had originally wanted to join Greg at the gym to \"tone up\" and maybe check out the hunks,  but from the first day she had fallen in love with lifting and was damn good at it.  In four short weeks her sister had become somewhat of a celebrity in the gym for her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Vanessa.  Even I didn't make those kinds of gains my first month.\" Greg interjected, breaking Laura's inner monologue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sat and watched her sister posing in the mirror after her third bench press set with 150 lbs.  \"You know, I was afraid that the stronger I got that I'd lose my, um, assets.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  I mean, I had an awesome booty before, but now I look 10x better.  Even the muscles I was really scared to build look good.\"  Vanessa flexed her biceps in the mirror and grinned as wide as possible. A tennis ball sized mound rose from her slender arm.  \"I thought it wasn't feminine, but I was wrong.  The bigger I get the sexier I feel.  I told myself I'd stop gaining after a little bit, but no way.  I'm getting as big as possible.\"  She pumped her arm a few more times and then spread her lats and turned to look over her shoulder in the mirror.  \"You know what I mean, Laura?  You have to, you're building up, too., no offense, but this look is a huge improvement from where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and nodded.  She knew her sister was right, but she struggled with the jealousy.  She was supposed to be the one making a splash, but as usual, Vanessa stole the spotlight.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Another Month Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jealousy never went away.  Laura had assumed that her sister would plateau and she would overtake her easily, but it was not to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app was performing it's magic on Laura.  She had added another 23 lbs and no longer merely looked athletic, she was downright muscular and sexy at 148.  Her buff body drew stares everywhere she went.  And she knew for sure that her long time friend Jason was in love with her because he told her so last week.  An admission he made after being given permission to feel her flexed biceps.  Her muscles weren't just for show, either.  She had just set a new one rep max on the bench with 190 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jealousy has never gone away because Vanessa is now warming up with that same 190 lbs.  The jealousy was wrestling with awe, though.  According to Greg, nobody had ever made progress this fast, man or woman.  He had asked her if she was on steroids, but he believed her denial because there was no drug that could cause muscle mass to grow this fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jealousy won, though, because that awe should be hers.  She, too, was making unheard of gains, but Greg and everyone else was focused on Vanessa's metamorphosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa easily put the bar back on the rack and stood up to pose in the mirror as she always did between sets.  \"275 today.  I want a new PR.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, 'Ness.\"  Greg set about loading the bar, just shaking his head and laughing to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was tipping the scales at 180 muscular pounds.  The fat had pretty much disappeared from her body, except for exactly where a woman would want it.  180 lbs of hard muscle looked unbelievable with natural DD's and a bubble butt.  Literally unbelievable because it was unheard of.  Especially paired with the 17\" biceps she was proudly flexing in the mirrored wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable was an understatement.  Laura's growth was unbelievable, Vanessa's was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDUH! How had she not thought of it before now.  Maybe the app made a parallel change to Vanessa because of genetics or something.  She pulled up the app for the first time in awhile.  She didn't have much use for it right now since her profile was locked down until the end of her growth.  If Vanessa was affected, hers would be locked, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's heart sank as her sister's page opened completely, showing a perfect model of the behemoth of beauty.  Laura dejectedly flipped through the settings admiring the numerical representation of Vanessa's perfection when she came across an interesting setting she hadn't seen before: \"Muscle Growth Aptitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a scale of 1-100 Vanessa's bar was naturally set at 95, which explained the ever growing mass of sexuality in front of her.  Flipping over to Greg she sees his is sitting at 71.  On her own page, she finds her aptitude is a ridiculous 12, which didn't matter due to the other alterations she had made to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention was drawn away from her phone to the bench where Vanessa lifted the ridiculous weight from the rack.  She promptly completed her new 1-rep max and followed it up with 4 more labored, screaming, presses.  After racking the bar, she sprang to her feet and ran to the mirror to witness her own massive most muscular flex.  Her now known aptitude level had allowed that lift to pump her chest enough that her pecs had obviously grown from just a moment ago, enough to make the straps of her bikini top visibly stretch.  Oh yeah, by the way, Vanessa lifts in a bikini top, cut off denim booty shorts, and on non-leg days like today, 4-inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jealousy never went away.  Laura needed to do something about it.</span></div></div>",

It had a reputation as the most hardcore muscle factory in the area, and initially that had felt like an attraction.  Surely surrounded by all of these bodybuilders she would find help and motivation.  Instead she had just found confusion and intimidation.  She had no idea what she was doing and that was punctuated by the fact that so many people here had obviously been doing this for so long, especially the massive and gorgeous model/bodybuilder currently about to flex out of her top in front of the mirrored wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, standing around gawking isn't going to get anything accomplished.\"  Angela said to nobody in particular.  \"Might as well try something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she found the least fit girl she could find and decided to emulate her.  The problem is, although she was the nearest in fitness level, it still wasn't close.  This girl looked like she had walked out of a fitness magazine and straight to the dumbbells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela sighed and followed step.  She passed over the lightest weights, assuming that although she had never worked out once in her life,her natural size should give her something of an advantage.  Angela was 6' tall and mostly legs.  Unfortunately for her, that picturesque frame was covered with almost 300 lbs of fat.  Earlier this week she had looked into the mirror and was honest with herself for the first time in awhile.  She had to admit that she was actually quite attractive facially, she just had to make her body match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, Angela grabbed the 25's assuming this would be a good start.  They were heavier than she had anticipated and she had struggled to emulate the good form of the woman next to her.  Angela was a determined woman, though.  She forced herself to curl the weights 10 times, and by the end she had found her rhythm.  The lifts were actually easier than at first, so she just assumed she had started wrong.  She picked them up again to do another set of 10 and found that the whole set went smoothly.  Stealing a glance at the girl next to her, she noticed that although she was undoubtedly more muscular and toned, she was also just using 25's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  I must have some muscle under this flab.\"  Angela said to herself and flexed a double biceps pose in the mirror.  To her utter shock, there was movement atop her arm.  More than just movement, her upper arm swelled above her shoulder.  It didn't have the definition or shape of the rest of the meatheads around her, but there was definitely considerable mass there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Angela had considered buying time with a trainer when she signed up at this gym.  There was certainly no shortage of qualified candidates to help her chisel her physique.  That turned out to be unnecessary, though, as she was apparently a natural at bodybuilding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have I never tried weight training before?\"  She muttered to herself in the changing room stall.  She was observing herself in the private mirror hanging on the back of the door.  She had tried every fad diet, infomercial training program, and even other conventional exercises like yoga.  She had never given true resistance training a chance but she was taking to it now like a fish to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God.  If a week of aimlessly lifting has given me this, imagine if I had dedicated myself to it awhile ago, like in college or high school.\"  She watched her underwear clad frame bring up a double bicep flex.  She was still soft, which is why she worked out in an oversized track suit, especially with viral sensation Vanessa Friedman always around showing off her shredded bulk in next to nothing.  The thick layer of fat was giving way to hard muscle, though, and every day after her workout she made sure to examine her progress in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most women she initially wanted to lose all her fat and be like the slim and lean models plastered all over society's advertising.  Like other women, she had liked the idea of having abs, but also like other women she had hated the idea of cardio.  Unlike most other women, when she saw her arms move with her flex, she began to like the idea of growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the growth now.  Even though she stayed clear of the treadmills, she was losing fat all over her body.  That fat was being replaced by strong muscle.  That first day she had been somewhat close to Vanessa as she shot a video for her YouTube channel.  For her fanbase, which was growing almost as fast as she was, Vanessa was measuring her biceps, cheering loudly when she squeezed her flex to get them over 17 inches.  Angela had never though of measuring her arms or body parts other than bust/waist/hips.  It made sense to her as a way to track progress, so she had done the same, just not for a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fished the measuring tape from her bag and wrapped it around the largest part of her upper arm.  She looked at her notepad to see last week's measurements, though she remembered them easily.  A week ago, her first day at the gym, her arm had been 14 inches unflexed and 15 inches flexed.  Some research told her that those were impressive numbers even for a woman of her height.  She doubted it was impressive at all if you took into consideration how soft her arms were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tightened the tape around her relaxed arm.  13.75 inches.  A good amount of fat loss for just a week of working out.  Angela brought out a smirk.  One thing the tape didn't tell was the strength she could feel even in her inert arm. Eagerly she flexed her bicep as hard as she could, nearly dropping the tape measure in her enthusiasm. She had stretched it to 15.5 inches.  A half inch of growth in a week was great.  Combined with the quarter inch of fat loss it was awesome.  What was making her bite her lip in excitement was something else altogether.  She could feel the power inside her body and it was intoxicating.  As she had seen Vanessa do last week, she relaxed her arm and quickly brought it back into a flex with all of her might.  Her arm shook and she ground her teeth, and the tape slid past 16 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the tape she turned back to the mirror.  She had slowly begun to see definition throughout the week, but not that much.  Now she could see the full separation of her biceps from her arm.  A visibly hard peak stood next to a large, round deltoid.  Without any form of smooth transition, she unleashed the same power she felt in her biceps from every muscle in her body with a most muscular flex.  She watched as her body went from large and obviously strong but smooth and a little soft, to large, obviously strong, and incredibly hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched rapturously as her abs not only appeared from beneath her fat, but showed up as a six pack.  Her pecs surged forth, lifting her large breasts with them.  Her shoulders bulged and hardened while her traps reached a bit higher up her neck.  Her back widened, audibly straining the cheap sports bra she wore under her jacket.  She was straightening both of her legs, standing on the ball of her foot, which brought her quads flexing past her kneecap and made her calves so large the muscle could be seen from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of her transformative flex to find her body had returned closer to it's previous state, but not completely.  Even relaxed she now looked like she belonged in this gym.  \"Holy shit.\"  She said to herself, trying to sort out her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, she recovered mentally and slid the pants over her now noticeably stronger legs and more bubbly butt.  She reached for her jacket hanging from the hook and caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?  I thought I was cute before.\" She said to nobody in particular.  \"I was wrong.  I was hot as Hell.  Now I look even better.\"  She let go of the jacket, and flexed her triceps.  \"I think I'm getting my second wind.  This workout isn't over.\"  She confidently strode out of the changing stall into the locker room, leaving her jacket behind and openly showing off her upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreviously she stood out as being out of shape.  Now she blended in perfectly with the assorted models, gorgeous women, and bodybuilders that used these facilities.  She made her way past these beauties toward the training floor to see what would happen if she dedicated herself NOW.</span></div></div>",

He knew how tall he was.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course there was the other problem.  He wasn't just not gaining any from his workouts.  He was losing size.  His arms had gone from being 24 inches in May down to 22 last week.  His six pack was beginning to disappear.  And his thighs...well he didn't want to say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pouting was interrupted by a loud obnoxious grunt.  He looked over and was surprised to see a woman that was deadlifting what had to be two hundred pounds!   \"HUH!\"  She cried as she lifted the big bar into the air the muscle on her back hardening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg decided he wasn't prepared to meet this new muscle head.  She was obviously a serious hard body.  And he wanted to get his gains back before he introduced himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman grunted and dropped the weight onto the ground her trainer an attractive man, clapped his hands.  \"Excellent work ma'am.

Laura being short, skinny and plain, was invisible to the various species of bully that patrolled her schools and the beach. Jason, on the other hand, was, at 6\u2019, tall and skinny which made him easily spotted and a constant target of anyone stronger than he which was almost everyone. Jason had mentioned on more than one occasion that he wished he could be big and strong like Laura\u2019s brother so that he could defend himself.

She increased his height to 6\u2019 6\u201d so he would stand a full 4 inches taller than her brother. Then she began piling on pounds of muscle until Jason out-shined her brother in that regard as well.

I need you to focus on what I\u2019m saying. You\u2019re not playing WOW or anything are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI\u2019m not raiding until tonight. I was just reading. What\u2019s up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Laura took a deep breath. \u201cYou remember how you\u2019re always talking about how you wished you could be muscular and strong like Greg so those assholes that push you around would back off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed, \u201cNot my favorite subject, but yes.

Over the course of the next year you\u2019re going to grow muscles even bigger than Greg\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found this... application. And I know it sounds insane, but it\u2019s, like, magic or something. It can change people\u2019s bodies. I used it to input a growth profile that will turn you into a bodybuilder sized hunk over the course of the next year. I just wanted to let you know so that you knew what was going on when your body started getting bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence on the other end of the line for a long time. Finally Jason spoke, \u201cHave you lost it? There\u2019s no such thing as-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA minute ago. Did you feel a strange warmth enter your body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the pause told her that she was right. It had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s hot in here. You know my dad never lets us turn on the air conditioner.\u201d Jason said, obviously taken aback by her knowledge.  \u201cIf you really have some magic.. whatever then use it to do something to me right now. Make me taller or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at the screen and saw that the height button was dimmed out. \u201cI can\u2019t change your height now, I locked in an increase of that over the course of the next year along with your muscles. Besides, I made the changes gradual so that people wouldn\u2019t wonder how you sprouted to 6 foot 6 overnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow convenient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d she said getting a little frustrated, \u201cI\u2019ll change whatever you want, but it has to be something only you can see. Do you have a scar or a birthmark you want removed or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have anything like that, but... well, uh... I guess if you want something that only I ever see... you could...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned. She knew where he was going and, on the iPhone\u2019s screen, zoomed in on his crotch. She was going to make him say it, though and remained silent waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could make my.... you know... bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour what?\u201d she asked playing dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was mumbling now. \u201cMy penis. Make it bigger. You know.. if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of torturing him further she agreed. \u201cHow big do you want it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me some sort of hint, you wuss. A little bigger, porn star quality, horse cock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... like, 13 inches or something like that. You know, big.\u201d Jason paused then added, \u201cAnd if you\u2019re fucking with me I\u2019ll never speak to you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, big guy, here it comes.\u201d She punched in the changes increasing his flaccid penis up to 6 inches and his erect size to 13 and a half. She then quickly increased his erect girth a little and even added a little mass to his testicles then hit \u201capply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her finger hit the button she could hear Jason begin breathing heavily. \u201cOh god,\u201d he muttered over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \u201cHow\u2019s that feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-Incredible! Ooooohhh!!! Nnnnnnmmmmmmmaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued to moan for nearly a full minute at which point he got very quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura waited a few moments then asked, \u201cStill there, tiger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sorry. I had to take my pants off. I shot a load into them bigger than any I\u2019ve ever seen. The entire left side of my pants are covered in cum.\u201d Jason laughed. \u201cThis is insane. I\u2019ve never seen a cock like this. It\u2019s so big and hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s hot! You\u2019ll have to show me sometime. So, you believe me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to dispute the evidence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, listen. One year from today you\u2019ll be a 6 foot 6 inch 275 pound giant. You\u2019re going to grow slowly at first, then faster and faster. I suggest that you do what I\u2019m going to do and join a gym so people aren\u2019t confused when muscle appears out of nowhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll tell them I\u2019m going through a second puberty. That\u2019ll help explain the extra height too. Wait, do what you do? You\u2019re going to grow too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled wide, \u201cThat\u2019s a secret. See you around, stud.\u201d She hung up the phone before Jason could form a protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was happier in that moment than she\u2019d been in her entire life.

She knew that Greg had a weight set in the basement, but decided she wanted something more public where she could be seen working out and gaining mass over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura changed into sweat shorts and a t-shirt. Then she went outside and hopped on her bike. A few minutes later she arrived at the massive gym and went inside. The clerk behind the counter was wearing a tight black t-shirt that was tight across his thick pectorals and bulging shoulders. Laura looked forward to the day that she too would fill out a shirt the way he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said with a bright smile, \u201cwhat can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking to sign up for a membership.\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, great.

Just fill out this form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did so quickly and handed the paper over with her ID and her debit card.

There was no question that Jay was muscular, but Adam made Jay look like a wimp by comparison. Adam was somewhere around 6\u2019 5\u201d and had developed his body to a form that surpassed her brothers. Jay introduced Adam to Laura and they went on a brief tour of the facilities. All the while Laura was watching Adam\u2019s massive legs pumping as he walked and his arms swell when he lifted them to point out various machines. Laura could tell that Adam was friendly and fun, but took his body and the gym very seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon completing the tour Adam looked Laura in the eye and asked her about her fitness goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that I\u2019m just messing around here. I really want to build my body up. I mean a lot. I know it\u2019s going to take a lot of work and a lot of time, but I would love to have muscles like yours someday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you. A build my size is probably out of your reach. That\u2019s nothing against your commitment, it\u2019s just basic physiology. I\u2019m more than a foot taller than you and I have a bigger frame. Plus, not to be sexist, but men are just capable of building more muscle than women are. But if you really want to build muscle, a lot of muscle, I can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really great.\" Laura paused for a moment before adding. \"Can I ask you something, it's kind of silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam's smile reduced to an interested grin. \"Sure, what do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed a little but went ahead anyway, \"Um, I was just wondering how big your arms were. Around, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam laughed then held both of his meaty arms up for her to see. He clenched his fist and flexed balls of muscle that Greg would have killed to possess. \"23 inches,\" he said. \"Some of the biggest you'll find anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>For now</i>, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent the next hour putting together a complex workout plan combined with an extremely high protein diet. After looking over all the information Adam had thrown her way she was very glad to have the magic of the Alterations app working for her. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to stomach even one of Adam\u2019s \u201c19 raw egg smoothies.\u201c Still, she was certainly looking forward to showing him just what her body was really capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their plan was in place Adam took Laura around and put her through the paces and made sure she understood how to perform each exercise. After completing an hour of pumping iron and hefting more weight than she thought she was able of lifting Laura went home feeling energized and somewhat sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rode her bike home she realized that the warm feeling that had entered her body earlier when she\u2019d started her slow growth had increased to a dull roar that flooded her body and was even warmer in the muscle groups that she\u2019d worked during her session with Adam. The feeling was incredible; it felt like the power of the app was filling her body already. She wanted more. Sadly, though, as the night wore on it faded and by the time Laura was getting into bed the original warmth had returned to its original level.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later, as Laura was leaving for the gym, Vanessa asked her where she was going. Since Laura had been feeling more confident her relationship with her siblings had improved and she didn\u2019t have any issues with telling her the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI joined up with the gym down the street. I\u2019ve decided that I want to get fit, and maybe get bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Vanessa asked, \u201cGood for you. How big are you planning on getting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019d be cool to be really big. Like Greg or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Vanessa could respond a booming laughter spun Laura around. Greg was exiting the kitchen with a huge plate of food in his hand. \u201cYou think you can reach my size? First of all you need to know that a woman with a little bit of muscle is sexy. A woman with a lot of muscle is ugly. Why would you want to look like a man? And another thing there is no way you could <i>ever</i> get anywhere near my size. Women are weaker and smaller than men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was turning red with anger. How dare the big oaf tell her what she could do or what looked good. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what my body is capable of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said. \u201cGet fit. It\u2019s good for you. But be realistic.\u201d He then turned and took his food down to his weight room and closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to storm out of the house when Vanessa took her hand and turned her back towards her. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cMuscles are totally hot on women, and you can get as big as you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled. \u201cThanks. And I know. This time next year he\u2019ll be eating his words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind. I\u2019m out of here. See you later.\u201d Laura headed out and off to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day she worked out harder than ever, focusing on her anger at Greg and pushing herself more and more. She worked until the warmth inside her was a raging fire that consumed every muscle in her body, injecting them with lava. When she couldn\u2019t stand anymore she went home and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a month. She didn\u2019t work out every day of the 5 day schedule Adam had given her, but when she did go to the gym she would think about Greg\u2019s moronic laughter and pig-headed arrogance and it would spur her on to work her body to a fiery exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the first month she checked her weight versus the chart from the Alterations app. According to the growth chart she had set up she should have gained 5 pounds bringing her total weight to 110. Instead the bathroom scale told her she was up to 116.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d Laura said examining her reflection in the mirror. \u201cMaybe this thing isn\u2019t as precise as it seems. Though it is super exciting to see that it\u2019s working. Six new pounds of muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t see any real change to her physique yet, but she could feel it. Her stomach wasn\u2019t as soft as it used to be, and her thighs felt tight and strong. Since she felt so good she dismissed the extra 6 pounds and continued working out as she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother month passed and she was really noticing some changes. Her shoulders were filling out her shirts a lot more, her stomach was beginning to show hints of defined abdominal muscles beneath her skin, and her arms, when flexed, were beginning to thicken with rounded biceps. Her strength was increasing, as well. Adam was rather surprised by the way she was able to add 5-10 pounds to her lifts on nearly a weekly basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura called Jason to check on his process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you noticed any changes?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am an inch taller. If I\u2019m going to grow 6 inches over twelve months it sounds like I\u2019m right on track.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about your weight? When I checked last month I was a little over plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last time I check was a few days ago. I was up by about 10 pounds. I\u2019m really starting to feel it too. My chest and shoulders are definitely bigger. Another month and I\u2019ll need to buy some new clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.. It sounds like you\u2019re exactly on the track that I set up for you. I wonder why I was growing faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you checked yourself recently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it right now,\u201d she got up and went into the bathroom. \u201cHang on a second, I need to check the chart.\u201d She tapped her phone\u2019s screen until her plan was displayed while she stepped on the scale. \u201cAccording to this I should weigh an extra 5 pounds. Last month I weighed 116 so I shouldn\u2019t be any heavier than 121 give or take a few pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so what does the scale say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Laura said, somewhat startled, \u201cIt says...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Why am I going faster while you\u2019re growing exactly as you should?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jason said. \u201cAre you doing anything that I\u2019m not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be. Wait, did you join a gym like I told you to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s question was followed by a silence that she took for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit, Jason! I told you to start exercising. What are people going to say when they start noticing you turning into a world class bodybuilder when all you do is sit on your ass and play video games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I didn\u2019t ask you to pump my muscles up and turn me into some meat head. Besides, I told my mom that I\u2019ve taken up swimming and I head down to the beach for a few hours a day. Swimming is a really good workout, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Laura said calming down, \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just concerned about just how big I\u2019m going to get at this rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stop working out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura thought for a moment. She didn\u2019t want to tell Jason the truth, that she was becoming addicted to the way the fire built in her body to a raging blaze. Besides, the more she thought about it the more she really liked the effect her workouts had on her body. And couldn\u2019t she stop down the line if she began growing too fast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d She finally said. \u201cSee you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up and checked herself out in the mirror. When she flexed her arms a noticeable swell of bicep sprouted up. She did the same for her right leg and smiled as her thigh hardened into a shapely mass. She squeezed her quadricep and felt no give. Slight as her muscles were they were solid as rocks. And she couldn\u2019t wait until her body really started transforming into a bulging mass of muscle. But she\u2019d have to be careful not to arouse suspicion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura smiled at her improving body.  She really did want to work out more and before she had talked to Jason mentally set herself to up her workouts to 5 to 6 times a week.  Maybe even a few twice a days as long as it didn\u2019t interfere with her college work.  As a freshman at the local college it was easy to get lost in the crowd, which was fine for her at the moment.  Greg went to the community college, hoping to graduate with a technical degree next year, while Vanessa worked at a local salon, still holding out hopes for some type of modeling career.  The three siblings passed each other in the hallways and saw each other occasionally at dinner, but beyond that they didn\u2019t hang out or talk much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Laura went downstairs the next day to head to the gym, she was surprised to see Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Laura, heading off to the gym again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head.  \u201cYeah.  I\u2019ve been getting pretty good results.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled, giving her the once over.  She had shorts on, but a baggy top covered up her torso.  Her legs certainly looked well toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad for a girl.  But don\u2019t push it too hard, you don\u2019t want to hurt yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sniffed.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t hurt myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled and headed out the door, leaving Laura fuming in her own juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thoughts she had about upping her workouts were now thrown out the window.  She\u2019d show him what she was capable of.  To heck with raising suspicion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Laura dove into her weight lifting like a woman possessed.  Still following Adam\u2019s plan, she simply upped the intensity and increased the weight.  Adam was now more than a bit surprised as her lifts were now increasing by 15 to 20 pounds a week.  At least!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another month passed by and Adam was spotting her on the bench press, he looked down at Laura.  \u201cYou\u2019re not on steroids are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked back up surprised at his bold question.  \u201cNope.  That isn\u2019t a healthy choice.  Why do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never seen anyone make the gains you\u2019ve made.  I mean everyone hits a plateau now and again.  But you\u2019re like some type of machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura twitched her nose and smiled.  \u201cIs that bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no.  But I\u2019ve never seen anyone ON steroids make your gains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled.  \u201cWell my face isn\u2019t breaking out, my voice hasn\u2019t changed and I\u2019m not growing a beard.  Let\u2019s just settle on a pleasant natural oddity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam responded with his own chuckle.  \u201cFair enough.\u201d  He looked at the bar and the whistled at the fact that the bar was holding 345 pounds.  \u201cFor a pleasant natural oddity, you sure are strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed as she brought her well muscled arms up to the bar.  \u201cAnd getting stronger every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled the bar off the rack with a grunt and held it for a moment.  The warm rush she always felt when she lifted heavy weights was now like a drug and she sighed with pleasure.  As Adam followed the bar down, Laura touched her thick pectorals and with another girlish grunt pushed the weight back up.  And as Adam shook his head with admiration, Laura pulled the bar back down again and pushed it back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her workout for the day, Laura ran home, which was now her routine, time permitting.  She was not just getting stronger, but fitter too.  Reaching the back door, Laura tossed her backpack to the ground and grabbed a water bottle she had left in the cooler.  She was in nothing but shorts and an athletic bra and the sweat beaded up on her muscles as she took a drink from the bottle.  Flexing her arm, a softball sized ball of hard muscle pressed against her skin, showcasing not just impressive shape, but great detail.  Three months in and she was as muscular as most any female bodybuilder she found in Greg\u2019s magazines.  And her strength was growing even beyond that.  She knew she was well ahead of the app schedule, but she didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the water Laura heard the door open behind her and a surprised exclamation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura!  Is that really you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura recognized the voice and smiled, turning her head slowly to look at\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My little Lulu, you\u2019re so big now! You weren\u2019t kidding when you said you were going to give Greg a run for his money. You look incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ve been pushing myself real hard lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I.. um.. feel?\u201d Now it was Vanessa\u2019s turn to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Laura put her water down and approached her older sister. She saw that Vanessa was wearing her black capri pants and matching low top sneakers with her white button up blouse open at the top to reveal the deep well of cleavage between her giant breasts. This was the outfit she regularly wore to the salon. Laura used to look upon even a simple outfit like this one with great jealousy but for the first time she could remember it was Vanessa who was overcome by the green-eyed monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood before Vanessa who reached out and took hold of the younger girl\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Vanessa said then covered her mouth embarrassed by her outburst. \u201cSorry.\u201d She returned both of her hands to Laura\u2019s solid delts and squeezed as hard as she could. \u201cWhat do you have under there? Steel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled then bent her right arm in front of her chest and flexed her softball sized bicep for Vanessa to feel. Vanessa ran her fingers all over her sister\u2019s well defined and completely solid arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing, Lulu, keep it up. You look amazing. Sometimes I wish I could have a body like yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Laura was bowled over hearing a phrase she had thought a million times come from Vanessa\u2019s mouth. She couldn\u2019t believe the tables had turned the way they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! It would be so cool to be so strong. Maybe then I could put Greg in his place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a laugh from Laura. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m <i>a lot</i> stronger than I look. My strength has been growing faster than my size. In a few weeks I should be stronger than Greg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! Really?\u201d Vanessa\u2019s eyes were alight with joy at this thought. \u201cThat would be insane! I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d Vanessa wrapped her arms around her sister and gave her a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Vanessa let go she gathered her things. \u201cI\u2019ve got to head to the salon, but you should come by if you have time. I\u2019ll give you a new style to go with your new body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d really like that. Maybe I will. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you, sis. Keep up the great work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa left and Laura went upstairs to soak in the bathtub and enjoy the afterglow of an intense workout.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no question that Laura was addicted to the way the hot glow of growth filled her body when she worked out. Even though she was concerned about the speed at which she was growing and what people would say about her she was overjoyed by the sheer power her muscled body possessed. And she was literally getting stronger every day. The conversation she\u2019d had with Vanessa gave her an excuse to push aside all worries and dive headlong into her workouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next day she returned to the gym and blasted past all her previous records. She worked for over four solid hours lifting more weight than ever before. The entire time the heat inside her built into a blaze so great that it even roared inside her ears blocking out all sound. She felt like she was standing at the base of Niagara Falls and could hear nothing but the deafening din all around her. Adam spoke to her just before she left, but his words were lost in the static. She just smiled and nodded at him, which must have worked because he, seeming satisfied, clapped her on the back and went on his way. Laura ran home and showered and slowly the fire that burned within her and fueled her ever expanding muscles faded back to its normal glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night she stopped off at Jason\u2019s house to see how he was doing. The two didn\u2019t see quite as much of each other as they used to, but she still did her best to make time for him at least once a week. Tonight they had made arrangements to go see the new sci-fi movie that was opening at the local theater. It was some alien invasion affair and Laura laughed as she knocked on Jason\u2019s door thinking to herself that you could pump a nerd full of massive muscles but they\u2019d still be a nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove her point Jason answered the door wearing a black t-shirt with the crest of Hyrule across the front. The shirt was on its last legs, though as it was stretched across a torso that was bulging with large, rounded shoulders and thick pectorals. Jason had put on a good 35 pounds of muscle in the three months since all this started, and while his physique was not in Laura\u2019s league or even close, he was beginning to look really strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s eyes went wide when he saw his friend. He looked her up and down while trying not to let himself get carried away lest his 13 and a half inch penis awake and make its presence known. It wasn\u2019t easy considering her outfit. She had turned her favorite jeans into a pair of cut-off shorts, and the legs that flowed out of them were bulging and curvy. Her chest was covered by a red tube top that molded itself to her dense pectorals and left her stomach and shoulders bare. \u201cWow, Laura,\u201d he said, \u201cyou just keep getting bigger every time I see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet, big guy.\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just getting warmed up.\u201d Then she brought up her arm and flexed a bicep that looked ready to pop through her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped. \u201cHow big is that thing now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust 16 tiny little inches. I can\u2019t wait until it gets <i>really</i> big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c16 inches is really good. There are a bunch of female bodybuilders out there that aren\u2019t that big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd some are bigger. But why are you comparing me to the women?\u201d She stepped forward and put her hands on his chest and began feeling around his pecs and abs. \u201cYou know I\u2019m in a class all my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to speak but only a few sputtering sounds escaped his lips as Laura\u2019s hands traced the lines of his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed, \u201cC\u2019mon Jason, I\u2019m just messing with you! It\u2019s just so much fun. Let\u2019s get going!\u201d She grabbed his hand and yanked him out of the house and towards the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie was dull, the sort of thing that she\u2019d seen a million times before and done better. About half way through she glanced to her right where Jason sat and realized that he wasn\u2019t watching the movie either. He was tracing the outline of her body with his eyes. She watched him for nearly a full minute before he realized she was looking his way, but instead of being ashamed he held her eyes with his own. Laura smiled and ran her hand down her chest through the divide between her pecs, across the ridges of her stomach and onto the swell of her thighs. Her look seemed to ask <i>You like what you see?</i> and she was quite excited when Jason smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached across meant to put his hand on hers, but as the last second she moved hers away leaving him with his fingers gripping the rock hard region of her thigh. He was astounded that something so hard could be wrapped in skin so soft and smooth. He slowly began moving his hand up the length of her leg but before he was able to get more than halfway Laura leaned in close to him. Jason did the same from his angle and the two kissed, Laura\u2019s hands going straight to the back of Jason\u2019s head to hold him there and make sure she wasn\u2019t just imagining this. Jason\u2019s hand then slid in between her legs and made its way toward the frayed hem of her shorts. It was then that Laura got up and dragged him out of the theater and back to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason drove home faster than he\u2019d ever driven before casting glances at Laura the whole way. When they got back to his house they bounded up the stairs toward his room shedding clothes the whole way. When they got to his bedroom Jason spun around to embrace Laura, but she shoved him so that he landed on his bed. At this point he was wearing only his underwear which was doing a poor job of encasing his porn star sized member. For the first time she was able to really take in his enlarged muscles and was impressed; he looked like an olympian gymnast. She crawled across the bed towards him then took his underwear in both of her hands and pulled ripping his briefs to shreds. Then she dove on his massive cock and began licking, sucking and stroking it with both hands causing Jason to writhe with ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he couldn\u2019t take anymore she crawled the rest of the way up his body and, draping her hair to one side over her beefy shoulder, locked her lips on his. At the same time she slid his penis into her and slowly slid down as far as she could. She then moved back up and began riding him faster and faster until she was bouncing rapidly up and down and howling with pleasure. Jason ran his hands over her entire body, feeling her incredible muscles and in turn she flexed for him loving the worship and attention he paid her awesome physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued in this way for over an hour, both of them finding that with their extra size came extra stamina. By the end both had orgasmed several times and Jason\u2019s bed sheets were soaked with sweat. They slept wrapped in each others arms both thinking about how, for years they\u2019d both assumed they would lose their virginity to each other but never imagining it would ever have been so amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning Jason watched as Laura gathered her clothes together and smiled as her muscles pumped, bunched and flexed with every graceful movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d she asked pulling her tube top over her thick chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much bigger are you going to get?\u201d he asked trying to hide his excitement and failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even imagine. Before you know it I\u2019ll be bigger and stronger than anyone has ever dreamed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s penis awoke and very quickly leapt to attention pitching a tent in the middle of Jason\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and said her goodbyes. There were now three reasons for her to workout and push herself harder than ever before.  All thoughts of modesty vanished and she longed to feel the ever present glow build to a raging inferno of growth and power.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura\u2019s growth spurt had not gone unnoticed by her brother. He was astounded by the fact that his sister, in such a short time, was able to transform herself into a full blown female bodybuilder. He attributed his quick gains to good family genetics; after all hadn\u2019t he been able to pack muscle on at a pretty fast rate himself? The trouble was that she didn\u2019t seem to be slowing down. So it was that about the time Laura\u2019s relationship with Jason was beginning to really take form Greg was also establishing a new relationship, two, in fact. The first was with a new girlfriend. The second was with steroids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn\u2019t know where Greg had found his new lady friend, but she was clearly one in a billion. Her name was Emily and her body had dimensions that made Vanessa look like a flat-chested little boy. Emily stood as tall as Greg\u2019s 6\u2019 2\u201d, but Laura never saw her not wearing high heeled shoes that brought her height to 6\u2019 6\u201d and made her already incredibly long legs even longer. When in her heels Emily\u2019s hips were even with the top of Laura\u2019s stomach even though Laura\u2019s height had now reached 5\u2019 6\u201d (half way to her goal of 5\u2019 8\u201d). Emily\u2019s beauty was unequaled, her strawberry blond hair was luscious and bright, her eyes were the sort of blue oceans should have been, and her face could have graced the cover of any glamor or style magazine and would have allowed the airbrushing or touch-up artists to just take a vacation, she was flawless. Her body was slim but solid and toned and appeared to hide some serious strength within it. But it was her breasts that really set her apart from other women. Emily had what looked like a pair of basketballs stuffed into her shirt, but the low cut neck showed that they were, in fact, her breasts. Whenever Laura saw Emily she was always wearing low cut tops and short skirts that flaunted her incredible assets and pulled men\u2019s eyes in several directions at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the first time Laura saw Emily there was something about her she didn\u2019t like. It wasn\u2019t just that she was constantly hanging on Greg\u2019s arm or that she treated everyone she met as a subordinate as if she were their queen; but there was something else, something almost sinister that made Laura leery of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was certain that it was Emily that had convinced Greg to begin taking steroids. No question it was an easy argument to make, Greg had been considering juicing for years, but Emily must have given him a few suggestions that pushed him over the edge. And whatever mix of drugs and hormones he was taking were exploding his body incredibly fast. In the span of four weeks he had put on over 50 pounds of muscle bringing his full weight to 280 pounds. He was enormous and felt amazing. He even stopped working out in the basement and returned to the gym so that everyone could see just how big he\u2019d grown. He was among the biggest guys to ever step foot there and could out lift anyone. To make matters worse he made sure everyone knew just how powerful he\u2019d become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother month went by and Greg continued to swell bigger and bigger. Now he was 320 pounds of solid, towering muscle and had broken every lifting record there was at the gym. The only thing that surprised people more than his size was his strength; somehow he was even more powerful than his enormous size would suggest. He had now outgrown everyone, including Laura\u2019s mentor Adam, and would spend every available minute working his body to a sweating, hulking mass. And he showed no sign of stopping or even slowing down. And always Emily was there. When at the gym she wore spandex shorts and bra set that looked as though it were a size or two too small. Her body was the only thing in the world that could have drawn eyes away from Greg\u2019s bulging form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura watched as Greg morphed into the monster he now was. She avoided him as best she could, working on opposite sides of the gym if possible, but at home it was harder. Greg seemed to go out of his way to make sure he could display his superior size and when Emily was around he was twice as bad. One day he blocked Laura\u2019s passage through the hallway. All he needed to do was stand there, his bulk being more than enough to prevent her from going around. Before she could ask him to move he held one arm up and flexed. His bicep bulged to outrageous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou keep lifting your little weights. You\u2019ve done pretty good for yourself. But if you want to see real strength, real power, some real muscle, then you just come see me. This baby is 27 and a half inches around and still growing. You could never even touch that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked Greg right in the eye. \u201cYou just had a head start, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m catching up fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed his arrogant laugh then pushed past Laura. Emily was right behind him and grinning from ear to ear. Minutes later Laura could hear the smacking and thumping sounds that signaled that the two were having sex for about the fourth time that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now December and a full six months since she\u2019d begun her muscle growth plan. Had she let the Alterations app work alone she would have only just now been a sleek 170 pounds. Instead, because her workouts supplementing her growth, she was a mass of female muscle  that tipped the scale at 235 pounds. She was now bigger than Greg had been before beginning his steroid cocktail and also larger than any other female in the world. And, although Greg didn\u2019t know it, she was closing in on his current strength level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her run in with Greg in the hall, Laura had gone into her room and stood before the full body mirror she\u2019d had installed. She ran through a series of poses watching with awe as her huge muscles fought each other for room on her otherwise petite frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned as she thought about the months to come. The Alterations app was set for its slowest growth in the first six months. Her body was about to go into hyper-drive. She was quite sure that she would be stronger than her brother in no more than two weeks. And there was a very good chance that no matter how fast he was able to pack on the pounds she would blast beyond his size in less than 2 months.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura finally did some investigation on Greg\u2019s girlfriend with help from Jason.  As it turned out, Emily was from a rich family that owned a drug company that had allegations of creating designer drugs used by professional athletes, but there had never been any proof.  Pictures of Emily from high school showed a thinner and less beautiful version of her current self.  The boobs and face were obviously presents from her Daddy.  And both Laura and Jason were convinced that Emily was using Greg as a test subject, but of course had no proof.  And not that Greg would listen to anyone at this point anyway.  He had moved in with Emily and quit school after the first of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to keep her distance and not let everyone see her progress, Laura had talked Adam into giving her a key to the gym so she could work out after hours and avoid Greg.  He wasn\u2019t thrilled about her working those heavy weights alone, but Laura convinced him she\u2019d be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued to get updates on Greg as another six weeks passed.  The increases in his lifting poundage had slowed once he bested some world record level lifts.  His biceps too exceeded world record levels at nearly 29 inches around.  Greg\u2019s now volatile nature kept everyone but Emily clear of him even as he bragged up his achievements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded to Adam when she filled him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Greg\u2019s benching over 1100 pounds now, huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam shook his head.  \u201cYeah.  Sponsors have been showing up, but Emily is handling everything. She bothers me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s nothing I can do about that right now.  But perhaps it is time to come back to the gym and, well, lift with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked her over.  He was wearing very large baggy sweats, hiding her physique.  But Adam could tell that her shoulders were barn door wide.  \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and nodded.  \u201cUh-huh.  Let him know I\u2019ll be there around noon.  I\u2019ll call you later with details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam shrugged his shoulders.  \u201cWell OK.\u201d  He paused for a moment.  \u201cAm I going to need to call the National Guard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \u201cI hope not.  But I\u2019d keep their number handy just in case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam sighed.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to keep this a surprise aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled.  \u201cUntil noon tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Greg knew Laura was going to be at the gym, Emily made sure to shoot him up so by the time noon rolled around he had already broken his own bench press record.  A small crowd had gathered to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked into the gym in her baggy sweats and headed toward Greg.  They hadn\u2019t seen each other in over a month.  Laura raised her eyebrows, surprised a bit at how large Greg looked up close.  Greg wasted no time in shouting her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo LITTLE sister.  Just because you\u2019ve been avoiding me doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not improving.  If your idea of showing off is to challenge me to a lifting contest, then we can settle this immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura held her calm demeanor and looked over at the bench press area and the number of plates piled on to the bar.  \u201cYou\u2019re right Greg.  Let\u2019s settle this immediately.  Is that your best lift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed.  \u201cDamn straight little girl.  1180 pounds.  Over one hundred pounds better than the previous record.  What do you want to do, try and leg press it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled at him and walked toward the bench.  \u201cNo.  I figured to add a couple hundred pounds.\u201d  She paused as she nodded at a nervous looking Adam, who had been helping spot Greg.  He pulled up a hundred pounds weight and began placing it on the bar.  Greg\u2019s face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you crazy?  You can\u2019t lift that!  Nobody can lift that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sat down on the bench and held her cool smile.  \u201cWhy, because I\u2019m a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg growled, \u201cExactly!  Now quit kidding around before you hurt yourself.  Then you can watch a real man go after the real records!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sniffed.  \u201cHumor me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay down and reached up.  Four men lifted the weight off the stand and brought it to Laura\u2019s hands.  She let out a breath and readied herself for the upcoming rush.  Her nipples pushed out in anticipation and her entire body tingled.  To be able to crush her brother\u2019s world record bench press cold was doubly exciting.  She truly was growing stronger every day.  And now it was time to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, the men released their grip, but held their hands close.  The familiar pounding and warmth sizzled through Laura\u2019s muscles and she gasped.  Once she had control of the weight Laura shook the men off so Greg wouldn\u2019t think she was helped.  Just this feat of strength was staggering.  But as the entire gym now watched in stunned silence, Laura brought the bar down to her massive chest that was flexing forth enough muscle to pull her XXXXX shirt taught.  Touching the bar to her pectorals, Laura let out a feminine grunt and with a collective gasp from the on-lookers, steadily pushed the impossible weight up and with an excited yell completed her world record shattering lift!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smattering of cheers of claps followed a the four men quickly moved in and placed the bar back on the rack.  Laura jumped up and looked at her enraged, yet completely dumbfounded brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd THAT\u2019S how you perform a bench press.  Don\u2019t tell me what I can and cannot do!  I\u2019m stronger than you Greg.  A LOT stronger!  You think that was impressive.  I can bench almost a ton!  And by next week I will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily reached out to Greg, but he shrugged her off, too mad and embarrassed for comfort or words.  Laura smiled smugly and stood up tall to her nearly 5 foot 7 inch height and ripped her top down the middle and tossed both sides to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same stunned crowd let out another collective gasp.  Her muscles bristled forth like pink steel boulders across her upper body.  The XXXX large white athletic top was stretched across her chest like a second skin, leaving little of her massive, Herculean muscles to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as for those so called World Record setting muscles of yours, get a load of THESE guns!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam walked up with a tape measure as Laura held her stare on Greg and pulled her right arm into a bicep flex for the ages.  The fact that her hands and joints were the same, small, girlish size only made the muscles blasting forth across her arm look even larger.  With her hand in a fist, Laura pumped her forearm up and the bicep rose up like an angry volcano.  Wicked veins pumped up across her arm, pulsing violently as the bicep peak pushed up her wide, incredibly thick forearm.  One hard squeeze sent the bicep peak jumping as a deep chiseled split formed.  And as Adam rapped the tape around the gigantic cantaloupe bicep and down to the deep, jagged football triceps, he quickly pulled the tape taught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg leaned forward as Adam gulped.  Laura, still staring at Greg hissed.  \u201cHow big Adam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam cleared his throat.  \u201cThir-Thirty inches.  You\u2019re biceps are thirty inches around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled again at the confused and over the top enraged Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Greg.  Your little sister now has bigger biceps than her so called big brother.  Too bad those real man muscles can\u2019t compete with these real girl muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg yelled out, his anger boiling over.  He stared at Laura for a moment, his eyes ablaze.  Laura released her flex, but held both her ground and her stare.  Greg took a step forward, but then stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of steroids you\u2019re taking, but the only thing this proves is that you\u2019re some kind of freak!  Don\u2019t think this will stand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled, ignoring his steroid fueled rage.  \u201cI\u2019m not taking any.  And I think I\u2019ve proved just who the strongest and biggest one is in this family.  And don\u2019t you forget it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily leaned forward and whispered in Greg\u2019s ear.  He grunted loudly as a vein on his forehead throbbed.  Turning around, he stormed out of the gym with Emily barely keeping up behind him.  Once he left Laura let out a deep breath, happy that it didn\u2019t get violent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam walked up to her side.  \u201cThat was beyond incredible.  You truly are a pleasant natural oddity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and headed out the back door so she could run home.  \u201cYeah.  And a real strong one to boot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam laughed as Laura headed out the door.  Laura ran home quickly, still excited from finally being able to show up Greg.  She pulled off the baggy leg sweats and tossed them on the stairs.  The pink biker shorts were as strained as her top and her gigantic muscles bunched and popped across her legs.  Reaching for some water, Laura picked up the phone and pulled up her profile from the ap.  She hadn\u2019t bothered to check it recently, but began to think.  She was already nearing the size she had programmed for herself.  Now she had to wonder.  Was she going to stop once she reached the end size or was she going to grow even beyond that until a year passed?  Her strength and size had increased incredibly these past weeks and she had over four months to go until a year had passed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the next few weeks went by Laura continued on her blistering pace, growing stronger every day, breaking the one ton bench press mark and cruising to her current record of a ton and half.  At this point she had eclipsed every record for every lift by anyone with no signs of slowing down.  If anything, her strength was increasing ever faster.  Adam had rigged a machine just for her with input from Jason and his mad engineering skills and it was enough to keep up with her needs.  For now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose encounters with Jason were all too infrequent, but were no less intense.  The last marathon session resulted in a broken bed frame.  Jason\u2019s parent\u2019s were upset, but knowing just how big Jason and Laura were, weren\u2019t too surprised.  And Jason was bigger too.  Right on track as he still refused to work out.  Too busy with school work, he\u2019d complain, even though she knew he was gaming until all hours.  Laura covered for him, telling everyone that he was a good partner in her off hours work outs.  Fortunately, nobody bothered checking since Jason was obviously getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich led to their investigation into the ap that started this all.  So wrapped up in themselves and the results of those long ago \u201cApplies\u201d, they failed to notice that nobody they knew, hell nobody else anywhere, was doing what they were doing.  Turns out that was because the ap was supposed to be a fake.  The testimonials were made up.  The ap was a 3D modeling application that utilized the advanced camera, archived photos and a wicked GUI that displayed an incredible realistic model that plugged into an advanced morphing engine.  The software could use pictures already loaded to set the baseline, then interpolate to display the detailed model.  So just how the ap only worked for real only on Laura\u2019s phone (to the best of their knowledge) was a mystery.  One they didn\u2019t see as a priority to solve, but one they now had to wonder.  Would it even work again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg hadn\u2019t returned to the gym since he stormed out, humiliated.  Laura hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him at all and all Vanessa could get out of him was that he was staying at Emily\u2019s.  Laura decided that once she grew in strength to super human levels that she would head out to Emily\u2019s and drag Greg home if she had to, as she was worried that Emily would push him until he was either seriously injured or the steroids started tearing him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa still greatly admired her \u201clittle\u201d sister, even if it was now also with a bit of fear.  Laura was more stronger and muscular than anyone had ever been already and was growing steadily bigger.  But one thing that Laura was still happy about was her flexibility.  Even though her muscles were huge, she could stretch like a gymnast.  And she could run like an Olympian as she discovered.  Borrowing a GPS watch, Laura ran as hard as she could for two hours along the paved paths that connected the beaches.  Turns out she ran just over 25 miles.  Looking up the results, she was on pace to break the world marathon record.  For the men!  Running so fast with her obvious bulk turned more than a few heads, but she was moving so quickly that they didn\u2019t have time to really say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd through it all her muscles grew bigger.  She struggled to find anything to fit her and was special ordering just enough clothes to keep her going, knowing full well she\u2019d outgrow the new clothes in no time.  Everyone close to her suggested she find a sponsor to earn some extra money.  Energy drinks, protein supplements, and athletic clothing reps had dropped by the gym; but for now Laura spurned them.  The less press the best for now.  If she went national and her huge gains were seen, much more suspicion that was already heading her way would have to be deflected.  No, maybe with a month to go or so, then she\u2019d see.  Of course, just exactly how big and strong she\u2019d be was still a bit of a mystery.  But to Laura, she still loved every moment.  As far as she was concerned the bigger and stronger the better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was a mid-day visit to the gym when Laura knew it was really slow that she met with Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Laura, how have you been?  Is the machine holding out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was now up above 5 foot 7, but also well over 350 pounds.  She looked like a tank.  Of course her face was still that of the same pretty 18 year old girl that walked into the gym 8 months ago.  The new pink biker shorts hugged her massive quads like a second skin and the pink athletic top was doing no better.  Even with the added padding in front, she had a hard time covering up.  Good thing the next round of clothing was due soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was still behind a machine and Laura was behind a wall at the front desk, so he couldn\u2019t see much more than her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how much are you benching now, girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled as he walked closer and she moved from behind the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver 3000 pounds.  3050 just last night to be exact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam stopped once he stood six feet away and blinked.  \u201cDid you say 3050 pounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled.  \u201cYou bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam visibly shook his whole body at the thought.  Letting out his standard sigh and shaking his head he walked around to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wanted me to set you up with a martial arts expert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded.  \u201cYeah.  I need some help controlling my strength to protect others around me.  And hopefully learn some defensive moves to keep the potential big drunk guys who might challenge me at bay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam snickered.  \u201cI\u2019d like to see how many boards you could break without any training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura rolled her eyes.  \u201cSo did you find someone to train me one on one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked up the computer.  \u201cYes.  His name is Brian Gamble and he should be here any time now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled.  \u201cCool.  I was hoping to set something up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened and it was\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door to the gym opened and Laura turned to see her sister Vanessa standing before her. It was clear that Vanessa had been crying, her mascara was wet and a her cheeks red. She seemed a bit distracted upon entering but once she spotted her enormous younger sister her eyes went wide with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura! My god! Just when I think you can\u2019t get any bigger...\u201d It had only been a week and a half since the two had seen each other but the difference in Laura\u2019s size was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and fought the urge to begin flexing various muscle groups as she normally would when complemented on her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Laura said then decided to cut right to the chase. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked over at Adam. \u201cHello,\u201d she said blushing slightly. \u201cI\u2019m Vanessa. Laura\u2019s big... well <i>older</i> sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam stepped forward and extended his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Vanessa. I\u2019m Adam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook his hand and ran her eyes over his bulging physique. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she said, \u201cuntil recently you would have been the biggest person I\u2019ve ever met. Now both of my siblings are true giants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam nodded, not really knowing what to say. Instead he turned to Laura. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two alone so you can talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was gone Laura motioned for Vanessa to follow her. Laura made her way to the back of the gym while Vanessa watched her monstrous legs pumping with each step. Laura\u2019s calves were each bigger than volleyballs and were bunching and flexing while the young girl walked. The two arrived at the back of the gym and went through a door that led to Laura\u2019s private area. Nearly half of the room was filled with machinery, cables and huge weights that all connected to the various locations where Laura was constantly pushing her ever growing body further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Vanessa said taking in the enormity of the muscle building machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike it? Jason and Adam built it for me. It\u2019s the only way I can get any kind of a workout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa walked along one wall of the room that was covered from floor to ceiling with a posing mirror. The floor was lined with pairs of barbells of ridiculous size ranging from 500 pounds up to 4 tons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you lift all of these?\u201d Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled. \u201cNo, right now I can curl those but even that\u2019s a bit tough.\u201d She pointed to the 1000 pound weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can lift this huge thing with one arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they are huge arms.\u201d This time Laura couldn\u2019t resist the urge and flexed her mammoth right bicep, the peak of which was even with the knuckles of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d Vanessa said as her hand slowly rose toward the sinewy peak independent of her will. Laura remained still as Vanessa ran her slender fingers over the ridges and valleys of the younger girl\u2019s thick arm. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Vanessa mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you again. So, why are you here? And why were you crying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was snapped out of her reverie and pulled her hand back immediately. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said looking to the ground as tears began to well up in her eyes once more. \u201cIt\u2019s Greg. I called him to see if he was going to come to mom\u2019s birthday dinner. He.. he didn\u2019t sound like himself at all. He was, well, incoherent and rambling. Kept talking about how big he was getting and how the new stuff was working wonders. When I asked him what new stuff he said it was Emily\u2019s and tip top secret. Brand new military grade super soldier stuff. That\u2019s all I was able to make out. Except for the last part. He...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa collapsed onto Laura\u2019s shoulder sobbing. The older sister was taller than the younger by about 2 inches, but that was the only dimension that was greater. Laura overshadowed Vanessa in every other conceivable way. The musclebound teen wrapped her beefy arms gently around her older sister\u2019s gently and consoled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said that Emily had given him the power to crush Laura once and for all. And he said that if he ever saw Vanessa he\u2019d probably do the same. I don\u2019t think he even knew he was talking to me. I\u2019m so scared, Lulu. You\u2019re so big and strong you can keep yourself safe, but there\u2019s nothing I can do. I wish I had muscles like yours. I think he\u2019s lost his mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was fuming. Veins were bulging out all over her body, but she made sure not to tense any muscles that would crush Vanessa. She was going to be better than her brother. She knew what she had to do. It was time to find Greg and bring him home. Then she could work on weaning him off of whatever chemical cocktail that bitch Emily had hooked him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about Vanessa? Should Laura try using the app again to grant Vanessa\u2019s wish for the strength to protect herself? Or should she just head right to the source of the problem? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura decided to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa released her hug, pulled in a quick sob and took a step back.  Laura\u2019s chin was pushed out as she ground her teeth with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then it\u2019s about time I head over to Emily\u2019s and take care of this problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s eyes widened.  \u201cAre.  Are you sure?  We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s capable of or what\u2019s going on in his head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \u201cI don\u2019t care.  Greg may be a jerk, but he\u2019s still our brother.  That Emily bitch is turning him into a monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s eyes look both sad and fearful, but she said nothing.  Laura was certainly strong enough to do what she wanted.  Laura turned and headed out from her personal gym and back into the main area.  Adam was there with another man and stepped toward Laura, careful not to get in her way lest she knock him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, this is Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s eyes came out of her focus for a moment and she stopped and sighed loudly, putting on a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Brian, right.  Can you train me?  Privately.  I was looking to be able to control my strength around others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind she was now thinking about learning various ways to punish Emily.  Brian, taken a bit aback by her huge size and determined look, nodded his head, having already talked to Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell OK.  Normally I don\u2019t provide private training, but if you were in a class, you\u2019d likely scare anyone you had to spar with.  How about we start tomorrow at 6:00?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kept her weak but distracted smile and nodded.  \u201cThanks Brian, I\u2019ll be at your studio.  Now if you\u2019ll forgive me I have to get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian shook his head, still having a hard time taking in Laura\u2019s form.  \u201cSure, sure.  See you tomorrow then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa had kept behind and smiled at Brian and Adam as Laura resumed her walk toward the door.  Vanessa caught up as they headed out onto the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLulu.  How are you going to get there?  I think Emily\u2019s house is at least 5 miles away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, back in her zone of anger, stopped and looked over at Vanessa.  She could run there of course and considering how fast she was, she could do it damn quick, but she needed to bring Greg home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you drive?  I can pull up her address on my phone and get directions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shifted uncomfortably.  \u201cWell OK.  But I\u2019m still scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura attempted to suppress her anger and knew she needed Vanessa\u2019s cooperation.  Looking into Vanessa\u2019s worried eyes; Laura held her hand and smiled.  \u201cNo problem.  You just need to stay out in the car while I go in and get Greg.  If anything goes wrong, just call Jason, or maybe 911.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa didn\u2019t look comforted, but dropped her chin lower taking her eyes off of Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK.  I can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura released Vanessa\u2019s hand and walked around to climb into their parent\u2019s SUV.  Laura opened the back door and put those seats down and climbed into the passenger seat.  Vanessa didn\u2019t comment about the seats and started driving.  Both knew that if Greg were coming back he would be lying in the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the directions set they approached Emily\u2019s house, which could better be described as a compound.  They pulled up to the gates and Vanessa put the car in park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to able to get in unless Emily wants us to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at the gate and could see the front of the house nearly a quarter of a mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.  I\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Vanessa could say anything Laura got out of the car and headed toward the 8 foot tall wall.  Taking a quick run, Laura pushed off with her massive right leg and like something out of a superhero TV show propelled her massive body to the top of the wall.  Placing her left on the top of the foot thick concrete, Laura deftly swung her body over the wall and landed in the grass on the other side.  She then darted toward the front door at a pace that would shame Usain Bolt and was at the front door in 30 seconds.  Vanessa\u2019s eyes had nearly bugged out watching what her little sister was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura knocked on the door with brutal purpose, nearly cracking the large oak frame.  Her ears were buzzing as a rush of adrenaline was pushing through her muscles, unknowingly making her ever stronger.  Her muscles all bulged hugely as her veins rose to the surface across her body.  Her top groaned under the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the door was opened by a butler, who looked surprised and curious as nobody should be at the front door unless they called at the gate.  The 6 foot tall butler looked rather large and was dressed in a suit.  His curious look changed to surprise at the sight of Laura\u2019s massive frame.  Before the butler could ask a question, Emily yelled from across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulian!  What\u2019s all that racket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked around Julian quickly and moving with incredible speed, moved to the side and pushed Julian out of the way, sending him sprawling across the waxed floor.  Laura stormed toward Emily with anger in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is my brother you conniving bitch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s normal control was momentarily shaken at the sight of the huge muscle girl.  She had been keeping tabs on Laura; curious as to just how she could get so big and strong without any apparent help.  But the pictures didn\u2019t do her justice.  Laura was beyond massive.  As Laura approached, Emily didn\u2019t move as she reached for her phone and quickly hit a few buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura.  I\u2019ll have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura got close to Emily, but Emily didn\u2019t back off from the much larger, though much shorter woman.  Laura clenched her fists and waves of muscles audibly ground forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care what you expected.  I\u2019m here for my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down and smiled, seemingly convinced that Laura wouldn\u2019t do anything to her.  Julian had recovered and was already on his phone.  Emily glanced over to her left and out of the shadows Greg lumbered forward.  Emily chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can speak to him yourself.  Although I doubt he has any desire to go with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura reached out and pushed a surprised Emily out of her way.  Emily took a few awkward steps and fell to the floor.  She let out an angry puff as she pushed the hair out of her face and got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura moved quickly toward Greg, who looked like he was on more than just steroids.  He looked disoriented and his movements were clumsy.  But he was also huge.  Large, freakish muscles protruded from his massive frame.  He was only wearing boxers and socks so his nearly grotesque upper body could be fully seen.  His mass looked to equal hers, but the huge muscles didn\u2019t flow naturally and looked bulky.  And he could barely move.  Laura got close and her anger momentarily fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg?  Are you OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg seemed to snap out his stupor and shaking his head slowly groaned.  \u201cEmily?  I mean, um, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s anger rose again quickly as her own massive muscle bulged to new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg, it\u2019s me, Laura.  Your sister!  I\u2019m here to take you home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s clouded eyes turned red and he clenched his large hands into fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura!  You\u2019re not taking me anywhere!  I\u2019m much stronger than you now!  I can bench press well over a ton!  The only thing you\u2019re going to do is get a taste of just how strong I am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grit her teeth, not wanting to ask what he could bench.  But since she was benching a ton and half, she felt that she was stronger.  As the buzzing built back up, her body was reacting once again, growing stronger than she had ever been.  And even though she was looking to improve her fighting skills, she had practiced enough on her own with some help from Adam to hold her own.  So when Greg lunged forward with his hands outstretched to either push her down or choke her, Laura pulled one massive leg back for balance and pulled her own heavily muscled arms up to block.  Everything would be decided in moments.  Vanessa now watched with extreme interest even as security guards were already on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg reached for her shoulders but Laura grabbed his wrists and pushed back.  Both combatants held firm for a moment as their arms shook from the effort.  Greg had the advance of leverage as he was pushing down.  His arms moved forward momentarily, but were soon held firm as Laura grunted with effort.  She had to focus hard as the buzzing, normally a welcome addition to her work-outs, was becoming a distraction even as her strength increased.  After a few moments, Laura began to steadily push Greg\u2019s arms up and away from her even as he yelled with effort.  And as he pushed as hard as he could, his oversized and overstressed right bicep tore from the bone, allowing Laura to push Greg hard away from her.  He stumbled back and fell onto the floor.  Even though the steroids blocked some of his pain, he still reached out to his torn bicep and wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grimaced again and turned toward Emily, who was looking at Greg with interest, but little sympathy.  Laura spat out in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook what your steroids have done to him!  His body is a mess.  I\u2019m taking him out of here now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked back at Laura, processing the events and what she wanted to do next.  The security guards were here and although they were big and muscular, were no match for Laura.  However, they also packed guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at Greg and then over to Laura and smiled.  She then told Laura\u2026</span></div></div>",

For now anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then tilted her head toward the four security guards, who pulled their guns out.  \u201cBut I\u2019d do it now before I change my mind.\u201d  Still smiling with evil confidence, Emily looked over at Julian.  \u201cAnd Julian, please get the door and escort these two out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at Emily with daggers, and then back down at Greg who was now barely conscience, rolling back on forth on the ground.  Sighing, she walked over toward Greg and reaching down, hoisted his huge body into the air and held him in front of her like a huge baby.  Laura had to look to the side to see where she was going, and then started walking toward the door.  She stopped to look at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think this is over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily chuckled.  \u201cNo, I suppose not.  But if you try and go to the press about any of this or spread any lies, I\u2019ll come after you with a room full of lawyers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sniffed angrily, but knew she was at a terrible disadvantage right now.  Confronting Emily would have to wait for another day.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Laura marched to the door with the semi-conscious Greg.  Julian opened the door and quickly closed it behind her.  The gate opened and soon enough Laura was placing Greg into the back and climbing into the passenger seat.  Vanessa\u2019s looked with near horror at Greg and then placing the car into drive, over toward Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is terrible!  Greg looks like a mutant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed, the adrenalin rush now over.  \u201cI know.  We need to get him to a hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa held back a sob and nodded her head, driving as quickly as she dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA special bed had to be found for Greg and he was placed into the intensive care ward.  The doctors ran tests and kept Greg sedated, finding that not only was his bicep completely torn, but multiple other injuries were masked by the steroids and his kidneys were near failure.  Whatever mix of drugs he had taken had given him near super human strength, but were destroying his body.  Laura could barely listen to the prognosis and chose to leave before their parents arrived, leaving the explanation, and Emily\u2019s warning, to Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later Emily visited the lab and was talking to the project lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now that we\u2019ve tested out the advanced formula and seen the results, have you been able to synthesize something that won\u2019t take out the subject?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe project lead gulped nervously.  Emily had essentially taken over her father\u2019s company at this point and had given up most pretence of covering up the illegal generation of advanced steroids.  The normal stuff would still be sold, but there was a lot of money to be made with the advanced formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes.  We\u2019ve been able to stabilize the mix and eliminated some of the worst side effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down at the intimidated manager.  She clearly enjoyed the height advantage and she knew her looks and body kept most men off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the speed?  I wanted it to be much faster.  How quickly can the subject build up muscles and strength?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager gulped.  \u201cWell we\u2019re not sure yet.  We were just now reviewing potential test subjects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily reached out and snatched the clip board from the surprised manager and looked over the names.  She had handpicked most of them, but none were as blindly loyal as Greg.  She considered going to get Greg once he recovered.  Looking over the list and thinking longer than she needed to just to watch the manager squirm, she smiled and sighed, pulling her magnificent chest up to the point of spilling her breasts out of her low cut dress.  This only made the manager sweat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe I know what we need to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as another week passed, Laura had become a woman possessed.  Her work-outs were nearly all consuming and her gains were now truly super human.  So mad at what Emily had done and sure that she needed to be stopped, Laura was convinced that she needed to become a super woman to take her out.  Her increase in strength was staggering, even for the conditioned Adam and Jason.  The 3050 bench press had moved on to 4000 pounds in days and onto to 5000 pounds just as fast.  More weight had to be ordered and Jason and Adam were able to modify the equipment to accommodate what they thought would be more than enough weight.  It wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bench presses were increasing at nearly 1000 pounds a day after the first week and by the end of the third week, were a ton a day.  She had moved from cranking out 7 tons for reps after her last blistering work out was benching 8 tons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 1000 pound one arm curls increased just as fast.  Vanessa visited often and was always surprised when she saw her younger sister hoist larger and larger weights with intensity.  She was up to 2000 pounds in less than a week and was tossing the 4000 pound bars around in no time, pounding her biceps to seemingly impossible levels.  Adam and Jason were now struggling to create larger weights as Laura now needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her muscle size wasn\u2019t keeping up with her strength gains those massive muscles still grew larger, easily surpassing the ones Greg had sported and well bigger than anyone else had ever even thought was possible.  And with the disproportional gains in strength, her muscles grew denser and denser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Laura\u2019s days and nights were now full.  School was nearly over for the year and while she was doing most of her classes remotely to avoid the stares in classes, she was barely keeping up since training was now taking priority.  Laura was glad that finals were this week.  The fighting sessions with Brian were incredible.  Watching him go through motions once or twice was enough for her to pick them up.  She progressed at a pace that Brian had never seen.  She was learning as fast as he could teach her.  And her speed was incredible.  She was quite certain that she was the fastest person on earth, and her reflexes must have reached that point too.  Once school was over Laura was going to rent as many fight videos as she could, convinced she could teach herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was on a warm day that Laura finished up her set with alternating 6000 pound curls with the newly created bars and Vanessa walked in.  The loud gasp was enough to cause Laura to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness Lulu, are those the 3 ton weights Adam and Jason just made for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura placed them down carefully, not wanting to crack the floor.  \u201cYeah, and by tomorrow they won\u2019t be enough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was covered with a light sheen of sweat and was wearing an athletic top that just a week ago fit fine, but now was straining mightily.  She shook her arms a bit and noticing Vanessa\u2019s wide eyed look, obliged her stare and slowly brought her right arm up into a flex than brought Vanessa\u2019s hands to a familiar reach.  The mighty bicep rose to new heights of massiveness, looking as if someone had placed a watermelon under her skin as the peak rose up nearly to the top of her head.  Vanessa ran her slender fingers across the bicep and pushing with all of her might was unable to even dent the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re still growing.  And your muscles, they feel like steel.  Are you, uh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled her eyes off her own gigantic bicep and looked at Vanessa.  \u201cBulletproof?  I think so, but we haven\u2019t tested it yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed with a pang of jealousy and pulled her hands away.  Laura saw this and now knew she was ready to talk about the ap and give Vanessa a muscle boost if she wanted one; assuming the ap still worked.  Releasing her flex, Laura grabbed a towel and brought up the subject that started most conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s Greg?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked down.  \u201cDoing better I suppose, but he still wants to blame you for what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura moaned.  \u201cWell hopefully now that he\u2019s almost ready to head home and recover away from Emily we can work on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s phone buzzed and she turned to pick it up, looking at the name on the screen.  Keeping her emotions in check with Vanessa looking at her, Laura hit talk.  It was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura held the phone to her ear. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura! How are you, girl? Still bulging, I assume? I\u2019m so glad I caught you!\u201d It was Emily and she sounded positively giddy. Laura had to contain her anger to keep from crushing her phone in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell are you calling me? And why are you talking as if we were friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Why wouldn\u2019t we be friends?\u201d Emily asked without a hint of sarcasm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s face was turning red and she could feel her control slipping. She steadied her voice and spoke as calmly as she could. \u201cAfter what you did to Greg I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop right there. Greg knew what he was getting into when he signed up. He knew the risks and was willing to chance it for the rewards. Which is why I\u2019m calling you. We\u2019ve finally been able to clear up all the red tape with our financiers and I\u2019m able to give Greg what I owe him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was confused. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018signed up?\u2019 What did he sign up for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe never told you? He was a part of our research project. He took a paid role in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily continued, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought you knew. Look, Greg kind of felt like he didn\u2019t have a whole lot to offer in the way of... well, money making skill. The only thing he was good at was building his body and he planned to go after contest money. Then he found himself unable to get any bigger and you were just exploding to the top of the pack so he went another route with my group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you twisted him into a monster.\u201d Laura tried to hold onto this fact, but this information about her brother went against everything she thought she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make him do anything. He knew exactly what he was getting into. The biggest risks for the biggest pay. I would have rehabilitated him in our own facilities as well if you hadn\u2019t insisted on taking him away from me. But no matter. I want to give you what he earned. Meet me at my lab in an hour. I\u2019ll text you the directions. See you then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call ended before Laura could ask any further questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Vanessa asked as Laura put her phone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was Emily.\u201d Laura said, still in a state of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked panicked, \u201cEmily?!? Why? What did she want? What did she say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said Greg earned money in her drug trials and that she has it ready for me to pick up.\u201d Laura pulled on an extremely oversized tank top and some black shorts. Both clung to her insane bulges like paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going are you? Are you crazy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura motioned to the 3 ton dumbbell on the floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s she going to do to me? I could take on a room full of Emily\u2019s. You should head home where it\u2019s safe.\u201d Her phone buzzed as the directions to the lab arrived. It looked to be in a warehouse near the harbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked upset by this. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just go home and hide under the bed. Where\u2019s Adam? I\u2019m sure he could protect me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled. Vanessa\u2019s attraction to Adam had been evident right from the start. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since yesterday afternoon. It\u2019s not really like him to not at least come by the gym, but he probably has other plans or something.\u201d Laura wrapped her enormous arm around her sister and pulled her in for a hug. \u201cLook, just sit tight. When I get back I\u2019ll give you some... muscle building tips and let you in on a secret of mine. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll be able to bulk up even faster than I did. Then you wont need a little runt like Adam to protect you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Thank you, Lulu. Be safe.\u201d Vanessa tried to return the hug, but even with her arms stretched out fully it was like she was hugging the side of a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura left the gym and began running in the direction of the harbor as fast as her super human legs could carry her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura arrived at the lab. Upon entering she found that the warehouse was once used for storing shipping containers and there were several along one wall that had been left behind when the building had been converted to a science workshop. The expansive space was covered with equipment of various types that meant nothing to the giant teen, but it did look very impressive. There were a handful of people moving this way and that with purpose, and a few stopped to stare at her as they passed, but would quickly move on. The stare was something Laura really enjoyed, she loved the way her muscles made people stop dead in their tracks and stare with their jaws hanging loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to ask someone where she could find Emily when she heard a voice call out from her right. \u201cLaura! So glad you came!\u201d Emily was the only person Laura saw who wasn\u2019t wearing a lab coat. On the contrary she looked like she was headed to a club. She wore knee high leather boots with a 6 inch heel bringing her already crazy height to a towering 6\u2019 8\u201d. Along with the boots Emily wore matching leather pants that hugged her hips, thighs and butt like a second skin. Her top was also black, but a tube top that went only so high as to cover her nipples leaving the top half of her enormous breasts exposed. The tight top squeezed her soft breasts together to create a huge line of cleavage between the massive mammeries. Her hair was tied back and she wore a pair of dark rimmed glasses, the only part of her look that spoke of professionalism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily ushered Laura into her office and offered her a chair. The large girl declined both because she had no desire to sit and because she doubted she could fit into the chair or avoid breaking it under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re here on a very exciting day. We\u2019ve had so many breakthroughs just in the last 24 hours it\u2019s staggering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily waved a dismissive hand, \u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a spoil sport, this is exciting stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust give me what I came for and I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily paused for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d She opened a black portfolio and tore out a check from the pages within. She handed it to Laura who\u2019s heart nearly stopped when she saw the many zeros. The check was made out to Greg in the amount of 2.8 million dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a daze Laura stood and began to turn toward the door. She folded the check to put in her pocket, but somehow felt strange doing so as if it were too much money to just fold in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a sec.\u201d Emily said. \u201cSince I\u2019m feeling extra generous you can have this too.\u201d She pulled a manila folder out of a drawer and tossed it on the desk. \u201cI wont be needing it anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Laura asked picking the file up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura opened the folder and found document upon document relating to her. Her complete medical history, school records, photographs (some as recent as two days earlier), but most surprising of all was a staggeringly accurate growth/strength chart documenting how much Laura was lifting and for how many reps. Since Laura had been making those lifts in the privacy of her own section of the gym there should have been no way for Emily to have that information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get this?\u201d Laura demanded showing Emily the chart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly grin slid across Emily\u2019s lips. \u201cA reliable source.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Laura\u2019s chest and shoulders expanded to make sure Emily knew who was the stronger of the two. \u201cI want to know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax. He\u2019s here now. Let\u2019s go say hello.\u201d Emily stood and led Laura back out to the main floor of the lab. They walked past several rows of machines and equipment to the back of the building. There Laura found an area filled with oversized gym equipment very similar to what Laura had been using except these machines looked cleaner and more advanced. There were several very, large men working out. Each was bigger than any Mr. Olympia. Each of them were making world record lifts and pumping their massive muscles to incredible size. Laura had them all beat both in size and strength, but they were still an impressive sight. Most of the guys looked to be about the size that Greg was a few months back when Laura had first out lifted him, but there was one guy who was much, much bigger. She was looking at him from behind, but she could tell he was a sheer monster. A few scientists stood around him as he did squats with an outrageously large weight on his six foot wide shoulders. Each time the big man stood his thick quads bulged larger than any of the observer\u2019s chests. A digital readout over the brute\u2019s head told everyone that he was lifting 5 tons. Laura was now able to squat nearly double that, but she\u2019d never seen anyone ever come nearly as close to her as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily asked Laura to wait while she approached the beefed up giant. Even at 6\u2019 8\u201d the buxom beauty was dwarfed by the huge man who was well over 7 feet tall. Emily said something to him then the man turned around and Laura\u2019s world collapsed. The body was mega enhanced but the face was clearly Adam\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he turned he was smiling, reveling in his great power, but when he saw Laura his face went into a look of shock and he dropped the 5 ton weight. Scientists scattered as the weight crashed to the floor leaving a crater in the concrete. Only Emily remained stationary, the smug grin still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam hung his head and approached Laura. She\u2019d never seen anyone look so powerful and weak at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, I-\u201c he began but stopped when Laura held up her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gave her information on me? <i>Her</i>!\u201d She pointed over Adam\u2019s shoulder at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how it looks, but I only told her about your lifts and it\u2019s not like that\u2019s vital intel. And if I didn\u2019t someone else would have, and they might have been more..... nasty about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you worked with her! <i><b>Her</b></i>? After what she did to Greg?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. But it all comes so easy for you. You don\u2019t understand how hard I had to work to get on top. Her formula was going to make it so I was left behind. I just wanted a taste of what you have: the size, the power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to respond, but she was too hurt to speak. She felt so betrayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily came over and squeezed in between them and began gushing as if there weren\u2019t two pissed off giants surrounding her. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you we\u2019d made some incredible breakthroughs? Adam just came in yesterday afternoon for his.... uh, reward. By last night he had gained over a foot in height and several hundred pounds of supercharged muscle. And thanks to what we learned from your brother we\u2019ve found no undesirable effects yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned away, she\u2019d had more than enough. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Emily shouted. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the best part yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped and took in a deep breath before turning back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled, she was clearly very excited. \u201cOkay, well, as you can see we have had plenty of male volunteers and successes. However, we didn\u2019t know how our formula was going to work on women. It\u2019s all very hormone based and the very foundations of the sexes are fundamentally different. So, we finally got ourselves a female volunteer and injected her with a dose. And nothing happened! Insane, right? So we gave her another. Still nothing. More and more was pumped into her body until she\u2019d received 700 times as much as Humongo here.\u201d She slapped Adam on the arm. \u201cStill not a bit of change. But, and here\u2019s the really cool part, this morning we give her a checkup. Still no change, but the drug is still floating around in her system.\u201d Emily paused as if this revelation should speak for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laura only shrugged Emily continued, \u201cIt should have flushed out of her system after an hour, two at most. But 16 hours later she was still flooded with it. We did some checking and found that her body is now <b>manufacturing</b> our formula!! She\u2019s creating an endless supply that\u2019s fully at her disposal. All she needs to do is learn how to use it. We have effectively altered her entire body chemistry and created something completely new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. Finally Laura spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what this has to do with anything. Who is this test subject?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked,\u201d Emily said. \u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIt\u2019s me, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Emily dropped her arms to her sides and closed her eyes. She then took in a deep breath and clenched her fists. Next her entire body tightened and, before Laura knew what was happening Emily\u2019s body was erupting with muscle. Her bare shoulders, arms and chest exploded out in all directions instantly eclipsing the giants on the gym equipment behind her. Emily\u2019s leather pants groaned for a split second, then split open along her hips and thighs. Her calves ripped through both her pants and boots creating matching tears along her backside that quickly ran the entire length of her long and expanding legs. After another few seconds passed Emily\u2019s pants were far too shredded to hang on and fell to the floor leaving her massive quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes and calves fully exposed and fighting for room as they continued to grow and grow into and away from each other. Emily\u2019s breasts were plowing forward on a thick shelf of pectoral muscle, her top had succumb to her expanding chest and ripped in half, but her lower torso, though clearly bristling with hard, ripped muscle, was still shrink-wrapped in her lycra tube top. Emily was now approaching and passing Adam\u2019s size and sinew continued to build upon sinew in great slabs of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Emily was not just growing out but up as her body began to stretch taller and taller. Her boots had already been ruined leaving her standing barefoot on the floor, but already her head had passed her previous aided height of 6\u2019 8\u201d as was approaching 7 feet. Emily began to slowly curl her arms upward causing her still growing biceps to bulge in an attempt to rip through her skin. Laura could hear a low rumble and then realized that Emily was growling. Finally the portion of her tube top that was wrapped around her stomach had received all the strain it could handle and fell away followed by her black panties. Now the pumped up powerhouse was completely nude and spectacular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl continued to expand as fast as ever. She\u2019d now blown up bigger than Laura and showed no signs of stopping or even slowing for that matter. Emily\u2019s head looked positively ludicrous dwarfed by shoulders the size of medicine balls and nearly 8 feet wide. Emily\u2019s growl was growing in intensity and volume as she began to raise her arms up to shoulder height. She then curled her arms into a mind blowing double bicep curl with arms that were bigger around than Laura\u2019s chest. Emily\u2019s growl turned into a roar and she squeezed the last few inches (which translated into several hundred pounds) of muscle and height into her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gulped and looked up at the newly birthed goddess. Emily now stood 9 feet tall and bigger than anyone had ever dreamed. She was more pumped up than the Incredible Hulk. Her thighs were 5 feet across each and were pulsing with untold strength as veins thick as ropes crisscrossed just below her skin\u2019s surface. Her abs were packed together tightly and each individual muscle was roughly the size of a basketball, her sides were lined with obliques thick as gold bricks. Emily\u2019s chest was a solid wall of pure female muscle 6 feet thick. The width of her shoulders was equal to her height, and her flexed biceps rose to peaks nearly a full foot above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily released her monstrous flex and, laughing, turned toward the back of the warehouse. With booming steps that practically knocked Laura on her butt Emily sauntered to where a collection of massive shipping containers were stacked three high near the rear wall of the building. Emily walked up to one of the stacks and bent down. She shoved her hands underneath the bottom container causing the ground around her fingers to crack. Then she lifted raising all three containers above her head quickly and with little effort. The enormous woman turned with several hundred tons suspended above her head, a huge smile plastered to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pumped the trio of cargo containers up and down several times. \u201cI hope you can now understand the full weight of what I was saying before.\u201d Her voice was deeper and boomed out in several hundred decibels. \u201cYou should know that this is not even close to the full extent of how big and strong I can get. This is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d She turned back toward the remaining storage containers and, taking a step forward, threw the three she held at the wall of steel. Her projectiles collided with the containers like a bowling ball hitting pins. A thundering crash sounded through the room as a great hole opened in the wall and storage containers poured out into the open like bricks from a falling building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily walked back to where Laura and Adam stood speechless. She towered over both of them then, bending forward flexed her chest and curled her arms in their faces. \u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ve both been paid what you were owed. It\u2019s time for you to leave and never come back. If I see either of you, or your friends or your neighbors or your neighbors friends I will show you just how big I can get. Then I\u2019ll crush you as slowly and painfully as I can. Goodbye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily walked away her body began rapidly shrinking back down. She grabbed one of the nearby lab techs and pulled the white coat off of him. After about fifteen seconds of shrinking she was small enough to slip the coat over her shoulders. She rounded a corner and, just before disappearing out of sight, had returned to her original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Laura and Adam were in shock as they left the lab together. Laura\u2019s mind was buzzing with fear over just what a power-mad and beefed up Emily could possibly have in mind. Maybe they\u2019d all be lucky and size and strength was all Emily was after. Or perhaps it was time to try the app out again and see if the playing field could be evened out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Laura and Adam got back to the gym, Laura called Vanessa and Jason.  The conversation with Jason lasted much longer than the one with Vanessa as they had tech stuff to discuss.  As they gathered in the work out area, Vanessa was back to near tears as Laura explained what had happened.  Adam sat quietly, realizing that he was there to try and answer questions and was still not well appreciated.  Vanessa sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?  That, that woman could kill us all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \u201cYes, well perhaps it\u2019s time to bring up how Jason and I have managed to get so big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Laura explained the ap and the events that led up to today.  \u201cSo in actuality, I\u2019ve greatly exceeded the setting I started out with and still have about two months to go.  I\u2019m growing stronger ever day and at an accelerated rate.  But I\u2019m not sure if even two months of exponential strength increase will get me to what Emily is capable of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam shook his head, but wasn\u2019t about to condemn anyone.  Vanessa seemed to improve somewhat in spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is good isn\u2019t it?  Can\u2019t you just make yourself stronger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Jason looked at each other with concern and then Laura looked back at the confused Vanessa.  \u201cWell, maybe.  The problem is, we set the ap to complete our growth in another 8 weeks, so I\u2019m not sure we can change anything until then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked even more confused.  \u201cWell, OK.  Then what about making Adam stronger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned.  \u201cNot with all the drugs he\u2019s got in him.  Plus, I don\u2019t trust him all that much right now.  If Emily hadn\u2019t threatened him too, I wouldn\u2019t even trust him with the information about the ap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stood there, still wondering what to do.  As the others all looked at her, Vanessa\u2019s eyes widened.  \u201cWhat, you mean me?  Oh, I don\u2019t know.  I would have been happy to add some muscle and strength before, but this sounds dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked over to her and placed her hand on her shoulder.  \u201cIt\u2019s not dangerous.  It worked wonders for Jason and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed.  \u201cYeah, but that was before Emily turned herself into the Hulk.  Now you want me to take her on.\u201d  Laura paused, not wanting to force Vanessa to do anything she didn\u2019t want to.  Vanessa looked at the hopeful eyes around the room and grunted lightly.  She turned back to Laura and nearly groaned.  \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled gently and pulling up the ap on her phone, had Vanessa put her thumb on the Press Thumb in Box symbol and within moments, a message appeared.  Welcome Vanessa.  A 3D model of Vanessa soon appeared.  Laura pulled up the menus and tapped the \u201cMuscle Tone\u201d button and a pair of sliders.  The top one read \u201cMass\u201d while the bottom one was \u201cDensity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled.  \u201cWell, the menu is the same.  I only played with the mass slider.  The density must have just followed.  Or working out must have increased my density even if it wasn\u2019t originally selected to change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa bit her lip nervously.  \u201cSo if you slide those, I\u2019ll add muscle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded.  \u201cThe mass one will.  With the density slide, you can become stronger too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shifted as her head buzzed.  \u201cWhat about height?  I don\u2019t want to be 9 feet tall!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed and smiled.  \u201cNo, no.  But do you want to be taller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa glanced over at Adam, who was now standing at his full 7 foot 3 inch height to get a look at the phone, but wasn\u2019t about to add anything unless he was asked.  Vanessa looked back at Laura and grinned sheepishly.  \u201cWelllll.  I suppose a little height wouldn\u2019t hurt.  Especially if my muscles are going to grow really big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled for the first time in a long while.  Seeing her sister excited about something again made her happy.  \u201cSo does this mean you\u2019re willing to give this a try?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her long blonde hair and stood tall.  Her yellow summer dress shifted a bit as she did so.  The dress was typical Vanessa.  Simple, stylish, yet daring enough to showcase her large chest and firm legs.  The matching yellow pumps helped to push her height to 6 feet to try and give herself some confidence.  Placing her hands on her hips, she gave a determined look to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  Emily is going to regret the day she messed with us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed and even Adam smiled.  Laura motioned for Adam and Jason to leave.  \u201cJason knows what we\u2019re going to need to do.  This is more than just making Vanessa our ace in the hole, you two have plenty of work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam protested momentarily.  \u201cBut Jason is the computer expert.  What can I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned again.  \u201cYou know about the formula.  After what you did, you have a lot to make up for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam sighed again and Vanessa gave him a weak smile.  His heart skipped a beat and he knew that he would do whatever it took to re-gain their trust, especially Vanessa\u2019s.  Jason tugged on Adam\u2019s arm and they left.  Once Laura felt they were gone, she smiled at Vanessa again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so just how big did you want to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled weakly again, blushing.  \u201cI, um.\u201d  See looked away from Laura and then back.  \u201cI\u2019d like to be bigger than Adam.  I mean not as tall, but more muscular.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned.  \u201cYou still like him don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa dropped her head.  \u201cYeah.  I know what he did was wrong, but he\u2019s so big, and well, oh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \u201cNo problem Vanessa, we\u2019ll make sure you put the steroid king to shame.  But that\u2019s only part of it.  Let\u2019s look at the density.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the Density bar to the right showed numbers that steadily increased.  Vanessa\u2019s 3D model looked the same, but from what they could tell, her body tightened a bit and as they slid the bar to the right her chest pushed upward and her skin started to shine as her small muscles looked carved out of marble.  Even her blue eyes brightened and her blonde hair looked even lighter.  Laura continued to push the number passed 1000, in her mind trying to ascertain just how strong Vanessa would need to be to challenge Emily.  As the number climbed to 10,000 Vanessa\u2019s model looked even harder and brighter.  And by the time they reached 100,000 Vanessa was nearly glowing.  Vanessa\u2019s eyes widen at the image before her and Laura sighed when she stopped at 1 million.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should make you 1 million times as strong as you are now.  If you could bench 100 pounds, then you would be able to bench 50,000 tons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s body tingled at the thought of being that strong.  \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed, a bit jealous herself.  \u201cWell, let\u2019s hope so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving the selection back to Mass, Laura worked to change the settings toward what Vanessa wanted and wasn\u2019t too surprised at the results.  After adding some height and putting a minimal delay on, Laura looked up at Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, are you ready for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took a step back, kicking off her pumps and momentarily closing her eyes, opened them again and smiled.  \u201cI think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused.  \u201cDo you want to take off the dress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled.  \u201cNope.  But, uh, just what am I going to wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pointed toward some clothes sitting on a bench.  \u201cAdam left some things he had gotten from Emily before she tossed us out.  I told him to leave them, even if he didn\u2019t know why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at them.  Not her style for sure, but she knew that soon enough everything would be changing.  \u201cOK, I guess I\u2019m ready then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gulped.  She wasn\u2019t even sure the ap would work again.  If it didn\u2019t, getting a hold of the formula would become much harder and challenging Emily\u2019s might would be nearly impossible.  This just had to work.  So as Vanessa looked on with wonder, Laura pushed the \u201cBegin Schedule applications\u201d button.  And\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the button was pushed Vanessa let out a satisfying sigh.  She then opened her eyes and let out a quick \u201cOh!\u201d as her entire body began to change.  Muscles started growing across her frame and her height slowly moved up.  The skirt pulled higher and her bra peaked out over the top of the dress as her back and chest expanded and the dress was pulled toward her midsection.  Within moments the straps of the dress tore in half as the muscles began to pile up all across her frame.  Her thighs ballooned out with mounds of massive muscles and her calves blew past softball size in moments.  Her arms, hung to her side for the moment, pressed out with widening forearms and expanding biceps and triceps.  The bra soon popped and fell to the floor as her back continued to widen, her pectorals grew thicker and her breasts became harder.  The dress was pulled down further, finally popping off her chest, exposing her ever expanding upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her height reached 6 foot 4, Vanessa reached down, ripped off the ruined dress and giggled as she saw her expanding muscles.  Turning toward the large posing mirrors, Vanessa shook her right thigh and then tensed it roughly, blasting pounds of muscle into her waiting legs and showcasing unmatched hardness.  She was already stronger than Laura even though her muscles were only still half as big.  But those muscles were now growing even faster as her height reached the 6 foot 8 inch mark she had wanted.  While she stopped growing taller, she continued to grow thicker and wider and much, much stronger.  Soon her calves were the size of canned hams, while her thighs were over two feet wide and nearly as thick!  Her narrow mid-section was an array of muscle blocks deeply separated that curved violently into ever widening and thickening lats and a chest that was already thicker than Laura\u2019s!  The pectorals shelf continued to add inches of mind blowing muscles as her once dominating DD breasts continued to grow harder, but was no longer as big as the muscles on her chest!  Her shoulders continued to add mass and were now 6 incredibly feet wide and still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggled again as she stared at her brightening eyes, beautiful face and long, blonde hair.  Peaking a glance at Laura, Vanessa finally brought her arms up into a double bicep pose.  The pose that had made her jealous of Greg years ago and the one that filled her with desire and envy from Laura.  Now SHE would have the biggest biceps in the family!  Vanessa had even made sure to zoom in on her arms and add extra mass to the point of being, well ridiculous, even on her growing, once impossible to even imagine frame.  Bringing her arms up slowly, the combination of muscle expansion and physics defying density caused rumbling as her muscle fibers audibly consolidated, flexed and grew.  Muscles piled upon muscles.  Strength multiplied against her growing strength.  She could have curl tons without touching the density bar.  But with the density set, soon she would be able to curl MILLIONS of tons!  Smiling at the sound, feel and look of her arms expanding, her mouth opened up slightly as her triceps dipped low and pressed into her massive lats and her bicep peaks pushed up to her wrists, to the top of her fists and on to the top of her head!  Her biceps were now well bigger than Adam\u2019s or Laura\u2019s, but now the extra kick set in.  Her biceps pressed out further, pushing her forearms away to vertical and even passed that as the bicep muscles expanded outward, blasting upward in height larger than 3 basketballs stacked on top of each other!  Her peaks were now well over a foot above the top of her head and pounded with super duper strength and power.  A light glow now surrounded her entire, muscle goddess body as the density reached the 1 million multiplier and her biceps reached 120 inches around each!  Large veins snaked their way up to her magnificent peaks, hundreds of muscle fibers feathered their way up her mighty biceps and the skin looked ready to split as her muscles pulsed with unearthly power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa held her pose for a moment as the glowing dimmed a bit and her growth stopped.  Releasing her awe inspiring pose, she smiled broadly at Laura and leaned down to pick up the 6000 pound weight Vanessa had just hours earlier looked on with wide eyed wonder when Laura was curling it.  Wrapping her still slender fingers around the weight, Vanessa chucked at how light it felt.  A couple of quick curls confirmed it.  It felt nearly weightless.  Turning the weight sideways, Vanessa held it in the palm of her hand and showed it to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess the ap worked!  Not only do I have muscles bigger than you or Adam, but I\u2019m stronger too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out with her other hand, Vanessa pushed down on the top of the large metal disks and was soon rewarded with a horrible metallic squeal as the inch thick bar bend and buckled.  Vanessa smiled and continued to push down, easily holding her other hand steady as the huge plates pressed against each other and began their own low frequency squeals as Vanessa continued to press down.  Bringing her other hand into play, Vanessa continued to compress the metal, nearly super heating the metal to liquid as she quickly pressed the weights into a ball and then pushed it into a smaller ball.  By the time she was done, the once huge weight was the size of a basketball!  Holding it back in the palm of her hand she looked at a stunned Laura and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this makes me MUCH stronger than you or Adam, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head.  \u201cYeah.  Let\u2019s hope that you\u2019re strong enough to keep Emily busy if we need to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s eyes narrowed.  \u201cShe won\u2019t stand a chance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled, wanting Vanessa to retain her confidence.  \u201cWell, unfortunately, you\u2019re going to have to maintain a low profile for a while.  While Emily clearly doesn\u2019t see us as a threat, that doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t still keeping an eye on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confident Vanessa sighed, pushing her gigantic chest up and down and actually causing a stiff breeze with her breath.  Laura noticed this and took a mental note to try and test Vanessa\u2019s abilities soon.  For now through, there was much to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo go ahead and put on Adam\u2019s clothes and the hat with it.  We\u2019re going to sneak you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa crinkled her face, once again a bit lost with the overall scheme.  \u201cWhat?  How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled.  \u201cI\u2019ll drive the SUV.  You\u2019ll push your hair into the hat.  With Adam\u2019s clothes, hopefully anyone spying on us with think you\u2019re Adam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s eyes widened and she looked insulted.  \u201cWhy, do I look like a man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura snickered.  \u201cNo of course not.  But it\u2019s dark now and your frame is so large that hopefully nobody will notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s eyes narrowed, still stung by the fact anyone would think she was Adam.  \u201cWell, OK, if you think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out another sigh.  \u201cI do.  Now get dressed and I\u2019ll drop you off at Adam\u2019s house.  He\u2019s hiding in his office.  Hopefully nobody noticed that you came in earlier.  Once we\u2019re gone, Adam will leave out the back and meet you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa struggled pulling Adam\u2019s shirt over her steel hard breasts and ripped the sleeves of the shirt in her attempt to pull the shirt down toward her waist.  Sliding up the shorts, Vanessa turned back toward the mirror and smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was jealous of you and Greg.  It\u2019s just so hard to believe how big and strong I am now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded and handed Vanessa the hat.  Vanessa released crinkled her face, not really wanting to hide her gorgeous hair.  A pleading look from Vanessa was met with a firm stare by Laura.  Vanessa sighed and did her best to shove her hair under the hat.  Laura turned and started to walk toward the car, hitting the lights as they neared the front.  Vanessa was right behind, walking tall and proud.  As they reached the front door, Laura looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, let\u2019s go, keep your head down and try not to stick your chest out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed again, unhappy that she couldn\u2019t strut her new body out for everyone to see.  But she followed Laura\u2019s advice and the two marched quickly toward the car and squeezed in.  Laura started the car and they drove quickly toward Adam\u2019s house.  Laura pulled into the driveway and handed Vanessa the keys to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, go in and wait for Adam.  Don\u2019t turn on too many lights and keep the curtains closed.  I\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at Laura curiously.  \u201cAren\u2019t you coming in too?\u201d  Laura looked ahead.  \u201cNo.  I\u2019m heading over to Jason\u2019s.\u201d  Vanessa smiled.  \u201cOh, OK.  Have fun then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \u201cWe have to work out our plan to take on Emily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s smile dropped a bit as Laura looked over her and tried not to look too stern.  \u201cAnd don\u2019t think about doing anything physical with Adam.  With your strength, you\u2019d kill him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s smile dropped all the way.  \u201cReally?\u201d  Laura held her firm look and nodded her head.  Vanessa groaned.  \u201cWell OK.  But we\u2019ll need to do something about that later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grunted.  \u201cYeah, later.  Now stay low and call me if anything strange happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded and climbed out of the car.  Laura waited until she was in the house before pulling away.  She reached Jason\u2019s house and found him waiting for her in the back yard.</span></div></div>",

Her arms were also beginning to look a little thick. She flexed and was rewarded with a bicep the size of a large lemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is so cool</i>, she thought to herself while she flexed. <i>I can\u2019t wait til you can see the split between the two heads. Then I\u2019ll start giving Greg a run for his money.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed her abs looked a bit more defined, even though she\u2019d been eating like a horse lately. She put her hands behind her head and found that she could make out a 6-pack if she really crunched her abs hard.<br>\r\nWith that pose, Laura also saw that her back was starting to flare out, giving her torso more of a V shape. All the rows and pulldowns I did are really paying off, she thought to herself. She loved the feeling she got when her arms rubbed against her bulging lats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Laura saw something that stopped her playful flexing in its tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked to be about a B-cup. She squeezed her pecs and saw a little jiggle as her new boobs bobbed up and down. She was so excited she didn\u2019t even notice the equally impressive muscles underneath. Even her nipples looked a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had been so obsessed with muscles, she hadn\u2019t touched the breast slider on the app. This meant she could still change if she wanted to, but for now she was too stunned with her new body to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s head swam with thoughts of how big she was getting and how much bigger she was still going to get. What about her height? Had that sped up too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura marked off the top of her head on the door jamb and measured the result: 5\u20196\u00bd\u201d, a height she shouldn\u2019t have reached for at least another month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m growing so fast</i>, she thought gleefully. <i>Before long I\u2019ll have bigger muscles than Greg, bigger boobs than Vanessa and be taller than both of them! Maybe I\u2019ll dress in some looser clothes so they don\u2019t notice as much; at least until I\u2019m ready to show them.</i><br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later Laura strode confidently into the gym ready for another month of punishing workouts with Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had packed on over 50 lbs. in the past month to tip the scales at a mammoth 212, and at 5\u20199\u201d she\u2019d already hit her desired height; and she still had 9 months to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had also continued growing to a large C-cup; not as fast as her height and muscles were growing, but still quite impressive. Given she\u2019d been her keeping a low profile around the house, she relished the chance to show off her physique for the leering gym-goers; and of course Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Adam,\u201d Laura chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning. Ready to blast those arms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Laura said coyly, \u201cI wanna do legs today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean? We just did legs two days ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but look at this!\u201d Laura pulled up the bottom of her tanktop with one hand (revealing a sharply cut 8-pack, even without flexing) and the leg of her shorts with the other. Her flexed quads bunched up into a tree trunk that dwarfed her knees before sweeping back out to her massive, heart-shaped calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy legs are almost bigger than my waist,\u201d Laura said, barely containing her enthusiasm. \u201cIf I really hit it hard today, I\u2019ll be able to push it over the top!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam stifled a gulp. Even though he\u2019d gotten used to Laura\u2019s phenomenal growth, he was having trouble hiding his attraction for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, I think my arms can wait a day,\u201d Laura grinned, playfully flexing her 19\u00bd inch biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam\u2019s shoulders drooped; he knew better than to argue with her at this point. \u201cFine, let\u2019s start with some deadlifts.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s alarm went off at 3:00AM. Even with the huge meals she ate, the only way she could get enough protein was to get up in the middle of the night to feed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s legs wobbled as she groggily made her way downstairs in just her panties and an oversized T-shirt. Laura had a sleepy grin on her face as she could still feel a bit of the pump from her grueling leg workout. She was sure she\u2019d accomplished her goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Before I\u2019m done</i>, she thought, <i>my arms will be bigger than my waist too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura made her way into the kitchen without turning on the lights and reached into the fridge to pull out a huge chocolate protein shake she\u2019d made earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold air of the refrigerator perked up her nipples as they stiffly tented the fabric of her thin T-shirt. The shake tasted so good she didn\u2019t notice the small streams running down the corners of her mouth, tickling their way down the front of her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned around in surprise to confront the voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amidst the Comic book and movie posters and the general nerdy trinkets gathered in Jason's room was something she never thought she'd see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat on the edge of his bed, head all the way back with mouth as open as his eyes were shut, completely nude.  In front of him, topless but with a light blue skirt on, was an unknown girl with gorgeous red curly hair.  She was currently on her knees, with her back to Laura, applying many intense movements to Jason's brand new shaft that both of them were clearly enjoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't know what to say.  She was rendered completely speechless and immobile.  Sure, she and Jason weren't dating, but she felt betrayed nonetheless.  At that moment she realized that she assumed they would always be with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about that moment it became clear that Jason was about to finish, and finish he did.  The fellatio artist sensed it as well and took much more of his cock in her mouth than Laura had imagined possible.  However, once the flood came there was nothing she could do to keep it all in.  She gulped and slurped, but there was still jizz everywhere.  Afterwards, she climbed up Jason to kiss him and he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura!\" He exclaimed.  The girl then turned around to see (and was painfully sexy in every possible way, Laura noted), shrieked, covered herself and then ran to the bathroom and locked the door.  \"How long have you been there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long enough. Who was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Nikki, Jasmine's friend.\" Jasmine was Jason's twin sister.  Much like in her own family, Jasmine got all of the physical attributes.  \"She was here waiting for Jazz to get back from soccer practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... but you've had that dick for maybe 15 minutes how did she end up all over it? Was she already interested in you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Jason admitted. \"I stepped into my room when you called and left her in the living room.  She heard my moans and came to see if I was alright and saw... it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  You really are a stud.\" Laura said...</span></div></div>",

I have to say, I'm not mad at all, that's amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a sigh of relief, he had assumed that Laura was going to be pissed. He wasn't sure why, it's not like she was his girlfriend or anything. \"Right? I don't even know how it happened really. It got so big so fast that I had to pull it out. Then once she came in and saw it she was all over me. And I may not be the smartest guy around but I know that when a smokin' hot girl wants to go down on you the last thing you do is put up a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura rolled her eyes then saw that Jason was moving to cover himself and she put her hands up. \"Wait a minute, what do you think you're doing? I gave you that monster you don't get to hide it from me. I want to take a look at my handiwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned then pulled the sheet he was going to use to cover himself back. Already his penis was beginning to harden once more, the head slowly rising away from Jason's waist and standing over a foot high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is something special,\" Laura said approaching the bed where Jason sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand how you did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I, really. I just got this strange email for a new iPhone app and downloaded it. It works like magic somehow and can do almost anything. I don't get it, but I love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say. We'll have to examine it further and see about having some more fun with it.\" Jason said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked down at Jason's 13 and a half inch cock and smiled. \"You'd better believe it, we're only getting started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom Nikki sat slumped on the floor with her back to the door and her knees to her chest. She was so embarrassed, she never did things like this. Going down on a guy was the sort of thing she rarely did, and only with men she truly cared about. But there was something about Jason's cock that just drove her wild and she couldn't help herself. It was so big and thick; the moment she laid eyes on it she just needed to touch it, kiss it, suck it, she wanted it inside her so bad but they had been interrupted by that nerdy girl from down the street. So instead of riding the most magnificent cock she'd ever seen she was hiding in the bathroom, topless, waiting for Jason and the girl to leave so she could get her bra and shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat she realized that she could hear them talking and why they were saying didn't make much sense. Somehow the girl was taking credit for Jason's enormous penis. She listened more and overheard them talking about some sort of iPhone app that made it possible. Could it really be true or were they just messing with her? Perhaps they knew she could hear what they were saying and just wanted to embarrass her further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stood and looked at her reflection in the mirror over the sink. She was gorgeous and she knew it, but she still wanted more. She cupped her C cup breasts which sat high on her chest in a perfect teardrop shape and tried to imagine them even bigger. She grinned imagining soccer ball sized boobs stuffed into her shirts and guys everywhere stopping and staring at her. Then she pictured her best friend Jasmine and another idea occurred to her. Nikki certainly had Jazz beat when it came to curves but Nikki couldn't hold a candle to Jazz's athletic figure. Nikki had always watched her friends body with envy and lusted for her thick quads and shapely calves, her strong arms and washboard stomach. If Jason's friend was right about what she had on her phone then Nikki could have it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to the door and listened but didn't hear anyone. She unlocked the door and crept out of the bathroom with one arm covering her bosom. As she had hoped the room was empty and Nikki was able to gather her clothes and return to the downstairs room where Jason was watching TV with his friend.</span></div></div>",

Instead the girl, Nikki was pretty sure her name was Lauren or something, was showing Jason her phone. Nikki was able to get close enough that she could see the screen displayed an insanely buff guy with muscles bigger than any Nikki had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is you, in a year.\" The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! That's ridiculous. I'll be bigger than your brother!\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty cool, right? This is why I suggested we join a gym, so at least we have a reason to be growing big muscles. The app has locked our ability to change our height or muscle size until our growth is done, but we can change anything else about ourselves in the meantime. You know, for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's mouth was dry; it was real. She needed that phone. Already she was imagining herself with monstrous muscles or the most incredible body the world had ever seen. She would be famous, she would be a queen, she would do everything she'd ever dreamed of. But first there was the matter of getting the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki backed up to the base of the stairs so she wouldn't be spotted by Jason or his friend. She considered her options. She could either be friends with the two of them and see if they'd bring her in on their plans. Truth be told she had no real problems with Jason and though he and his friend were kinda geeky they were always nice to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's other option was a bit more mean spirited. She could just steal the phone and make a break for it. If she were able to get away she could make herself strong enough to never have to worry about Jason or the girl again. She didn't want to be that mean but she wanted the power of the phone even more. </span></div></div>",

She took a minute to calm herself and realized that she couldn't bring herself to be a thief. Jason was a geek to be sure, so was his friend, but they'd always been nice to her even when Jasmine was at her nastiest. And Jasmine could be downright mean to her brother when she wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki decided that wasn't who she was going to be, though. As silly as it sounded she was having feelings for Jason. Maybe it was the fact that he was hung like no one she'd ever seen or that he was on his way to bulking up into a muscle monster but she wanted to be his girl. And if she just so happened to gain access to some upgrades to her own body through him and that girl then so be it. Besides, if being with Jason didn\u2019t work out then she could look into stealing the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki fixed her hair and made sure her spaghetti strap halter sufficiently showed off both her impressive boobs and her trim tummy, then she pulled the waist of her pleated skirt up to show off a few more inches of thigh. She took a deep breath then reentered the living room where Jason and his friend were now actually watching TV instead of discussing the phone with the intention of landing herself a boyfriend. She rounded the couch and stood at Jason's side. \"Um.. hi. I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blushed. \"Oh... uh, sure.\" He stood and led her into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Nikki began trying to sound nervous and finding that she actually was, \"first I wanted to apologize for just jumping on you earlier. I mean I just saw your... you know, and I couldn't help myself.\" She casually draped her hand across her breast to make sure Jason remembered the sight of her naked chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment he stared at her boobs then snapped back into himself. \"Right! No problem, I mean it was nice. Better than nice, really. Great. Yeah! It was great. We should do it again. Well, not right now, but sometime. I mean, we could. If, you know, you wanted. That is, we don't have to but it'd be nice, er, great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled to herself. She had him, the poor guy didn't stand a chance. She realized that it was likely that he'd never had a girlfriend before in his life and definitely not one like her. She held up her hand to quiet him. \"I liked it too. But now I've got a problem. I like you, Jason. I have for a while; I've always thought you were cute. But now I\u2019ve ruined everything. I can\u2019t ask you out or make you my boyfriend because I'm afraid you'll think all I want is that monster in your pants.\" She paused and bit her lip while staring at his crotch and letting out a horny sigh. \u201cAnd I do,\u201d she moaned, \u201cI really want it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stepped forward and raised herself up on her toes closing the gap a little between her 5 foot 8 inch body and Jason\u2019s 6 foot one. She put her hands on his face and locked her eyes onto his. \u201cBut I want you even more. All of you. This big brain, this sweet guy, this goofy sense of humor. I want Jason. Not just Jason\u2019s cock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki waited forcing Jason to speak. \u201cUh\u2026.. wow. That sounds good. Really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled and her green eyes flashed. \u201cAwesome. And to prove to you that I\u2019m really serious about being with you we can go as fast or as slow as you want. We can wait as long as you want to have sex, a week, a month, a year, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll be here waiting patiently until you decide I\u2019m worthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSex?\u201d Jason mumbled absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki could see the gears turning in his head. \u201cYeah, baby. Anytime you want it.\u201d Nikki hugged him, pressing her body against his tightly. \u201cNow why don\u2019t you introduce me to your friend, I want to apologize to her too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took Nikki\u2019s hand and led her, now his girlfriend, back to the living room. Jason officially introduced the two girls and Nikki, as she\u2019d said she would, apologized to Laura for the embarrassing moment she\u2019d happened upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It was my fault for just wandering in here unannounced, what you guys do in private is your business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you Jason and I were wondering if I could join you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d Laura chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat on the couch with Laura on his left while Nikki snuggled up on his right. She guided his hand to her thigh which he greedily squeezed savoring her soft, smooth flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you guys watching?\u201d Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssault on Arkham.\u201d Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen it before?\u201d Jason asked not realizing how silly this question really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, never. I\u2019ve never even heard of it. It\u2019s a cartoon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got a little defensive, \u201cWell, yeah. But I mean, it\u2019s not for kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded then rested her head on Jason\u2019s shoulder. The trio remained that way for the next 30 minutes until Jason\u2019s twin sister, Jasmine, came home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they all heard the door open and shut Nikki jumped up. \u201cBaby, let me go talk to Jazz. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the redheaded bombshell was gone Laura slapped Jason square in the chest. \u201cWow, look at you, stud. Less than an hour with a giant dong and you land a super hot chick.\u201d She made air quotes around the last three words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said she already liked me before,\u201d Jason said sheepishly then relayed the conversation he\u2019d had with Nikki in the kitchen including the part about waiting for him as long as it took to earn his trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d Laura said. \u201cWhile you were talking I was using my phone to check her emotions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do that?\u201d Jason was continuously astounded by what that app could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. She was showing signs of joy, excitement and even some nervousness. I\u2019m still learning how to read this thing, but I think she really does like you. Still, you may want to make her wait at least a month, just to be sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and nodded. He wanted Nikki so bad right now, but perhaps Laura was right. Then again who cared if all she wanted was his penis; he\u2019d never had a gorgeous girl throwing herself at him before in his life. Why not take advantage? He quietly wished he could see into Nikki\u2019s mind like Laura could with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get that app, again? And do you think I could download it too?\u201d Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm.. well, a link was emailed to me. I guess I could forward it to you and see if it works.\u201d Laura didn\u2019t seem excited about sharing control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be great, I promise not to do anything crazy. You know, if it works.\u201d Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to say something else when she was interrupted by shouting from upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck is your problem?\u201d That was Jasmine\u2019s voice. \u201cHe\u2019s a fucking dork, what are you thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you talk about him that way! You\u2019re just a mean spirited bitch, you can\u2019t stand the idea that someone doesn\u2019t think like you do.\u201d Nikki shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stormed back downstairs to where Laura and Jason tried to look like they hadn\u2019t been listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby,\u201d Nikki said to Jason, \u201cI think I should go. Do you think you could walk me home?\u201d She looked at Laura. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m stealing him away from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood. \u201cNo, it\u2019s totally fine. I was just leaving to go to the gym, anyway.\u201d Laura looked at Jason. \u201cI\u2019ll forward you that email.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Jason said before leading Nikki out of the house.</span></div></div>",

As they walked they chatted about whatever topics came to mind and to both of their surprise they found they had quite a bit to share.

Then I wouldn\u2019t be so frightened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Jason laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s actually one of the reasons Laura and I are joining the gym. Both of us are tired of being skinny weaklings. And if I can get Jazz to back down a little then even better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooooohh!\u201d Nikki purred. \u201cAre you going to be my big muscle man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 maybe someday. We\u2019ll see, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I could join the gym too; pump some iron. Would you still like me if I had big, bulging muscle too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would,\u201d Jason said. \u201cI think muscles can look really good on a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll pump \u2018em up for you, baby. You\u2019ll see.\u201d Nikki hoped that she was giving Jason the proper encouragement to help her along. \u201cI\u2019ll get so strong that you won\u2019t have to worry about Jasmine, I\u2019ll kick her ass for you.\u201d Nikki giggled at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was silent for a long time doing his best to control himself; the thought of Nikki with huge muscles was enough to give him a raging hard-on but the shorts he currently wore wouldn\u2019t conceal his monster penis adequately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at Nikki\u2019s house 20 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for walking with me,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until we can hang out again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason agreed, \u201cthough I\u2019m sorry my bitch of a sister is going to make hanging out at my place a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\u201d Nikki grinned then seductively slid towards Jason, wrapping her arm around his neck. Without even thinking Jason put his hands on the exposed skin of her waist. \u201cI don\u2019t have any sisters or brothers. I just live here with my dad and he\u2019s almost never home. I practically have the place all to myself all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Nikki pulled Jason\u2019s head down to meet hers and she planted a kiss on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivers erupted up and down Jason\u2019s spine and he pressed into her harder and parted his lips. Nikki did the same and moments later their tongues were dancing together. When their kiss was complete Nikki took a step back and it became clear that Jason could no longer control his erection. His 13 and a half inch penis was tenting his shorts to an obscene degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019ll be patiently waiting until you\u2019re ready to share that magnificent cock with me again.\u201d She opened the front door to go inside, then paused. \u201cYou could even come in now, if you wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to head to the gym too,\u201d Jason lied. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to take you out tomorrow night, if you\u2019re free. Traditional date: dinner and a movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds wonderful. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Nikki vanished into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason practically sprinted home and once inside he practically bowled into Jasmine just before he made it to his bedroom. He stopped short of running into her but took a step back when he realized she looked pissed. Sensing his weakness she lurched forward and shoved Jason and even though he was 6 inches taller her powerful muscles sent him sprawling onto his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine walked up and stood over Jason flexing her thick thighs and bulging calves. Jasmine was an all star at soccer and a runner to boot and legs were easily the most developed part of her body; she usually loved showing them off. Now she was just angry and flexing her pumped muscles was merely a sign of dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what the fuck you and Nikki think you're doing but it's going to stop.\" Jasmine sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your problem, what does this even have to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine stepped forward and shoved Jason onto his back with her foot. She stepped on his chest hard and held him down. \"You're a loser, Jason. A loser I'm chained to by birth but a loser all the same. You don't deserve to have any girl much less one like Nikki. What you deserve is loneliness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to respond but there was no air in his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine sighed. \"Aw fuck it. You two won't last a month together.\" She took her foot off of him and vanished into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got up and ran into his room locking the door behind him. He booted up his computer and opened his email. Just as Laura had promised he found the mysterious email linking him to the Alterations app. He downloaded it and synced it to his iPhone. He launched it and was prompted for his thumb print after which he was greeted with the image of himself as he would be in a year, 275 pounds of solid beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works!!\" Jason shouted. His heart was practically pounding its way out of his chest. \"Jasmine has no idea what's in store for her.\" Jason performed a quick search and easily found Nikki's profile. \"This is going to be the start of something good.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki got out of the shower and toweled herself off. She stood before her naked reflection and smiled. The last two months had been very good to her. Jason had been very good to her. And every day things were getting even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took up her bra and fastened it around her torso. She laughed as she watched her tightly packed cleavage spill over the top of the cups. \u201cWell girls, looks like it\u2019s getting tight in there. I think it\u2019s time to go up yet another size.\u201d She said to her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason still hadn't mentioned the fact that he and Laura were in possession of a magical iPhone app that could alter reality, but no matter. All Nikki had had to do was mention how much she would love to have bigger boobs way back on their second date and within the week she had felt her shirts getting tighter. She continued to act surprised as her breasts continued to swell little by little, but she also made sure Jason knew just how excited her new endowments made her feel. Truth be told she kind of liked that Jason hadn't clued her in to what he was doing to her yet, it meant that she didn't know just how big her boobs were going to get. She loved finding new outfits that highlighted her gorgeous cleavage because she knew that her breasts would soon be swelling right out of her top. When she was alone at home she would frequently put on old shirts that were way to small just so she could burst out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, for his part, played dumb about why her bust could possibly be expanding though he did mention that he\u2019d heard of girls going through a second puberty late in their teens and even in their twenties. Beyond that he\u2019d simply enjoyed the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nikki and Jason had started dating 9 weeks earlier she had worn a C cup bra and filled it perfectly. Since then her breasts had been swelling gradually so that 2 weeks after their relationship began Nikki had to go up a cup size and wear a D. Not quite 2 weeks after that she was moving on to a DD then an E not long after that. She thought her growth had been drawing to a close but earlier in the month she had tried an EE cup bra for some added space but eventually even that wasn\u2019t enough. Even now the garment she was bursting out of was an F cup bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki unhooked the over-tight brassiere and tossed it into the small trash can by the sink. \u201cI guess it\u2019s time to graduate to a G. This is getting expensive. I should make Jason buy all my underwear from no on.\u201d She giggled then put her hands on her hips to admire her gorgeous assets. Her softball sized boobs had grown substantially but they still maintained their perfect teardrop shape and sat high on her chest. Nikki turned sideways to get a look at her profile; her slender stomach only made her enhanced bosom look even more impressive and the fact that her bust line extended out beyond the tip of her nose was most impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill,\u201d she said giving her massive mammaries a squeeze, \u201cI\u2019ve got to find something that\u2019ll fit me now before I can even go out to buy a bigger bra.\u201d She glanced out of the tiny bathroom window and saw the sand and ocean outside. \u201cThat\u2019s it!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki rushed back to her room ( her father was out making this one of the many times she had the house to herself) and began rooting through her dresser drawers. She quickly found the neon pink bikini top she\u2019d purchased a little over a week ago. It was both adjustable and stretchy so it should still fit her just fine. Slipping it on it was actually more snug than she\u2019d expected, but it fit and even enhanced her already outstanding cleavage. She pulled a white tank top on over the bikini and decided she liked the way the neon showed through, so she pulled the tank off and found a white mesh top instead. This garment was too tight, but the mesh stretched sufficiently to accommodate her chest. Still, the way the webbed holes got extra wide around her giant boobs made Nikki giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she may actually make a stop at the beach later Nikki pulled on the matching bikini bottoms then a pair of tight denim cut offs over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she stood before the mirror and appreciated her form as a whole. The rest of her body was changing too, in fact. Her curves, once supported by fat deposits around her hips, thighs and butt were no longer soft though they were just as curvy. In fact she was pretty sure that her legs and butt had even added an inch or two as her skinny jeans were tighter now than they\u2019d been before. As a trade off her waist had dropped the same inch or two further enhancing her hourglass shape. As much as the shape of her body excited her Nikki was even more excited about what was going on just below the surface. Jason had been strengthening and building her muscles a little at a time. A thin layer of fat still hid what was going on underneath but when she flexed Nikki could tell that her power was something to contend with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and stuck her behind out at her reflection while going up on her toes. Her calves went from rounded and shapely to hard and cut with a serious cleft above her slender ankle. At the same time Nikki squeezed her glutes causing her tight jean shorts to pop and creak. She slid her hand over her incredibly round butt then gave it a hard slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could crack industrial strength walnuts on this baby!\u201d she said with pride. \u201cI wonder how long until I\u2019m stronger than Jasmine. Maybe I am already.\u201d She considered this for a moment then decided her new strength was going to her head and that she probably wasn\u2019t as powerful as that just yet. But she would be soon enough. In the meantime she'd just have to be excited for her ever expanding bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki slipped on a pair of flip flops and drove to the local mall. She picked up a few new bras (two G cups and 2 H cups as well to plan ahead) then perused various tops and dresses. There were several she wanted to buy but she decided not to since she may not have the opportunity to wear them before outgrowing them, a thought that sent giddy shivers down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the register with her 4 bras and set them on the counter. As she was checking out she noticed the guy behind the register, a college aged geeky looking kid, had his eyes locked onto her chest. When he finally looked up and noticed he'd been caught he turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" he said. Flop sweat formed on his brow and he looked like he was about to melt into a puddle on the floor in an attempt to escape the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your hand,\" Nikki ordered; she noticed his name tag read \u201cMatt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softened a little. \u201cMatt, it\u2019s ok. Give me your hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he did as he was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is your lucky day.\" She took his hand and placed it on her left breast then pressed his fingers firmly into her soft flesh. Matt gasped and tried to pull away but Nikki held him firmly and eventually he went with it squeezing her breast gently through her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki closed her eyes and purred, his touch was warm and spread across her entire chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Nikki said, her eyes still closed enjoying Matt\u2019s kneading fingers, \u201cyou can tell your friends but no one will believe you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki realized she\u2019d been letting Matt fondle her breast for nearly a full minute. She was about to bring his fantasy to a close when he asked a question that didn\u2019t make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm feeling in her chest was intoxicating. \u201cMmmmm, doing what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis!\u201d Matt said lifting her breast from underneath. Nikki realized that something felt different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and saw that her boobs were bigger. Much bigger, in fact. She had intended on buying an H cup bra to grow into over the next few weeks but already it would be too small. Nikki was dumbfounded and could only stare for a moment before she noticed that her bikini was getting tighter and it became clear that her breasts were still rapidly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki took a few step back hoping that breaking contact with Matt\u2019s hand would stop whatever process had begun but it was no use. By now her softball sized boobs had grown to the size of cantaloupes and were straining her bikini. Flesh began to ooze from below, above and along the sides of her top while her mesh shirt stretched further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was fairly empty but the few customers within had gathered around to watch this sexy miracle unfold. A twenty-something man took out his cellphone and began taking video. Nikki spun away from his camera and put her hands on her chest in an attempt to stop her swelling bosom by force. She\u2019d wanted huge boobs, but this was too much too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bikini could take no more and the tiny string across her cleavage snapped allowing her enormous breasts to surge forward separating the mesh on the shirt she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw for Nikki. She clamped an arm across her bust and sprinted out of the store to her car. Once inside she had to move her seat back to keep her still expanding chest from laying on the horn. By now each breast was nearly the size of a volleyball and didn\u2019t seem to be slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason, what the hell are you doing to me?\u201d She was both scared and angry. She lifted her rear as much as she could to fish her phone out of her back pocket. As she unlocked her phone and was about to call Jason the warm feeling left her chest and her breasts stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki took a minute to calm herself taking deep breaths and getting her heart to slow down. When she looked down all she could see was boobs. She ran her hands around the enormous curve of her volleyball sized endowments and squeezed. She had to admit they felt amazing but Jason should have known better than to just instantly pump her up, she\u2019d been embarrassed and exposed. She lifted her phone and dialed her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason answered quickly, \u201cHi baby, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason, what did you do to me? This is insane!\u201d Nikki wanted to sound calm but her nerves were shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jason truly sounded clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to beat around the bush Nikki decided it was time to come clean, \u201cLook, I know you\u2019ve been slowly changing my body with that weird phone thing. I\u2019ve been loving your work so far, but this is way too much. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got watermelons on my chest, and why did you make them grow so fast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause then Jason uttered a quiet, \u201cOh, that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that. I barely fit behind the wheel of my car, how can I-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, just come by my place. The garage is empty, you can park in there so no one sees you.\u201d At this point Jason abruptly hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Nikki was pulling into the garage at Jason\u2019s house. Jason met her inside and led her through the garage door into the kitchen then up to his room. He was silent the whole time and Nikki thought his face looked red as if he\u2019d been crying or was ready to start. She also found it odd that he hardly even looked at her mammoth chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in his room Jason looked at Nikki. His eyes were glassy, he really looked like  he was going to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have something you want to tell me?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I- Look at me, is there something <i>you</i> want to tell <i>me</i>?\u201d She held up her giant boobs but he still didn\u2019t look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you know about the phone app, so you must have figured out what happened to you. Don\u2019t play dumb, the proof is right there in your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d Jason was getting louder, more emotional. \u201cI\u2019ve been changing your body. I did all kinds of things you\u2019re not even aware of yet, but I also set some traps. Even a booby trap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Nikki\u2019s head was spinning. She didn\u2019t know how to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made it so if you cheated on me, if you let someone else touch you, fondle you, or\u2026 or.. fuck you the evidence would be super obvious. So who was he? Who did you let play with your tits?\u201d A tear freed itself from his eye and rolled down his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she understood. \u201cJason, it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDON\u2019T LIE!\u201d He slammed his hand down on the dresser to his right with a thunderous crash. The last 9 weeks had been good to Jason\u2019s body as well; he\u2019d put on a little more than 20 pounds of muscle and now tipped the scales at 175 pounds. He was no longer skinny and frail looking but rather filled in a solid. He didn\u2019t look overtly intimidating but much like the extra muscle Nikki had been gaining his was rock hard and super strong. Nikki realized that he could really hurt her if he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying, I\u2019m not a cheater! Besides, how could you do this to me? You didn\u2019t trust me, you set up traps in my own body?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn this around on me. Yes, ok, yes I\u2019m insecure. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend before let alone one as incredible as you. But it looks like I was right to be suspicious. So tell me, who was touching you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sighed. \u201cLook, here\u2019s what happened.\u201d She told him everything, the whole story even including the embarrassing show she put on for the small group of customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason thought for a moment. He lowered his head and looked at the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or worse that you just let some random stranger feel you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know why I did it? Because he reminded me of you. A skinny, nerdy kid that didn\u2019t seem to believe in himself much. I wanted to give him a story to tell his pals. I wanted him to feel good about himself. I thought that maybe if this guy gained a little confidence that maybe he could get the girl of his dreams. I really didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal. I would never cheat on you, but yeah, I let some guy touch my boob. They still belong to you, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed quietly. He went to his desk and picked up his phone then went to his bed to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFixing things,\u201d he said. \u201cJust give me a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tapped away at his phone\u2019s screen for a bit then nodded. \u201cOk, this should make things better.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was very similar to earlier when her breasts had been expanding only even more intense and not just in her chest. To her relief, though, she saw her volleyball sized boobs begin to shrink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you.\" The warmth was growing into a heat that pulsed through her whole body. It was even making her head all fuzzy, her thoughts began to jumble. \"I.. I'm so glad you.. uh..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't paying much attention, he continued to tap away at his phone. Then he turned the screen around to Nikki. \"Is the the guy you let touch you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki squinted at the picture. Was it? She was pretty sure but for some reason her thoughts weren't as clear as they'd been a moment ago. \"I think so, yeah.\" Nikki was about to tell Jason to let it go when she noticed that her breasts had ceased their shrinking and we're still much larger than they'd been that morning; she was back down to the size of large cantaloupes. \"What.....?\" She had trouble forming the rest of her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki,\" Jason said finally setting his phone down, \"I've spent these past few weeks doing a lot of thinking. I realized that I've been a victim for much of my life. Things have gotten better recently and before long I'll be physically superior to just about everyone in the world, but I think I deserve even more. This phone, this program is capable of turning me into a veritable god and I think it's about time I took advantage of that fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki frowned at Jason. She could only pick out a few of his words, her brain was fuzzy. \"I don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't,\" he said. \"I've dropped your IQ through the floor. I've also made me so attractive to you that you'll be fiercely loyal to me and do anything I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded, it was true. She would do anything for him, in fact she was dying for him to order her around. He was the ultimate man, there was no greater and there never would be. She lived only to make him happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c As you can see I\u2019ve made your tits a bit more manageable though still huge, you'll soon notice I\u2019ve made a few additional enhancements I'm sure you'll enjoy.\" His words were followed by a creaking sound coming from behind Nikki. She spun around looking for the source for a moment and did a complete circle like a dog chasing its tail. She stopped and giggled at herself then discovered the noise was coming from her denim shorts. Her rear was expanding causing her shorts to begin to split apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! Neat!\" she said running her hand around her ever expanding bubble butt. \"Still feels nice and hard too!\" She tensed her glutes and watched the split open up wider down the back of her shorts exposing her pink bikini bottoms. \"Grrrr!! I'm like She Hulk!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki noticed that her arms were getting slightly bigger as well. She raised and flexed them watching baseball sized peaks swell beneath her skin. She extended and flexed over and over again mesmerized by the motion of her new muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her body had completed its transformation she was a busty hardbody that could clean up in a fitness competition. Nikki, still hypnotized by her pumped up arms, noticed Jason looking at her. She stopped testing her muscles and put her hands on her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like what you see, baby?\u201d She cocked her hips to one side and gave Jason a look that caused him to feel weak in the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, very much. But your clothes are all ragged. Your shirt is stretched out, I think that\u2019s a torn bikini top in there, and your shorts are ripped. Why don\u2019t you take them off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did as she was told and removed her ruined clothes leaving her clad only her hot pink bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Jason said standing and moving closer to his new toy, \u201chow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki slid her hands up her tight tummy to the enormous swell of her giant boobs. She squeezed them both tightly which sent bolts of intense pleasure through her body. Spurred on by the amazing feeling she began to knead her right boob while tweaking her left nipple; she moaned deeply. \u201cI feel really good.\u201d Without warning an orgasm, brought on just through breast play, exploded within her and she shook where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki waited for her orgasm to pass. Panting she said, \u201cReally, really good.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it you like your new boobs? I wanted to put you in a class above some of my favorites like Denise Milani, Jordan Carver, and Wendy Fiore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki frowned. \u201cAre they girls from school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \u201cNo, baby, they\u2019re models with really big tits. But don\u2019t worry I made yours bigger, your whole body sexier. You\u2019re my favorite now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Then she paused before adding. \u201cI kind of feel drunk, but the love drunk. You know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \u201cI altered your biochemistry a bit, it may take some getting used to. Whenever I\u2019m around you your brain will react by flooding your body with endorphins, dopamine, serotonin, stuff like that. My very presence makes you feel good which makes you addicted to me and also willing to do anything I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what those words mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, like I said earlier I also made you dumber, which might add to the drunk feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe furrowed her brow doing her best to understand what Jason was telling her. The concepts and ideas were flowing so quickly and all the words were so strange that she just couldn't keep up. All she wanted to do was to please Jason, make him feel good. Why were they talking so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled at her struggles. He stepped forward and pinched her cheek. \u201cAw, poor thing\u2019s confused. That\u2019s my little sex toy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he was smiling and she liked the words he was using now Nikki smiled too. \"I think I\u2019m going to like being your sex toy.\u201d She draped her arms over Jason\u2019s shoulders and moved in close smashing her bare boobs against his chest. She lifted herself up on her toes stretching her 5\u2019 8\u201d body to meet his 6\u2019 1\u201d height and planted a rough kiss on his lips. She moved one of her hands to the back of his head and, gripping his hair tightly between her fingers, smashed his face into hers. Their lips parted and Jason slid his tongue into Nikki\u2019s mouth which she sucked with such vigor that for a moment Jason thought she\u2019d rip it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished their kiss and Jason removed himself from her embrace. \u201cAll in good time, baby. First there\u2019s something else I need to do.\u201d He picked up his phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, not that phone again!\u201d Nikki slumped down into Jason\u2019s computer chair and pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \u201cYes, the phone again! You\u2019re going to like this. See, I\u2019ve been looking around in the superpowers categories for things that could be fun. There\u2019s some pretty crazy stuff in there. I even-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to be all super strong like Superman? Or big and buff like The Hulk?\u201d Nikki asked excitedly. She may not have meant to, but one hand was beginning to play with one of her nipples. Jason had learned that much like Laura\u2019s sister, Vanessa, Nikki had a muscle and strength fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said, \u201cunfortunately because my muscles are set to grow at a specific rate for the next 10 months I can\u2019t use any of the powers dealing with size or strength. But don\u2019t worry, before you know it I\u2019ll be massive and there\u2019s lots of other things I can do. I even activated a few powers for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki lit up. \u201cReally? What can I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the way your body is currently shaped is going to make it tough to find clothes that\u2019ll fit so I gave you the ability to create new clothes from your own skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nikki looked disgusted. \u201cMy skin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not describing that well. Just imagine clothes of any type, shape, material, any outfit you want and it will appear on your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!?! Let me try!\u201d She jumped up and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you do you should take off your bikini bottoms, otherwise they\u2019ll be on top of anything you create.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded and slipped out of the remnants of her swimsuit. She closed her eyes again and focused. A pair of black spandex shorts and a black tank top appeared on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and leapt into the air with excitement. \u201cI wanted to start with something easy, and it was even easier than I expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven though I made your mind simple you still know a lot about clothes and your power works closely with this knowledge. Those clothes are now real so if you try to make another outfit it\u2019ll appear beneath what you\u2019re wearing, so you may want to strip down before trying again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki quickly whipped her shirt off over her head. As soon as she dropped it the tank top vanished before it even hit the floor. \u201cWow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, as soon as you\u2019re no longer touching them they disappear. That way you can make as much as you want and we don\u2019t get overloaded with clutter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed and pulled off her shorts which dissolved once she stepped out of them. She ran over to a mirror on Jason\u2019s wall and raised her arms over her head. A moment later she was wearing an exquisite green silk evening gown with a plunging neckline that framed her awesome cleavage and a slit that ran all the way to her round hip. She even created a pair of matching stiletto heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is like the best superpower ever!\u201d Nikki said spinning around to let Jason see her creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled and shook his head. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. There are a lot of very exciting things I\u2019m going to try out. They\u2019re really powerful so I need to be careful and just add them one at a time.\u201d He looked back at his phone and made one last tap to confirm his changes. \u201cFirst up I\u2019m trying out\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just when Laura pressen enter, Jason felt a jolt go threw his body, but waved it off as a spaz attack because he stayed still to long. Jason was in his room writing in his journal about everything he wished for, but didn't have, and at what he hoped to get done. It wa a strange coincident that he felt the jolt when he wrote down that he wished to be bigger than Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Greg was doing that, Laura went to the gym to work out. However, she stopped by Jason's to see if he would come with her. He said no because he was more of a book person. Laura thought \"Not for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month, Jason was getting worried. He has never worked out a day in his life, yet his muscle were bigger and more defined. Hes gained 11lbs this month bring him to a solid 154. You look at your self in the mirror, and saw a small bumps form all over your body. You could see a faint 6pack on your stomach. You didn't wasnt to say anything to arouse suspiction, so you just stayed quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a total of six months, you were getting big. You biceps which were non existent popped out of nowhere. You grew faster than enyone thought possible. You now weighed in at 209 lbs. You couldn't believe yourself. You only avoided questioning by your parents by telling them that you started to work out after school, but you really didnt. All you did was stay outside and walk around. In school, you put on really baggy cloths to hide your growth, so no one noticed. That was becoming more difficult by the end of the month. Your muscles started to actually make your baggy cloths not baggy, but actuallu fit nice and snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another month and a half, you were as big as Greg. You were so happy, but you wanted to see what would happen next. In these seven and a half months, your penis had also grown considerable. It was now a 15in python carrying a grapefruits for balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFianlly, the twelve months had past, and you were a wopping 275lbs. 50lbs heavier than Greg, and you were also 4inches taller than him. Makeing you a 6ft 6in muscle beast. One day, you friend Laura came up to you and said \"Did you like your growth?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \"You noticed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura \"I made it happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura \"I Made you grow bigger\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \"Prove it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before she decided on the pace of the muscle growth, she looked back at the density tab.  The default was set at 1.  Checking out the question mark, a pop up indicated that density was related to strength, each number was a multiplier.  So with the muscles cranked up to the current levels she would already likely be stronger than anyone, but not necessarily.  Moving it to 2 would make her twice as strong and ensure her dominance.  But was that enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her chin and smiling at the prospects, Laura slowly started to move the slider to the right, imagining where this would take her.  Her image didn\u2019t change, or at least the overall muscle size didn\u2019t change, but the muscles looked\u2026.  Better?  Harder?  More defined too she guessed.  Her arms moved away from her sides and her muscle breasts pushed upward and outward as if they were\u2026  Weightless?  As the density passed 20 another pop up indicated that she was effectively bulletproof.  Moaning with pleasure, Laura continued to move the slider upward, realizing that this would cause her to grow super humanly strong.  She would be able to bend steel bars with ease, laugh at missiles exploding harmlessly against her raging, female muscle loaded body, and toss tanks around like they were ping pong balls.  Laura\u2019s eyes almost rolled in the back of her head at the prospects.  Stopping at 5000, Laura let out a breath and laughed slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God.  If this is real then I\u2019ll become a super girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her image she shook her head.  \u201cI\u2019ll be the most muscular, strongest girl ever.  Stronger than any man.  And definitely bigger and stronger than Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling and looking out the window, Laura wondered what she would do first if she hit the Apply button and all of this became real.  She could see Greg talking to a pretty girl and Vanessa had a guy fawning over him.  A large SUV was parked near the door, Greg\u2019s birthday gift from a year ago.  Some construction material and a large earth mover were next door since the neighbors were starting a renovation project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and holding the phone, Laura stared at the image again and the glowing Apply button.  Wondering how she wanted to play it out, Laura came up with a plan.  Slipping off her wet bottoms, she quickly put on a pink bikini bottom she had wore only once when she tried it on at the store.  Using the Velcro strip that came with the phone, Laura placed it on the side and put the phone holder onto her hip.  Setting the time for a steady, but not quite immediate transformation, Laura headed to the kitchen and grabbed an energy drink, pulling off the label.  She knew the story she was putting together in her head wasn\u2019t any more believable than the phone app, but this would take the attention away from the real source and not allow anyone to figure things out.  Pulling the top off the drink, she lightly placed it back on and let out a nervous smile.  The idea that this could all be real was making her weak in the knees.  With her thoughts now clarified, Laura decided to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gathering her wits, Laura walked out the door with the phone in one hand and the drink in the other and headed toward her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching Greg first she saddled up near him so he could see her without having to take his eyes off the girl he was talking to.  The girl was very pretty at about 5 foot 9 with long blonde hair and tight curves stuffed into a barely there bikini.  She wasn\u2019t quite up to Vanessa\u2019s levels, but she was still very pretty and well built.  Greg was tensing his chest up and down and the girl was giggling.  Laura sniffed at Greg\u2019s display, which finally caught Greg\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there squirt, I didn\u2019t expect to see you out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cringed.  She hated it when he did that.  He was normally OK when it was just the family, but when he around his friends, or worse yet, a girl he trying to impress, he acted all full of male testosterones.  The squirt comment would only be the beginning normally.  But now feeling confident in what was about to happen, Laura changed her frown to a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I figured to come outside for a while anyway.  You know, get some sun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled and pulling in his stomach and puffing out his large chest, he glanced over toward the pretty girl he was hitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Stephanie.  She goes to the local college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at her and meeting her eyes, nodded her head.  She looked back at Greg, pulling in a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t want to interrupt you two, but I wanted to let you know that I picked up a new sports drink the other day.  It promised enhanced growth.  Seeing as I\u2019m a squirt and all, I figured to give it a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was already back looking at Stephanie and barely acknowledging Laura, nodded his head absently.  \u201cSure.  You could use a little muscle tone.  Well, you could use any muscle tone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie giggled as Greg stretched his arm out in a fake yawn to bring his biceps bulging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned again and with a quick tug on the bottle, pulled the top off and took a long drink.  With her other hand she hit the Apply button and slipped the phone into the case.  Taking another long drink she placed the empty bottle down and let out a small burp.  Looking back at Greg and Stephanie she felt a strange sensation run through her body and within moments felt her muscles tighten.  Bringing her arms to her sides, she let out an excited yelp as her muscles began to expand across her frame slowly, soon filling out her body, covering her bones and pushing up against her green shirt.  Within moments her body looked as good as Stephanie, but that was just a speed bump.  Laura could barely contain her excitement and whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s working.  I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s working!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles continued to surge forward and the first stress on her top around her shoulders caused the fabric to groan, pulling Greg and Stephanie\u2019s attention back to her.  Greg looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, are you OK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to yell out with ecstasy, Laura smiled nervously.  \u201cMust be that drink.  It appears to be having a positive effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now her chest was also pressing hard against her shirt and the top rose up higher to expose her now evident 6 pack abs.  Laura stood on her toes, feeling the tingling in her calves push the muscles outward toward the size of softballs.  Her thighs quickly morphed as big as any college gymnast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled at Greg\u2019s slowly changing expression as her muscles continued to grow bigger, harder, and stronger.  Bringing her arms out to the sides and tensing gently, her forearms pushed out strange ropes of muscle and her triceps built up more and more muscle toward her armpits and even her stretched out biceps could be seen to have added considerable mass.  Her shirt pulled away from her arms as her back, shoulders, chest and traps grew larger.  Letting out a satisfied sigh, Laura now felt that the app was not only working, but would bring her up to the levels she chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck that, this drink is having an extraordinary effect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her arms up slowly, Laura felt the tingling sensation grow stronger and felt a building warmth throughout her muscles and specifically in her tensed biceps.  Her arms were now larger than baseballs and rising significantly as she pulled her widening forearms upward.  The rest of her body was growing well passed light weight female bodybuilder and was cruising passed middleweight status as the threads ripped and the top split along her shoulders and down the center toward her growing and thickening cleavage.  Her legs continued to add inches and pounds of curvy, female muscle, while her midsection remained narrow, but continued to grow more defined as new muscles rose to the surface.  Greg was now worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, are you sure you feel OK?  You look like you\u2019re swelling up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura snickered as she pulled her ever thickening forearms up to vertical and squeezed her fists, causing her biceps to leap upward, exceeding softball sizes masses of girl muscle.  Her top ripped in several areas and fell to the sand as her upper torso was now covered with insane muscles to put the largest female bodybuilders to shame.  Her muscular chest pushed forward and her nipples pointed straight ahead like twin thimbles.  Previously, her nudity would have mortified her, but now she barely cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m feeling OK Greg.  I\u2019m feeling really OK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body continued to grow more massive, the muscles hardened, growing denser and denser, giving her entire body a look of strength and vigor.  She pulled her forearms down a bit and brought them back up, emphasizing her growing musculature by flexing bigger biceps, which were now 20 inches around, nearly rivaling Greg\u2019s large arms.  Laura looked at Greg and over at Stephanie, who stood there equally stunned, but curious and a bit jealous as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Greg, why don\u2019t you flex up your bicep and have Stephanie give it a feel.  Then she can come over here and give mine a feel.  You know, to compare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was nearly frozen, but when Stephanie reached out to touch Greg\u2019s arm, he shook his head out of his trance.  Stephanie smiled at him and helped him pull his forearm up.  Greg gave her a quizzical look, but once Stephanie reached her slender hands to rub around his upper arm, Greg instinctively flexed down and balled his mighty bicep up into a 22 inch flex.  Stephanie giggled and rubbed the big strong manly muscle before letting her fingers slowly run down the sides and off his arm.  She had enjoyed that a lot.  Greg blinked at her as if unsure as to why she would stop, but once Stephanie turned and started walking toward Laura, the reality of the situation came crashing back.  Laura was now huge!  And worse yet, her muscles were STILL growing larger.  As Stephanie neared his massive, nearly naked younger sister she flexed her right arm up and placed her left hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that you\u2019ve felt Greg\u2019s bicep, let me know what you think of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was back on her toes, blasting ever increasing mounds of muscle into her legs.  Her inner thighs were now almost touching as her quads were radiating power with clean separation, bulging, rippling musculature and death defying sweeps and curves.  Her calves continued to pound bigger, distended out larger than cantaloupes at well over 25 inches around.  Her pink bikini bottoms were being sucked into her bulbous, mega muscles glutes, while her midsection was an incredible array of muscle plates and deep grooves across her midsection and multiple pebble obliques that pushed out to her fantastically wide back that now spread out to three feet wide.  Her pectorals continued to stack striated slabs of muscle ever forward, pushing out to her chin with her gravity defying, equally striated muscular breasts sticking out another nine inches.  Her brown hair now draped on either side of her football sized shoulders and looked shiny and full of body, an effect she hadn\u2019t even intended.  Her entire body screamed muscle.  She was already bigger than her brother.  And yet her muscles continued their slow increase in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was dumbfounded, muttering \u201cThis is impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Vanessa had heard the commotion and had walked over to see what was going on.  She stared on with equal awe, fascinated and unsure of what was happening.  Holding her own phone, she got a text and glancing down saw a message from the application store stating that someone she knew just downloaded a new and exciting app.  Shaking her head, Vanessa was thinking that Laura was more important than some silly app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo all Laura continued to change, \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Stephanie reached Laura, she had to pause.  This monster muscle girl was shorter than she was.  Yet she was displaying more muscle than any person she had ever seen.  Stephanie was drawn to the power, the confidence and the muscles.  Stephanie had always like big, strong muscles.  She just had never imagined that she would meet a girl that met her base desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as she looked down into Laura\u2019s smiling eyes with wonder and watched the incredible bicep flex up into a mountain of she muscle, Stephanie practically panted as she reached out to touch the rising peak.  Tentatively placing her fingers on the upper bicep Stephanie brought both hands into play as Laura tensed harder, infusing an extra two inches of pure muscle into her upper arm.  Stephanie\u2019s hands jerked slightly and she let out a surprised \u201cOh\u201d.  Laura giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Stephanie.  What do you think?  Are my biceps bigger than Greg\u2019s over there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie, wide eyed and enamored, simply nodded her head as she continued to probe Laura\u2019s arm.  Another hard squeeze by Laura shot her bicep up even higher, pushing her forearm away from her now monumental 30 inch bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear that Greg?  Your little sister is flexing up a bicep bigger than yours.  Bet you never thought you\u2019d see that happen, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg didn\u2019t even nod his head as he stared on with disbelief.  Laura grunted lightly and looked at her ever growing bicep.  \u201cGo ahead and try and squeeze it Stephanie.  See if you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura\u2019s muscles continued to grow in size and strength, blasting forth more muscular than the biggest of bodybuilding men, Stephanie tried to squeeze down.  But when her initial attempt failed, Stephanie tried with all of her strength, but was unable to press into Laura\u2019s muscle at all.  Stephanie\u2019s face turned red from the effort and she let out a defeated sigh as she pulled her hands away and stepped back, staring with awe and a bit of lust at the power Laura clearly had.  Laura smiled and flexed up her bicep again, this time up to 40 impossible inches around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty hard, huh?  Like, oh, I don\u2019t know.  Steel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie nodded and as Laura looked toward Greg she narrowed her eyes to a more dominating stare as the color escaped his face.  Laura snickered and bringing her arms down in front of her, flexed her chest, pulling her massive pectoral slabs up and down, causing her chest to put on a show that put Greg\u2019s to shame.  Standing back up, Laura pulled her arms up into another double bicep pose.  The incredible growth was nearing an end and her strength was now out of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up on her toes for a final flex, Laura\u2019s 5 foot 4 inch height seemed even shorter, as her enormous muscles had piled up onto her slim frame like massive rocks, pressing out in every direction in defiance of normal human anatomy.  Her feet were the same size they always were, which made the curve to her volleyball sized calves even more incredible.  And those pink balls of power curved into the same narrow knees that were practically engulfed by her beyond massive quads.  Her thighs were deeply separated, thick as a bag of water softener salt and two incredibly feet wide each.  These huge pillars of female muscle dramatically curved into a stomach that was now even narrower than her former 30 inch flabby midsection, but was covered completely with muscle blocks to put any man or woman to shame.  Her incredible abs whipped back out to an insanely wide back now flexed to nearly four feet wide, while her equally massive chest pumped up with twin basketball sized jagged pectorals that bristled with impossible strength and hardness.  Smiling as she flexed up her biceps into two female mountains of fury, her triceps dipped low into her lats and her biceps exploded upward, bigger than her head, rising up to touch her fists!  Laura was now simply the most muscular person to ever have lived.  She was an 18 year old super girl.  And she loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Greg, what do think of your sister now?  Not so puny anymore, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, Stephanie and many onlookers nearly swallowed their teeth.  Laura laughed and releasing her flex looked around.  Vanessa was in the crowd to, holding her own phone and looked less shocked than everybody else.  Laura grunted nervously and smiled at Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Greg and Stephanie, Laura shook off her concerns.  She had a captive audience and was unsure as to what to do next.  Thinking quickly, Laura decided to.</span></div></div>",

She thought about her tall sister and the gorgeous long-legged girls she admired on Sports Illustrated\u2026 how about some height as well, she thought. That would certainly be nice, she didn\u2019t want to put on so much muscle on her 5\u20194\u201d frame and look like a stocky little freak. She wanted to stand high above everyone else, she wanted control and respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards the small icon with a human figure and an arrow symbol pointing upwards next to it. \u201cThat must be it\u201d she thought as she tapped into that part of the menu. She carefully tuned the model to make herself 5\u20198\u201d then 5\u201910\u201d and then even bigger over 6 feet. However, Laura suddenly noticed that the representation of her started to look slimmer as it distributed her 355 lbs weight over a taller frame \u2013 she didn\u2019t want that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost scolded herself when she located an option which read \u2018Scale weight with height\u2019 for not seeing it earlier. Without hesitation, she checked the box next to the option and continued increasing her height, which was now accompanied with a proportional increase in weight to maintain the same desired muscle mass she originally had with the 5\u20194\u201d and 355 lbs pairing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura made herself to be a solid 8 feet tall and 798 lbs of huge thick muscles. Yeah, that was more like it\u2026 Laura\u2019s panties got even wetter at the sight of what her new body would turn out to be. She certainly had thought of the consequences and did wonder what would happen if she were to walk around in public in that form, but she decided to go ahead with the change anyway just to experience what it felt like to be huge. She was certain that no clothes in the world would fit her tall, ripped, gigantic body so she would probably linger around in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Laura hit the Apply button and was shocked as the app made her\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would have taken about twenty seconds to scroll down to the bottom of the list, but Laura never got that far before a feature caught her eye and made her pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many bizarre alteration on the list, all as impossible-sounding as the others, but \"Shrink/Grow\" just seemed too farfetched. It was one thing to change one's body, through medical miracles or other methods, but another to change one's size. In fact, Laura was almost certain it was impossibly by her own knowledge of physics, since the atomic structure of a person's body could never stand to be consolidated, at least not as quickly as this feature boasted: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow taller than a telephone pole or learn what a day's like in the life of a paramecium. The choices is yours.\" Oddly worded for a pitch, but it got the point across for her. The concepts were well documented in media, even some she enjoyed. It wouldn't be something that hadn't already crossed her mind before, after all. Size change was probably something that crossed a person's mind at least once in a lifetime, whether it be a wish to be shorter or taller, or just how insane it would be to explore the world from a different vantage point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's finger hovered over the \"Grow/Shrink\" button as she pondered this decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A heady nausea came as the second pulse hit her. Laura began to regret the whole thing and dreaded another wave of growth. The third wave of growth hit her with the same dizziness, except this one made her feel kind of good. Sort of like a nice buzz from wine. After laying in her bed anticipating another wave of growth for a minute, Laura stood up feeling hot all over. She turned to her mirror to see that she was covered in sweat and had grown a fair amount. <br>\r\n\"Jesus, I must be 6ft tall now.\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\nEntranced by the person in the mirror, Laura started shifting positions to check herself out from all angles. Besides her increase in height, she pretty much looked the same. The height definitely made her look better, she decided, but she hadn't filled out any. The more she looked at herself, the more turned on she started to get. Subconsciously, Laura\u2019s hands began moving up and down her side. Almost completely mesmerized by herself, she remembered the app. She pried her eyes away from her body to look at the phone she had dropped on her bed. It then dawned on her, she no longer had to take any shit from Vanessa, her self esteem, or anyone ever again. She could have anything or anyone she wanted. <br>\r\nLaura darted to her phone and opened up her profile in the app. She knew she wanted to change herself right now. But how?

Her body was on fire and she was near ready to vomit. Her body pulsed skyward as her tits plumped outward like semi-firm water balloons. The next thing she knew she was face down ass up, groping herself with one hand and pleasuring herself with the other. \u201cOh god,\u201d she whimpered as her body shook with growth. She began to moan absent-minded, overcome with the pain and pleasure. It felt like burning, cosmic rays graced her hips, thighs, and ass as they thickened, developing faster than the rest of her body. Laura was nearly drooling from the pleasure. In that moment she didn\u2019t have to worry about anything, all she needed to do was grow bigger and sexier. Her breasts were beginning to raise her torso off the ground like two supple, watermelon sized pillows. As the final pulse of the growth slowed to a stop, Laura regained composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up in the room proved difficult with her current size. After hip checking her desk and knocking over a couple cabinets, Laura turned to the mirror to see her full beauty. Unfortunately, Laura couldn\u2019t get a full look at herself with the room and mirror being so small. But what Laura was able to see was divine. She pulled out her phone to snap a selfie, which proved to be difficult with her phone being so small. Then it hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, if I keep growing like this I won\u2019t be able to use the app.\u201d Laura thought about what to do.

Even though she had hardly any size in her boobs, the bikini looked just about right enough to make her look pretty sexy. Then Laura packed some things and went onto the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a good spot to sit and placed a blanket on the sand. She looked around for someone to grow when she noticed two teenagers sitting together, who both looked to be about 15 or so. There was a teenage boy with dirty blonde hair who was taller than her, standing at almost 6 feet tall, but he was pretty scrawny. Laura estimated that he probably weighed more than herself, but the weight was spread a little thin over his tall body. Laura's eyes then moved down to the boy's green swimming trunks and noticed a fairly sizable bulge. Laura laughed at the thought that this young boy had a bigger cock than her brother, Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Laura looked at his girlfriend, standing next to him.

She quickly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Linda awoke, she noticed that she was in a bed still wearing her green bikini. She then realized she was in her room, except... something was different. She got up and noticed that something felt... different about herself. She walked over to her mirror and was shocked to see she was bigger than before. She was 5'9\", and had an extremely fit body. Her six-pack abs were easily seen, and she flexed her bicep to find it only slightly smaller than a baseball. Her breasts were now bigger than before, almost as big as her head. She then looked around her room, and found a picture of her and Matt. She saw her new body standing, but Matt was crouching so they could be at the same height. It was as if Matt had his new size his whole life. Linda squinted at the picture, and noticed a skyscraper in the background, with the words \"Meteor Labs\" in front of it. Linda was curious about the skyscraper, but then she went over to her window, and saw that the ocean was far below her. She must be in that skyscraper now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda turned on the TV, hoping to get some information. There was a documentary on Meteor Labs and Matt on, so Linda kept watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only three years ago when young teenager Matt,\" started some narrator, with a picture of a normal sized Matt when he was 12, \"when he found a strange green meteor in his backyard. Little did he know that there would be big changes coming to his life, literally.\" There were more pictures. Matt at school, taller than everyone else. Matt at the beach, wearing swimming trunks a tad bit too small. Matt towering over his father at the founding of Meteor Labs.<br>\r\n\"The meteor's radiation caused the boy to grow, and his father started a company to research it, called Meteor Labs. The company is now the richest in the world, gaining money from news coverage and fundraisers and what not. The company found out that the meteor's radiation has a great effect on boys (just look at Matt's size!) but a decreased effect on girls. Matt's girlfriend, Ms. Linda Tyla, offered herself up to testing, but got somewhat unsatisfactory results.\"<br>\r\nLinda was amazed as a lab assistant opened the door.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Tyla, Matt and Dr. Anderson would like to see you now.\"<br>\r\nLinda shrugged and followed the assistant to a lab where Matt and his father were waiting.<br>\r\nMatt's father started to talk.<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are, Linda, as beautiful as ever! We were just about to start an experiment that could cause Matt to grow even bigger!\"<br>\r\nMatt leaned down and whispered something in his father's ears. His father nodded and left the room with the assistants.<br>\r\nMatt came over to Linda and started talking.<br>\r\n\"I know this sounds crazy, but I haven't been this way for a while! Somehow, history just changed!\" said Matt, worried.<br>\r\nLinda looked at him and realized he must've kept his memory as well.<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean. We were just on the beach when you grew, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exactly! I don't know if I want to do this experiment, though...\"<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay. Besides, if it makes you grow stronger, I'll love you even more!\"<br>\r\nMatt smiled as his father came back in the room.<br>\r\nDr. Anderson attached Matt to a machine that was connected to a container holding a strange meteor. Dr. Anderson then flipped a switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: If the experiment goes as planned, Matt will start growing at the rate Laura accidentally set him up on)</span></div></div>",

Linda noticed that it was made of metal, probably to accommodate Matt's weight.<br>\r\n\"You know, Linda, I just want to say that I'll love you forever.\" said Matt.<br>\r\n\"Same here!\" said Linda.<br>\r\nThey talked for a bit, but Matt was kind of aroused by Linda's new body, so he started to get an erection that was visible through his swimming trunks. Linda noticed, and grabbed it, rubbing it a little. But before she could do any more, Matt started to glow. He grew a little, and Linda could see some definition in his muscles now. A six-pack started to form, and his pecs were showing some definition. Matt grunted a little as his swimming trunks tightened on him, tearing a little at his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked at her now 8'6\" tall, 245 lb. boyfriend with a 15 inch member. Just then, an assistant came in.<br>\r\n\"Mr. Anderson and Ms. Tyla, there is a visitor to see you. An 18 year old named Laura Friedman. I suggest you ignore her. She was wearing nothing but a blue bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda thought for a moment why someone would do that, but then she remembered something before the change:<br>\r\nThere was a girl in a blue bikini who did something on her phone before looking at Matt, right before Matt grew. She would probably have the answer to all this!<br>\r\n\"Matt, we should go. This girl might have answers.\" said Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then left the room.</span></div></div>",

They were getting close when Matt. glowed again and began growing. This time, the combined growth of his legs and his cock were too much for his swimming trunks, so they snapped off. Matt's face turned red with embarrassment, as the two girls looked at the now nude 8'10\", 265 lb. giant with a gigantic 17 inch rod. Matt's head was starting to get close to the ten foot tall ceiling.

I'm sure I have something to fit you there.\" she said.<br>\r\nMatt rushed into her room and just grabbed the sheets off her bed, wrapping them around his body.

Her breasts were about the size of basketballs. But then she noticed Matt was receiving a similar growth spurt, only more powerful since he received a more powerful dose and he was male.

That much radiation focused on her boyfriend could have... unwanted side effects. She and Matt were too young to go through something like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt soon started to grow, and the sheets on him started to tighten on him, and started to tear. There was a massive rip revealing a chest and eight-pack that would make any bodybuilder jealous. The \"sleeves\" of the sheets started to disintegrate around Matt's huge biceps, which were getting to be bigger than basketballs. The sheet ripped around his legs, and soon it looked like he was wearing a speedo made of bed sheets. But soon that gave way to Matt's cock, and Matt continued to grow as the meteor got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he reached close to 20 feet tall, and large groans could be heard.<br>\r\n\"Oh no! This structure wasn't meant to hold something as big as Matt! If we can't get him to the ground soon enough, the tower will collapse on itself!\" yelled Dr. Anderson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt continued to grow, reaching 30 feet tall, so big that his cock was bigger than Laura was! He kept growing, so he decided to jump off the top. He did, and then Matt was in free fall. Before he hit the ground he straightened himself, and he landed with a small quake. People all around were amazed at the ginormous teenager, who was still growing. Soon he passed the height of several buildings, reaching 50 ft tall. And he still grew, to about 100 ft tall. Just then, a massive shadow fell over the city, and the meteor was about to hit. Right before it hit, Matt caught it, but was nearly crushed. Matt couldn't keep this up much longer. But then he started to grow again, being in such close proximity to the meteor. Soon he was almost as tall as the skyscraper he was just on, with a cock bigger than some small buildings. With a huge effort, he shoved the meteor away back into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

In the end she wanted to experiment with the phone some more before taking such a big leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent several minutes excitedly scanning the various options on the 'More' tab. Everything sounded to incredible she hardly knew where to start. At last she narrowed down her selections to two that she thought could make for a good test. There was a selection that was simply called 'Superhuman Abilities.' Clearly no matter what was listed there would be awesome and Laura had dreamed of having superpowers since she was old enough to read comics. The other choice that caught her eye was called 'Historical Adjustments.' This one intrigued her because it sounded like she could actually alter her past so that she was in a better place. Perhaps she could rewrite an entirely new and happier life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking over her two choices Laura noticed another button at the top of the screen next to her own name that read 'Create New Profile.'

It was well past midnight and he'd been trying to fall asleep for a while but his mind was overrun with thoughts and none of them were making him feel all that good. He'd spend most of the day playing video games hoping that Laura would call him so they could hang out. As the afternoon wore on and it was obvious that she had other things to do Jason got bored of his games and began watching the world outside his window, which was a mistake. His room faced the beach with the ocean beyond which should have been a lovely view but unfortunately this town was overrun with the most beautiful people in the world which just made Jason sad that he wasn't one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodybuilding community where he lived was huge (both in number and physical size) and Jason could see dozens of musclebound hunks with glistening, oiled bodies flexing for packs of busty bikini clad blonde bimbos. It was unreal to watch, and terribly disheartening for someone as sickly skinny as he was, as girls fawned all over the men whom they outnumbered at a 10 to 1 ratio. Even if he were somewhat desirable he could work with those numbers, heck the attention of just one attractive woman was all he really wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead he just watched. He watched as one particularly large man offered his bare chest to a gaggle of girls and they hungrily pawed at it, feeling his pecs. Jason watched as a group of athletic ladies struck up a game of volleyball; their firm butts and thighs worked as they ran around the sand while their generous busts bounced with every jump and move. As the sun set and a group of college kids set up a bonfire party with kegs of beer and music blasting through a stereo system Jason watched pairs and trios, and even a few quartets, break off and begin making out and feeling each other up in the waining light of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he had given up on watching people more fortunate this he was and had plopped down into bed but sleep had not come. All he could think about was the life he would never have. This was one of the closest bonds that he and Laura had formed over the years. Yes they had similar nerdy tastes and very similar senses of humor but both of them understood the pain of an awkward body because both of them had siblings that were absolutely gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Laura would argue over who had it worse. Laura would point out that she had not one but two siblings who'd won the genetic lottery in Vanessa and Greg while Jason would counter that his sister was both a knockout much like Vanessa and a jock like Greg <i>and</i> Jason's twin to boot which to him meant that he should have also been able to reap the benefits that Jasmine had received. In the end both Laura and Jason agreed that their lives sucked and were not likely going to get any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly two hours of tossing and turning Jason sighed then reached across the bed and turned on the reading light on his night stand. He then reached under the bed and pulled out a small stack of well worn comic books featuring his favorite ladies. There were a few Wonder Woman books, a Gen 13, a Supergirl or two, several She Hulks and a handful of others. Jason pulled out an issue of Power Girl and flipped through the pages until he found an image of a particularly buff version of Power Girl hefting a boat over her head. Jason pulled down his shorts and held his swelling member in his hand. His penis was the only physical attribute of his that could be considered impressive. Even his 10 inch cock made him a bit sad, though, since despite it's grand size he knew that with the rest of his body he'd never get close enough to a girl to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason mechanically went through the motions of masturbating while he ran his eyes over the busty super heroine. After several minutes of pumping Jason came, then he cleaned himself up and lay down with the comic still in hand. He studied the page as he had so many times before taking in the swell of Power Girl's biceps, the thickness of her flexed thighs and the generous cleavage visible through the open hole in the front of her costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed again as he began to relax at last and drifted off to sleep, the book clutched tightly in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was faint pale light coming in through Jason's window which was strange. He was pretty sure he had closed his blinds the previous evening when he'd gotten fed up with the bonfire party outside. He forced his eyes to open and saw that his blinds were indeed open. Even more strange there seemed to be someone standing near the window, he could just make out their silhouette. It was a woman, that much was clear, which led him to believe that it was his sister Jasmine picking on him about something. As his mind cleared, however, he realized that it couldn't be Jazz since this mystery woman had short cropped blonde hair while his sister had long black hair. The sudden realization that a stranger was in his room shocked him awake and he sat straight up in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sleepyhead.\" The stranger said. She spoke with a sultry yet melodious voice that caused his loins to stir and made the hair on his arms stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's eyes cleared further and he found himself staring at the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen in his life. Her golden hair curled under her hard jawline which gave way to chiseled cheekbones. Her eyes were lightning blue yet somehow warm and comforting set just above a petite nose. Her ruby lips were plump and parted in a smile that turned Jason's bones to jelly; had he been standing her smile would have left him in a pile on the floor to say nothing of the ridiculous curves of her body. Below her face was a body unlike any Jason had ever seen: long powerful legs with juicy quads, broad shoulders and arms with biceps that bulged even when relaxed. Round hips and a trim tummy with chiseled abdominals just below a pair of huge breasts that squeezed out of her top putting insane amounts of cleavage on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer top... there was something strange about her top... Jason shook his head still trying to clear the cobwebs, it must have been early in the morning because he rarely had this much trouble waking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stood a good 6 feet tall, perhaps a little more, but some of her height came from her boots which had a stiletto heel several inches long. Her boots were familiar, Jason realized. They were made of blue leather and reached most of the way to her knee where they then folded back down again much like a pirate's boots. By the time Jason realized that the woman wore matching blue leather gloves he started to put the pieces together regarding the identity of the woman before him, though his addled brain wouldn't accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a skintight white costume that was cut like a bathing suit around her hips but long down her arms ending somewhere under the gloves. The material was so thin Jason could make out every swell, valley, cut and ridge of her muscled frame. A hole was cut above her bust showing off the tops of her creamy G cup breasts. She wore a red belt with a gold buckle which hung loose around her slender waist at an angle while a gold medallion with matching gold rope held a red cape which flowed over her left shoulder and hung down to meet her rear. It was Power Girl, straight from the pages of his comic book now before him in the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" she asked cocking her hip to one side and flexing a baseball sized bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mind was broken but he was just able to spit out a single word: \"HOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, do you like it?\" Power Girl lifted off the ground and spun in circles showing off her body from every angle, then she stopped and slowly returned to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, the sound filled Jason with warmth. \"Who do I look like, silly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not possible. Power Girl.. that is, you aren't real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you, I'm very real.\" She took a few steps toward his bed swaying her hips seductively. When she reached the edge of his mattress she climbed on and crawled on all fours slowly towards where Jason sat. \"But you're right, I'm not really her. I know she's your favorite, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who are you?\" Jason was trying his hardest to maintain eye contact and not stare at the cantaloupe sized breasts that were practically spilling out of her costume and begging for his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystery woman grinned then her face quickly changed from the gorgeous Kara Zor-L's to one that was more plain but familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LAURA?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's face changed back and she winked. \"I found something amazing and it gave me superpowers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was breathing heavily. \"You... I... what.. what powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \"You know how you always complain that Superman is boring because he has too many powers and can do almost anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have even more powers than him.\" She sat up so she was on her knees on his bed. \"And you and I are going to have some fun putting them to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began to hear the sound of latex stretching. Then he noticed that Laura's breasts were pressing together more and more in the cleavage window of her costume. More flesh began to spill out and the material of her suit began to groan as her boobs grew in size. Finally her top could take no more and split open between her engorged tits which burst out and kept right on growing until they were each the size of watermelons. Laura cupped one gigantic breast in her hand and pinched her nipple while she raised her free arm and flexed. The baseball sized bicep returned but then hardened even larger than before. She extended her arm then flexed again, this time her muscle grew to the size of a softball. Relaxing again then flexing with a loud grunt Laura's arm exploded outward in all directions bursting through her sleeve from shoulder to wrist. The enormous limb was nearly 30 inches in circumference and she kissed the hardened peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to have some fun?\" she asked with grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I still don't understand how this is even possible,\" Jason said to Laura in her incredibly busty Power Girl body. \"How did this happen to you? Were you hit by a meteor or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head. \"Let's not worry about that for now. I'll explain everything later and, if you're a good little boy, I'll even share.\" She relaxed her pumped up arm and Jason watched it reduce in size until it matched her other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, you're in control of who gets these powers, are you?</i> Jason thought. Then Laura moved in closer to him and touched her long, slender fingers to his bare chest and all thoughts left his mind while goosebumps broke out across his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason swallowed deeply. \"So..... what sorts of things can you.. um.. do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out an excited squeal then her entire body lifted off of the bed and into the air above it. As she drifted backward she extended her legs down and and hovered a few feet above the floor as naturally as one would stand. \"I thought you'd never ask. Well, as you can see I can fly; and let me tell you it feels every bit as amazing as it looks.\" She spun a quick circle and set herself gracefully on the floor then did a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she continued, \"I'm super strong, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How strong?\" Jason asked giddily. Super strength and huge muscles were his fantasy so to be standing in the presence of someone with superhuman strength was a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's amazing smile grew wide. \"I'll be honest, I don't know exactly how much I'm able to lift, you know, in tons or anything. But I'm fairly sure I could put a tank in orbit without trying too hard. You and I will have to find somewhere I can take my strength for a spin and see what my limits are.\" She could see how excited her talk was making Jason so she added, \"If I have any, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason realized that he was holding his breath and let the air out of his lungs with a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Along with flight and super strength I gave myself the rest of the Superman package so I have super speed,\" to demonstrate her body became momentarily blurry and when she became clear again she was standing a few inches to the right and holding a beer from the downstairs refrigerator which she handed to Jason. \"I've got super hearing and sight, plus heat and x-ray vision.\" Laura's eyes turned from blue to all white and she tilted her head down. \"And by the way you have a very large penis. How come I never knew that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, embarrassed, covered his erection with his hands. He realized how fruitless such an effort was and removed them, but not before giving Laura a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I like it.\" she purred. \"Ok, what else. Oh! I can phase through matter at will.\" Now she took a step forward and actually passed through his bed so that her thighs were sprouting out of the top of the mattress. She continued walking through and came out the other side. \"And you've seen that I can change the shape and look of my body at will; that one is really fun because I can do anything.\" Laura's body stretched taller and taller very quickly until she was over 9 feet tall and her head was touching the ceiling, then she shrunk down to a petite 5 feet with the same watermelon sized boobs hanging from her chest. Her hair lengthened and began changing color rapidly going through the entire rainbow before settling on jet black. \"And I can be anyone I want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's hair continued to lengthen down her sides while the top puffed up into a beehive, her skin became strikingly fair and her breasts shrank down to mere D cup while a black dress with a plunging neckline and long slit covered her body. Jason could see that her legs were covered with black stalkings and she now wore black pumps. Laura was the spitting image of Elvira right before him. Then she grew a few inches taller and her dress turned into a leather catsuit that was unzipped down to her abs. Her hair became auburn and wavy her breasts plumped slightly. Now she looked exactly like Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, I can take this even farther into fantasy if you want.\" Now Laura's height shot back up beyond the 6 foot mark to nearly 6' 5\", most of her new height coming from her legs alone. The leather catsuit turned back into a dress but this one red and dazzlingly sequined. Laura's red hair filled out and became several dozen shades brighter then her skin took on a color that was almost plastic looking while her breasts swelled greatly. Before Jason could figure out what was going on he was face to face with Jessica Rabbit, and not a human version but an actual living cartoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura put her hands on her waist and cocked her hips to one side. The slit of her dress opened all the way up one sumptuous thigh which she stuck out for added effect. \"Haven't you dreamed of getting your hands on this body since you were a kid?\" Laura asked in a perfect Kathleen Turner rasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was just about to make a move to take Laura up on her offer when her body changed again this time into herself, except it wasn't really herself. It was clearly Laura's face but made a bit prettier, her drab hair now cleaner and shinier, and her body had been souped-up. She stood in bare feet a few inches taller than her usual 5' 4\" wearing tiny denim shorts that showed off long, fit legs. Her top was a black tank top with white block letters that read \"SEX GODDESS\" and the shirt was tight over D cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's head was spinning. He couldn't keep up with what was going on and his brain was about to simply overload and shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's no all,\" Laura continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more?\" Laura could hear the exasperation in Jason's voice without having to use her new hearing powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" she said, \"and actually this last one is my favorite; though I didn't expect it to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a few deep breaths. \"What's that?\" he finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telekinesis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving things with your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Sounds cool but not amazing. The thing is, though, it's crazy powerful. So, yeah, I could pull apart a watch and move every gear individually and all, and that's fun stuff but the thing is I can feel stuff. It's like I'm really touching it, and it's a crazy sensation overload.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason frowned. \"I still don't understand, how does that make it better than flying or being super strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura answered Jason with a smile. Suddenly he felt her hand touching him on the chest just as she had been earlier, and just like earlier her touch was electric, only this time it wasn't her hand. She was using her mind. The hand gently guided him onto the bed so he was lying on his back. He felt her fingers trace a line up to his cheek at which point another hand touched the other cheek and caressed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time another pair of phantom hands took hold of Jason's shorts and tugged at them, ripping them apart like paper and exposing his throbbing erection. Invisible fingers wrapped around his shaft and began playing with it, gripping tight and moving up and down. Then the hands on his face were massaging his neck while more hands gently dragged fingernails down his arms and chest. It was like he was being felt up by several women at once. Jason glanced over to Laura whose eyes were closed. She let out a quiet moan and sucked on her lower lip a bit. Her fists were clenched tight at her sides but Jason could see her breasts undulating as if they were being kneaded by a ghost. Apparently she was playing with herself as well as Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best part is,\" Laura said through short breaths, \"my telekinetic powers are so strong I can mimic anything I can think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could ask what that meant he felt warm lips press against his own. Seconds later another pair of lips began sucking his neck by his right ear while he felt nibbling on his left. He then felt a tongue running up his stomach toward his chest followed by tiny kisses just below his neck. The hands that were rubbing and pumping his cock were joined by another pair of lips that Jason could feel part and surround the head of his penis. The invisible mouth continued to envelop more and more of Jason's member slowly traveling down the entire length until all 10 inches were inside it. His shaft was licked and caressed by a very long tongue and the lips began moving up and down sucking at his cock. Jason was astounded when he realized that he could also still feel the hands playing with his penis as well right through the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the rest of his body was being overtaken with dozens of hands and mouths. Jason was in pure bliss and from the sounds coming out of Laura she was too. Now she was panting and moaning loudly. Jason heard a ripping sound and turned to find the top of Laura's shirt and been pulled apart and her breasts were spilling out, still being fondled and played with using only her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh god, oh god, I can feel everything, Jason,\" she said whipping her hair around. Jason could see that a baseball sized hole had been ripped through the crotch of Laura's shorts and her labia was pulled apart. He realized that she was being filled by some invisible cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Jason's cock was enveloped again but this time by something even more tight and wet than the mouth. With astonishment Jason realized that he was now receiving a hand job and having oral and vaginal sex all at the same time. It was far too much to take and seconds later Jason was coming, though the ropes of semen simply dissolved into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's breathing slowed slightly as Jason's erection softened. \"Oh, did I mention that I can control other people's bodies as well as mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could tell her that she hadn't his erection returned full force then his penis thickened until it was as large around as a beer can and extended to over a foot long and their mental lovemaking continued anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could easily see why these powers were Laura's favorite. They were his now too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bull Ward was, true to his name, a beast; truth be told \"Bull\" wasn't really his first name but he'd gone by it for so long no one knew or was willing to ask his actual one. He stood 6 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 450 pounds, all of it muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't ugly per se, but his lips seemed to be caught in a sort of permanent snarl, his nose was wide and flat with big open nostrils, giving him his nickname. His black hair was buzzed close on the sides of his head white short spikes on top. His head sat atop a neck that was wider than his jaw while his traps rose almost to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBull's shoulders were 3 feet wide while the arms that hunt down from them were like tree trunks. At this moment Bull stood before a mirror crossing his forearms before his stomach and flexing his biceps to obscene size. Each jacked-up python measured 28 inches around and was covered in a pulsing network of veins that looked ready to burst through his skin. He straightened his right arm and flexed his triceps while running his fingers over the horseshoe shaped mountain and through the several valleys while nodding with approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBull's chest, bare and shiny with oil, protruded nearly a foot beyond his chin before sucking back into a tight midsection that was littered with abdominals of various sizes and shapes. From the bricks on his stomach to the piano keys running down his sides his waist was riddled with bumps and ridges that writhed and pulsed in waves as he breathed and moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBull wore enormous black gym shorts that were actually loose despite his monstrous bulk except right in the crotch. The outline of his thick, snakelike member was starkly visible through the thin cotton. Upon seeing this reflected Bull's snarl became a slight grin and he adjusted his shorts so that they were even tighter around his package. Satisfied that he was adequately displayed Bull put his hands on his hips and tensed his legs watching them swell in all directions passing 40 inches in circumference easily. Bull loved the way his thighs pressed into each other, fighting for room, and he really loved the way they felt when he walked and his legs would rub together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBull's body was a muscle building machine and had been since he was in high school. His ability to add mass to his frame was coupled with an obsession to get bigger and stronger, to dominate all those he labeled as less worthy. Now, after years of grueling workouts and dedication Bull had grown into the biggest and strongest man in the entire world and he had arrived to wreak havoc on the local bodybuilding community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that was the story Jason and Laura had come up with as they had transformed Jason into the hulking monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was really loving being Bull and the masses of muscle he wore filled him with a sense of power and confidence. Jason and Laura had spent the last hour talking about Bull as if he were a real person, filling in his backstory, but just being huge was all the story Jason really needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see how guys like your brother can get obsessed with this feeling,\" he said his voice now a booming baritone that rattled the walls slightly. \"I feel like the world belongs to me, like I can just take whatever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit a most muscular pose and grinned at his reflection, then he spotted Laura who appeared from behind him admiring her handiwork. \"I know what you mean,\" she said and Jason realized that she understood his feeling even better than he did. Enhanced as he was he had become the strongest <i>man</i> in the world but she was still far and away the strongest person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down at his friend. \"I was wondering, when do I get to have powers like yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ran her hands over Jason's massive chest. \"Soon, baby. Soon you'll be my superman, but first I want to screw with Greg and Jasmine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason growled and punched his fist into his open palm. \"Those little pipsqueaks! We'll show 'em what real muscle can do.\" Then Jason fell out of character and let out a geeky chuckle which made the terrifying Bull Ward suddenly look like a nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shared a laugh then Laura transformed into her new persona: Lexine, a biker chick sexpot designed to subtlety one-up her sister in every way. Vanessa was 5' 10\" so Laura made herself 6'. Vanessa had a fit body so Lex was buff. Vanessa had an hourglass figure with DD cup breasts so Laura made sure to enhance her curves even further and pumped her chest up enough to require an H cup brassiere to contain her melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the details Laura added were intended to heighten her intimidation factor. She had wild, untamable black hair that fell down between her shoulder blades, her face was hard and chiseled but beautiful all the same, and she had a bright and beautifully rendered tattoo of a rose on her neck below her left ear which reached all the way to her collarbone and another of a busty 50s pinup on her left arm. The Betty Paige style beauty was pictured completely nude with one arm barely able to wrap around her cartoonishly huge bust while the other hand daintily covered her crotch. Jason watched as yet another tattoo appeared on her skin, this time along her right side, this time it was a picture of a beautiful yet enraged female bodybuilder bending a car in half over her head. The the feral muscle beast's modesty was just barley concealed behind torn strips of clothing as if she had just burst out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura dressed herself in a black leather vest that had a single button just below her bust line and a pair of black, ripped denim shorts so tiny they fit her like a bikini bottom. Laura's height jumped up several inches as a pair of black, knee-high boots with stiletto heels appeared on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slid under Jason's arm and hugged herself to his giant chest (the fact that his arm was about as big around as her waist was not lost on him). Jason could feel his giant cock begin to stir but kept it at bay; Laura had given him control over his erections so that he didn't accidentally burst out of his shorts and now Jason decided to test this control by grabbing a handful of Laura's perfectly toned ass and giving a hard squeeze. She purred and lightly dragged razor-sharp nails down his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to go have some fun and get a little revenge?\" Laura asked putting her head on Jason's chest and admiring just how good their reflection looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better believe it.\" Jason said with a snarl. \"Who should we find first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" Laura said. Jason felt a strange sort of flicker run though Laura's body. \"Ok, I found them both. Greg is at the gym downtown working out and Jasmine is hanging out on the beach with a bunch of her cheerleader friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did you just leave and come back?\" Jason was astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled. \"Yeah, it took me a little longer than expected to find Jazz, too. She's not in her usual spot but way down near the pier instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flew downtown and to the pier and back and I never even saw you leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I mean I had to check a few other places too.\" Laura shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura actually blushed a little. \"Well, it's less impressive when you realize I don't need to go around anything. I just phased through every building in my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you covered a whole ton of space and I hardly felt you even move.\" <i>Just how fast was she?</i>, Jason wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just let out a laugh then changed the subject. \"Alright, big man who do you want to torment first?\"</span></div></div>",

Some of Greg and Vanessa's mutual friends came over to gawk at them. Both the men and women visibly intimidated by the pair who by far the biggest human beings there today. One of Greg's workout buddies broke the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brings you all out this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't know you needed an invitation to come to the beach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! It's just that-!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax dude. I'm just fuckin' with ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Uhhh...yeah....funny...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName's Bull Ward.\u201d Jason said, holding out his catcher's mitt sized hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyan \u2013 Ow ! Shit!!\u201d the boy replied, wincing as Jason enveloped his hand in his crushing grip, \u201cWhat do you do, crack coconuts with that thing??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can. That's one of his party tricks.\u201d the raven-haired walking wet dream behind Bull replied as she unfolded herself from the back of the motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my girlfriend, soon to be fianc\u00e9e, Lexine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure to meet you.\u201d Lexine replied, extending her hand. Ryan decided to take another chance and found out that her handshake was just a slightly softer version of her husband's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo again. What brings you all out this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just passing through. Thought we'd check the place out. Maybe settle down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you guys are ex-military?\u201d Ryan asked, indicating the sergeant's stripes on Bull's deltoid muscle and Lexi's left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Cute and perceptive....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan laughed nervously, afraid that he might anger the beast of a man in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Marines. Lexi and I just came back from Afghanistan about a month ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's so cool. After that, I don't know if you would want to hang out with a bunch of stupid college kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we could be persuaded. Right, Lex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got nowhere to be right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me introduce you to the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan took them to meet his friends who were more than a little impressed by the two ex-soldiers.<br>\r\nThe only person who seemed none to pleased was Vanessa, who was used to being the center of attention along with her older brother Greg.  While she will admit the guy was DEFINITELY someone she wouldn't mind getting to know better, he was accompanied by that porn-goddess girlfriend of his. The woman seemed to outclass her in every way possible. She was way taller, her breasts were massive and she looked as if she was strong enough to bench-press a Volkswagen. Vanessa did her best to keep her jealousy in check, which was difficult as Laura was  telepathically affecting the part of her brain that controlled it. To make matters worse, Lexi made it her business to come over to Vanessa to introduce herself personally. Laura increased the heels on her boots by another quarter inch so that she could tower over Vanessa even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what were you all planning to do before we came along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe usual stuff. Hang out, maybe pump a little iron. I think the girls were planning to play some volley-ball. Then we were going to have a barbecue later on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't suppose you'd like to join us Lexi?\u201d Stacey asked, ignoring the poisonous glare she was getting from Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd love to girls but I didn't bring a proper bikini. Just a top.\u201d Lexi replied unbuttoning her jacket to reveal what could only be described to be four bits of string connected to two  tiny scraps of cloth that was just barely enough fabric to cover her nipples. All of the guys got hard in less that a second. And once again Vanessa was turning absolutely green with envy. Stacey spoke up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you have on should be perfect! Let's go play!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd while they're busy with that, maybe you could give us some pointers Bull. Dude, you have GOT to tell us how you got so jacked!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBull smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out on the sand, the girls were choosing their teams. Lexi made sure she was on Vanessa's team.  Lexi helped her team dominate the match, making it her business to almost always knock Vanessa out of her way when she went for the ball. It was especially noticeable when they would be at the net for a spike. When the ball was in the air, Vanessa went up for it. Just as she was about to make contact, Lexi jumped over her head and drilled it back onto their opponent's side, causing Vanessa to fall face-first into the sand.  The other girls laughed at what happened. Vanessa could feel her anger bubbling up inside her.  As the game went on Lexi began rewarding her teammates by make them grow bigger, stronger and faster for every good play they made. Everyone except Vanessa, that is. By the time the girls switched sides for the second half of the game, Lexi's teammates were having to readjust their bikinis to accommodate their larger breasts and bulging muscles. They slaughtered the other girls in the second half, playing as if it were an Olympic qualifying match instead of a friendly game. Of course, Lexi didn't let up on Vanessa any less, crowding her and basically showing her up in every way possible. By the time the game had finished, Vanessa was livid. As they were walking back up to the deck, she decided to confront Lexi. She tried pushing Lexi but soon discovered she'd have more success trying to knock over the Empire State Building with a butterfly wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's your problem bitch!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExCUse me??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you think you're some kinda hot shit because you joined the Army instead of going to college??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, I joined the MARINES not the ARMY, learn the difference! And secondly, I don't think I am some kinda hot shit. I THINK my parents couldn't afford to send me off to some fancy four year college, despite my near perfect SAT scores, so to take some of the burden off of them I joined the military instead and EARNED my way to my bachelor's degree!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time, the commotion had reached over to the work-out areas where the guys were. Bull got up from the bench-press bench he was on and noticed the row taking place. He  began walking over to see what was going on, his brow furrowed with concern when he realized he still had the 600 lb dumbbell he was pressing in his hands. He then casually tossed it over his shoulder where it thankfully landed on the bench-press rack with an echoing CLANNNG!!! He then stood behind Lexi with a scowl on his face, casting his shadow on the group of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything OK over here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi reached back and caressed her massive boyfriend's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry daddy. There's nothing going on I can't handle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so babe. You know where to find me if you need me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBull then stalked back to the weight area where he'd left the guys with stunned looks on their faces. He didn't even bother to say a word. Just stacked another 150 lbs on the bar, slid underneath and continued his workout.  Lexi then turned back toward Vanessa and took off her shades, her pale gray eyes looking as if they were piercing into her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you know what's good for you little girl, DO NOT cross me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi then spun on her heel and walked over to beach showers to rinse the sand and sweat off herself. As Vanessa was brooding over what happened she felt someone shove her from behind. She spun around to find herself face to face with an angry Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the blue fuck is your problem Vanessa??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMY problem??? What the fuck is HER problem?? You saw the way she was crowding me out there!! Knocking me down and getting in my way while we were playing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo different from what you do when Laura comes out here!! You didn't think we noticed how you took advantage of your sister??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't give a shit about that. That big muscle-bitch is gonna PAY!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?? She already shown you she's bigger, stronger and faster than you are. How EXACTLY do you intend to get even with her??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd besides in case you forgot, she's ex-military. It certainly doesn't look like she spent her time typing e-mails and getting coffee. You have no clue what kind of top-secret, next level, hand to hand combat shit they taught her in there!! She probably knows nine different ways to paralyze you for life!!\u201d said Brittany, one of her other friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo yeah, you know what? You're not invited to the barbecue tonight anymore. You obviously need to go home and get your head on straight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just who the fuck do you think you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone who is gonna kick your ass if you don't stop behaving like a spoiled, whiny bitch, that's who??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed in contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really now?? And how do you plan to accomplish that? In case you forgot you peroxide blonde bimbo, I'm way stronger than-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi then let the facade drop and let Vanessa see that she was surrounded by the 6 muscular women.  Although, they had a loong way to go before reaching Lexi's level it clear to see that their bikinis were now straining to contain their now extremely big breasts and bulging muscles. Vanessa gulped as she stared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGO....HOME....NOW!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to muster as much dignity as she could, Vanessa gathered her things and fast-walked back toward home. As Vanessa retreated, Stacey walked over to Lexi who was still under the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease excuse our friend, Lexi. Obviously she had her bitch pills this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to apologize. Some people just seem to have an over-inflated opinion of themselves. I heard you all mention something about a barbecue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! It our annual get-together before everyone heads back to school. I don't know if you and Bull would be interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I love barbecue! And as you can see, Bull doesn't exactly say no to food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young women laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you need me to bring anything??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know if we could trouble you all for some steaks or ribs??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a bother at all. We'll bring both. Is your little friend gonna be joining us??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if she knows what's good for her...\u201d Stacey muttered, \u201cBut I'm not sure. Hopefully she would've cooled down by tonight.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura showed up to the barbecue all excited with Bull next to her. For the first time in her life Laura was invited over to hang out with the popular kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hay Lexi! Glad you can make it!\" one of the girls said as she came up to hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, Samantha. I'm so glad you invited me over \" Laura replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you brought some ribs Lexi. Here I'll take them. Go make yourself comfortable\" Samantha said taking the ribs out of Lexi's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls lets get this party started\" Another girl yelled out while hitting the on button on the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on in the night the girls and Bull ate, laughed, gossiped, ate smores, danced, shared secrets,.. etc. \"Wow is Vanessa really not coming this year?\" one of the girls asked. \"Seems so, kind of serves her. I mean she was being all mean to Lexi over here. And not to metion she is mean to her little sister.\" another girl replied. \"But still. Vanessa is what makes us popular. But you are right she is kind of a mean person.\" The girls all but Laura were chatting away about Vanessa and her past. Laura listened eargerly learning all of her sister's secrets and her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laura and Vanessa were ever together in public Vanessa always acted indifferent to Laura. At home was different. Vanessa never even talked to Laura. There was an obvious hate in Vanessa. But Laura never knew why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls chatter and Laura's thought came to an abrupt stop when they heard there doorbell ring. \"Come to the backyard\" the girls yelled from the back. Upon moments they saw Vanessa. Surprisingly she was not wearing her sexy outfits. Instead she wore sweatpants and a sweater. \"I thought we told you are not invited\" one girl quickly told her getting up approaching her. \"I'm staying for long Cindy\" Vanessa quickly and coldly replied. \"Then what are you here for?\" Samantha asked \"And make it quick we don't want your attitude here\" Samantha quickly added on to the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa swallowed all her pride and ego and made it quick holding back her tears of anger \"I'm sorry for my behavior\" she said while looking at the ground. Then Vanessa quickly turned around and left before any body could say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere girls were silent for a while until Laura broke up the awkwardness of the situation. \" Anyone up for a game of charades?\" The rest of the girls quickly got their thoughts back and agreed to a game of charades. During the game side conversations about Vanessa sprung up. None of Vanessa's \"friends\" were totally calmed down due to the fact that : 1 Vanessa just apologized (She never had done that for as long as they knew her) , 2 She wore seat pants and a sweater, and 3 her cold tone towards Cindy, who was the groups little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the party carried on the girls accepted what just happened and were now back to enjoying themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the party was closing off the girls and Lexi changed numbers and agreed to meet up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked home and reverted herself back to normal. \"Wow so that's what it's like to be popular\" she thought to herself and many other wonderful toughs filled her mind. Upon entering her bed room Laura now was filled with glee. She got some revenge on her sister and she loved it. But as she thought about her sister she realized that Vanessa may be her sister by blood but other than that Vanessa was a complete stranger. It wasn't only with Vanessa but with Greg too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's mind quickly changed focus from more revenge to figuring out her own family. She knew Vanessa and Greg had acknowledged each others presence. But other than that she never had seen them talk. While Greg acknowledged Laura Vanessa didn't. She never knew why Vanessa hated her. As time passed on Laura had started becoming aware of how different her family was from everyone else. Her mother and her dad were normal but among the sibling things seemed to be weird. Laura didn't want revenge anymore on her sister. Now all she wanted was to get to know who Vanessa really is. Laura kept thinking and thinking about her mysterious sister as she fell asleep. </span></div></div>",

Eventually, she decided to type something, and maybe change it later : \"Adapting Alpha Human\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder this weird name was an idea she had discovered reading a comic : a character could adapt itself to any situation and threat he was facing, his body changing each time differently to adapt. Laura had thought \"It would be great to have a power just like this for everyday life !\". Like, if someone was bullying her, she would become taller. Trying to push her around ? She would become stronger. Seduce the boy she wanted ? She'd become sexier... and always be the Alpha Girl around ! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she didn't want people to freak out and finish in some lab with scientists cutting her in pieces. No, she didn't want her body to change back to her scrawny one each time. Hell, why ? That was what she found stupid in the original power : why return to your original body if it is weaker ? No, she'd keep it. And she'd change slowly so people wouldn't freak out, but at least quick enough to feel the taste of revenge soon after facing a problem. She began typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>\"Adapting Alpha Human\"</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This power gives to the owner the ability to adapt so he'll always be, in any group, the Alpha, being better and more impressive than the other members a long way. The power is always active, and anytime it detects someone having something better than the owner, the owner within a few days or weeks change to become way better than the person detected in the relevant way. I.E : If the owner crosses someone cuter than he is, he'll turner even cuter in no time. If the owner is in a room with someone taller than he is, within a few weeks, he'll tower above the person. This power also works when the owner needs it, meaning that if the owner tries to do something, I.E, lifting some weight, his body will adapt, so, soon after, he can lift the precedent weight like it was nothing, even if he only tried once several weeks before. Also, the power detects when someone is making fun of the owner to adapt his body until the person can't make fun of the owner in the relevant domain anymore. I.E : if someone says the owner will never be as tall as something or someone, the owner will soon become taller than something or someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say it simple : anytime the owner of this power isn't good enough for something or someone, he quickly changes until he becomes the best in this thing. Meaning he'll always be the Alpha, whatever he does and whoever he crosses.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe read it, unchecked the box \"Share it with the community\" as she wasn't sure of what could happen if someone else had this power. And clicked \"Save.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pop-up window appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">* WARNING * </div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The user is adding a new supernatural ability, and the company editing this app can't be held responsible for the consequences of its creation.

She was redirected to this main page of her profile, with a message reading :<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura Friedman now has the user-created supernatural ability : \"Adapting Alpha Human\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her body being warmer for a few seconds, and then, it cooled down. It had worked ? Or so she hoped ! She would probably know soon : with Vanessa and Greg around, she would probably feel something the next time she would cross them. And maybe she'd gain enough size, muscles and breasts to make it so she'd be, at last, the family most impressive child !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">Laura laughed, dropping the phone on her bed and following it soon after, laying there with a big smile on her lips. All of her life, she had been quite undeveloped, especially compared to her brother and sister, both alphas in their own ways. She just had to wait for them, and then, wait for her body to adapt. She had a hard time waiting, being impatient, but in the end, the siblings came back home. She heard them talking and ran out of her bedroom to meet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, you should have come with us, it was fun !\" said Vanessa with her perfect cheerleader body. \"I know you're shy about your body, but you shouldn't worry so much about it and just have fun !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned at her sister, a strange grin Vanessa didn't really understand. Laura, looking at her toned body, her large breasts, her cute face and her tall stature felt like a weak electric shock had just hit her body. She knew what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer power had kicked in and commanded quite a growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa's right, Laura, you shouldn't stay inside all day long !\" said Greg as he got out of the bathroom and appeared in his glorious 6'2 glory, with nice muscles gliding with sweat. He was so tall, so strong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slightly shivered as she felt another electric shock in her body. Wow ! She could feel when her power activated. Wait, so if she was right, she'd soon probably grow taller and stronger than him ? She couldn't wait ! But she had made it so her power would still take some time to look kind of natural, so she had to wait for now. She was surprised as her stomach growled so loudly both the siblings turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, was that your tummy ?<br>\r\n- Uh... yes ?<br>\r\n- God, you were waiting for us to have your dinner ? What about some fast food tonight ? Not healthy, but after a day of exercise, I'd like it ! Do you agree Vanessa ?<br>\r\n- Sure ! Why not ?<br>\r\n- Then, off to the restaurant, come on !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio left quickly and went to the nearest fast food, sitting there and ordering the usual. Laura was a bit nervous once there : she hadn't think about it, but what if someone else even taller or curvier was there ? Would she grow even more ? Luckily, she didn't cross the path of anyone like this, the siblings being the best the restaurant crowd had to offer to the wandering eyes, and they all talked quietly about the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the second Laura finished her hamburger, her stomach growled again. \"I guess I was hungrier than expected ! I'll take one more burger.\" She went to order, went back to her table, and ate it in two bites, the siblings looking at her, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, are you sure you're alright ?<br>\r\n- Yeah sure I... I was just hungry, that's all.<br>\r\n- Okay, let's go home then, it's late.<br>\r\n- Uh... go, I'll join you there, I just saw one of my friends over there !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura lied : she just wanted them out of the way. The siblings left soon after, and the second they did, Laura ran to order more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mam, I'll take three more menus, please.<br>\r\n- Three ? Are your friends coming back ?<br>\r\n- Nope, please, just give me my order !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress frowned, but hey, it wasn't her job to investigate on why customers were ordering more stuff than they should. She served her, and moments later, Laura was sighing happily on her chair, her table looking like ruins of a gargantuan feast. She patted her stomach, but couldn't feel it especially full. While the rest of her body was feeling... weird ? She stood and went to the restaurant bathroom to look at herself in the mirror. There was something... odd. She couldn't place it, but something about her wasn't exactly like it should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lifted a sleeve to wash her hands when she surprised a small shadow : was it... a very, very little muscle where there was nothing before ? She patted it, and indeed, her arm felt way harder than before ! Realizing it was indeed her growth beginning, she patted her chest, noticed how her nipples felt puffy, then her ass and pants, noticing barely any difference, but sure that they were here. Her shoes were feeling a bit tighter so... it was a very, very small beginning, but still. That explained her constant hunger : she hadn't precised in the power description that the growth was magically fueled, so the energy had to come from somewhere ! Tomorrow, the first changes would probably be a bit more noticeable, but for now, she wanted to change the power so she didn't need to eat that much anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her phone, launched the app and went to click on the power on her profile, but a pop-up appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Change impossible</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This user-made power is actually working and cannot be modified. User should first stop using the power, and then modify it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap !\" said Laura \"I'll have to wait for the growth to stop to change this... it sucks, but at least, now I know I'll need to fuel it. I should drink a lot of soda and eat some snacks when the siblings aren't looking, and it should go quite fine. For now, let's wait and see how they react to their little sister finally having her growth spurt !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked home, and could almost feel, deep inside of her, her growth spurt working...<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura tapped on the \"Historical Adjustments\" button just to check it out and was greeted with a brief splash screen that highlighted this selection's features. Reading over them she quickly felt that she had found exactly the route she was going to take:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Change more than just your appearance: CHANGE YOUR LIFE!<br>\r\n-Build the body of your dreams and your place in the world around it!

No matter the change you make Alterations will follow along with you ensuring you're never stuck with your choices.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were shaking. This couldn't be possible, could it? Not 10 minutes ago she had been dreaming of changing her body to match her siblings but now she could create a world where she'd always been beautiful or strong or both. She could be rich, famous, popular, desired, the center of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura flopped down on her bed with a huge grin on her face. She was dreaming of the lives she could live, the changes she could make. She knew she should take her time and think things through since this was a major alteration to the very fabric of the universe but she was so excited she wanted to do it now, right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly formulated three possibilities. In the first she was a drop dead gorgeous bombshell even more curvaceous than her sister. She could then make herself a rich supermodel and actress. The idea of the entire world drooling over her hot body got her warm between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second life she envisioned was as a world class female bodybuilder. Maybe even the biggest, strongest woman ever. Like her first fantasy she could create a life of riches and fame, perhaps she could even create herself as a sex symbol and change the world's perspective on female muscle. Imagining her body with slabs of massive muscles pushed the warmth in her sex to a fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly she considered writing a world in which she was given superpowers. Perhaps an accident of some sort turned her into a being of unrivaled strength and power. Her head spun with the various powers she could give herself and what she could do with them. By now she was massaging her crotch and panting. She orgasmed hard and let out a shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pretty sure that superpowers were going to be the way to go, but as her head cleared she realized that she didn't really know the full scope of what was possible with the app. It was a huge leap to assume it really could rewrite history and another to imagine it could grant impossible powers. Perhaps it would be best to go with one of her other fantasies. After all, it sounded like she'd still be able to make more changes later if she got bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura decided she would...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura decided that being a superhero would have to wait until she had a better understanding of the app and how it really worked (if it did at all). So that meant she would go with one of her more understated fantasies. Thinking about which she wanted more, huge boobs or huge muscles, left her at a loss for a time but in the end she decided that she envied her brother more than her sister. While Vanessa could get what she wanted by enticing others Greg could just up and take it himself without convincing others. Also, as nice a guy as he was, Greg could really be intimidating when he wanted to be. Vanessa was still vulnerable should someone want to hurt her or take without asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began working on building her new life as a champion bodybuilder. The first step the app took her through was making adjustments to her own body. She was about to begin just piling on muscle when she decided that she wanted her body to appear extreme but also keep her physique in the realm of possibility. As much as it would be awesome to rival the Hulk in size the fact remained that she didn't want to look too freakish. Still, the desire to be the biggest remained, but what did that mean exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set her phone down and went to her computer. Laura spent the next hour looking up female bodybuilders, Ms. Olympia champions, statistics, measurements, even workout routines and lifting records. She took notes and slowly began to formulate her ideal body. She pulled measurements from the biggest women she could find like Iris Kyle, Renee Toney, Nicole Bass, Karla Nelson, and Jana Linke-Sippl and pushed them just a little further. Satisfied with what she'd written down she returned to the app and began adjusting her own body. She gave herself a chest that measured 55\" above a waist that was a mere 28\". She set her quads at 32 inches (she shivered at the thought that each thigh would be bigger around than her waist) and put her calves at 19\". Then she pumped her arms up to 21\" which, if her research was correct, would make them the biggest biceps of any woman in the world. Laura filled in additional details sculpting her prospective body into a statuesque monument to female muscle and beauty. She smiled at her handiwork awash in giddy energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished up by zooming in on her face and taking nearly half an hour making fine adjustments to maintain her femininity and cement her status as a complete goddess. By the time she was satisfied her face could have graced the cover of any fashion magazine while her body would outclass any woman in the world and quite a few men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last Laura clicked on the \"Next Step\" button and was taken to a screen with a series of drop down menus and text boxes. The first several boxes were setting the ground rules for the new reality she was creating. Many of the options she didn't understand but there was an instruction at the top that only the bottom field was required. Deciding not to mess with more than she needed to she scrolled down to the bottom and found a large text field where she could write, in plain text, the details of her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a few minutes then began writing. She detailed how, at age 10, she began following her older brother to the gym. Greg was 16 at the time and had just started making a serious run at building his muscles up. Laura had been intrigued by the idea of getting stronger and began working out with him. At first Greg didn't think much of her efforts, though he always helped her with her form and gave advice. He just decided that she would get worn out and give up. Laura didn't, though, and instead showed a real aptitude for weight training. As weeks went by she continued to increase the weight she was lifting at a fairly regular rate and not only that her body was changing. By the time she turned 12 Laura's body was packed tight with sleek muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned and typed faster. She wrote about a time in middle school when one of the kids from the basketball team made fun of her for her muscles and called her a freak. She let it go, deciding that he wasn't worth the effort but he continued his taunts for a solid week. One day after school Laura approached the bully on their way home and even though he stood nearly 2 feet taller than she did she used her tiny but powerful body to crush her tormentor. She never got called a freak after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote that as the years went by her muscles continued to grow bigger and bigger as well as stronger by leaps and bounds. When she was 15 she entered her first ever Ms. Olympia becoming the youngest competitor ever. Though she didn't break the top 5 she used the loss to fuel her desire to grow even more and began entering more contests to get more experience all while continuing to push her body ever larger. She very quickly began winning contests and returned to take the top spot at Ms. Olympia the following year as well as the year after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now at 18 years old\", she finished, \"I have become the strongest and most muscular woman in the world. Despite my freakish size I have maintained my image as a sexy, gorgeous woman and have successfully bridged the gap between bodybuilder and supermodel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused for a moment looking back over what she had written. It sounded good. Very exciting. Then a thought occurred to her and she added: \"And I accomplished my great size and strength through hard work and good genetics, not with drugs or hormones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding in a deep breath Laura tapped the button that read \"Apply Changes\" and waited.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The anticipation was so great that Laura didn't even dare breathe. She held her breath until her lungs burned and she was forced to let out a gasp. She looked at her phone and frowned. Of course it didn't work, how could it? She couldn't believe what a fool she'd been to think something could do the things the app advertised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith anguish turning to rage she cocked her arm back to throw her phone into the nearest wall but just before she fired she spotted something out of the corner of her eye. She turned and saw nothing. Just her closet along one wall and her dresser nearby with a full body mirror in between. She then realized that she'd never had a mirror like that before. Where did it come from? Next she turned she found that her bed had grown from a twin into a queen sized mattress and moved to the corner of the room. In the space it had previously occupied she saw stacks and stacks of free-weights. Next her closet door opened revealing that it was now stuffed to overflowing with clothes. Moments earlier her it was near empty but now there wasn't room enough for the volume of garments she owned; several were even piled onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ran to the mirror and examined her body. She still looked exactly the same but there was no denying that things were changing. Her room was altering to accommodate her new past. In the reflection she could see more changes taking place all around her but she didn't dare take her eyes off her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Any second now,</i> she thought, <i>it's going to happen!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she saw it. The veins along her forearms were beginning to press out of her skin. She tensed her fists and watched the muscles just below her wrists expand ever so slightly. She raised her arm and pulled the sleeve of her t-shirt up over her shoulder to see as much skin as she could. Now she flexed her bicep which should have been nonexistent but instead hardened into a lemon sized ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura broke into a giddy laughing fit as her muscles slowly grew. \"It works!! Oh my god, I can't believe it actually works!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched with rapt wonder as the body of her dreams materialized before her eyes. She ran her hands all over her chest and stomach reveling in the spectacular hardness and deep grooves that now covered her torso. She lifted the hem of her shirt and counted 8 deeply defined abs surrounded on each side by a dozen piano key obliques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura noticed that her pant legs were now filled to the breaking point and she eagerly awaited the feel and sight of her bursting out of her clothes. However, despite the fact that she was still growing ever larger her pants didn't split. Instead as she watched they began to slowly transform. The blue denim continued to stretch across her massive quads spreading thin while at the same time it darkened until it was black. She suddenly realized that she was no longer wearing jeans and was instead wearing black yoga tights. Her tights began to shorten little by little, the end moving from her ankle to just above her inflating calf muscles where it stopped. Laura turned and pressed her toes into the floor watching her calf harden into a shredded diamond. Then she slid her hand over her monstrous glutes, squeezing and finding no give whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget walnuts you could crack diamonds on this ass!\" Laura called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to face the mirror again and noticed that her shirt had transformed just as her pants had. Her green t-shirt was gone and in its place was a white tank top that was glued to her huge chest. Across the top of the shirt was her own name and just below that was a cartoon caricature of her in a crab flex with insanely huge muscles. Laura grinned then mimicked the flex herself feeling an electric thrill surge out from her spine. She relaxed then hit the pose again her body surging even larger this time. She relaxed again and noticed that she was panting with excitement. She hit the flex one last time tensing her entire body as hard as she could letting out a roar at her reflection at the same time. Her roar turned into a moan as an orgasm flooded her body with endorphins, her eyes rolling back into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteading her breathing she whispered to herself, \"I made myself come... just from flexing... I never even touched myself. Oh, this is going to be even better than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer transformation took nearly 10 minutes from start to finish and Laura loved every second of it. By the time she was done she was a monster. She stood still, hands on hips, just admiring every bulge, valley, vein, sinew and swell of her incredible new body. She looked even bigger than she had expected and she quickly realized why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't make myself any taller!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the bodybuilders she'd copied stats from had been several inches taller than she was, one was nearly a foot taller. But she'd taken their mass, increased it slightly, then packed it onto her 5' 4\" frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" she said raising an arm and flexing her 21\" bicep. The muscle looked enormous on her short arm and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tore herself away from the mirror and noticed even more changes to the room around her. On the far wall behind her bed was a large poster of her holding an enormous trophy over her head. On either side of her were women with impressive physiques but it only took a quick glance to see that Laura was clearly the biggest, most defined, most sculpted of them all. Surrounding the poster were a dozen other smaller pictures taken from other contests that Laura had participated in over the years. In one she noticed that it was none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger handing her a first place trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst another wall was a bookcase and above it was another set of pictures, but this one was much more personal and Laura moved in close hoping to gain some insight into her new life. There were collages of her and friends hanging out at the beach or the park or just goofing around in random places. She didn't recognize any of the people which worried her a little; what if she met them and had to speak to them like she'd known them for years? She didn't even know their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany,\" she spoke out loud while looking at a picture of a statuesque blonde. In the picture the girl stood next to Laura and both were flexing their biceps. The difference was that Brittany was quite slender and flexed mere bumps compared to the melons on Laura's arms. She didn't know how she knew the girl's name but she knew it was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura moved to another picture of a tiny but mighty asian girl with jet black hair. She put her finger on the picture and spoke, \"Suzy.\" This girl, though several inches shorter than Laura's small stature, was rather buff and clearly a bodybuilder as well. The tiny girl was hugging her impressive body against Laura's side, one leg lifted and pressed against Laura's stomach. Laura had an arm around her companion and her hand was grabbing a handful of Suzy's rear while the other hand gripped Suzy's thigh and held it in place. It was a very sexy picture and Laura could feel goosebumps spreading out over her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Laura spotted an image of an incredible redhead. This one was taken at the beach and the beauty wore an emerald green bikini that contrasted with her fair skin and fiery hair wonderfully. She had the most perfect pair of C cup breasts Laura had ever seen and a body that wasn't as big as Suzy's but that was still very well developed. She looked like a fitness competitor with her chiseled abs and strong shoulders and her legs, oh goodness Laura couldn't believe this girls legs. They were long and thick but perfectly sculpted with flawless skin. The girl was standing near the waterline with an enormous smile on her face. As far as Laura could tell it was the only picture on the wall that Laura wasn't in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole,\" she said. She shook her head, \"Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still didn't know how she knew these names but she felt better about her new life. It seemed that some information was coming to her and perhaps more would follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura scanned more photos but most of these seemed to be random shots of her and other female bodybuilders, perhaps at shows or contests, some at hotel convention centers and several on the Las Vegas strip. In every single case her mass put everyone else's to shame and there were more than just a few shots in which the person she was posing with was pointing at Laura's incredible muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura followed the trail of pictures to her doorway where she found another new addition. A large refrigerator now sat right next to the bedroom door and alongside it was a microwave. She opened the front and found the inside stacked, from top to bottom, with tons of large tupperware containers each packed tightly with food and marked with the date and time that it should be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \"Oh, I should have expected something like this.\" She did a quick count and saw there were at least 40 containers packed into the fridge but incredibly it looked as though she was scheduled to have eaten through all of them within 3 days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously it takes a lot of fuel to keep my body growing bigger.\" Her stomach growled in agreement so she removed one of the containers and ripped the lid off. Inside were 4 boneless chicken breasts and a pile of kidney beans. She heated the food and before she knew it she was looking at an empty tupperware container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the container on her dresser and flopped down on her bed which groaned under her considerable bulk. Laura loved how heavy her body felt while also being incredibly easy to move. It was a strange sensation that she hoped she never got used to. She began wondering what she should do next. On the one hand she wanted to go show off her body but she also wanted to visit her best friend Jason and perhaps even ask him about her life now. She felt she could trust her nerdy friend with the secret of her incredible growth in exchange for information about herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason had been Laura's best friend since the two were in preschool together. They had both grown up in the shadow of more popular siblings (while Laura had both a jock and a beauty to look up to Jason had his twin sister Jasmine who was both a beauty and a jock) and had followed similar paths enjoying the nerdier things in life: science fiction, roll playing games, anime, comics, and so on. Jason and Laura had spent countless days talking about what they would do if they ever found themselves with bodies like those that they envied and now that Laura had accomplished exactly that she had to go see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she knew that the muscles that were so new to her were old news to Jason, but she even considered the idea of telling him about her old life as a wimp. Perhaps she could even share her new reality bending ability with him, but caution was a must. She'd already messed with the fabric of reality once, best to wait at least a little while until she did it again, right? Besides, she wanted to take her time and enjoy the new life she'd built so they could share the excitement of her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, though, Laura decided she was going to pay Jason a visit. At the very least it would be worth it to hang out with a familiar friend before diving into a life she knew nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura leapt to her feet and approached her closet. She didn't want to wear workout clothes and wanted to find something else comfy and casual that still showcased her gorgeous muscles. She was shocked by just how many garments were stuffed into her closet. There was hardly any room to move clothes around and see what she had. There were tons of dresses of varying degrees of sexiness ranging from \"everyday wear\" all the way to \"turning every head in the club.\" She found quite a few suites and other business casual clothes, oversized slacks and giant button up shirts, and wondered what she used those for. There was a section that looked like a huge jumble of bungee cord that turned out to be dozens upon dozens of bikinis. As Laura searched through them she found that they were all sequined or jewel encrusted, or tied with strings of pearls. She decided that these must be her collection of posing bikinis for her competitions since they all seemed far too fancy to just wander around the beach in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact for all the clothes in her closet there wasn't much that looked like clothes she could just lounge around in. Abandoning her closet for the nearby dresser she found what she was looking for. The top drawer was filled with socks and underwear on one side and swimsuits for actual swimming on the other. The middle drawer held her tops, t-shirts, tanks, halters, and undershirts. And below that drawer were pants, shorts and tons of lycra garments in every color of the rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is more like it,\" Laura said pulling out a pair of cut off shorts with frayed denim hanging down. Laura then picked out a t-shirt (a purple one with She Hulk on the front her muscles pumped up and one hand in the air holding a barbell with several giant plates on either side) and then opted to go with a red bikini with black stripes in place of underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura quickly stripped off her current clothes keeping her eyes away from the mirror because she knew that were she to catch a glimpse of her naked form she'd go right back to staring at her own reflection again and she didn't know if she'd be able to stop any time soon. Getting the bikini top on was a bit more cumbersome than she'd expected with her extra bulk but she actually really loved that she had trouble, it just meant that she was than damn big. She had similar trouble with the t-shirt, though it was a bit easier. Finally once she had pulled her shorts over her giant quads she allowed herself a peek at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad she'd opted for the bikini since the shirt was so tight across her chest that she could make out the triangular shapes beneath the fabric, she preferred that look to a bra or even her nipples poking through. The bottom of the shirt ended a few inches above her shorts showing off a hint of her incredible abs and she was a bit surprised to find that the shorts were cut so high they fit her somewhat like a bikini themselves. She put her hands on her hips and flexed her muscles listening to her clothes cry out in protest. Thankfully they held and she felt confident that she could go outside without fear of bursting a seam unless she really wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura found her collection of shoes in the bottom of the closet behind a pile of clothes and picked out a slightly worn looking pair of flip flops. The sandals were super comfy telling her that they must be a favorite of hers. She was about to leave her room when her stomach gurgled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a serious problem if I can't stray more than a hundred feet from my fridge,\" she told her musclebound reflection. With a shrug she collected her next two meals (several fish filets, a brick of cheese, a container with half a dozen raw eggs, a large pile of green beans, and 2 pounds of ground beef) and consumed every last bit within minutes. As she finished her second and third lunches of the day Laura began to wonder about her daily routine. Was she supposed to be working out today? What would she do when she had to go to the gym? Would the power of the phone app keep her big and bulging or would she have to work extra hard to keep her size up? She supposed this was why she needed an ally, someone who knew she was clueless about her own life. More than ever she knew she needed Jason's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bounded down the stairs from her room to the entryway then out the front door with such momentum that she nearly plowed right through it. Jason's house was just a few blocks down from her own so she walked with a confident strut. She couldn't help but grin at the heads that were turning in her direction and for the first time in her life she loved being the center of attention. She even winked and waved at a pair of cute guys who promptly turned beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she was at Jason's door. She knocked, banging on the door harder than she'd intended and for just a moment she realized that she didn't really know just how strong she was. Before she could contemplate her power any further the door swung open and the Jason of this reality stood before her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura had been more than half expecting that the Jason of this reality would have bulked up simply by being associated with her but apparently that hadn't happened.  The Jason who now stood before her wasn't a musclebound beefcake like the one she had found herself hoping for.  He did look different though, his hair was longer, splitting the difference between being unkempt and spiked out, he was also wearing a tight black t-shirt for a band Laura didn't recognize which was different than his usual baggy superhero shirts.  Maybe he wasn't quite as scrawny as he had been, he looked good in the shirt Laura decided, if he wasn't actively working out he was at least eating better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"  The coolly delivered question snapped Laura out of her inspection of her friend and she brought her attention back to his face, which didn't look happy to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I,\" Laura began uncertainly before she was interrupted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason who is it?\"  Laura's attention was drawn over Jason's shoulder as a girl she didn't recognize appeared behind Jason.  And if Laura had ever seen this girl before she would have remembered her.  The girl was tall, almost as tall as Jason, and thin.  She was generically pretty enough to not be considered plain, her only stand out features being her eyes, which were strikingly green and mostly shrouded by her long dark hair.  Her eyes and her breasts.  Laura actually did a double take and had to stop herself from doing a triple take at the sight of the massive breasts this girl had stuffed into her tank top.  They were large to the point of being improbable but the way they moved as the girl put her arm possessively around Jason's waist and held him tight made Laura pretty certain they were real.   The strange girls eyes hardened as she regarded Laura.  Laura was struck speechless by the sight of this girl and she struggled to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyah, you remember Laura.\"  Jason's expression was still distant and his words were carefully neutral sounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember,\" Nyah said softly, her gaze becoming even more steely.  She buried most of her head behind Jasons shoulder, only her eyes were visible, glaring at Laura as though over a fence put up between feuding neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Laura, I'm about to head out to practice,\" Jason said, picking up a bass guitar that had apparently been leaning up against the wall near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colin and Wendy are waiting,\" Nyah said in agreement, nodding her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whatever you have to say, please say it quickly.\"  Jason finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince when did Jason play an instrument?  Laura's mind reeled and suddenly it hit her, Laura couldn't remember seeing any pictures of Jason on her wall with all of her new friends.  And Laura also suddenly realized she hadn't seen any of her comics, or for that matter any of her favorite geeky, nerdy stuff anywhere in her new room.  The realization seemed to create a cascade of new (old?) memories. She could remember drifting away from Jason as he stayed as he always had and she had began to seriously pursue bodybuilding, she could remember him timidly trying to ask her out as more than a friend once, something she apparently refused to consider because she was focused on her next competition and because he was too scrawny to interest her and hadn't outgrown \"nerd stuff\" yet.  More memories came pouring in and Jason was in very few of them.  At some point she had recollections of Jason joining a band and her going to see them perform once, maybe to patch things up between them but it had apparently ended with a fight between her and Nyah, whom she could now remember saying horrible things to.  \"I'm so sorry,\" Laura finally said, tears threatening to flow.  She felt overwhelmed by the rush of new memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's expression softened slightly.  \"So am I, but I don't have the time right now to get into this with you.  If you want I'll text you later,\"  Jason brushed past Laura with his bass and Nyah in tow, closing the front door behind him and getting into a beat up compact car, presumably Nyah's, and drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood on his front porch for a few moments lost in thought, sifting through her conflicting memories, trying to make sense of how much she had really changed from the person she could still remember being this morning.  She wasn't sure she wanted a reality where she has lost touch with her geeky pursuits the same way she wasn't sure she wanted a reality where her and Jason weren't best friends but on the other hand, Jason appeared to be doing well for himself without her, he was in a band and was with a girl who not only seemed devoted to him but was rocking a supermodel/porn star figure.  And thinking of Nyah's figure gave Laura a massive pang of jealousy.  She had thought Vanessa had big boobs but holy crap.  Where had Jason found this girl and how had the two of them gotten together?  Would things have worked out differently between Jason and Laura if Laura's boobs had been that big?  Maybe the phone could fix things somehow so their friendship wouldn't have been wrecked, or maybe she should leave it alone until she explored this reality more.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura walked back home lost in swirling thoughts and conflicting emotions. The spring had definitely been taken out of her step and while she had basked in the glow of admiration from the general public on her way to Jason's house she didn't take notice of any of the many people who stopped to stare at her muscular body on the way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excitement she'd felt earlier over her new life was fading and she was now realizing that while some elements of this reality were far superior there were some consequences that she didn't like at all. Had she really compromised a huge piece of who she was on the inside in exchange for her giant muscles? Did she really have to live with the pain of being such a bitch to her best friend? Most of the way back she was trying to think of how she would use the phone to correct what she'd done and repair the bond between her and Jason. It seemed possible based on the way the Alterations app described its features, but there was a voice in the back of her head telling her that things could get much worse and that she should wait and see more of this world before erasing it and trying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Laura stepped inside her own home she was assaulted by an angry voice. \"Where the hell have you been? We're late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Laura was snapped out of her doldrums and put on the defensive. It was Vanessa that was angry with her and while Jason's body hadn't gone through any real changes in this reality as she'd hoped, it was clear that Vanessa's had. Laura was used to seeing a Vanessa that was curvaceous but still fit from years of track, cheerleading, and dance. While \"curvaceous\" was still an apt descriptor \"fit\" was no longer strong enough a word to do the job. \"Buff\" was the first word that came to Laura's mind upon laying eyes on her older sister. Vanessa was clad in tiny terry cloth shorts and a sports bra under a tight tank top, and this gave Laura a clear view of Vanessa's plump thighs, wide shoulders, and thick arms. Vanessa had not yet crossed the threshold into bodybuilder territory but she was dancing very close to the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Vanessa demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was shocked by her sister's dominant demeanor and totally forgot about her complete physical superiority, once again becoming that scrawny and lost little girl she'd always been. \"I.. uh, Jason's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa frowned. \"Jason's house? What were you doing there? I thought you guys weren't speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not.\" <i>Apparently</i>, Laura said in her mind. \"I guess, I don\u2019t know, I was hoping to patch things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Vanessa smiled. \"Oh my little Lulu. Don't worry about him, he'll come around when he's ready. But seriously we're late for your workout, you're never late for chest and arms day. It's so unlike you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled. \"I haven't been very much like me at all today.\" Suddenly, though, Laura felt much better. A good workout was just what she needed to clear her head, plus it was a good opportunity to feel the strength her new body possessed. She smiled and nodded at Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl!\" Vanessa gave Laura a hard slap on the ass then sucked her breath in. \"Why do I do that? It hurts every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura bounded up the stairs to her room and began changing into workout clothes. This time she opted for lycra shorts and no shirt over her sports bra. As she was tying her shoes her phone chimed indicating a text message. It was from Jason:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">we r doing a show @ 8 tnite @ the chiller. i'll put u on the list. can talk after if u wnt.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt a bit of a weight lifted from her heart. Maybe this reality wasn't so dismal after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that smile for?\" Vanessa asked as Laura descended the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason invited me to see his band play and says he wants to talk after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good news,\" Vanessa handed Laura a duffel  and a huge sipper cup filled with some sort of shake. Laura took a big sip and decided that it didn't taste bad but it didn't taste all that good either. \"What time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The show is at 8:00.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, that means I have five whole hours to turn you into a whimpering puddle of goo, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa drove them to the gym while Laura sucked down the odd shake. Inside Laura was glad to find that Vanessa seemed to be her trainer and led her through a series of warm-ups which she seemed to read off from a big black binder she carried around. As she was finishing the warm-up routine and getting ready to begin her workout proper Laura felt a massive surge of energy fill her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god, what was in that shake you gave me?\" Laura asked without even thinking that this could be a strange question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed. \"You always ask and I always tell you the same thing: it's my own special, carefully researched formula and you should mind your own goddamn business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way you avoid the question leads me to believe that you're slipping me illegal substances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa feigned outrage. \"As your manager do you really think I would jeopardize your career and thus my money stream like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was grinning ear to ear, this was not the sort of relationship she ever had with Vanessa before but it still felt so natural and fun. \"How about as my sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As your sister I don't make a penny, so who the fuck cares?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a bitch!\" Laura said and burst out laughing which got Vanessa laughing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, though, the pair was all business and Vanessa guided Laura through an intense workout all the while making notes in her binder. Vanessa proved to be an incredible coach pushing Laura to dig deeper than she ever thought she could. It was as if Vanessa could sense the moment Laura was ready to give up because suddenly Vanessa face would be right in hers screaming at the top of her lungs to keep going, push harder, dig deeper, more reps, now, go, go, go! Over and over again Laura would reach the end of her strength and somehow Vanessa would shove her even further and then further again. It was the single hardest thing Laura had ever done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later Laura found herself in the locker room shower rinsing the sweat from her body. The muscles of her chest, arms, shoulder, and even her back were quivering from fatigue. As difficult and painful as the workout had been Laura wanted more; the pump felt incredible, erotic, addicting even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home Vanessa joined Laura in her room and acted as an assistant of sorts pulling Tupperware containers from the fridge and heating the contents. Finally she set four full tubs before Laura who was now looking at more food than she normally ate in a whole day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura scarfed, hardly taking the time to chew, Vanessa went to Laura's closet. \"Have you thought about what you were going to wear tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't, in fact since pretty much every outfit she'd worn over the last several years had been jeans and a t-shirt it wasn't a question that ever really came to her mind. \"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her head. \"Little Lulu, what am I going to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura responded as if the answer was the most obvious thing ever, \"Dress me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed. \"What's this club called again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Chiller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of it, so let's keep things simple.\" She retrieved a garment from Laura's closet. It was a little black dress, or little for Laura's bulky frame, at any rate. It had a scoop neck and very low back to maximize the amount of skin on display while still looking very classy. \"This oughta fry his brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to win his affection, just be his friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Vanessa said as she dug through the bottom of the closet looking for shoes. \"You wear this and any man will give you anything you want. If it's friendship you want, you'll get it. How could he stay mad?\" She pulled out a pair of shiny black pumps with a silver metal heel. Laura wasn't sure if that was for looks or to support her weight. Either way they looked incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fatigue that Laura had felt after her workout was fading fast and being replaced with high levels of energy, she actually felt like she could take on another workout but there were other matters to attend to. She finished her dinner and then Vanessa helped her get into the dress. Once on it fit her like a second skin. The hemline sat very high on her thighs and her thick quads liked to push it even higher. Laura had a feeling that she was going to spend much of the night pulling her dress down again, but she had to admit that it looked amazing on her. She stepped into the shoes and her mouth dropped. Somehow the simple addition of high heels magnified the muscles of her legs and made them pop in unbelievable ways. Laura turned one way then the other watching her mouth watering quads and calves flex with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa admired her handiwork. \"You're not of this world, kid.\" She slapped Laura's ass with similar results as earlier. Clutching her damaged hand she shouted, \"SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura did a quick Google search for the location of the club which seemed to be deep in the center of downtown. She then set out to see what the night had to offer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura caught herself mid-stride as she exited her front door in the act of rummaging a set of keys out of her purse.  It was completely automatic, something she did without thinking as though she had done it countless time before even though she could never remember having done it.  She didn\u2019t have a car\u2026 did she?  She tentatively pushed the button on the key fob she had dug out of her purse and heard the chirp of a car unlocking from inside her parent\u2019s garage.  She cautiously pushed the button on the garage door opener that was also on her key-ring and waited expectantly as the door lumbered slowly upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d she breathed.  The door finished squeaking open and she found herself staring at a brand new, red convertible Camaro.  She smirked when she was the license plate read \u201cPUMP3D.\u201d  \u201cI wonder if I did that because I still think \u201cleet speak\u201d is cool or because it wasn\u2019t available without using the number?\u201d  She mused to herself as she slid behind the wheel.  \u201cOof, that\u2019s a tighter fit than I was expecting.\u201d  The logistics of her short frame being able to reach the pedals and the extreme girth of her chest made the steering wheel placement feel slightly awkward.  She adjusted the seat and wheel a few times but ended up not finding anything more comfortable.  \u201cOf course I would have already tried that,\u201d she chided herself as she put everything back as she had found it.  She couldn\u2019t keep from grinning as she drove away in her own car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe club was relative easy to find.  \u201cThe Chiller\u201d looked like it had once been a meat processing plant or something.  The entrance was through large, insulated metal doors and the d\u00e9cor was made up of things like meat hooks and tables that looked like butcher counters.  To her chagrin Laura realized that pretty much everyone was wearing jeans and t-shirts.  Mostly band t-shirts but she suspected she could have worn a superhero t without standing out too much.  As it was she felt like she stuck out like a sore thumb.  Then she realized that no matter what she wore she stuck out like a sore thumb.  With this realization giving her a boost of confidence she began to walk into the club but was stopped by the ticket line.  A large tattooed man with a nose ring brusquely told everyone in line as they reached him, \u201cten bucks to get in.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m with the band.\u201d  He looked at Laura from head to toe and snorted.  \u201cI don\u2019t mean I play with the band, I mean Jason invited me.\u201d  Laura struggled to think of the name of the band he was in, how could she remember the names of people she had never met by seeing them in a picture but not remember whether or not she owned a car, what her exercise routine was or the name of Jason\u2019s band?  Or had she ever known the name of Jason\u2019s band?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was saved from her momentarily brain lock by the arrival of a thin blonde girl.  \u201cRelax Tony, princess is with us.\u201d  The girl was an inch or so shorter than Laura if you discounted her wild hairdo which could only exist with the aid of more hairspray than Laura had ever used in her entire life.  The girl eyed Laura with an air of bored detachment and an undercurrent of disdain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Wendy, keep her out of trouble.\u201d  Tony waved them through and Laura followed the other girl wondering if the warning was generic or specifically aimed at her based on something she had done in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019ll be sitting at the sound board with me.  Back stage is off limits during the show, he hasn\u2019t said it but I don\u2019t think Jason wants you and Nyah alone together and she\u2019s back there,\u201d Wendy sat down at the mixing board and gestured to a stool next to her.  She slipped a pair of headphones on and turned her back to Laura.  Laura looked around at the crowd, which was now milling around the stage and again felt out of place.   Jeans, t-shirts, leather and denim jackets, long hair, tattoos and piercings, this was not the sort of place she ever would have thought Jason would have anything to do with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was snapped out of her contemplation by the house lights going down and the curtain opening.  The long haired guitar player strode up to the center microphone and addressed the crowd with an accent that was vaguely British, \u201cGood evening mates!  We are The Marauders!\u201d  And with that chaos erupted.  The band was shockingly loud and the crowd reacted with over the top excitement.  Jason was on the left side of the stage with his bass and Laura could feel the thunder of it deep in her gut.  This was not the Jason she knew.  The Jason she knew was quiet and shy in public.  This Jason was obviously enjoying being in the limelight, head banging, singing backing vocals, parading around the stage, stoking the crowds enthusiasm to a fever pitch and enjoying every bit of it.  Laura wasn\u2019t really into punk or metal or whatever kind of music it was they were playing but the energy was infectious and she found herself on her feet, unable to keep from tapping her feet or even jumping up and down periodically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed quickly, the band kept up an almost constant barrage of sound, pausing just long enough to shout out song titles before launching into the next number or to briefly whip the crowd back into frenzy.  This constant, frenetic pace made the slight pause while Jason and the guitar player (who had introduced himself to the crowd as Colin) switch places really stand out.  Jason strode confidently up to the center mic.  \u201cI want to dedicate this next song to a very special lady, it\u2019s one of her favorites and I know she\u2019s here tonight.  Just remember baby, I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d  For a moment Laura wanted to believe that Jason was talking about her but then she followed Jasons gaze to the sidestage and caught a glimpse of Nyah gazing back at him with absolute adoration in her eyes.  Jason grinned back at Nyah and again Laura felt a pang of jealousy, she and Jason had been friends for years and he had never looked at her like that.  Jason set his bass down in a stand next to the microphone and whipped his shirt off over his head, tossing it offstage to Nyah and putting the bass back on in one smooth motion.  The girls in the crowd screamed their approval and pushed closer to the stage and Laura sucked her breath in sharply.  Jason was ripped.  Not buff like a bodybuilder, but lean and cut like a runner or swimmer.  He looked REALLY good, how had the her of this reality brushed him off?  The jealousy pang came back again even stronger as Jason started pounding out a throbbing bass line.  \u201cLucretia, my reflection.  This one\u2019s for you Nyah,\u201d Jason intoned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unreal seeing Jason so confident and full of life, it was even more unreal when he began singing, his voice was pitched much lower than Laura would have expected.  She never would have guessed in a million years that Jason could sing.  Jason\u2019s presence during this song was completely different than earlier though.  Before he had been playing to the crowd, now he was performing for one person, all his attention was directed to the girl Laura could only occasionally catch glimpses of standing just off stage.  The crowd ate it up anyway, it was as though the entire club was filled with the sexual tension of those two people and everyone else was swept up in it.  By the time the song was over Laura was convinced that Jason and Nyah regularly made love to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over Jason adjusted the microphone, raising it up so he had tilt his head back to address it.  \u201cAnd this next song is dedicated to a hero of mine who passed away recently, rest in piece Lemmy.\u201d  With no other segue and without missing a beat Jason launched into a thundering bass line that even Laura recognized as the opening to \u201cthe Ace of Spades\u201d because it had been in one of the guitar hero games.  The crowd erupted as Jason growled his way through this song as well, once again surprising Laura that he could make his voice sound like that.  But apparently it came at a price.  \u201cOK,\u201d Jason laughed hoarsely as the song ended.  \u201cThat\u2019s about all I have in me, back to you Colin.\u201d  They switched places and played two more songs before bidding farewell to the crowd amid deafening applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura found herself with too much time to think and feeling too many emotions while she waited for Jason to come talk to her.  What was she was going to say?  Why was she even here?  Was she here because she wanted Jasons friendship or because she wanted to sleep with him?  When had sleeping with Jason even become something she thought about?  The memory of his bare chest and confident manner brought an undeniable flush to her skin and she had to fight her mind from going further down that path.  Was this exact indecision been what caused the source of whatever tension there was between her and Nyah?  Was it going to flare up again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy gave up the soundboard to the tech for the band that was going to be playing next and Laura followed her to a hall behind the stage.  \u201cRemember princess, play nice,\u201d Wendy said.  Laura\u2019s breath caught in her throat as she caught sight of Jason walking towards her, cutting off any retort she might have had for Wendy.  Laura felt that jealous pang again at the site of Nyah at his side, with their arms entwined.  Nyah was wearing an oversized jean jacket that was covered with patches and studs but it did little to disguise her extreme figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin rushed past Jason and kissed Wendy, momentarily distracting Laura.  \u201cC\u2019mon babe,\u201d Colin said grabbing Wendy\u2019s hand, \u201clet\u2019s leave these three alone for now.\u201d  And with that they darted away leaving Laura staring at Jason and Nyah with no idea what she was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jason said, clearing his throat after a moment of silence went by.  \u201cWhat was it you wanted to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So,\" Jason said, clearing his throat after a moment of silence went by. \"What was it you wanted to talk about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment something inside Laura snapped. She was overcome with feelings counter to what she had experience earlier on Jason's doorstep. Instead of regret for actions she had nothing to do with she instead felt jealousy for what Nyah had taken from her. Jason, by all rights, belonged to Laura: they had known each other for longer, been friends forever, they had \"played doctor\" together and shared so much over so many years. Who the hell did this pretender think she was wedging her way between Laura and Jason with her giant tits? Laura was the real masterpiece, she was the strongest, most muscular woman on the planet and she was going to take what belonged to her. Sure Nyah's tits were crazy big, but Laura suspected that, given the chance, Jason's love of female muscle would win out in the end. And she intended to give him that chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Laura was also smart. She knew that just coming on to Jason or offending Nyah would drive a wedge between them. While she could just use her considerable brawn to take him with her and never let him go she knew the real victory would lie in getting him to push Nyah away. Laura's mind worked feverishly constructing a plan but first things first: she had to make sure to repair the rift between herself and Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to let you know that I've been doing a lot of soul searching lately and I've come to realize what a bitch I've been to a lot of people.\" Laura had no idea if this was true or not, but the few memories she had of how she'd treated Jason and Nyah let her know that, at the very least, Jason and Nyah would believe it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wrapped an arm around Nya's slim waist and pulled her close to his side. \"I'm listening,\" he said. There was caution in his voice, but hope too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a lot of good times together, a long time ago. You were the best friend I ever had and I let my obsession with bodybuilding push you away. I'm sorry for that. I was just overcome by a desire to grow these muscles as big as I could that I lost sight of what mattered.\" She raised her arm and flexed her 21 inch bicep which was still quivering and pumped from her workout earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there it was! She had offered up the bait and Jason had taken it. The moment she locked in her flex she saw Jason's eyes drawn to it, just for a second. There were tons of little details, clues as to what was going on inside his mind and Laura took them all in. The slight dilation of his pupils, the nearly imperceptible lift of his eyebrows, just a hint of flush around his neck, just the tiniest exhale through slightly parted lips. Laura saw it all and her heart leapt because she knew what it meant. Desire, longing, most importantly lust. He wanted her muscles and she was going to give them to him. All in good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntentionally leaving Jason wanting more Laura turned to Nyah. \"Nothing will ever make up for the things I said, but I hope you understand that I truly am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyah looked lost for a moment. She'd always just naturally hated Laura that now she couldn't quite fathom the concept of not having that anymore. \"Um.. okay. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio chatted for a little while, mostly small talk. Laura complimented the band and Jason's surprising singing prowess. She made sure to send a few complements Nyah's way as well endearing herself to Jason as much as possible. All the while she would occasionally give a subtle flex to various muscle groups, just to remind Jason that they were there. After a little while Colin and Wendy returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still playing nice, princess?\" Wendy asked as Colin hugged her from behind taking quick nibbles out of her ear and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep calling me that?\" Laura asked and instantly realized she shouldn't have. All four of her companions gave her a look that said this was the most obvious thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jason offered up the answer. \"Because of your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura feigned understanding. \"Oh, right. Sorry, stupid me. Big muscles, tiny brain.\" She noticed that Jason's eyes darted to her body, likely in the hopes of another flex but this time she denied him while also making a mental note to see what the heck Greg was up to in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, mate,\" Colin said, \"we told Sam we'd be there by ten and it's nearly nine forty-five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at Laura apologetically. \"Yeah, we need to go. We told a friend we'd do a few songs for his sister's birthday party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you go rock their socks off.\" Laura said. \"I'm glad we got to talk.\" She moved in and gave him a big hug, briefly smothering him in her rock hard embrace. <i>This will give him something to think about while he's fucking that walking pair of tits.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nIt took Jason several seconds to recover from her hug. \"Me too,\" he finally said. \"We'll do it again soon.\" Even Nyah gave Laura a smile as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment they were gone Laura let out a low growl. She was suddenly hornier than she'd ever been in her life. This whole time a fire was building inside her, she desperately wanted Jason and her animal urges were only just overpowered by her understanding that she had to take her time to win him over. But now she was just left with an overwhelming need for sex. She scanned the crowd and found nothing but skinny kids with wild hair and lots of piercings. None of them were really her type, but they would have to do in a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura approached the bar and saw a tall guy with dark hair checking out her body. That was all she needed to go on. She walked up to him, even with her heels bringing her height up to 5' 7\" this guy still stood nearly a foot taller than she was. With no hesitation she put her hand on his shoulder and brought his ear close to her mouth so as to be heard over the booming music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've heard of you,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you know what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause while he pondered this statement. \"Uh.. yeah, I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna do it with me?\" She spoke this last words hot and breathy while giving his ear a tiny lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mystery man had hardly so much as nodded his head and she was dragging him across the club and into the women's bathroom. She led him into one of the stalls (finding she had very few inches on either side of her wide shoulders to work with) and very hastily pulled his pants down. His cock was already at full attention and while it wasn't quite as big as she'd hoped to find on such a tall guy she reminded herself that beggars couldn't be choosers and right now she was definitely begging for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned and faced the toilet placing one hand on the wall while the other pulled the back of her dress up over her engorged glutes. She took hold of her underwear and pulled it off in one fluid motion ripping it to pieces and dropping it to the floor. Her prey stepped up behind her and began running his hands over her ass and down the sides of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he said attempting to grip handfuls of her flesh and finding it as hard as granite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wow,\" Laura was getting impatient and dragged her boy toy right up against her backside where his penis could find the searing heat of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no further encouragement he used his hand to guide himself into her and then took hold of her hips and began thrusting as hard as he could. Several minutes of this and Laura decided that while it felt good it just wasn't going to satisfy her needs so she spun around forcing him to sit on the toilet then she turned around again and mounted him with her chest right in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, lover boy. I don't know if you're going to make it through this.\" Laura then began bouncing up and down on his cock driving him as deep as possible into herself. Now this was more like it, already she could feel an orgasm on the horizon. For his part her companion was taking the beating she was giving him with no complaints, though not like she was going to give him a choice. She knew that at the very least his thighs were going to be pretty bruised after all this, but she couldn't bring herself to care. He was reaching up and feeling her chest, shoulders and arms so she decided to reward him. She flexed a bicep and he instantly began pawing at it amazed at it's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she was ready to come so Laura braced herself with her hands on the walls around her. Suddenly the orgasm ripped through her like nothing she'd ever experienced before. She tensed up and, without realizing she was even doing it, shoved the stall walls apart ripping their mounts out of the wall and collapsing them into the stalls on either side of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis crazy display of power was enough for her partner to get beyond the pain of her bouncing and he erupted inside her as well. Laura moaned softly, running her hands through her hair as the glow wore off of her. The collapsed walls on either side of her moved slightly; apparently there were people underneath but she hardly noticed. Instead she simply stood, straightened her dress and gave her exasperated playmate a pat on the head before walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Laura knew she was in her bedroom. She felt like she was coming out of some sort of trance. These actions, her desire to break up Jason and Nyah, her need for sex and destruction of a bathroom, she wasn\u2019t acting like herself. She was two different people now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that wasn't right, she was three different people. At once she was the skinny, nerdy girl who was socially awkward as well as the powerful amazon but now she was also a strange combination of the two. She was a once wimpy, downtrodden girl who had been given the power to do as she wanted and she was acting on her desires. And it terrified her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura reached for her phone with the intent to change something, anything, maybe even back to the way things were originally because she wasn't feeling comfortable inside her own skin.  The longer she was in this new reality the more she wasn't liking what she found.  Sure the body was amazing but was this new personality of hers something she wanted?  She thought back to the recent having sex with a random stranger thing that had just happened and shuddered.  It hadn't even been GOOD sex, it was just sex, like trying to scratch a persistent itch but just not quite getting it.  Without realizing it her hand had drifted down between her legs and the rough scraping of the side of her thumb against her own clit startled her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" She gasped.  She firmly put both hands on the phone and navigated to her profile in the app.  This HAD to stop.  She had to put her life back to how it was before it was too late.  With a few quick swipes and taps her profile filled the screen of the phone and she hesitated, fixated on the image of buff perfection she had crafted.  \"Laura Friedman\" was across the top of the profile and next to her name in very small print was \"revision 1.\"  This text looked like a clickable hyper link so she tapped it and was greeted with a text box that read \"Revert to original profile?  Yes/No?\"  As she hesitated again something else new on her profile that she hadn't yet noticed changed.  In tiny print at the bottom corner opposite of the \"revision 1\" text was the text \"Synchronization with new reality and personality.\"  The number next to this text ticked upward from 79 to 80%.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  This was stupid.  There was no way she was giving up this body.  She had worked for it, it was hers and that was that.  She noticed the time and shut the phone off.  \"It's still early, I have time to eat and hit a real club before it gets too late.\"  Laura swept through her closet quickly, tossing aside the little black dress and digging for something else.  \"Vanessa meant well but she's so old fashioned,\" Laura smirked to herself.  Laura slid into a pair of slouchy ankle-high boots that glittered with straps and buckles but still showed off all the glory of her calves with four inch chunky heels.  She clacked loudly down the hall to the kitchen, the sound echoing off the walls giving her some satisfaction.  People would hear her coming before they even saw her.  She caught sight of her reflection on the door of the huge stainless steel fridge, and smirked again.  Her legs were sheathed in black fishnet stockings and her body was showcased in a one piece strapless leather micro-dress.  It had a dramatic asymmetrical cutout that wrapped it's way from one hip, across her stomach to show case her abs and around the other side to show off a bit of underboob, no bra required.  People would hear her coming before they saw her and never forget the sight when they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled tubs of food out and prepared them without thinking about it.  The alarm on her phone went off saying \"time to eat!\" at almost the exact same time the microwave dinged, signaling her food was ready. \"I don't know why I bother keeping this alarm, I can set my watch by my stomach, it's not like I'm going to forget to eat.  I know my food plan as well as I know my workout routine.  She chuckled as she began shoveling food into her mouth as she fiddled with her phone, then frowned as it opened to her profile in the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was I messing with this thing?  You don't mess with perfection.\"  Laura backed out of it and was about to close the app entirely when a thought crossed her mind.  She opened Nyah's profile.  \"Let's see how many revisions Nyah is on.  I wonder if she gave herself those boobs all in one go or if she kept increasing them bigger and bigger as time went on?\"  Laura's face fell when Nyah's profile indicated no revision history.  \"No way is that bitch natural,\" Laura snarled around a mouthful of food.  \"Fuck, I guess she is.\"  Laura did a slow burn.  Why was everyone so naturally gifted except for her?  Why was she the one who had to use the app to give herself the life she deserved?  Out of curiosity Laura flipped to Jason's profile.  \"Jason HAD to have gotten a boost, he couldn't have gotten that ripped on his own.\"  After a quick inspection revealed that Jason also had no revision history Laura cursed. \"Fuck,\" she slammed the phone down and ignored it until she was done eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe angrily swiped the phone back up off the counter and was greeted by the sight of Jason's profile again, only this time he was naked.  \"Hello...\" Laura purred to herself.  Jason had a rock hard erection fully displayed and Laura was pleasantly surprised at its size.  \"One day that's going to be all mine.\"  She navigated back to Nyah's profile and was surprised then enraged that Nyah was naked as well.  \"I bet they're fucking right this second!\"  She fumed.  \"Fuck this big-titted whore, let's see if she can keep Jason with a-cups.\"  Laura's mouth twisted into a mean spirited grin as she watched Nyah's spectacular breasts deflate as she dragged the \"breast size\" slider down to zero.  Without hesitation her thumb flicked across the \"apply changes\" button.  \"What the fuck!\"  Laura exclaimed as an error displayed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning, this profile has been safety locked by another user.\"  The app blinked repeatedly until Laura acknowledged the error, bringing her back to naked Nyah.  Nyah's nipples were standing at full attention and her skin was flushed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stupid bitch is probably getting a better orgasm tonight than I did,\" Laura grumbled and went back to Jason's profile.  Her phone buzzed, signaling that she had just received an email.  She ignored it so she could concentrate on altering Jason's profile.  Laura dug through menu after menu in Jason's mental and emotional settings until she finally found what she was looking for.  \"Love interests\" displayed a handful of names.  The few at the bottom were girls Laura didn't recognize and one she did, her friend Nikki.  All of them were labeled \"sexual fantasies.\"  Apparently Jason occasionally had dirty thoughts about other girls, good.  That should make it easier to worm him away from Nyah.  Laura and Nyah's name were toward the top.  Laura was labeled, \"old friendship\" and \"intense sexual attraction.\"  Nyah's name was at the top of the least over Laura's.  Laura was expecting this but it still irked her.  Nyah's label was \"long term monogamous relationship\" and \"soul mates.\"  Laura snorted.  She selected the label next to Nyah and copied the data from it to her own label in addition to \"old friendship,\" then erased Nyah's, leaving it blank.  She laughed as she tapped \"apply\" then cursed as once again the app flashed an error at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning, this profile has been safety locked by another user.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slammed the phone down in frustration then angrily cleared the dishes from her meal.  Her phone buzzed indicating she had received another email as she picked it up.  Opening her email she saw two new emails with the subject \"Strike One\" and \"Strike Two.\"  The sender was blank.  Curious, Laura opened the \"Strike One\" email.  The message was short.  \" Some changes have big consequences and some people are off limits.  Please be more careful in the future.\"  There was no indication that the message had to do with the app but Laura's mind jumped immediately to this being in response to her trying to change Nyah with the app.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible,\" Laura said finally.  She opened the \"Strike Two\" email.  Like \"Strike One\" it was blank and had an empty field where it should identify who sent the email.  This message was slightly longer.  \"Princess, you've been warned once and chosen to ignore it.  You won't be warned again.  Do not attempt to interfere with me again or there will be consequences.\" Laura felt a chill run down her spine.  Did they intend to get revenge on her by altering her own profile?  She quickly returned to the app and opened her profile, searching through the settings to find the lock function.  It was right in front of her name, a faint padlock that was still in the unlocked configuration.  Laura confidently tapped the padlock then groaned as yet another error message displayed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only unrevised profiles can be safety locked.  Do you wish to return to your original profile revision?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura's thumb hovered indecisively over the options to choose either \"Yes\" or \"No.\"  Part of her, a big part, wanted to keep this amazing new body she had given herself.  She had barely had the opportunity to really try it out yet!  But at the same time she was worried about what she had apparently become in this reality.  A cold bitch?  Someone who had random unprotected sex in club restrooms with complete strangers?  Someone who was plotting to destroy a happy relationship for the sake of jealousy?  She had faced all of these questions less than an hour ago and had decided it was worth it but these strange emails had shaken her sense of invincibility.  Someone else out there had the app and could presumably change other people and themselves just like Laura could.  Had Laura gotten involved in something bigger than she had anticipated?  The thought of someone being able to change her without warning for the moment scared her more than anything.  Suddenly her original body didn't seem so bad, especially since there were much worse options.  She clicked \"yes\" and shut her eyes as a disorientating wave of sensations washed over her.  It wasn't even that she felt like she was shrinking, she felt like she was being carried through time and space and put into someone else's body.  An almost overwhelming wave of nausea settled over her and she coughed, barely able to hold back from vomiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there Lulu, slow down, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cautiously opened her eyes to find her sister leaning over her.  Laura cough/gagged again and looked around.  She was on the couch in her living room, an Anime was playing softly on the TV.  Vanessa took something out of her hands and at first Laura lunged for it, thinking it was her phone with the app.  Instead she realized it was a wine bottle.  Vanessa sat back down next to her and took a swig from the bottle.  A million thoughts ran through Laura's mind, and she wanted to ask them but all that she could croak out was, \"why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because kiddo, you're a lightweight, I don't need you yakking all over the living room,\"  Vanessa set the bottle down on the coffee table, just out of Laura's easy reach, and leaned back.  \"What did you say this show was called?  It's better than I was expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't even glance at the TV.  Was Vanessa spending time with her?  Was this a bonding moment?  Holy shit it was!  \"I love you so much,\" Laura threw her arms around her sister tried to give her a bear hug.  She sat up again realizing that the taste in her mouth must be wine.  \"How much did I have to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed.  \"Probably too much, you can NOT tell mom and dad I let you do this.\"  Vanessa's tone softened and she put her arm around her younger sisters shoulders.  \"And I love you too.  I am really sorry I ever you made feel this way but I'm glad we talked about it.  You can't keep stuff like that bottled up, it'll make you do something stupid eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura say in a thoughtful silence, wishing she knew what they had talked about.  Apparently it had been a good talk.  Memories from her alternate life swirled with her \"real\" memories and jumbled somewhere in there was the day she had lived today without the amazing body she had given herself?  Or was that just something she imagined because of the alcohol?  \"Where's my phone?\"  Laura asked when she realized it wasn't on her.  She needed to check the app.  She needed to know if that had been real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charging in your room I think,\" Vanessa took another swig of wine then turned to look at her sister more closely.  \"Are you OK?  You look worried about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Laura felt disoriented and confused, she didn't want whatever moment she having with Vanessa to end but at the same time she had to know whether any of the stuff with the app had really happened or not.  \"I think I need to go to bed,\" Laura attempted to stand and Vanessa had to quickly catch her as she wobbled unsteadily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably, let me help you upstairs.\"  Vanessa shut off the TV and helped Laura get to her bed.  Before she left she made sure a trashcan was at Laura's bedside.  \"I'll check in on you but if you have to puke this will help.  Laura lay back and nodded, the room felt like it was swaying.  \"Get some sleep, we'll hit the mall tomorrow and get you some new clothes and makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never realized how you felt, you always seemed so happy and comfortable with who you were, you have a great friend, you have no reason to feel like this.\"  Vanessa gave her a peck on the forehead.  \"My sister is NOT an ugly duckling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was speechless which Vanessa took as her cue to leave.  That's what they had talked about?  Laura's feelings of inadequacy and jealousy?  Laura felt tears begin to roll down her cheeks, she wasn't sure if it was tears of joy because she apparently had a better bond with Vanessa than she realized, or were they tears of shame for how she felt about herself?  Maybe both.  Laura could feel sleep closing in, whether it was the emotional release, the wine she had drank or just the fact it was almost one in the morning she couldn't stay awake any longer, not even long enough to check her phone.  Her last thought before finally passing out was still whether or not the app had been a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes opened to sunlight stabbing at them painfully.  She sat up and looked around, her head still felt fuzzy but she no longer felt like puking was only seconds away.  She fumbled around her nightstand and found her phone.  She had a short text from Vanessa, \"you were still sleeping when I got up, I had things to take care of but if you can meet me at the mall around eleven I'll still take you shopping like I promised.\"  Laura checked the time, it was a little after nine in the morning.  That should be plenty of time to meet Vanessa.  She quickly texted her sister back that she would meet her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone buzzed again, this time from Jason.  \"I'm bored u doing anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About to head to the mall, want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, when?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me at the bus stop in a half hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura crawled out of bed and rubbed her head.  Jason reminded her a fuzzy memory.  Had they had a fight yesterday?\"  Suddenly the memories of her day as a muscle goddess came rushing back.  The app!  She snatched her phone back up again, and unlocked it.  Was the app real or had yesterday been a dream?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura quickly found the Alterations app and opened it, she was immediately greeted be her profile.  A quick review showed that her profile was set at Revision 0 and was safety locked.  A small exclamation mark notation was next to \"Revision 0\" and she tapped it.  \"Reactivation of a previously applied revision will disable the safety lock feature. Do you wish to proceed?\"  Laura quickly clicked \"no\" for now.  She wasn't ready to mess the app again at the moment, it was more powerful than she first realized and she didn't have time to mess with it right now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura quickly showered, dressed and wolfed down some food before jogging to the bus stop.  She could see Jason standing at the bus stop as she approached it.  She could also see the bus pulling away and she cursed at her timing.  She gave up jogging and walked towards the bus stop instead, suddenly stopping as recognized one of the people who had just got off the bus.  It was Colin, who had been in Jason's band yesterday.  Colin walked past Jason without a hint that either one of them recognized the other.  Colin pulled a cigarette out and lit it as he walked past Laura, also without a glimmer of recognition.  Laura hesitated as they passed each other then looked back over her shoulder at his retreating back.  It was so weird seeing someone she had met and recognized in what was apparently an alternate reality but that here they apparently didn't know her.  If she did this much more often would her mind be able to keep track of this sort of thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resumed walking slowly then looked back over her shoulder at Colin again, he was turning up the walk to red house on the corner down the street from the bus stop just as a car Laura also recognized pulled up to the same house.  The unmistakable figure of Nyah exited the car and followed Colin up to the house.  Nyah was dressed in baggy unflattering clothes but it was still impossible to fully conceal the mammoth size of her breasts.  Laura literally stopped in her tracks to watch Nyah until she entered the house.  The posture and attitude of this Nyah was a night and day difference from what she had seen yesterday.  Yesterday Nyah had been wearing tight, flattering clothing and had looked confident and self assured.  Now she looked like she was trying to hide from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled up her phone and opened Nyah's profile.  Nyah's physical stats looked the same as yesterday but that was the only thing that was the same.  Relationships had no friends, romantic or otherwise, only family at which point Laura realized she was Colin's sister.  What had changed?  Had Jason been the positive influence in her life that had led Nyah to open up?  Laura stopped wondering about Nyah's life and instead wondered about her own life, specifically how different it might be if she had Nyah's breasts?  Laura could see that Nyah's profile was still safety locked but she could at least copy what the other girl had couldn't she?  Nyah was a thin girl, according to her information Laura had the same bra band size as her, which made her snort incredulously.  She wouldn't have thought the two had ANYTHING in common in their chest areas.  Laura hesitated then selected Nyah's breasts and hit \"copy\" on the clipboard icon, then opened her own profile and hit \"paste.\"  Laura gasped as the avatar on the phone screen swelled to the point of bursting out of her t-shirt.  The breasts looked even more dramatically large on Laura's frame and it took her a moment to realize that Nyah was six feet tall.  The height difference helped make her look at least slightly more proportional.  A series of warnings about muscle tone and probable back pain appeared on Laura's screen and she read through them before choosing \"see recommended alterations.\"  Laura gasped as body subtly changed to accommodate the massive breasts.  Her muscle tone in her shoulders and stomach dramatically improved and her hips widened to better match the proportion of her upper body.  \"Oh my God, I look unbelievable,' Laura breathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of an approaching bus caught her attention and Laura looked up to see that Jason had noticed her and was waving.  \"Laura come on, you're going to miss the bus!\"  Laura put her phone away and ran to join her friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura broke into a run to reach the bus managed to breathlessly board it right behind Jason.  The two took seats toward the back of the nearly empty bus.  Laura let out a sigh as she sat down, \"thanks for getting my attention, I was zoned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Jason looked out the window as the bus pulled away.  Laura noticed that Jason was looking in the direction of the house where Colin and Nyah lived.  Was that a coincidence or did he already know Nyah somehow?  After a moment he leaned back and pulled out his own phone to begin playing a game on it.  \"What are we going to the mall for?\"  He asked without looking up from his screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa is taking me shopping for some clothes and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Jason sounded mildly surprised since Laura and her sister had rarely spent much time with each other since the older girl had graduated high school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I'm actually kind of excited about it,\" Laura admitted.  Laura realized she really was legitimately excited about it.  Both because she was looking forward to spending time with her sister again and because beyond \"geek\" t-shirts for comics, TV shows or movies she didn't usually think much about clothes and makeup was something she almost forgot existed.  She felt as though she was about to learn some next level piece of forbidden knowledge.  Jason grunted something that was probably supposed to be some sort of agreement and continued to play his game.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed and pulled out her own phone, she hadn't intended to mess with app anymore for now but the sight of her potential new body when her phone unlocked caused her pulse to quicken.  She glanced guiltily in Jason's direction but he was lost in his own world.  She returned to regarding her digital self.  The version of Laura on her phone screen was naked from the waist up, the enormous breasts having outgrown both the t-shirt and bra she had been wearing.  Her shorts looked they were about to suffer the same fate due to her widened hips.  While her body had been far more muscular yesterday this version was a very sexy level of sleek musculature, her abs were noticeable and her shoulders and pecs were well rounded and strong looking without a shredded bodybuilder look.  Laura spun the model around to look at it from all angles and was appreciative of the finely muscled back.  \"All the better to lug those boobs around,\" she thought to herself.  She was pleasantly surprised to notice that her backside had received a considerable upgrade, her hips had not only been widened, her ass had become well rounded, to the point her shorts had split open revealing panties that were straining to not do the same.  Her legs had been tweaked to fit the new hips as well, not overtly muscular but well shaped, they narrowed down to shapely calves.  Laura desperately wanted to push the \"Apply Changes\" button and start living life in this new body, it looked incredible.  But how would she change it?  She was kind of afraid of using the historical option again, she'd didn't like the idea of potentially waking up in a new reality where she had changed into a person she didn't like or losing her friends again.  Applying instant changes seemed like a bad idea, how would she explain to anyone how she had transformed so dramatically?  She dug through the options and found a progressive setting that looked like it would incrementally change her body from what it was now to what she wanted it to become over a period of time but that had its own problems.  Too fast and it would still seem weird.  Waiting a long period of time not only seemed horribly frustrating, she'd also be buying new clothes and bras constantly in the meantime.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a sigh of frustration and decided to put off doing anything with herself for now.  She was about to close the app when she remembered something from last night.  Guiltily sneaking a glance at Jason she switched to his profile instead, remembering how good he had looked naked the last time she looked at him with the app.  She kept sneaking glances as Jason as she worked on his profile, she didn't want him to catch her at what she was doing.  The first thing she figured out how to do was remove his digital clothes.  It didn't take long to find \"Display options\" and toggle between \"real time clothing\" and \"nude.\"  Laura was both happy to see Jason's surprisingly large member again and disappointed that his body in this reality was scrawny rather than the gorgeously well cut body he had yesterday.  Laura played with the muscle slider, nudging it all the way up to almost four hundred pounds.  He looked incredible at any size, did he have a natural affinity for muscular development that was currently untapped or did the app automatically synchronize things like proportion?  She reverted him back to his normal size and switched tabs to take her mind off of it, she was starting to get worked up.  Laura found herself in Jasons mental tab.  She glanced down at his relationships.  Like the Jason of the other reality this one had a healthy selection of girls in the \"sexual fantasies\" column though more of these were actresses or models than people Laura actually knew.  She was mildly surprised Nyah wasn't anywhere to be seen, apparently Jason didn't know who she was after all.  Laura wasn't very surprised that Vanessa was high on his list with tags like \"strong sexual attraction\" and \"crush.\"  She was surprised though to find her name with both \"long term friendship\" and \"conflicted feelings.\"  What the fuck did that mean?  Laura went back to Jason's main profile page and re-enabled his clothing display.  She was about to exit the app and put her phone away when she noticed that unlike Nyah, Jason's profile wasn't locked in this reality.  What had been different in the other reality that Jason's profile was locked there but not here?  And what did that mean for Laura?  Just because she could change her friend should she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up from her phone, the bus wasn't far from the mall now, if she was going to do anything with the phone now would the time, otherwise who knew how long it would be before she had the opportunity again?</span></div></div>",

If she was going to mess with either Jason's body or her own she wanted more time to decide on what changes she was going to make and how she was going to implement them.  Making a hasty decision seemed like a bad idea.  Especially after yesterday's experiment with the app that had seemed well planned.  \"C'mon,\" she elbowed Jason in the ribs, \"we're almost there.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up then back at his phone, \"almost done,\" he mumbled.  Laura wasn't sure if he was talking to her or himself, she rolled her eyes as he continued working on whatever he was doing on his phone.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura laughed, recognizing the old game.  Jason must have downloaded an emulated version of it for his iPhone.  \"That man is playing Galaga! He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did!\"  Laura elbowed him in the ribs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha,\" Jason elbowed her back as he tried to evade incoming enemy fire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No quippy Tony Stark quote in return or anything?\"  Laura continued jostling him with her elbow and laughing, now concentrating on his arm instead of ribs for maximum game disruption.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I have a plan, attack,\" Jason said with obvious distraction, he began trying to jab Laura back with his own elbow without dropping his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your game is weak,\" Laura giggled.  \"Both of them.\"  She stopped with a squeak of surprise as one of Jason's elbow attacks slipped past her and hit her directly in the boob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason immediately realized what he had done and began turning beet red with embarrassment.  \"Oh my God, I am SO sorry,\" he put his phone down and reached towards Laura as though to help then realized he had no idea what to do, how to do it or where to put his hands.  \"Shit, I am so sorry,\" he repeated as he picked up his phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed \"It's fine, I'll live.  It startled me more than it hurt,\" she rubbed her boob and tried not laugh as Jason turned even more red.  \"And good aim, it's not like they're big targets or anything.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mouth dropped open and Laura couldn't help but laugh at the expression of horror on his face.  With the air of a student saved by the bell Jason looked relieved when the bus stopped and the announcement that they had arrived was made.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura texted her sister after they got off the bus and only a few minutes later Vanessa joined them outside the mall entrance.  \"Hey Lulu, I already got you some stuff but the rest you need to try on.\"  Vanessa greeted Laura with a hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, what did you get so far?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No peeking,\" Vanessa playfully slapped at Lauras hand as it went towards the bags Vanessa was carrying.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Vanessa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jason, I didn't expect to see you tag along.  Laura warned you we're shopping for girly stuff and you'll probably be bored right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was bored anyway, might as well be bored hanging out with people I like.\"  The easy exchange between the two took Laura by surprise.  Usually Jason seemed very subdued around Vanessa.  But then usually Vanessa didn't usually talk directly to him.  Momentarily Laura had a feeling like a half forgotten memory that Vanessa and Jason had been a couple.  But that hadn't ever happened had it?  But at the same time Laura could clearly remember once being of the strongest women who had ever lived and that hadn't technically happened either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK Laura,\" Vanessa touched her arm and leaned in close to look at her eyes. \"You're over last night right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened last night?\"  Jason asked before Laura had a chance to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing of course.  We are two well behaved girls of less than legal drinking age so of course nothing happened,\" Vanessa winked at Jason and put her finger over her lips in the universal sign of \"shh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa!\"  Laura said with some shock.  \"I'm fine, let's just go OK?\"  Now it was Laura's turn to blush, she could feel her ears burning.  Why was she embarrassed?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jason are you sure you'er going to come with or do you want us to catch up with you later?\"  Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glanced at the bags of shoes, jewelry and make-up and looked like he was having second thoughts.</span></div></div>",

Laura expected Vanessa to laugh but instead was surprised to see her sister looking thoughtful.  \"You're not interested in Jason are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shrugged.  \"I don't know, I never really thought about it.  He's tall, his complexion has cleared up a lot in the last year or so, he could stand to dress a little better and maybe wash his hair more often though.  Hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fucking with me right now?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, are you fucking with me right now?  I always figured you two were either already hooking up or that you were planning to, I'm not going to step in between you two.\" She paused.  \"Unless you're offering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I mean I don't know.\"  Laura slowed her pace a bit as she thought about it and Vanessa followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough of a no for me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, thought back to the odd memory/vision of Jason and Vanessa as a couple she had experienced earlier.  \"But why would a guy be interested in me if you're around?\"  Laura blurted out, then immediately wished she could take it back.  \"I mean...\" all the feelings of inadequacy and jealousy she had felt yesterday morning came rushing back, \"I don't know what I mean,\" she finished lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lulu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me Lulu, I'm not a kid anymore,\" Laura snapped.  \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.  I don't know what's wrong with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"  Vanessa said firmly.  She stopped walking and grabbed Laura by the shoulders, turning her so they were face to face.  \"There is NOTHING wrong with you.  Not a thing.\"  Laura opened her mouth and Vanessa shook her head.  \"No, listen to me before you say one more word.  You are a good looking girl.  You have put me above you on some pedestal and are comparing yourself to me and you're hurting both of us by doing it.  You're wrecking your own confidence and you're going to make yourself resent me which isn't fair to me because I love you.  I. Love. You.\"  Vanessa emphasized.  Laura was suddenly afraid her sister was going to cry and that she'd have one more thing to feel bad for.  \"C'mon, let's go sit down.\"  Laura allowed Vanessa to lead her to a nearby bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa set down her shopping bags and turned to face her younger sister.  \"Do you want to know a secret?\" Vanessa finally asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked confused.  \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa leaned in close and said in a conspiratorial whisper, \"There are prettier girls than me out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura immediately bristled, \"but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing, there are.  There are girls with prettier faces, bigger boobs, better butts, whatever.  I work with what I have, you need to work with what you have.  And don't even tell me that what you have isn't good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wanted to feel angry, to complain about her lack of assets but at the same time she felt like there was a glimmer of hope.  \"What do I have that's good?\"  She asked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh kiddo,\" Vanessa brushed Laura's hair away from her face.  \"Do you really not see it?  You have big beautiful eyes.  When you smile they light up and you have a very pretty smile.  You have nice teeth, nothing is missing, crooked or snaggly, you have a good clear complexion, you have nice hair, you're not too skinny, you're not too fat.\"  Laura began to shake her head with frustration and Vanessa stopped her again.  \"It's about presentation and it's about attitude,\" Vanessa said.  If I had thought you cared about this sort of thing I would have taught you a long time ago but I thought you liked the tomboy thing you had going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura rolled her eyes.  \"I'm not a tomboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed.  \"You don't wear makeup, you don't do anything with your hair except maybe put it in a ponytail,\" Vanessa tugged on Laura's ponytail for emphasis, \"you wear jeans and t-shirts all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wearing shorts right now,' Laura said indignantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean shorts,\" Vanessa snorted, poking at the hemline that was just above Lauras knee.  \"Laura, trust me.  I will show how good you can look and how plain I can look and I will make you understand how superficial all this is if I have to beat it into your stubborn head,\" Vanessa was chuckling as she rapped the top of Lauras head with her knuckles but Laura wasn't sure whether or not she was joking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n====================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of hours went by quickly as Vanessa led her younger sister from store to store, all the while expounding on the theories behind body types and clothing choices.  By the end some of it was actually starting to make sense to her.  \"You're not very curvy,\" Vanessa said at one point, \"there's nothing wrong with that, it just means you have to pick out clothes that draw the eye to the different parts of your body as though you were.\"  Or makeup color choices, or hair styling tips, or just general advice on posture and attitude.  \"There are girls who could be amazing if they didn't dress and act like they were trying to hide from the world,\" Vanessa said at one point.  Laura immediately thought of the world of difference she had seen between Nyah today and yesterday.  One was obviously insecure and self conscious, the other had been like a barely contained force of sexual nature.  And Laura had seen for herself that there had been little difference in her physical statistics.  Laura began to feel a flicker of real hope and confidence about herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word Vanessa was demonstrating how plain she could look.  She had brushed her hair into a plain ponytail, washed off most of her makeup, bought a loose fitting t-shirt and a pair of jean shorts that weren't skin tight.  She finished it off with a pair of Chuck Taylor's, the first shoes without heels Laura had seen her sister wear in a long time.  She looked... normal.  Non-threatening.  Like someone Laura could spend all day hanging out with and not feel self conscious around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at herself in a full length mirror as Vanessa put the finishing touches on her makeover and she almost didn't recognize herself.  Whatever Vanessa had done to her hair looked amazing.  Even though Laura still didn't fully understand things like volume and body and how to use them to her advantage Vanessa had made her hair look like a shampoo commercial with a full and wavy cascade of hair framing her face.  She was wearing a loose fitting short sleeve top that was cut off at her midriff.  Vanessa had looped a thin gold chain around Laura's waist and apparently she had just enough hips to keep it from falling straight off of her body. \"This is one of the areas you want draw the eye,\" Vanessa had explained.  The top was cut with a v-neck that was both wide and low and in that gap, hanging  down to where she would have cleavage had she been better endowed, was a necklace Vanessa had helped her pick out.  \"It helps draw the eye this way also, seriously kid, you look really good.\"  Laura fidgeted and plucked at the hem off her denim mini skirt.  \"Stop that,\" Vanessa scolded with a chuckle, \"it's covering what it needs to, you're supposed to show off the rest.\"  Vanessa gave her a playful swat on the butt and in response Laura wobbled slightly on the low heeled sandals Vanessa had picked out for her.  A small charm bracelet hung from one ankle.  Laura had to admit, she looked good, better than she thought she would.  Her face broke into an unrestrained grin.  The minimalist makeup Vanessa had artfully applied to her lips, cheeks and eyes really did make her features \"pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, all decked out from head to toe,\" Vanessa finally said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Laura said, wrapping her arms around Vanessa in a combination between a a tackle and a hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweat Lu... Laura.  Anytime you need me, I'm here for you.  Now don't cry, you're going to smudge your makeup.  Don't make me cry either,\" Vanessa added after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises,\" Laura said with a sniffle.  Finally Laura let go of her sister.  \"OK, let's collect my wayward nerd and head back.\"  She began texting Jason to meet them at the entrance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"b there in 5\" he texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Vanessa were waiting for him and Laura almost laughed out loud when he almost walked past them both then did an obvious double take when he finally recognized them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he said involuntarily.  He blushed.  It was nowhere near as dramatic as earlier but it was still obvious.  It looked like he was trying to get up his courage to say something, finally he did.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura and Jason sat in silence for a few moments.  She gave his hand an absent minded squeeze and thought about the idea of the two of them being a couple.  It felt like some form of tension she didn't realize had existed was now gone.  \"So,\" she said finally, \"are we, \"going back to your place?\"\" She giggled as she said it and looked at Jason to confirm her suspicion that it would probably make him blush again.  She was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want,\" he answered with a shrug.  \"I guess I'm not sure what we should do.\"  He began to shrug again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't say anything, instead she grabbed Jason's arm in mid shrug and drew it around her waist, leaning as close to him as she could.  They remained like that, in relative silence for the rest of their bus ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they exited the bus and Jason turned to start walking towards his house, Laura hesitated to glance in the direction of Colin and Nyah's house.  She cursed inwardly when she realized Nyah was leaving the house and walking towards her car.  She quickly resumed her pace, willing Jason not to look in Nyah's direction.  It was silly because in this reality Nyah and Jason apparently had no idea the other existed but Laura couldn't shake the feelings of jealously towards the other girl that carried over from her experience yesterday.  If they saw each other would it be a love at first sight type of thing?  Laura was just beginning to breathe a sigh of relief that Jason hadn't noticed Nyah when both of their attention was drawn towards someone yelling \"Head's up!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyah was walking at a brisk pace towards her car with her head down so she wasn't ready for some younger boy to dart out and chuck a water balloon at her.  Despite his mocking warning Nyah didn't react fast enough and the water balloon exploded on impact, directly on her chest, drenching her and causing even the baggy, shapeless shirt she was wearing to cling to her bust, leaving nothing to the imagination.  \"Too slow, tits!\"  The boy ran away laughing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little shit!\"  Nyah screamed.  She stomped her foot in frustration and then stood motionless in her driveway for a moment, seemingly frozen in place with a combination of anger and misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt awful for the other girl, she couldn't even imagine being publicly humiliated like that.  She tried to hurry away before Nyah noticed that her embarrassment had been witnessed by anyone other than her delinquent attacker but realized that Jason had stopped motionless in his tracks to stare.  \"Jason,\" Laura hissed to get his attention and tugged at his hand.  \"Jason come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyah stomped her foot again and looked up, locking eyes with Jason.  \u201cTake a picture, it\u2019ll last longer,\u201d she snarled before turning on her heel and stomping back into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, come on,\" Laura repeated with impatience.  This time Jason allowed himself to be led away, though he paused to make a self adjustment before continuing.  \"Seriously?\"  Laura fumed, instantly forgetting that a moment ago she had felt sorry for Nyah.  \"Did you seriously just get a hard on from that wet t-shirt show?\"  Jason tried to stammer out an apology but for the moment Laura wasn't having any of it. </span></div></div>",

How is your date with Jason going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over already.  Can we talk again?  I think I need some advice.\"  Laura glanced back over her shoulder.  Jason was walking morosely back in the direction of his own house with his head down and his hands in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, r u ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, I'll be home soon.\"  Laura put her phone away and walked home as briskly as the unfamiliar heels would allow.  She felt like the last two days had been a non-stop emotional roller coaster and she was tired of it.  She was relieved that Vanessa was still in her dressed down casual attire, she wasn't sure if she would have been able to handle being around her right now if she had her boobs on display like usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura what's wrong?\"  Vanessa asked as she let her younger sister in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't answer until she after she flopped down on the living room couch.  \"I had a fight with Jason and it was probably stupid but I'm still mad about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"  Vanessa sat cross legged on the couch next to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason got turned on looking at another girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, \"Yes,\" Laura paused, \"I'm sure, Jason has a big dick, it was pretty noticeable.\"  Laura felt her cheeks flush as she remembered how big his dick was according to his stats in the app.  His display a few minutes ago have her no reason to doubt the apps accuracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does?\"  Vanessa sounded like she was both incredulous and curious.  \"What was going on?  Was he being a pervert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \"No, not unless you count staring as being pervy.  He was...\"  Laura shook her head and started over.  \"This girl was walking to her car and some kid ran up and nailed her right in the tits with a water balloon; as a prank I guess.  Her boobs are enormous and with her shirt soaked they REALLY stuck out.  Jason just kept staring while I was trying to drag him away.  She noticed him staring and got angry and yelled at him, that was when I noticed he had a hard on.  It just pissed me off so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa put a consoling arm around her sister.  \"Oh kiddo, I really don't know what to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know either, I just wish I was bigger, I mean I feel ridiculous even wearing this new bra, it's not like I need it or anything,\" Laura grouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be that way,\" Vanessa said shaking her head.  \"Yea, I got my breasts from mom and yours are more like Aunt Gina but you know Aunt Gina modeled for a while right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I forgot,\" Laura said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, she did some Calvin Klein stuff back in the day and some other things.  Then she stopped to have kids and never got back to it.  But the point is you and Aunt Gina look a lot alike and you know she's pretty.  She'd have to be to married as many times as she has been,\" Vanessa said, hoping to get a laugh out of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's taller than I am,\" Laura said sullenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa let out a sigh, \"This is exactly what we were talking about earlier, you can't keep comparing yourself to other people, there is always going to be someone different than you, but that doesn't always mean better.  Be happy with what you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I didn't have to be?  What if I could change it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?  Plastic surgery?  Don't go there Laura, you're fine the way you are.\"  Laura sat silently, but the glare she gave Vanessa spoke volumes.  \"Besides,\" Vanessa said, \"from what you described I don't know how much I'd blame Jason.  I'm not going to say that all men are pigs that are going to ogle women every chance they get but what you describe it doesn't sound like he was going out of his way to check this girl out, it just kind of happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Laura said mournfully after a moment.  \"I know I probably blew it out of proportion.  I don't know what to do about it now though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call him and talk to him would probably be a good first step, you two have been friends for a long time, this seems like a silly thing to risk losing that over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sat lost in thought before finally replying, \"Yea, I should call him.\"  She got up from the couch and gave her sister a hug.  \"Thanks for talking about this with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Lulu, I mean Laura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lulu is fine.  Well maybe once in a while, just don't over do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma-am,\" Vanessa gave Laura a mock salute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked slowly to her room and closed her door behind her before she pulled out her phone.  She opened the app and stared at the image of the body she could give herself with the push of a button.  She still had doubts about the risks and whether or not it would be worth it but at the same time she kept thinking how much easier her life might be if she were to change her body.  Vanessa seemed pretty sure Laura should stay the way she was but then again, Vanessa didn't know about the app and what did she know about the way Laura felt anyway?  Vanessa had been gorgeous since she was in middle school.  Laura couldn't decide what she wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

She kept the tweaked mashup of her body with Nyah's breasts and tried to decide what time frame should would use for implementing her body.  After her previous experience with the historical setting Laura was very hesitant to try it again.  At first she started dabbling with the settings for gradual or \"staged\" implementation but quickly decided she was too impatient.  Laura scaled the time to \"full implementation\" from six months, to two months, to three weeks, then just skipping it and choosing instant instead.  She wanted this now and damn the consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger flicked across the \"Apply changes\" button and was surprised to see a series of warnings pop up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caution:  Drastic changes from the users baseline may require the use of staged implementation.  Instant or accelerated timeframes can cause potential injury or other complications.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Immediately after pushing the button Laura felt a wave of warmth rush through her body, it started deep in her chest and radiated outward, leaving her skin tingling and her nipples standing at attention.  \"Whoa,\" she breathed.  The tingling sensation slowly intensified until it abruptly vanished with hardly any gradual fadeout.  Another pulse of heat emanated from her chest, rushing outward with an intensity that was so powerful and startling, she dropped her phone.  Likewise the tingling was even more intense, though instead of her skin this one seemed to settle more into the muscles of her upper body.  Her whole body stiffened as it increased to an almost painful level before again abruptly vanishing.  This time she was expecting the next pulse but it still didn't prepare her for the even more escalated intensity.  An involuntary moan escaped her lips and her whole body trembled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, I don't know if I can handle an entire hour and a half of this,\" Laura gasped in the momentary reprieve between the disappearance of the current pulse and the onset of the next.  This one flashed through her body and settled in her breasts, the intensity growing until she cried out again, not with pain but with the overwhelming sensitivity her nipples suddenly possessed, it seemed like she was aware of every nerve ending against the fabric of her bra.  She clapped her hand over her mouth the instant before the next pulse caused her to cry out again.  She didn't want Vanessa or anyone to hear her and assume she was having phone sex with Jason or something.  She giggled momentarily at the thought but it was cut off as another shockwave went through her body.  This one was powerful enough so that sagged down to lay across her bed, her body going limp as though it felt every nerve ending was being overloaded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt continued on like this for what felt like hours, the pulses alternating between focusing on her skin, her muscles or, with an always escalating intensity, her breasts.  After only a few minutes she couldn't stop groping her breasts, checking to see if the latest pulse added any size and if so how much.  It sent her now hypersensitive nipples into overdrive and it wasn't too long after that she began rubbing at herself through her panties.  Another moan escaped her lips as the current pulse definitely added enough meat to her chest that she could grab a handful of breast flesh and squeeze.  It was like sending electrical jolts of sexual energy throughout her entire body and she tore her soaked through panties entirely off and plunged a finger deep inside herself as the next pulse hit, making her whole body quiver both with the energy from the app and the sexual sensations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand never strayed far from her crotch after that point though her other hand roamed across her entire body, caressing her legs, squeezing actual full and round butt cheeks, exploring the cobblestone like abs that were forming, feeling the firm new delts and biceps.  She was nowhere near as strong or developed as she had been yesterday but it was amazing to have better muscular development again.  Her bra was becoming extremely painful so she took a moment to tense the muscles in her chest and arch her back which caused it to split with a loud crack.  She moaned with ecstasy at how it felt to grope her swelling mammaries without the bra in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, everything going OK in there?\"  Vanessa called from the hallway.  There was a mixture of playful teasing and possible concern in her voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was too wrapped up in how her body felt to even be angry.  \"Everything is WONDERFUL,\" she exclaimed, not even trying to hide the overtones of sexual ecstasy in her voice.   This was punctuated by the seam in the ass of her mini skirt loudly tearing across her widening hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll let you be,\" Vanessa sounded sheepish as she retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura relished every second of her transformation, from the moment her breasts finally exploded through her new top to the moment she felt the last pulse fade from her body and every body quaking orgasm in between.  Breathless from the hour and a half of sensory overload and sexual release she struggled to her feet to walk across the room and regard herself in her dresser mirror.  For a moment she was almost overwhelmed by her vastly different center of gravity but in a few steps she was fine, like her body had always been this way.  \"Oh my GOD, I look even better in reality than I thought I would.  Laura hefted her breasts in her hands, marveling at how full and round and real they were.  She tweaked a nipple and went weak in the knees from the sensation.  With that she turned back to her bed and passed out.</span></div></div>",

She rolled over to get up and squeaked with surprise as she rolled onto her own boob, pinching it between her body and her numb arm.  \"Ouch,\" she exclaimed, rolling onto her back instead.  The weight of her breasts pushing straight down onto her chest made it surprisingly difficult to breathe, after a moment she sat up and cradled them in her arms.  \"Guess it wasn't a dream after all,\" she purred as she massaged at her still sore breast.  \"Huh, never had to worry about that before,\" she observed, referring to both the danger of squashing her breasts with her own body and to having breasts large enough to impair her breathing.  She rubbed her head groggily and looked around her room.  It stank of sex from her marathon self pleasuring session last night and even in the dim light of the barely risen sun she could see the remnants of her ruined wardrobe scattered across the floor.  She felt a moment of regret on seeing the state of her brand new clothes but then shrugged.  \"Worth it,\" she opined as she flopped back down on her back and spent a moment reminding herself of how amazing her new breasts felt and how sensitive her new nipples were.  Finally she sighed and dragged herself out of bed, she had to pee.  Laura groaned in frustration after failing to pull on a pair of her panties.  Predictably there was also nothing in her wardrobe that would even come close to fitting over her new chest.  Finally she just shrugged and ventured out of her room naked, nobody was likely to be up this time of the morning anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the restroom Laura decided it wasn't just her room that smelled like sex, she was smelling pretty fragrant all on her own.  She wanted to get out of the house as quickly as possible to buy herself time to figure out how she was going to explain her transformation to her family but at the same time she didn't think she wanted to go out in public smelling like she currently did.  After only a moment of hesitation she opted to take a quick shower.  Because she was in a hurry she only towel dried her hair and left the bathroom with a bathtowel awkwardly attempting, and mostly failing, to preserve her modesty.  As she crept down the hallway Laura could hear the faint sound of music coming from Vanessa's bedroom.  Sometimes Vanessa fell asleep with her radio playing (something Laura suspected she mainly did to cover up when she had a guy over) but Laura hadn't heard anything earlier so she assumed that meant Vanessa was now awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grabbed an old beach bag from her room and tossed her wallet, phone, a book and some sun screen into it while frantically wracking her brain over what she was going to wear so she could venture out into public.  She quickly detoured into the laundry room and managed to scrounge up a pair of Vanessa's bikini bottoms that were uncomfortably tight but at least sort of fit.  Tops were a little more difficult, she finally succeeded in finding a button down work shirt that probably belonged to Greg.  Buttoning it was out of the question but she was able to tie it off below her breasts which almost looked like something someone would wear on purpose.  She snagged a widebrim floppy straw hat of her mother's and a pair of aviator sunglasses that covered most of her face that she thought might have been her dad's.  Feeling somewhat secure in her makeshift outfit she turned to leave.  Her plan was to hopefully hide out on the beach for a while until someplace opened where she could get clothes that fit her new body.  After that her plans was a little more vague.  Come home and say, \"Surprise everyone, I grew a huge pair of tits overnight?\"  She shrugged and reached for the backdoor.</span></div></div>",

People were still pretty sparse on the beach at this hour but Laura obviously attracted what little attention there was available as she walked towards the boardwalk.  She could feel the smile on her face widen with each turn of a head or double take from the people around her.  She had never got attention like this and it felt fantastic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a stretch of sand not far from the boardwalk to lay a towel out on.  She sat and began applying sunscreen to herself.  A cluster of girls nearby were obviously pointing and talking about her, \"of course they have to be totally fake\" was said loud enough for her to hear.  Laura felt a pang of annoyance and wondered if Nyah often faced that accusation.  Laura made it a point to manhandle her boobs enough as she applied sunscreen to them that even a casual observer wouldn't doubt their reality.  She smirked as the girls packed up their things and moved further down the beach shortly afterward.  Laura lounged with book, soaking up the sun and the attention as the beach filled up for the day.

A group of teen boys who had apparently been trying to look down her shirt while she was napping scattered with absolutely zero subtlety when they realized she was no longer asleep.  Her phone buzzed as it received a text and she realized this must be what had woken her up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised to see it was a series of texts from Vanessa.  \"Laura r u ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found what u did 2 the clothes we bought yesterday, did u talk 2 Jason last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, where r u?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Laura was reading those another came in, \"I'm worried about u, please call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed and texted her sister back.  \"I'm fine, don't worry about me, I'll call later.\"  After a moment she sent another text, \"I didn't talk with Jason yet.\"  She looked at her phone and thought about Jason, really for the first time since she had pressed \"Apply\" on her phone last night.  Should she try to find him?  If she did how should she play it?  Let him know who she really was? Try to pretend to be somebody else?  She opened Jason's profile and regarded his list of relationships again.  Both her and Vanessa were near the top and she was irked to see \"conflicted' still being listed by her name.  A new entry was right below the two sisters, a question mark described as another \"sexual fantasy.\"  Laura clicked on the question mark and wasn't surprised to see it was an image of Nyah with her wet shirt plastered to her boobs.  \"Sexual fantasy has got to mean whacking material,\" Laura scoffed.  She was about to close his profile when she decided to take a look at the rest of his \"sexual fantasies.\"  She was a little startled but not exactly surprised to see that they were almost exclusively naturally large breasted models.  \"No wonder his brain froze up yesterday, seeing Nyah in a wet shirt must have been like a dream come true to him.\"  Laura's phone buzzed with another incoming text from Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If U need to talk I will always B here for U\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled, if she had been feeling down in the dumps she's pretty sure that gesture would have cheered her up.  Laura sat up and began to pack her things back into her beach bag.  As she stood up she noticed a middle aged man shuffling awkwardly away from her while trying to conceal his boner; she rolled her eyes.  Maybe not all of this attention was all that great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked to the boardwalk and picked a store that looked like it sold swimsuits more or less at random.  She quickly picked out a bottom she liked and a beach wrap but she was having trouble finding a top that fit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\"  The store employee actually gasped as Laura stopped digging through a rack and turned to face the voice that had addressed her.  She ignored the open mouthed stare of the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having trouble finding a top in my size,\" Laura said.  \"N,\" she clarified before the girl could ask the obvious next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, um...\" The girl looked at Laura's chest, around the shop, then back to Laura's chest.  \"I think we have some things that will probably work for you, it won't have a fitted band, you'll have to tie it yourself,\" the girl explained as she led Laura to a different section of the shop.  The girl showed Laura a selection of string bikini's that were obviously meant for larger women.  Laura looked at them skeptically but took a few to a fitting room.  \"I'm sorry we don't have a better selection for you but I think this is the best we'll be able to do.  Do you normally buy custom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm..,\" Laura was surprised at the question.  \"Yea, this was kind of an emergency though.\"  Did Nyah have to buy custom bra's and clothing?  That sounded like it would be a hassle.  The girl left Laura to try on her choices and Laura eventually found a couple that fit passably well.  She was worried that if she moved around too much she would fall out of them and she had to be kind of creative with her knot tying since there was a lot of excess string but it was good enough for now.  Laura paid for her items and left, starting to think about grabbing something to eat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby there was a snack bar that Jason tended to eat at a few times a week.  He claimed it was because he liked the food, Laura humored him but believed it had a lot more to do with him wanting to watch girls walk around in swimsuits while he ate.  Maybe she would bump into him there?  She shouldered her beach bag and walked briskly in the direction of the snack bar.  She was already starting to get a little irked by the traffic stopping nature of the attention she was getting, especially after hearing a few cat calls and even one request to \"put 'em on the glass.\"  She came to a stop when she saw Jason was sitting at the snack bar.  How did she want to approach this?  She didn't think he would recognize her, maybe she could play it off like she was someone else, or maybe she should just be open with him.  She sat down a couple seats away from him and tried to decide what her next move should be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was about to get out of her seat and move to sit next to Jason when one of the snack bar's employees approached her, \"What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to face him and winced as she squished one of her boobs between her chest and the edge of the counter.  She momentarily couldn't decide what to do, flop her boobs up onto the counter so she could lean in closer?  Hunch over so they were under the counter?  She sat back up straight in her chair and resisted the urge to rub at her possibly bruised breast.  \"Just a diet Coke for now,\" she said finally.  She paid and took the soda as it was passed to her over the counter.  She had to give this guy credit, he was mostly able to avoid looking down her valley of cleavage.  When he turned away and she was pretty sure no one else was looking she gingerly rubbed at her breast, it wasn't sore to the touch, maybe she would be lucky and it wouldn't bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyah hates those things.  I don't think she would consider it a sign of flattery that you copied them from her,\"  Laura jerked her hand away from her breast and turned with a start to her left.  A very pretty girl with extremely long, pale blonde hair sat there, engrossed in her phone.  Laura wasn't even sure at first that she had been the one who spoke to her until she continued, \"Not very imaginative, it looks like you just copied and pasted the breasts then took whatever compatibility tweaks the app suggested.  It doesn't look bad on you though.\"  The girl glanced up from her phone to give Laura an obvious appraisal.  \"The hips make it work for you, Nyah is too willowy, they look even more out of place on her than on you even if she is taller.\"  The girl entire demeanor was cold, clinical, detached.  Laura felt a chill despite the summer breeze as the aloof girl switched her focus back to her phone.  \"So how do you know Nyah?  She doesn't get out much and I know she doesn't have any friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...,\" Laura wasn't used to feeling like she was at a loss for words but this exchange was unsettling on so many levels.  Who was this girl?  How did she know Nyah?  She obviously knew about the app, what was she planning?  Laura was also intimidated by her beauty, the girl was so attractive it was eerie and the longer she looked at her the more overwhelmed Laura felt.  Gorgeous legs flowed out from under a tight pair of cut off daisy dukes, a flawless skin tone, an amazing hip/waist ratio, perfectly formed and perky breasts that obviously were not being supported by a bra.  This girl looked like she wouldn't be out of place on a runway full of supermodels despite being casually dressed in a plain white halter top and unbuttoned, oversized shirt.  Every feature could be described as \"perfect\" without exaggeration.  Laura sipped on her diet Coke to distract herself, it was starting to feel like she had been staring at the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't actually like diet do you?  You know you can eat or drink whatever you want right?\"  The girl paused to look at something on her phone screen more closely.  \"Yea, of course you can.  The only ones who change that are the ones who are into weight gain or bodybuilders who would lose their minds if they didn't keep on packing on more pounds of muscle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at her soda like it was a dangerous animal.  \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl looked away from her phone just long enough to roll her eyes, \"Seriously?  Why does no one read the documentation?  It isn't that fucking hard.  They encourage calorie excess, with the weight maintenance feature turned on the excess get funneled to the... you know what, never mind, if you cared you would have done the research on your own.\"  The girl arched her eyebrow as she looked back at her screen, obviously distracted from her rant. \"Those are really your natural eyes and cheekbones?  Wow, somebody hit the genetic lottery.\"  Laura was pleasantly surprised by the compliment.  Other than her own family telling her she was pretty, which she had always assumed they were required to do even if she were hideous, she had never really been complimented by a stranger.  \"You never said how you know Nyah,\" the girl said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wasn't sure how much she should tell this girl. She had no idea what the girls motivations were and telling her more than necessary may turn out badly.</span></div></div>",

I was getting off the bus and I think she lives right near the bus stop.  Some kid threw a water balloon at her and hit her right in the chest.  I got mad at my boyfriend for staring at her soaking wet boobs and then decided to see what it would be like to have them for myself.\"  This summary of events wasn't strictly false but it left out a lot.  She also surprised herself by describing Jason as 'her boyfriend.\"  She glanced in his direction and was disappointed to see that he no longer appeared to be at the snack bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl frowned thoughtfully while swiping at her phone screen.  \"Yea, she was pretty upset about the water balloon thing,\" she said absently.  \"That punk kid is going to push her too far one of these days,\" she paused to regard Laura again.  \"That's kind of a drastic change for you though, don't you think?  Are you after attention?  Self-esteem issues?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began to fold her arms over her chest then realized she wasn't quite sure how the logistics of that were going to work now.  She settled for putting her hands on her hips instead, \"Judgmental much?  What business is it of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my sister's boobs you copied so I'm making it my business.\"  The girl held her finger up to silence Laura as she continued talking. \"Other reasons I'm making it my business.  You obviously have the app, less people do than you probably think because of the implications of its use and the users can inadvertently affect each other if they aren't careful.  And you're dangerous so I wanted to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dangerous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl continued talking over Laura like she hadn't said anything.  \"You're impatient.  You didn't research the app, you just started fiddling.  You're also impulsive.  You saw Nyah last night and applied a change already so you're willing to take risks to get what you want.  And you're indecisive.  You're on revision 1 but you've reverted back to baseline and overwritten your previous revision 1 at least once.\"  The girl looked at Laura as she held a hand up to tick off the points she just made. \"So you, have the app,\" extended thumb, \"you're impatient,\" extended forefinger, \"impulsive,\" extended middle finger, \"and indecisive,\" extended ring ringer.  \"All those things together make you dangerous,\" she extended her pinkie finger as well and waved her now fully opened hand in front of Laura's face for emphasis.  The girl stood up, \"it looks like the attention those things bring is already starting to wear thin for you, ditch them before it's too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that just be even more, \"indecisive?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smirked which Laura found she liked even less than her typically neutral expression.  \"Nyah has had them her entire life and she's miserable.  All signs point to the fact that she always will be.  You do the math.\"  She turned away from Laura and the swirl of hair behind her was mesmerizing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"  Laura finally asked, before the other girl walked too far away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite your other issues you look like a smart girl Laura, I'm sure you'll figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was momentarily taken aback that the girl knew her name but quickly realized that since she been obviously looking in-depth at Laura's profile it shouldn't be surprising she knew her name.  Still, Laura was left with a lot to think about.  She pulled out her own phone while she finished her soda and went first to Nyah's profile.  Under her relationship tab it was easy to find her sister, Monica Frazer.  Laura was surprised when she attempted to open Monica's profile it failed to display and she received a message that only said, \"This operation cannot be completed due to an unknown error.  Please try again later.\"  Laura went back to confirm that she could still open Nyah's profile and even Colin's, however another attempt to open Monica's gave her the same result.  She sighed and regarded Nyah's profile again.  Was she really that miserable?  She looked like it today.  Her hair was unkempt, she wore no makeup, she looked like she had recently been crying and she was only wearing an oversized t-shirt and sweatpants.  \"Monica is wrong though, Nyah can be happy, I saw it,\" Laura said to herself.  \"There's no reason I can't be either.\"  She began to put her phone away then had a thought and pulled it out again.  \"Was Nyah so happy because she was dating Jason?\"  Laura wondered as she opened Jason's profile.  She read through his relationships and there had been no change to either her \"conflicted\" status or Nyah's \"unknown/sexual fantasy\" status.  She was surprised to see a brand new unknown at the top of his list with the descriptors, \"strong sexual attraction\" and \"crush.\"  Laura clicked on the question mark to see who it was Jason was crushing on but apparently didn't know personally.  She groaned when she immediately recognized who it was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like the unknown sexual fantasy in Jason's relationship tab that the app was tracking Nyah with, this question mark didn't link directly to a profile, but only to an image of the person Jason was thinking of.  And similar to the image of Nyah that had been focused on her soaking wet chest, this was an image that Laura immediately recognized as her rubbing her own breast when she had thought no one was looking.  She had to admit, she looked really good, her head was turned slightly away as she was scanning to see if anyone was watching, which combined with the oversized sunglasses and how her hair had dried with a bit of wave to it instead of her usual blow-dried straight hair, had probably all helped to contribute to the fact that Jason had apparently been unable to recognize her.  Well that and the fact that he had obviously not been focusing on her face.  Laura's rubbing at her possibly bruised breast made it appear that she was cupping her breast to exaggerate her already insane cleavage.  The enhanced musculature in her shoulders also helped change her profile, she look powerful as well as sexy in this image.  \"Wow, I really do look amazing,\" Laura acknowledged before she sighed and exited the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked around again in the hope of spotting Jason in the boardwalk crowd but still saw no sign of him. She tossed her phone in her beach bag and debated what she was going to do next as she began to wander aimlessly back towards the beach.  She realized as she walked that in addition to being openly leered at, many people were taking pictures of her as well.  Her earlier thought about sexual fantasies probably meaning whacking material came back to her and she suddenly wondered how many of these people would later masturbate and think about her?  She shuddered slightly, not sure what to think about the possibility.  Were these the sort of thoughts that drove Nyah to be miserable?  Laura's train of thought was interrupted as she recognized Jason ahead of her, walking along the beach in the general direction of her house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her really wanted to talk to someone about what she was going through and how she felt about her changes, maybe Jason would be the ideal person for that?  Or maybe she would be better off talking to Vanessa, her older sister seemed more accessible and easier to talk to than she had thought. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura instinctively began to jog to catch up to Jason, this lasted for only a few steps.  She quickly realized that moving even slightly faster than a walking pace was uncomfortable even with her enhanced musculature.  It also caused almost everything that was going on around her to come to a screeching halt as all attention quickly zeroed in on her and her incredibly bouncing bosom.  As though to emphasize this observation a nearby frisbee game resulted in a man being struck in the face as he failed to see the incoming disc while he obviously stared at Laura, she inwardly winced though based on his lack of reaction he may not have even noticed.  She slowed back down to a walk then stopped, feeling her face flush with embarrassment.  \"Never mind, I'll catch up with Jason later,\" she decided, turning in a random direction and walking, not ready to attempt running or jogging again anytime soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's mind wandered as she again considered the repercussions of her impulsive and extreme body alterations.  She still hadn't come up with anything remotely approaching a plausible explanation for what she would tell her family about her changes, and what about Jason?  If she did get together with Jason with this body would she end up wondering whether or not she and Jason could have ever ended up together if she hadn't changed?  Is that what the conflicted part of her relationship in Jason't profile was?  That he liked her but was turned off by her physical appearance?  That's not what he had said last night but she wasn't sure what to believe, especially since he had apparently all but fallen in love with her new self based on one good look.  She frowned as she realized where her aimless wandering had taken her.  She was approaching the local beaches outdoor gym where the local muscle heads hung out.  She was familiar with it, it would have been impossible to be Greg's younger sibling without being familiar with it.  She used to like coming here with him to watch the hardbodies work out but she had felt increasingly uncomfortable around and outclassed by the beach bunnies that hung around for the same reason.  Though as she stopped to consider it, her new body should allow her to fit right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though to prove her own point for her as she stood there on the outskirts of the outdoor gym crowd a bodybuilder she didn't recognize approached her, \"Hey honey, looking for something, or someone?\"  He openly examined Laura from head to toe, obviously enjoying what he saw.  He was short, barely taller than Laura, but his body was packed with an impressive amount of muscle.  On the other hand he suffered from obvious steroid acne and she found his smarmy attitude off-putting.  To reinforce her initial negative impression he grabbed her ass and smiled, \"because you may have just found him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura angrily slapped his hand his away then openly appraised his physique much as he had just done to her.  \"The last guy I was with was packing just over nine inches, it doesn't look to me like you measure up, stud,\" the last word dripped with as much sarcasm as she could muster and he slunk off, looking defeated but trying not to look broken by the harsh rejection.  As he left Laura could see that others had noticed her, guys working out were subtly making sure that she could see their efforts, and the nearby girls were pointing, whispering and beginning to form ranks, obviously intimidated by her.  She may be able to enjoy this she thought with a smirk.</span></div></div>",

Vanessa put the gun down on the kitchen table and stepped quickly up to Laura, grabbing her painfully by the boob.  \"What the fuck Vanessa?  That hurts,\" Laura protested as she jerked herself away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa let go and took a step back as Laura indignantly rubbed at her breast.  \"I thought maybe they were falsies,\" she said in a more conversation tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Falsies?

She was quivering and after a moment Laura realized that everything was growing, not just her breasts. She held her arm up and watched with incredulity as the muscles thickened and grew again.  At the same time her breasts surged painfully forward, tearing through her new bra and then straining at the now uncomfortably tight top she was wearing.  At the moment where it seemed like all the discomfort in her body was becoming too much for her to handle she could feel the now familiar sensation of being displaced from her own body and memories.  Everything was a disorientating blur and for moment she was convinced she was arriving in another reality where she was drunk again but then another much different feeling overwhelmed her senses and she cried out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was currently being fucked, and unlike the hazy memory of joylessly fucking some guy in a bathroom stall last night (did that really happen?) this was actually enjoyable.  She cried out again as a seriously large dick plunged deep and hard into her.  She tried to get her bearings but was momentarily overcome by a series of conflicting memories that caused splitting pain the more she tried to concentrate on them to determine which were real.  The very concept of real suddenly seemed very subjective and imprecise.  Her partner, whoever they were, seemed to sense that she was no longer fully participating and cradled her hips in powerful arms, pulling her hips even more forcefully into their thrust.  The feeling of pleasure was so intense it made her vision literally blur and she closed her eyes, reveling in the feelings.  She was on her back, and she could feel the weight of her large breasts wobbling with each body quaking thrust.  She brought her hands up to cradle them and gasped as her fingers closed over her sensitive nipples.  She began to play with them and tweak them as she continued to be pounded by her unknown lover.  Trying to recall who they were caused another wave of painfully confusion of memories and trying to look beyond her own heaving breasts just gave her the impression of someone immensely powerful, someone physically on par with her, a virtual wall of muscle with immense pecs and biceps dominating her view.  She closed her eyes and began to moan as she felt a powerful orgasm building within her.  Her lover slowed their rhythm slightly but if anything they thrust in even harder than before.  Laura arched her back and cried out with each thrust until she began screaming with pleasure as the best orgasm she could ever remember ripped through her body.  She clutched her breasts and lay almost completely limp in the aftermath as her partner continued to thrust and grunt until they came as well.  Laura sighed, enjoying the feeling as their penis quivered and pulsed inside her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Laura tried to focus on her memories and surroundings but was met with a sense of confusion and a series of overlapping memories that was so intensely disorientating it was painful.  Her lover flopped down onto the bed and draped an arm across her belly, \"Everything OK babe?  You got a little weird there towards the end, I was almost afraid you passed out for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stretched and snuggled closer to the immense body next to her, feeling at the same time totally familiar and totally alien with the sensation.  \"I'm fine, you just fucked me so hard I was literally seeing things,\" Laura laughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer partner rolled onto one elbow to Kiss Laura then also laughed.  \"I'm not sure whether I should be flattered or worried, I don't want to break you, you're one of the only people who can keep up with me.\"  Laura could finally see their face and was shocked to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was very surprised to see that the muscular behemoth who had almost fucked her into a state of unconsciousness was Jason.  Despite the immense slabs of muscle covering his body his face was still easily recognizable.  Though she noticed with some distaste that his hair was short enough to almost be mistaken for a buzz cut.  He rolled out of bed and stood stretching which Laura eagerly devoured with her eyes.  He was still at usual height of six foot one and still had the large cock that Laura had been drooling over since she learned he had it a couple days ago but that was it.  Every other inch of his body was dramatically different, covered with muscle, prominent veins and very little else.  He looked like he was ready to step onto the stage for a competition but she had never seen a competitor before who was tipping the scales at what had to be close to four hundred pounds.  He looked like he had been custom built to be sexually compatible with Laura's own immensely strong physique.  Laura stopped inspecting Jason to regard her own body.  She would be lying if she said she was sorry to see her muscles back, and she had also now had the boobs she had wanted.  She lay back and tweaked one of her own nipples again, shivering with pleasure at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go take a shower, be back in a few minutes,\" Jason said as he leaned over and gave her a peck on the lips.  She murmured some sort of generic approval and watched him stride out of the room, his muscles an endless display of barely restrained power as even the slightest motion set off cascades of ripples and flexing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was gone Laura rolled flat onto her back and tried to remember when she and Jason had started dating, whether or not this was the first time they had fucked, anything.  But every attempt to remember specific details about her past was met with a disorientating miasma of jumbled and conflicting memories and eventually a painful headache.  She groaned and then began searching the room for her phone.  She didn't recognize the room though something told her it was hers.  Though the more detail she picked out the more she thought it was shared with someone, Jason she assumed?  The king sized bed, the two sets of dressers, the jumbled array of his and hers clothes that obviously were more than just they had taken off for this love making session.  Laura finally found her phone and opened it, navigating it quickly to Jason's profile, she had to see whether this Jason was modified or natural.</span></div></div>",

Laura groaned inwardly.  Based on visual cues like weight sets, tubs of protein mix and other things like bodybuilding magazine scattered around the room she was pretty sure she had always had her muscles in this reality.  But when she tried to remember whether or not she had always had these breasts or if they were a recent addition using the app she herself starting another headache.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura's head still ached with jumbled memories that she couldn't make clear as she stepped out of the bedroom and into an apartment that was definitely not familiar. She turned one way down the hall and found the living room. A large couch sat against one wall, it looked both old and new at the same time since the fabric was still in good condition but the seat sagged terribly in the middle. Laura realized that Jason's huge body probably contributed to the general state of this particular piece of furniture. She looked down at her own naked and hyper-muscular form and realized that her own weight probably didn't help much either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this how big I was before?</i> she wondered to herself. <i>Am I bigger this time? I think I am.</i> A bolt of pain bounced around inside her skull and reminded her that the past was off limits for the time being; best to focus on the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to scanning the living room looking for clues as to her current living situation, personality, life, anything. Behind the couch was a framed poster for the anime Akira right next to a shelf containing numerous comic book collectables and action figures. Facing the couch was a very large television with half a dozen gaming consoles plugged in and wires, controllers, and games strewn about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly we're still nerdy, so that's good to know. Laura crossed the living room passing the kitchen and entering another hallway identical to the one she came from. She saw a set of doors leading to another bedroom and suddenly became very aware that she didn't know if she had any other roommates. Was walking around completely naked okay? Was someone going to see her? With a body like hers would they even care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly crept in and opened the door finding this bedroom had been converted to a very small gym. A bench on one end was loaded up with an insane amount of weight as was a standing machine on the other wall. In the back there were tons of free weights beginning at very heavy and getting ridiculously large. She returned to the bedroom where she had begun her journey. As she moved she relished how her body felt incredibly heavy and yet she had the power to move it so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust passed her bedroom door was one that lead to the bathroom, in here she found Jason. The shower was running but he wasn't in it yet, instead he was standing in front of the sink with his hands clasped flexing his enormous chest in the mirror. Laura watched as he relaxed and let his arms drop to his sides and began making his pecs bounce one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cleared her throat to announce her presence. Jason jumped slightly then blushed slightly. \"Didn't see you there,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were getting in the shower.\" She sauntered into the small space that was now quickly filling up with 2 enormous bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting there,\" Jason said with a grin. He hit a monstrous double bicep pose and Laura had to keep her mouth from hitting the floor as she watched mountains sprout up from Jason's arms which must have measured a good 27 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pressed her body in front of his so that she was between him and the mirror looking at their shared reflection. Just like Jason her height was unchanged so at 5' 4\" her head only really came up to about Jason's chin. She pressed her large body against his larger one and mimicked his pose. Though not nearly as large her arms were beyond impressive and looked to be around 23 inches, which looked even bigger on her smaller frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura could feel untold levels of power crackle in her arms which combined with the heat of Jason's naked body made her nipples tighten. She purred grinding her lower back against his crotch. \"Mmmmmm, I've missed this.\" After the words were out she realized that she was talking about the return of her muscles and strength. She became worried that this wouldn't make any sense to Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately he grinned. \"I know, I've missed you too. I'm sorry I've been on the road so much but it can't be helped right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Laura said. She didn't but she was glad to have fallen into a line of conversation that didn't raise any eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lowered his own arms and put his hands on Laura's biceps. She flexed harder at his touch. Then he slid his hands up over her shoulders and down her chest finally settling on her huge breasts. \"And I've missed these!\" he said squeezing roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a surprised moan and ground her hips even harder into his crotch. His penis was waking up again, she could feel the big rod touching her butt. She flexed her glutes to say hello and Jason responded by pressing his hips forward and mashing her breasts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Jason let out a frustrated growl and backed away from Laura, removing his hands from her body. \"Goddamnit!! You love to tease me so much. I'm already running late and the sexiest woman in the world just keeps tempting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one feeling let down,\" she said with a smile. Then she stepped forward and gently ran her fingers down his chiseled stomach to his penis which was standing at full erection. She gripped his tool tightly and let out a frustrated grunt of her own. \"Fine! Take your shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled at his beefed up lady. \"I don't have to head back out on the road until Wednesday. That gives us two whole days to play.\" He vanished into the shower but kept talking, \"In the meantime I promised Colin and Wendy that I'd talk over a new set list with them for the rest of the shows on the tour. They think we can get even more energy out of the crowd if we make a few changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin and Wendy, the names were familiar but as soon as Laura began trying to tie the threads of memory together she was wracked with a splitting headache. She put her hands to her temples and held back a scream, she didn't want to worry Jason and didn't even know where she would begin to explain what was going on when she didn't understand it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe? You still there?\" Jason called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she thought she did a pretty good job of holding back the pain in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to come along? I'm sure the guys would all love to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she said before she even realized what it was she was agreeing to. Once it was out there she desperately wanted to take it back but didn't know how to. She was going to go to a place that could have people that would make her headache worse. She decided that she would just have to do her best to focus on the here and now and not worry about the past until the app was done fixing whatever it had to fix.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura returned to her bedroom to look for something to wear. She pulled a black thong out from a jumble of panties that was in her dresser drawer and slid it on carefully over her beefy thighs. She searched through other drawers and found various t-shirts and shorts that actually looked like they might be big enough for her enormous body, but she wasn't in a shorts and t-shirt sort of mood. Another drawer was packed with enormous bras but again she wanted to see what outfit she would wear before figuring out if she'd wear one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled the closet open and found it overflowing with dresses, blouses and other garments of varying degree of formality. The sheer selection was like nothing she'd ever seen before, this was more clothes than even her sister Vanessa ever possessed. (A brief thought of where Vanessa could be now brought the low rumblings of pain to her head so Laura dropped it and continued rummaging.) There were sequined ball gowns, skimpy little cocktail dresses, suits with pants or skirts, button-up blouses, even a fairly large selection of lingerie that she suddenly wanted to try on and see if she could entice Jason back into bed. Pushing the idea aside for now Laura pulled out a handful of sun dresses that looked casual enough to \"hang out with the guys\" in while still skimpy enough to show off her incredible body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the selection she decided on a white dress with a sunflower pattern that reminded her of a dress she had when she was a little girl. She loved the idea that she could wear something so innocent looking with a body composed of such dangerous curves and bulges. She draped the dress over her head but her attempt to put it on failed when the dress was far too tight to get around her enormous bust. Instead she placed the dress on the floor and stepped into it slowly pulling it up until the spaghetti straps were on her shoulders. She then went to the mirror and admired just how amazingly well the dress fit. With her outrageous proportions it would be very easy for such a garment to hang off the shelf of her boobs like a muumuu completely obscure the tight figure below. Instead this dress was tailored perfectly for her so that it clung to her hips and stomach without being too tight and even offered some support for her breasts so that a bra wasn't necessary and she was still showing off a good amount of cleavage. The bottom hem draped high on her thighs and swished as she moved or turned and showed off her spectacular legs quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was still watching her reflection, flexing, turning, running her hands down her waist, teasingly lifting the bottom of her dress up to show off her rear, when Jason entered. It was his turn to clear his throat and surprise his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura jumped even more than he had but recovered quickly. \"Can't a girl admire her own body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason entered the room completely naked, every move a chain reaction of undulating sinew through his entire 400 pound body. \"Sure, but I like it better when you admire my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on her hips. \"As I recall I was the one that was grinding on you all ready to go and you pushed me away. I think you called me a tease, if memory serves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin Jason approached Laura from behind and wrapped his huge arms around her waist. She fought back but his immense strength was far beyond hers. \"I believe I also said you were the most beautiful woman in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexiest,\" Laura said giving in to Jason's hold and nuzzling against his pecs. \"You said I was the sexiest woman in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, that too,\" he leaned down and placed his lips on her neck right where it met her shoulder. He began sucking and biting in a way that made Laura melt into his arms even more. Then suddenly he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura spun around to find him gathering his own clothes from his own dresser. \"Hey! Now who's being a tease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Jason said wagging his butt at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gave his ass a hard smack but only managed to damage her own hand. She bit her lip to keep from crying out while she dashed out of the room to find some shoes to wear. A pair of well worn flip-flops were by the front door and she slid them on. A few minutes later Jason emerged wearing black denim pants and a black t-shirt with a gritty photo of The Clash across the front. His clothes were enormous still managed to be tight and Laura was pretty sure she could hear the fabric stretching with every move Jason made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura followed Jason outside taking note that their apartment was in a small complex further inland than either of the houses they normally lived in. The smell of salt in the air told her that the beach wasn't too far away, though. They got into an old SUV which sagged under the weight of their bodies but managed to transport them to a house that was pretty familiar, though Laura dared not try to remember why. She was beginning to get used to just living in the moment and hadn't even had the hint of a headache in a little while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey parked and approached the front door. Seconds after Jason knocked the door flew open and they were greeted by a tall, slender girl with shockingly green eyes and long black hair. Her face lit up in a smile when she saw the two huge bodybuilders. In fact Laura noticed that the girl's nipples began poking through her tight baby-doll t-shirt as she looked Jason up and down. The girl clearly wasn't wearing a bra and seeing as her breasts were nonexistent Laura didn't blame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two,\" the girl said moving aside to invite them in. \"Colin is in the back waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nyah,\" Jason said giving the girl a quick hug. \"Thanks. Are you going to watch us practice tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't,\" she said pouting, \"I've got a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that's acceptable. As long as you're coming by The Chiller tomorrow to see us play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Laura left Nyah and headed to the back. The whole time Laura's brain was telling her that this was different, this was wrong, but she refused to let herself dwell on it. She followed Jason through the house and into the back yard where a concrete patio held a mishmash of instruments and amplifiers as well as a smattering of old, beat-up gym equipment. Laura spotted a girl with teased blond hair standing over a very large man doing bench presses with an impressive amount of weight. The girl was short, perhaps an inch or two shorter than Laura, and wore black ripped denim shorts and fishnet stockings with holes torn in various places, her top was a raggedy tank with splashes of neon pink and green. Laura noticed that this girl was pretty buff, her well muscled legs fought their fishnet coverings and strong arms contained well defined biceps while her small top revealed a defined back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon!!\" she shouted at the guy she was spotting on the bench. \"This is pathetic, I thought you were actually a man.\" She slapped his head as he grunted another rep with quivering arms. \"Don't you dare stop now or you'll never get to touch me again, you hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred on the big man lowered the bar again and yelled out as he pushed the weight skyward once more. Not satisfied the girl berated him further getting three more hard reps out of him before helping him rack the weight. She walked around and grabbed him by the front of his shirt pulling him into a sitting position then she straddled his legs and kissed him deeply while he caught his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how does that feel, baby?\" she asked backing up and letting the big man stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his arms and chest enjoying the pump. \"That feels good,\" he said in a vaguely British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does,\" she said. \"Now go say hello to our Guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big man turned and Laura recognized Colin's face but his head was atop a body that was ready to take down a Mr. Olympia title, and probably without much trouble either. Jason was still far bigger, but this version of Colin probably weighed at least 300 pounds. He wore a white tank that fit snug over his massive chest and black leather pants shrink-wrapped thick quads.<br>\r\n\"Jason! You're late.\" Colin said approaching where he and Laura stood. \"But you brought Laura so I'll forgive you. How are you, love? You look to be as bulging as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so bad yourself,\" Laura responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta give the fans what they want, yeah?\" he said tensing his arms and letting them swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds to me that it's Wendy here that is really getting what she wants,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy gave a sexy grin, \"It's good for the band and that's good for business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to say something when she heard her phone chime. As a faint pain began to build in her head she reached into her purse to find\u2026</span></div></div>",

Reality calibration commencing. Attempting to consolidate requisite memories.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe? Are you okay?\" Jason voice was filled with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" she asked finding that her voice was shaky and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I-, uh\u2026 I-\" Laura wasn't okay. Her strength left her body and she felt the full weight of her bulk. Her vision went black and Jason's cries faded from her ears. Her knees folded and she collapsed forward so that she was kneeling. Her legs were cold, no they were freezing. It was as if they were submerged in water or something. Slowly her body began to normalize and her senses returned. Her strength was still missing but she felt more like she could move now. She raised her arms and turned her body to test out her mobility and while the former moved easily the latter felt bogged down by some incredible weight. She opened her eyes and allowed her sight to clear and found that her body had shrunk back down to her original skinny shape but the enormous breasts she'd programmed for herself were still attached to her chest. At least that explained why her torso felt so heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, are you doing okay?\" Jason voice snapped her out of her thoughts. She looked to where he was standing, about ten feet from where she knelt on the ground, and smiled when she noticed that he was still a massive bodybuilder and still crammed into the same tight clothes. Colin too was still bulging and still clad in leather pants and a tank top but Laura frowned at the addition of a tripod mounted camera between the two of them. A thin, nervous looking man stood behind the camera checking his watch between glances at the giants on either side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026 yeah. I'm good,\" she said at last. Despite the fact that she was feeling mostly normal again her legs were still freezing. \"Just cold is all.\" She looked down around her enormous breasts to see if she could figure out what was going on with her lower half and saw that she was on her knees in an inflatable pool filled with what looked like mud. She dipped her hands into the slimy brown goop and felt around. Goosebumps broke out across her entire body and she shivered. She realized that her dress was gone and she was clad in a tiny black bikini that hardly managed to cover her volleyball sized breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, love. I didn't have a chance to warm the water before mixing that stuff.\" Colin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \"We'll make this as quick as we can then we'll get you a nice warm shower. We just need Wendy and we can get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Wendy emerged from the house wearing a bikini just like the one Laura had on. Her fit body was reduced down substantially though she still looked very fit, especially with her washboard abs on display. The biggest change, however, was that her boobs were now on par with Laura's. The tiny girl was sporting a chest that was so perfectly round and firm that it was obvious that they were implants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glaring at Colin as she crossed the patio to join Laura in the pool. \"I'm still not a fan of this idea. Isn't this a played out idea for an album cover? This sort of thing died with the 80s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin laughed. \"That the point, baby. It's retro, just like our sound. Punk thrives on old ideas made new. Besides, we paid a lot of money for those tits so let's put them to use, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy spun raised her middle finger at Colin. A flash of light told everyone that the photographer snapped off a round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta boy!\" Colin slapped the skinny man on the back nearly knocking him to the ground. \"See Jason? I told you this guy was a total professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wendy reluctantly joined Laura in the mud bath she began to wonder if her own breasts were implants as well. Suddenly a memory appeared in her mind of being in high school and being called Laura Largetits. The memory of the nickname brought additional memories of both shame and pride. And what's more the memories didn't make her head hurt. She tried to focus on the events from earlier in the day, before she and Jason had made love but suddenly she felt the lightning spark in her mind as it had earlier. Obviously her past was getting fixed, but it wasn't all the way there yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy knelt beside Laura and the three men began giving orders to roll around in the mud and pose for various shots. The photographer, whom Jason called Rick, gave the most direction but occasionally Colin or Jason would chime in with an idea. \"Get closer,\" \"grab her bikini,\" \"tug her hair some,\" \"smash your boobs together,\" \"squeeze her tit,\" \"look angry,\" \"look sexy,\" \"look like lovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls followed orders in the hopes that this would all end quickly. Eventually Rick asked them to take their tops off and guided them through a few poses that kept their nipples hidden with strategic placement of hands, arms, mud or even just pressing their chests against each other which gave Laura all the proof she needed to tell that her breasts where very real while Wendy's were medically enhanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after over half an hour of the most demeaning act Laura had ever been involved in she and Wendy were excused. They both shook off excess mud and made their way into the house where they showered in turn. The only garment Laura had to wear was her bikini which she put back on and returned to the patio. Here she met Wendy who was watching Colin and Jason pump iron while Rick moved around them with his camera taking shots of the beefy behemoths as they pumped their muscles to obscene size. Both men had removed their shirts and would stop between sets to pose. Laura got so caught up in watching Jason's huge, gorgeous body swell with rock hard muscle that she hardly heard Wendy talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that at least we're not the only ones getting objectified here.\" She spoke sarcastically informing Laura that she knew very well the difference between the power fantasy the boys were living out was very different than the sexy fantasy they'd put the girls through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be worse,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laura could answer she heard a familiar chime from nearby. She looked around and saw a pile of belongings that looked like her clothes and purse. This must be where she'd set her things after changing. She wanted to pull her phone out to see what the sound was, but she already knew: it was the same sound the Alterations app made just before she'd found herself on her knees in the mud. She braced herself for whatever new change was on its way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura's mouth literally dropped open as she walked out of the bedroom.  She found herself standing at a railing, overlooking the vast open interior of what looked like a mansion.  Stretching out below was a huge rec-room/living room and beyond that she could see the entrance to a kitchen or dining area.  The walkway she was on stretched out around to the right and left, to her right she could hear water running and assumed it was Jason in the shower.  She forgot entirely about her plan to join Jason and instead wandered off to her left, opening the first door she came across.  When she flicked the light switch on she jumped at seeing someone across the room then quickly realized it was her own reflection.  The entire back wall was a mirror and she took a moment to flex and pose, admiring her body.  She struck a double bicep pose and held it. Were her arms bigger than she had originally programmed them for?  They looked bigger.  She stepped closer to the mirror and inspected herself, she was positive she was bigger than she was \"supposed\" to be but any attempt to try to remember why that might be caused the now familiar jolts of pain in her head.  She struck one more double bicep, holding until her arms seemed to pulse with energy then released it and inspected the rest of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like it had once been a gym, there were marks on the hardwood floor and even anchor points in the walls where pieces of equipment had obviously once been installed.  Now the room appeared to have been converted into a shrine to her bodybuilding accomplishments.  Starting at the door and going clockwise around the room there were framed magazine covers, posters, awards and trophies which appeared to go in chronological order from earliest to most current.  Apparently in this reality these breasts had been with her for a quite some time.  In her earliest photos she was obviously large breasted, even at contest weight but not unusually so.  Skipping ahead a year or so and she was obviously an anomaly on the posing stage.  One picture of her award presentation for a contest showed the second place competitor obviously giving Laura's bust the stink eye.  The review of memory lane was unusual for Laura, she couldn't remember any of these events and any attempt to do so appeared to be impossible.  She eventually got into a sort of zen frame of mind where she just accepted the images at face value without trying to remember them or think about them too hard.  She was a little confused by the fact that at a point where her career appeared to be approaching a peak, where there was a new magazine cover or award at least every month, it suddenly cut off.  The last magazine cover on the wall was dated about a year and a half ago.  She didn't attempt to wonder why at this point, just noted it for future reference and turned the light off as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to wander to the left, passing what appeared to be unused bedrooms and a storage room before descending the stairs to the ground floor.  She absently wondered if anyone else lived her and if she should go back and get a robe or something then shrugged and continued walking.  She certainly wasn't ashamed of her body and she didn't think anyone would care if they got a chance to see her on display.  Her impromptu tour brought her to a massive gym just to the left of the base of the stairs.  She stopped dead in her tracks after opening the large double doors and realizing what she was looking at.  Massive machines that looked like something out of science fiction dominated the room along with a section of free weight racks that were filled with plates and dumbbells that she would have considered ludicrously heavy.  Again, an entire wall was devoted to a floor to ceiling mirror but instead of a hardwood floor it looked like solid concrete covered with rubber mats.  Given the weight of all the equipment she thought she could understand why the gym had apparently been moved here from upstairs.  Another door on the far side of the gym led to a huge, larger than Olympic sized pool.  Without hesitation Laura ran and dove in from the side of the pool, happily swimming back and forth, both amazed at how effortless it felt to swim while at the same time realizing how her new body was definitely not hydro-dynamically efficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over to her back and drifted for a while, staring at the ceiling and trying to contemplate her new life without giving herself a splitting headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd find you here.\"  Laura turned her head to see Jason standing on the side of the pool watching her.  She involuntarily sucked in her breath at the sight, he was clad only in a pair of briefs and he looked ever more unbelievably massive now that she was looking up at him like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  She said, literally at a loss for words.  Her brain had instantly shifted gears from contemplating her life to, \"I really want to fuck him again.\"  She giggled to herself at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked along the edge of the pool next to Laura as she continued to drift along on her back.  \"You, you're predictable, when you want to think or something is bothering you you always end up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like swimming,\" Laura said, inwardly glad that this hadn't changed about her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jason said with an easy laugh.  He stepped off the side of the pool and into the water next to her, she responded by wrapping her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist, Jason struggled for a moment to get his feet planted on the bottom of the pool but once he did he was able to keep both his head and hers above the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love how tall you are,\" Laura giggled.  \"I would be drowning right now.\"  She surprised herself with her own comment, her odd, zen like acceptance of her circumstances that she had entered apparently had her bypassing her inner censor.  \"I like how tall this is to,\" she said as she ground her naked crotch against Jason's clothed penis.  She could feel it begin to react and giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, we just got done with that, we're going to be late if...\" Jason gave up as Laura forcibly ripped Jason's briefs off and lowered herself onto his now released rod.  \"Wow,\" he said, moving his hands to cradle Laura's ass as she began to move her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Laura said with a laugh, \"wow!\"  She was a bit surprised at the sensation of his hot penis filing her along with the contrast of the cooler water around her.  She liked it she decided, enjoying this sensual moment even more than the last one since she didn't feel like she was in the middle of transitioning realities.  Jason helped raise and lower her along his shaft and she moaned involuntarily.  It was a cool display of strength she thought, though she was pretty sure he could have done the same thing even if she wasn't being partially buoyed by the water.  She let her arms go from around his neck and pawed at his muscular chest and caressed his biceps as they flexed, his sheer muscularity and the feeling of immense power within both of them was turning her on more than she could have even imagined were possible and she bucked her hips and gyrated with an intensity that surprised both of them, her shrieks of ecstasy as she came echoed off the walls of the immense room and Jason chuckled as she draped her arms back around his neck and went limp.  \"Oh my God, that was so good,\" she whispered in his ear as he continued to thrust into her, bringing himself to his own orgasm.  She was practically purring with happiness and contentment as he carried her out of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, we really have to get going,\" he urged her as they quickly showered the chlorine water off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't even bat an eye at the immense size of the shower they were using or question where they were going.  \"Sure,\" she said, \"how should I dress?  Formal?  Informal?  Sexy?\"  She winked at him and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about formal and sexy?  Little black dress maybe?\"  Jason towel dried his body and Laura followed him to the bedroom as she continued to dry her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that,\" she said as she began digging through her closet.  The first dress she tried on was way too snug, the material was stretched so thin it was virtually see through.  So was the next one.  She frowned, had she not worn these for a while and bulked up significantly since?  She tried a button up blouse, the biggest one she had according to the labels.  The supposedly tailored garment strained visibly at the buttons and felt so snug around the arms she was afraid the sleeves would split if she moved too much.  She struggled to get out of the blouse without destroying it and then stood frowning at her wardrobe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"  Jason asked coming up behind her and kissing the back of her neck. \"You're not dressed yet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to face him and was surprised to see him already dressed in a well tailored suit.  It didn't do anything to disguise his sheer size but he looked very good.  She stopped staring at him and finally responded, \"I must have put on a lot of weight recently or something, nothing fits.\"  She laughed and struck a double bicep pose for him.  \"Muscle weighs more than fat after all.\"  Her muscles felt supercharged with energy but she relaxed her flex and stopped laughing in reaction to Jason's expression which seemed unusually serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much weight have you gained?\"  He fiddled with his cuff-links.  And looked momentarily embarrassed.  \"I know you're not supposed to ask a lady what she weighs but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed, \"I don't even know.  Let me check.\"  Jason followed her to watch her weigh herself which she was glad of since she didn't even know what she supposed to weigh.  He frowned at the result and if anything looked even more serious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and finish getting dressed, that black dress looked great on you, I need to make a call and then we can get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged and put on the beyond skin tight dress again along with a g-string to avoid pantie lines.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason let out a whistle when he saw Laura. \"No bra?  Are you sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, do these things look like they need the support?\"  She hefted her breasts and held back the urge to laugh as Jason's eyes bugged out of his head.  \"Settle down, you just saw them naked a few minutes ago, they shouldn't shock you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things will always shock anyone who see them,\" Jason said.  \"Are you ready to go then?\"  He asked while trying to take his focus away from her breasts and prominent nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, it's a scoop back, bra straps would ruin the look,\" Laura explained as she slipped a pair of stiletto heels on and grabbed a small clutch purse.  \"Ready, unless you think my makeup needs touching up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you look perfect,\" Jason looked her over from head to toe and made an adjustment to the fit of his pants before clearing his throat.  \"C'mon, change of plan, we're going to see Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki?\"  Laura had a brief half formed memory of a red headed girl with a pretty smile and contagious laugh handing her a beer at a beach party but as quickly as it came it was blotted out by a spike of blinding pain.  Laura blinked a few times as her head cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\"  Laura nodded but Jason grunted with skepticism as he offered Laura his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a gentlemen,\" Laura cooed, \"you certainly know how to make a girls panties melt,\" Jason actually blushed and Laura laughed as she gave him a peck on the cheek.  \"Save that blood Jason, you'll need it for your other head later.\"  She laughed again as his blush deepened.  She abruptly stopped laughing as they entered a garage and Jason opened the passenger scissor door of a Lamborghini Aventador for her to enter.  \"Thank you,\" she said, momentarily at a loss for words.  She sat and buckled herself in, not able to think of anything to say as Jason pulled away.  This had been one of Jason's dream cars, even more than the mansion they were apparently in this drove home how much different this life seemed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the immense temptation it must take to drive a super car without speeding like a maniac Jason's driving was mostly sedate though he did open it up enough on one straight away to make Laura squeak with surprise as she could feel the horsepower dramatically tug at her insides and plaster her deep into her seat.  Laura couldn't recognize the area they drove through or the huge house they eventually pulled up in front of though it all looked extremely expensive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe case of not recognizing things was apparently just limited to Laura though.  She had barely gotten out of the car as Jason held the door open for her before she was pounced upon by someone,  \"Laura!\"  Laura had an impression of a mass of red hair before the person threw themselves onto Laura, wrapping her in a bear hug.  If Laura had been more normally proportioned she may have had been knocked over or winded by the tackle masquerading as a hug but as it was she laughed as her assailant gasped to catch their own breath.  \"Whoof, still impersonating a brick wall I see,\" the person stepped back and also gave Jason a hug.  \"Jason, it's good to see you again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you to Nikki,\" Jason disengaged from the hug and took Laura's hand.  \"I just wish it were under different circumstances.  Is your dad here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, he's in his lab as usual.  It is great to see you two again though, it's really been too long.\"  Nikki turned on her heel and Jason and Laura fell into step beside her.  Laura tore her attention away from the distractingly opulent surroundings and looked at Nikki instead.  Nikki was gorgeous Laura decided.  She had a number of outstanding features, her eye catching red hair, a vibrant smile, a pair of the most perfectly formed C cup breasts Laura had even seen and stunningly long and well formed legs and a very nice figure, all encased in a leather micro dress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we take you from something?\"  Laura asked after noting how Nikki was dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the same thing you two were supposed to be going to,\" Nikki regarded Laura with a slightly odd expression.  \"Are you feeling OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Laura said practically bubbling.  She never felt so energetic before in her life.  She loved that she was back in her hyper-muscular body again, she just wished she could remember more about her life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Jason exchanged a look that didn't escape Laura.  \"I'm pretty sure it's what we've been afraid of since the accident,\" Jason said finally.  Laura felt her eyes widen, \"what accident?\" she wondered without saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Nikki said, putting her hand on Laura's arm in a universal gesture of sympathy.  \"I know you were hoping this wasn't the case, your career...\" Nikki's voice trailed off but the look of sadness and pity spoke volumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Laura couldn't even sputter past that before Nikki was talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you're right, we'll have to do another round of testing.  Maybe we're wrong again.  I really hope so,\" Nikki strode up to an elevator and firmly pressed the down button.  After a moment the doors opened and the trio entered.  \"Going down,\" Nikki said, sounding like she was forcing an attempt at being lighthearted.  Jason squeezed Laura's hand in a manner that she was sure was supposed to be reassuring but instead it was creeping her out.  What was going on here?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If Laura had any hopes of being able to figure out what was going on without asking direct (and probably very odd) questions she was giving up on them.  Nikki and Jason's conversation had become so self referential it was all but impossible to follow any of it.  The only information Laura felt she could understand was that for some reason Nikki seemed to all but worship her.  In just the short elevator ride she made multiple references to \"not being able to ever thank Laura enough\" and \"owing everything to her.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you probably get tired of hearing it from me all the time but it's true,\" Nikki said after her last such comment.  Laura just smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other data point Laura felt like she was able to absorb was that at one point in the past Nikki and Jason had apparently been a couple.  There was also constant reference to \"the accident\" without any further elaboration and Laura had the gut feeling that \"the accident\" either directly caused them to breakup or at least was coincidentally timed with it.  For exes they seemed to be on pretty good terms and Laura idly wondered if she had any reason to be jealous.  The impenetrable chatter continued as they left the elevator and entered an almost cartoonishly high tech looking laboratory through an ever escalating series of checkpoint and safeguards including hand and retinal scanner and armed guards.  Laura couldn't decide if it was more or less weird that no one they encountered seemed to give Laura or Jason a second glance. But, Laura was sure if she put any real thought into any of this she would be greeted by the mother of all headaches so she stayed studiously in the moment without overthinking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem awfully quiet,\" Nikki finally observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just concerned I guess.  I'm a little anxious about how this is going to turn out.'  That much was true at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Nikki said putting her hand on Laura's bicep in a gesture that was probably meant to be consoling in some way.  Laura wanted to giggle at how her bicep dwarfed Nikki's hand but that seemed like it would clash with the relatively somber tone that Jason and Nikki had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they arrived at a point deep in the lab where a tall distinguished looking man wearing a lab coat and some kind of goggles greeted them.  \"Jason, Laura, it's good to see you again,\" he strode quickly towards them and shook hands with Jason, he took Laura's hand in a manner than almost made her think that he was going to kiss it but then he let it go again.  \"Nikki told me that you were coming, we'll get started right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"  Laura was surprised at the unusually respectful and formal tone Jason adopted around the man she assumed was Nikki's father.  Laura was surprised again when Nikki put on her own lab coat and gestured Laura to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start out with some simple base line readings to compare to the last time you were here,\" Nikki explained as she had Laura stand on a small raised pedestal and began attaching suction cup sensors to her arms and chest.  \"Obviously it won't be 100% accurate since it's been a while since you did this but it will give us a place to start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the thought of, \"have I really done this before?\" sent a spike of pain into Laura's head and she shook her head to clear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything OK?\"  Nikki asked, stopping what she was doing to look closely at Laura.  It seemed like she was studying her pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head, \"I'm fine, just woke up with a bit of a headache today.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki didn't look convinced but didn't say anything else until she was done attaching the sensors to Laura's upper body.  \"OK,\" she said finally.  \"Nothing strenuous to start with, just do something mild to get your blood flowing for now, you know the routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Laura had no clue what that routine might be like but she figured Nikki would let her know if she did something too off track.  She started with some stretching, trying to gauge what her range of motion was going to be like with all the wires dangling from the attached sensors.  Nikki looked at the monitor that was in front of her.  \"Good so far,\" she looked closer,\" wow, up to 24 inches on \"the guns\" huh?  You must be working out harder than ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura both was and wasn't surprised.  She was surprised because she knew she had set the app to give her not quite 22 inch biceps, she wasn't surprised because she had been convinced that she looked bigger when she had been posing in the mirror earlier.  Thinking of posing made Laura hit a double bicep flex and hold it.  She loved the feel of flexing her muscles, it was indescribable the amount of power it felt like was contained in her biceps.  She wondered what Jason and Nikki's father were discussing, they had retreated to a distant corner of the room, only occasionally glancing in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Laura that's enough flexing, try something... hold on wait,\" Nikki peered again at her monitor, \"That makes no sense... Laura stop, something is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wasn't really paying attention to Nikki anymore, there was something that felt powerfully erotic about holding her flex as hard as she could.  The muscles in her arms as well as her vagina were tingling as she contracted her flex even harder.  Suddenly she orgasmed, spontaneously and loudly.  \"Oh my God, I'm so sorry,\" she said, lowering her arms to cover her face after she realized what had just happened.  She was blushing uncontrollably.  Both Jason and Nikki's dad came running over at the commotion.  Nikki sat back hard on the seat behind her as though she had narrowly avoided fainting entirely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what this is dad,\" Nikki said, waving a hand towards her readouts.  \"Her biceps just increased in girth from 24 to over 32 inches AND there was a spike in density readings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father and Jason both looked from the screen to Laura and back, \"She looks like the same as she did when she came in,\" he said finally.  \"If she had increased muscle mass by 30% where did it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the crazy thing, you can see here that the readings reversed back when she stopped flexing.  I would say it's a glitch in the readout but I saw it.  It should be impossible but I saw it.\"  All of them stood staring at Laura more than long enough to make her uncomfortable.  </span></div></div>",

She felt certain that if she did and if she did end up with Jason, that part of her would always wonder whether or not it was really her or the new body that he reacted to.  No, she had to at least see him once more and work through their recent argument.  She was about to call him but decided this would probably be a better conversation to have in person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura left the house through the back door, not wanting to disturb Vanessa who seemed to be camped on the couch tonight.  She took off her heeled sandals to walk along beach, not really realizing until she did so how they had improved the shape of her calves specifically and her legs overall.  \"Vanessa really knows her stuff,\" she reflected as she walked, feeling the sand between her bare toes.  The sun was beginning to set and Laura took a moment to look over the water towards it.  Nearby a group of people her own age were setting up a bonfire and she unconsciously began angling away from them, her experience with crowds of her peers tended to be negative.  A group carrying lounge chairs and a cooler moved past her towards the fire, one of the guys, obviously trying to show off by carrying way too much, dropped one of the chairs and after a moment of hesitation Laura picked it up and followed them.  \"Hey, you guys dropped this,\" she waved to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" one of the girls jogged over and took the chair from Laura, \"who are you here with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um... I'm not, I live nearby and was just passing by.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well hang around for a while if you want,\" another girl had joined them and passed Laura a beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks.\"  Laura was momentarily speechless, she sipped at the beer to distract herself from the fact that she had no idea how else to respond.  She reflexively made a sour face at the taste.  Did people really drink this on purpose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, don't give her that horse piss,\" a guy showed up at the impromptu welcoming party that had formed around Laura and handed her a wine cooler, \"this is probably more her speed.\"  Laura dropped her sandals and now with a drink in each hand sipped at the new one.  She had to admit she liked the fruity taste of the wine cooler much better.  \"Brodie,\" the boy said by way of introduction.  \"Melissa,\" the first girl said with a wave, \"Nikki,\" said the second.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura,\" she introduced herself after taking another swig of wine cooler, \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She lives nearby,\" Nikki interrupted Laura, sweeping her red hair to the side.  Laura had the bizarre impression she was supposed to know Nikki from somewhere but she couldn't think of where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool, I wish I lived closer to the beach,\" Laura handed Brodie the beer that she had no intention of finishing and he downed it quickly and belched.  \"You going to hang out with us for a while?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was conflicted, she wanted to see Jason and work through their earlier argument but at the same time she felt like she was being given a chance to see inside another world that so far she had only caught glimpses of from the outside.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura wanted to see what had Jason to enrapt. The way he was sitting it almost seemed like he was intentionally hiding the screen from her while trying to not look like he was hiding the screen. Looking away for a moment she leaned slightly towards him then turned her head back to see what he was up to. She saw the screen for a split second before Jason, quick as a gunslinger doing a reverse quick draw, locked and pocketed his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Jason said looking slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked familiar but at the same time not. \"Really, what were you doing? It looked like a bunch of menus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's face scrunched in for a moment and he looked like he was going to bark back his response. Then he relaxed. \"It's just this Japanese game I downloaded. It's supposed to have a lot of RPG and character building traits but in the end it just ends up being another match three game. Kinda disappointing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it looked like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" Jason was now calm but forceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something strange about Jason's voice. Somehow her will power melted and she had no choice but to believe. It was nothing. Jason was always downloading random games and apps and the menus she saw could very well have been from that sort of game. She opened her mouth to say something further when Jason leapt to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside Laura texted her sister and Vanessa met them just inside the mall near the GameStop that was typically Laura's one and only destination. Today would be different, though, and she was surprised by how excited she was. Excited and intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lulu!\" Vanessa cheered as she approached. \"I'm so glad you're here, this is gonna be fun! And Jason is here too!\" Vanessa went straight to Laura's friend and gave him a big hug which Jason returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's odd</i>, Laura thought, <i>I've never seen them hug before.</i> Laura was always surprised when Vanessa actually remembered Jason's name but now she was displaying friendship that bordered on affection. Was there something there that Laura had never seen before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You here to cheer on our gorgeous swan?\" Vanessa asked Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged. \"Any chance to spend time with beautiful girls at the mall, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Laura was shocked this time it was at how smooth Jason's response was. Usually he would have been completely tongue tied if Vanessa so much as said hello to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Vanessa ran her hand down Jason's arm from her shoulder to his elbow. \"You smooth talker. You always know just what to say to a lady, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No he doesn't</i>, Laura's mind yelled. There was definitely something strange going on. \"What is with you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa and Jason looked to Laura. It was her sister that spoke first, \"What's wrong? Upset about not being the center of attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Laura.\" Jason said, his voice talking on that calm, hypnotic tone just like on the bus. \"Everything is fine.\" And again, just like on the bus her brain was overridden by some power in Jason's words. Everything was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few awkward, silent moments passed while Laura recovered like a boxer who'd gotten his bell rung then Vanessa laughed. \"Okay, I've got you an appointment at the hairdressers in a few minutes then I have a friend who can help with some makeup and lastly we'll get you some new clothes to highlight your assets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to counter that she didn't have any assets to highlight but swallowed the comment. Vanessa was here to help her and she would remain optimistic. Something else was odd, though. \"Speaking of clothes, what's going on with yours?\" Vanessa was wearing a pair of black Chuck Taylor low tops and black leggings that reached just below her knees, but the problem that Laura was referencing was her top. Her white halter was not fitting well at all and Vanessa's large breasts looked like they were trying to escape over the top of the scoop neck. Laura could even see that the cups of Vanessa's bra were overflowing quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa turned red and crossed her arms over the top of her chest. \"Oh, I know. Embarrassing right? I must be retaining water like crazy because nothing fit me right today. I'll be stopping to get some better fitting clothes for me while shopping for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Retaining water? Just in your boobs?\" Laura asked. \"Oh! Maybe you're pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Vanessa punched Laura in the shoulder then laughed loudly. \"Besides, I'd have to get laid first and that's an itch that hasn't been scratched in quite a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I would have thought you could have any guy whenever you wanted.\" Laura said truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled. \"If only it worked that way. Look, let's get going, poor Jason doesn't want to stand around and listen to our embarrassing girly talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked and saw Jason standing there with a big dopey grin on his face. \"I don't know, I'm sure he'd be happy if we stood here and talked about your boobs some more. Jason, don't you think it's weird that her breasts are so swollen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa is fine,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Vanessa is fine,\" Laura repeated, this time she didn't even notice the odd tone of voice he used to convince her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa grabbed Laura's and Jason's hands and pulled them deeper into the mall finally. A few minutes later they were standing before the salon, the sort of place Laura never thought she'd ever set foot in. Typically she would just have her mother give her hair a quick trim to keep her ends more or less in line. She actually found herself afraid to enter the salon, a feeling that was only made worse by the trio of girls that were just leaving. Laura recognized them as Emily, Jessica, and Megan, cheerleaders who had spent much of their high school careers making Laura feel awful through snide comments about how ugly she was and how no one would ever like her. Suddenly she wanted to run, she wanted to be anywhere else but here. This was stupid, how could she ever think this would work. If she left she could just use the app instead and be as pretty as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa must have sensed Laura's unease because she turned her sister's eyes to her own. \"Whether you do this or not I just want you to know that you're beautiful. Cutting your hair, changing your clothes, these things are just to help show off what you already have going on, okay? And it's going to be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took a breath. Vanessa was right, this would be fun; and she was curious to see just how much of a difference all this could make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jason spoke from behind them. \"Uh\u2026 I'm pretty hungry. I'm going to go to the food court. Text me if you want me to bring anything back.\" Suddenly he was gone, head down, cell phone in hand, headed for the collection of fast food stops on the other end of the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head. \"Well, so much for 'any chance to spend time with beautiful girls at the mall' right?\" She mocked Jason's voice while holding a hand in the air like some Shakespearian actor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was watching Jason go, almost as if she was lost in thought. Laura's comment snapped her back to reality and she chuckled. \"Yeah, seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were a complete blur. The hairdresser worked feverishly using dozens of tools and machines Laura had never seen before in her life. Then in what seemed like the blink of an eye Laura found herself in the makeup department of a huge department store while a friend of Vanessa's worked meticulously on Laura's face with brushes of varying size. Finally, after just over two hours of primping and preening Vanessa stood before Laura with a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready, Lulu?\" she asked turning Laura towards the mirror before waiting for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's breath was knocked clean out of her. \"I\u2026 I\u2026 I look like you.\" She glanced at Vanessa then back to her reflection. It was true, she actually saw the resemblance between herself and Vanessa, something she never even considered was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a compliment,\" Vanessa said putting her own face next to Laura's so they could compare their similarities. \"Still, I'd kill for your cheekbones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So would I,\" Vanessa's friend said. \"Girl, you're on a level with Olivia Wilde with those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wanted to cry. She looked amazing. Her smoky purple eyeshadow succeeded in making her brown eyes almost appear amber in color, her lips popped with a pink hue that almost looked natural, and her cheeks\u2026 wow. She never realized how perfect her bone structure had been all this time. To top it off her brown hair had been stained with copper highlights and now fell over her shoulders in loose curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" Laura could hardly speak and the words came out as a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa wiped away a tear that had escaped then chided Laura, \"Don't cry on me, you'll smear your mascara.\" She scooped up a bag filled with cases of makeup for Laura and tugged her sister's arm. \"Now it's time for some new clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa dragged Laura across the mall to her favorite clothing store they passed the food court. Laura realized that they hadn't heard a peep from Jason this whole time and wondered what the heck he was up to. As they rushed past the packed tables Laura scanned the crowd to see if Jason was still there. She spotted someone that could have been him, she could only see this persons back but it kind of looked like Jason. She quickly dismissed the idea, though, when she spotted that this guy was sitting with Emily, Jessica, and Megan. Even if Jason had lucked his way into sitting with even one attractive girl there was no way he'd ever be able to bring himself to utter a single word, and this guy had all three of them enthralled with some wild tale that required massive arm movements to get his point across. Some punchline must have come up in whatever story was being told because suddenly all three girls broke out in giggling fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah that can't be Jason</i>, Laura thought as she left the food court behind. <i>He must have gone off to the game store or something.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it Laura was standing in the dressing room of a trendy clothes store. Vanessa held up a red mini skirt with tiny white polka dots and a blue top with long sleeves; just one of several outfits she'd grabbed. \"These first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura still had her doubts. \"Isn't that a little advanced for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, and that's what I want to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued to frown so Vanessa tried a different approach, \"Look, you know how in World of Warcraft there are some armor sets that work really well with your character's abilities and others that do nothing for them? Think of this as your sexy gal loadout. These work with what you've got, I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reference was so apt that Laura almost let it pass right by without a thought but a moment later it hit her and she spun to face Vanessa. \"Wait! What did you just say? Since when did you know anything about a video game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa turned bright red and looked like she wanted to just shrivel up into a ball. \"Well\u2026 I\u2026 There was this guy, a few years ago and\u2026 I saw him play a few times and I thought I would give it a try. I never told anyone because I thought they would make fun of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Is this why you begged mom and dad to buy you that computer for your room?\" Laura didn't think Vanessa could get any redder but suddenly she was. \"This is the best thing ever, you're such a nerd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk,\" Vanessa said both smiling and a little hurt at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Laura said, \"who would know better than me? And nerd is not an insult, by the way.\" Laura leapt forward and wrapped her arms around Vanessa's neck hugging her tight. \"We're so much more alike than I ever knew. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redness left Vanessa's face and she returned the hug. \"I don't know why you're thanking me but you're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura backed up and Vanessa once again shoved the clothes into her hands. \"These will highlight your strong points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I don't trust you, but what are my strong points?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're slender, which is great because there's a lot we can do with that. And you've got really nice legs, thus the skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura got even more nervous. \"Legs? My legs are scrawny and my knees are knobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa tilted her head to the side. \"Just trust me.\" Before Laura could protest again Vanessa vanished claiming she had to get a few other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Laura stripped out of her jeans and t-shirt and put on the new outfit. Taking in her reflection she had to admit she didn't look half bad. The top was short and ended a few inches above the top of the skirt showing off a few inches of trim tummy and she decided that her legs weren't too bad, though she'd hardly call them sexy. After viewing all angles of herself for a few minutes Vanessa reappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Laura noticed was that she'd changed out her overstressed halter for a better fitting tank. Even the bra was new and she was no longer spilling out of the cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do a little shopping for yourself as well?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, feels so much better. I'm so bloated I had to go up two cup sizes, I've never had it this bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wearing an F cup!\" Laura wanted to take back the comment as soon as it was out of her mouth but she was just so shocked by how large her sister's breasts were. In fact she realized that she was staring into Vanessa's deep cleavage and had to stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa blushed yet again. \"Actually it's a G. Double D and E are practically the same depending on the brand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god. Are you sure you're bloated? You don\u2019t look like you're having trouble anywhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else could it be? It's not like my breasts just decided to start growing. That's not possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura thought of the app. \"Actually, there are ways.\"</span></div></div>",

The pressure the shoes put on her calves and thighs brought out subtle yet shapely curves she'd never seen in herself before. As an added bonus the shoes brought Laura's height up to 5' 7\" which actually made her feel tall and her legs look long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a knockout!\" Vanessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wouldn't have gone that far but she certainly was feeling sexy in her own skin for the first time ever. Vanessa put Laura through several other outfit combinations and the younger girl grew more and more excited as time went on. She was wearing things she'd never dreamed she would ever be able to pull off, pleated skirts, tank tops, cocktail dresses, and cut off shorts. And Vanessa paid for it all. Laura was astounded at her sister's kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too much, why are you doing this?\" She felt tears welling in her eyes for the second time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just consider this my chance to make up for missing out on shopping with you for the last several years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's phone buzzed.

Vanessa and Laura arrived first even though Laura was going fairly slow since she was getting used to walking in her new high heeled shoes. She had changed back into the first outfit once more and actually enjoying the few glances she was getting. When Jason arrived he did a slight double take when he spotted Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look amazing,\" he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you girls ready to-\" Jason's question was cut off by several voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jason!\" Emily, Jessica, and Megan sang together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned red as the girls approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's stomach sank when they all approached her but she was surprised to find no malice in their eyes. Emily, the de facto leader of the three, stepped forward. Laura felt like shrinking as the strong, sexy girl had always been the most powerful on the team and it looked like she'd done nothing since graduation but hit the weights because thick, muscular arms hung down from broad shoulders and bulging thighs and calves were proudly displayed extending down from tiny denim shorts. \"Hi Laura. Jason was telling us just how much we hurt you over the past few years. It really made us realize how awful we were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was a total bitch,\" Jessica said from behind Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" that was Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily continued, \"We just wanted to say we're really sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was astounded. She didn't know what to say so for a long time said nothing. Then she realized her silence was rude so she stammered out a thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleaders seemed happy with this and began to go on their way. Before they left Emily approached Jason, \"It was really nice talking with you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leaned forward and whispered something into Emily's ear. The girl's face flushed and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that a lot,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really pretty,\" Megan said to Laura and then the three of them were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very long time Laura finally looked at Jason, \"What the fuck happened to the bitch sisters?\" The not-so-clever name was used for several years to describe more than just those three, but they were the core of Laura's troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason merely shrugged. \"I just talked to them. Maybe they've matured since high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a month and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just smiled the biggest smile Laura had ever seen. He set himself between Laura and Vanessa and looped his arms into theirs. \"Let's go. I want to show off my sexy girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who is this guy? </i>Laura wondered.</span></div></div>",

He's just trying to be more confident.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever he was doing it was working. Jason still looked the same, just as tall and lanky, but he moved and spoke like a totally new man. He and his \"sexy girls\" had piled into Vanessa's car and he had directed Vanessa to drive them downtown where he intended to treat them to an early dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you just eat?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged and sent Laura a winning smile. \"This isn't about me. I want to take you out to celebrate the new you.\" Then he turned to look at Vanessa, \"And the wonderful sister who made it possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason guided them to an upscale Italian restaurant in the center of the main drag. It was far fancier than anyplace Laura had been with Jason before. Heck, it was fancier than any where Laura had been ever. \"What are we doing here? How can you afford this?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just smiled that same knowing smile he'd been wearing most of the day. \"Don't sweat it. A special place for a special occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe approached the hostess stand where the woman standing there asked how many were in their party with a tone of voice that suggested that they didn't belong there. Jason took a few steps past her and began scanning the restaurant as if he were looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, sir?\" the hostess asked sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ignored her for a few more seconds then finally pointed to a waitress across the room. \"Her. We want to sit in her section.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostess turned and craned her neck. \"Olivia? Are you friends with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jason said plainly. \"I just think she's really pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn annoyed sigh followed and Laura could practically hear the poor girl's eyes roll back in her head. \"That's not how this wor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason put a hand on her shoulder and spoke slowly. \"I would really appreciate it if you would help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further complaint the hostess gathered a few menus and led the party back to a table in the requested section. Along the way Laura and Vanessa exchanged a look that showed they were both perplexed by Jason's behavior but neither knew what to do about it. A minute or two after getting settled the brunette waitress that Jason had identified arrived at their table. Instantly Laura could see why Jason had picked this one, she was quite beautiful with soft facial features and bright eyes. She wore black slacks that hugged her round hips and a white button up shirt with the long sleeves turned up to the elbow showing off a bright blue butterfly tattoo on her wrist. Over the shirt was a black vest and matching bow tie. The vest was pushed very far out, the buttons straining from the force of a very large pair of breasts underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia introduced herself and asked if they wanted anything to drink. Jason surprised everyone by requesting 2 bottles of wine for the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia tilted her head, \"Uh, sure thing, sweetie. I just need to see your IDs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to contain himself Jason waved his hand slightly and said, \"You don't need to see our identification.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia blinked a few times then smiled brightly. \"Great! I'll get that started for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the waitress was gone Laura slapped Jason on the shoulder. \"Seriously, what the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! I just decided that I wasn't going to let life push me around anymore. I've always been so scared to be assertive but then I look at you and you're a whole new person now. I want to be all new too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had no argument. She knew the world was full of people who went for what they wanted and if Jason was going to do the same then good for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wine was delivered and Laura gave Vanessa a pitiful look. Her stomach was turning with thoughts of being sick the previous night but her big sister just leaned in and whispered, \"Just have a little and see how you feel. Stop if you don't want more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was happy to find that the wine was quite good and though she was trying to take it slow she was finished with a glass and a half by the time their food came. Already feeling buzzed she hardly noticed when Jason got up walked away. A few minutes later Laura spotted Jason across the restaurant talking to Olivia and  a man in a suit. The man nodded then shook Jason's hand. He said something to Olivia who nodded as well then walked away. Jason took Olivia's hand in his own and said something that made her blush. He kissed the back of her hand then tore a scrap of paper out of her server book and scribbled something on it. Jason took it then placed a hand on Olivia's hip and leaned in to kiss her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned to the table Laura asked him who the man was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the manager. He agreed that because of the special occasion he would comp our dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the wine or perhaps it was the constant flow of surprising behavior from her best friend but Laura gave up on being shocked by the events of the evening. It was best to just go with the flow and enjoy the free meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done eating Vanessa excused herself to the bathroom. Once they were alone Jason moved close to Laura. \"Can I talk to you about something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Laura said. \"You can talk to me about anything.\" </span></div></div>",

She realized that she had always assumed that she would end up with Jason. Suddenly she felt like she was back in the parallel universe where she had lost him as a friend, everything she knew was spinning out of control. Here she was a whole new person feeling more attractive and desirable than ever and he chooses this moment to slap her down and tell her he want to ask her sister out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sucked in a breath to tell Jason exactly how she felt but he cut her off. \"Please, be calm. I don't want this to upset you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the fire inside her was gone. She realized that if she had really wanted Jason she could have made a move herself. He deserved to get what he wanted and if that was Vanessa then so be it. \"Yeah, it's cool. I know you've liked her forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's face lit up. \"Thank you, Laura. You really are a wonderful friend, and a beautiful girl. I promise I'll help you land the hunk of your dreams very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What an odd thing to say,</i> Laura thought. Then something else occurred to her. \"Hang on, didn't I just see you ask for the waitress's phone number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to ask them both out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I mean not at the same time.\" Jason looked confused. \"They're just dates, Laura. I'm not committing to anyone. Not yet, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From single to super player in a single afternoon.\" Laura paused then another realization came into her mind. \"Wait! Did you ask Emily out too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \"Yeah, also Megan. Jessica still has a boyfriend so I left her alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze! The new more assertive you is on fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the restaurant Jason had Vanessa drive them all back home. Once there Laura went inside while Jason said he wanted to talk to Vanessa. Laura watched through the living room window as Jason asked his years long crush out. She honestly didn't know how Vanessa would react but considering Jason seemed to have the world wrapped around his finger today she wasn't too surprised when she saw Vanessa agree. She was a little surprised, however, when the two came together in an embrace that quickly turned into a hard kiss. Her surprise grew as she watched Jason hand drift down Vanessa's ass to her thigh which he lifted and wrapped around his rear as he pressed her against her car. Suddenly her other leg was wrapped around him as well and their kissing intensified. Jason now slid his hand up her hip and under her tank top groping around like crazy. With no concern for the fact that they were still outside he whipped her shirt off over her head leaving her topless save for her bra. Less than a minute of kissing and grinding went by and then the bra was off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stopped and said something to Jason who stepped back as she untwined her legs. She kept an arm wrapped across her chest to keep her breasts from being exposed then the pair made for the house. Once inside they dashed right past where Laura stood and ran up the stairs, Jason right on Vanessa's heels slapping her butt the whole way. Then Vanessa's door slammed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" She said aloud to an empty room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three of them had gotten home in the late afternoon, but by the time Laura was climbing into bed Vanessa's door still hadn't reopened. She surmised that they'd actually been sleeping for the last while since the initial 2 hours of thumping, moaning, and screaming sounds had been followed by silence. However, now as she was beginning to fall asleep the noises were returning and sleep became the furthest thing from her mind. She wished her parents had been home instead of on vacation so they could put a stop to this. Even Greg, who was still very protective of his little sisters, would have said something by now but he was probably sleeping at his girlfriend's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura knew she really shouldn't be upset; Jason wasn't her boyfriend and had had a crush on Vanessa for the better part of a decade, she had even given him her blessing. Still, something about her best friend banging her sister in the next room left her feeling a swirl of emotions and none of them were all that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Vanessa cried out signaling her third orgasm of this second round of sex Laura left her room and instead sat on the porch overlooking the beach. There was no moon in the sky and no light to see the water, but she could hear it. Even better Vanessa's room was on the opposite side of the house so Laura could no longer hear what was going on. She figured she'd give them another hour or so before checking to see if they'd fallen asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime she pulled out her phone and launched the Alterations app. Her enhanced body with Nyah's enormous breasts was still sitting there waiting to be made real. Laura desperately wanted to press \"Apply Changes\" but stopped recognizing that she was in a rather emotional state and would probably regret a rash decision. She thought back to the way she acted as a musclebound beast and shuddered. It would be too easy to loose herself again. She'd make some changes to herself again, the gift was too good to pass up, she'd just have to be smart. And right now she wasn't feeling very smart at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to just play around in the app to kill time and without even thinking about it she opened Jason's profile. Seeing his naked body with is raging erection just made her stomach sink. Was his dick even bigger than she remembered? No, that must just be her brain torturing her. She was about to click back to her own profile again when she spotted something at the top of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT. THE. FUCK!?!\" She stared for a long time trying to get her head around what this meant. \"This can't be,\" she said but at the same time she realized that it made so much sense. At the top of the screen right next to Jason's name where it should have said \"Revision 0\" it instead said \"Revision 34.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty four? He's made thirty four changes? How did he even get the app? No wonder things have been going his way, he must have done something to boost his chances.\" As shocked as she was this news actually made her feel better. She realized then that she'd been terrified that her nerdy friend had been leaving her behind. Oddly, this felt more like something she could deal with. She tapped in the revision link and was brought to a screen that listed all the changes that Jason had made. Interestingly there were way more than 34, closer to 50, but many of them had been reverted back. She looked through the list but wasn't able to make too much sense of the changes since most of them were in a strange coded shorthand. She did see one that read: \"PNS ERECT EFFT +40%\" She guessed that this had something to do with his penis when erect and realized that his dick really was bigger than she remembered it being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she couldn't really make much else from the remaining entries she returned to her bed and even though Jason and Vanessa were still going at it Laura felt much better and was able to fall asleep just a few minutes later.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning Laura was up a little earlier than usual. She sat on the couch in the family room drinking a heavily sweetened cup of coffee while scanning through TV channels. Eventually she heard some movement upstairs followed by the shower turning on. She waited to see if Jason came downstairs but once the shower was done it was Vanessa alone who joined her in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's hair was still wet and she was wearing some grey cotton shorts and an ill fitting t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good morning.\" Laura said as her sister poured herself some coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa blushed. \"Um\u2026 sorry about last night. I\u2026 uh, hope we weren't too loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were, but don't sweat it.\" Laura laughed. \"What brought all that on, if you don't mind my asking?\" Laura had a pretty good idea what brought it on, in fact she probably knew better than Vanessa, but she wanted to hear what her sister's perspective was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I mean, Jason has always been kinda cute but something about the way he was acting yesterday he was just,\" she paused looking for the right word. \"Irresistible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right,\" Laura muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Vanessa entered the room to join Laura on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just- holy shit Vanessa! Are you wearing the bra you bought yesterday?\" Now that she had a better look at Vanessa, Laura could see why her shirt fit so oddly: her breasts seemed to have grown again. The new, bigger bra was overflowing worse than the one she'd started off the day with the day prior. Her v-neck T had torn slightly from the strain of overwhelming cleavage that oozed up and the bottom of the shirt rode high on Vanessa's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed. \"Yeah, Jason says I could be going through another round of puberty. He says sometimes it can happen late, like even all the way up to 30.\" Her voice tried to sound annoyed but she couldn't hide her excitement very well. It was clear that she loved having bigger boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet he said that,\" Laura wondered what revision Vanessa was up to by now and made a mental note to check later. \"Don't you think it's odd to grow so fast, though? Your cup size is going to be on the back side of the alphabet by tomorrow if this doesn't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason said not to worry about it,\" Vanessa said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura could only shake her head. \"Good enough for me. Speaking of Jason is he still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he left late last night after we- well, never mind.\" Vanessa thought for a long moment. \"Lulu, are you alright with this? I mean, me and Jason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister's concern was endearing. Laura put her hand on Vanessa's knee. \"Sure, Ness. In fact Jason checked with me before he asked you out\u2026 er, in\u2026 whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw! That's so sweet of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it?\" Laura said not even trying to hide her sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat watching TV together for a little while when finally Laura just had to ask a question that was bugging her. \"Just so I know, did Jason mention that he'd still be dating other girls? Like Emily and that waitress from last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. He said he was just getting used to his own new found confidence and didn't want to be exclusive with anyone yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're okay with this?\" She knew the answer before she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa grinned. \"Sure, what's wrong with having some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura faked a smile, she had never known Vanessa to be the sort to \"just have fun\" but decided to leave it be for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa jumped to her feet. \"Alright, that's it. I'm heading back to the mall. I fell like this thing is cutting off my circulation.\" She motioned to the undersized bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was just about to check Vanessa's profile on her phone to see what sized garment she would need now but she was interrupted by a text message. Surprisingly it was from Jason:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Hey! You busy? I was thinking we could cruise the beach and find you a big, muscle bound boy toy.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had to read the message a dozen times before her brain let her believe what it said. Never in her life did she imagine she'd receive a text like this one, and especially not from Jason. It was so stupid she almost ignored it completely. Still, a portion of her was envious of what Jason had. Perhaps she could play along for a day or two and have some fun of her own. Then again, it seemed like the right thing to do would be to call Jason out and talk about what was going on.</span></div></div>",

And she'd be lying if she said she wasn't intrigued by the possibility of landing a cute guy the same way Jason had landed three sexy ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jason and Vanessa seemed to be having fun,</i> she thought, <i>why shouldn't I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replied to the text: <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><b>Sounds exciting.

Jason was smiling his dorky grin while the girl laughed and struggled to cover her huge, naked breasts with one hand and the camera with the other. Laura couldn't make out all of the girl's face but she spotted a bright blue butterfly tattoo on her wrist and immediately remembered the waitress from the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, Jason!\" Laura yelled at her phone. Jason hadn't even gone half a day before moving from Vanessa to another girl. She took a deep breath and calmed herself; Vanessa was very aware of the fact that Jason was going to see other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took the time to fix her hair and practice applying a thin layer of makeup, just enough to help without looking like she was wearing makeup. Once done she really felt it helped. She complimented herself on a job well done and set to picking out some clothes to wear. She sorted through the things that Vanessa had picked out for her and settled on a basic combination of tiny denim cut offs and a white halter top. It was the sort of thing that, up until yesterday, she never would have considered wearing but today she didn't feel too terribly awkward. That felt like real improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later Laura found herself standing on Jason's front porch knocking on the door. She had butterflies in her stomach thinking about what the afternoon would hold for her. She didn't know what to expect but was still surprised when the door opened and she was greeted by the waitress completely nude. Olivia seemed to have shed the modesty she had displayed earlier when Jason had tried to snap a photo of her and now she made no effort to cover her nakedness. Her body was curvy and soft and begged to be touched and squeezed. Laura was astounded by the size of her breasts which hung down in teardrop masses that actually managed to overshadow even Vanessa's new size. Laura spotted a smattering of hickeys and love bites across Olivia's shoulders, chest, and breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread across the girl's lovely face. \"You must be Laura, right? Jason is upstairs getting dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again,\" Laura said entering the house. She did her best to take this all in stride sensing that it was only the start of a very strange day. \"Um\u2026 no offense but\u2026 do you know you're not wearing any clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia laughed, \"Yeah, Jason convinced me that I should be proud to show off a body like mine.\" She put her hands on her waist and cocked her hips to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's not wrong.\" Laura said watching the way even the slightest movement set Olivia's boobs to jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls went together to Jason's room where they found him slipping into a pair of cargo shorts. He was still shirtless and Laura spotted red marks on his chest and shoulders similar to those on Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura!\" Jason said and immediately went to her for a hug. This was new, he'd never given her a hug before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jason,\" Laura said trying not to sound too confused while not sure if she should return the embrace. As Jason pressed his body against hers she could feel the immense bulge in his pants radiating heat like a furnace and wondered if he'd continued to make adjustments to his already oversized cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for today? It's going to be so exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not,\" Laura said truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed and then looked to Olivia. \"You can go ahead and get dressed and head out, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How sad,\" the busty brunette pouted but did as she was told. She gathered up her clothes which Laura recognized as the outfit she'd been wearing to work the previous night. Obviously she had come straight here after work which compressed the timeline in Laura's head even more. Jason really just jumped from Vanessa to this girl right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was not surprised to find that when Olivia put her bra on the garment didn't fit and her huge boobs spilled out over the top of the cups. She adjusted the straps then pulled the cups down each movement causing more jiggles, finally she frowned, shrugged, and put her shirt back on leaving the top buttons undone revealing cleavage deep enough to drown in. <i>Good grief, Jason. You're a living, breathing boob fairy, aren't you?</i> Laura thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow dressed Olivia went to Jason and draped her body on his. The two shared a long kiss while Jason's hands explored the contours of Olivia's round behind. After a very long time Jason broke off from the kiss and told Olivia it was time to go. She did as she was told and a moment later Laura was alone with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly are we doing?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave her a knowing grin as he pulled his shirt on over his head. \"I told you, we're going to land you a hunk to call your own. I've been able to use\u2026 uh\u2026 my confidence to get out into the dating pool and I think you should do the same. And I know just the guy for us to go after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was a tight bundle of nervous energy. \"Oh yeah?\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. C'mon, let's go.\" Jason lead the way with an anxious Laura close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not a place that either of us belongs at.\" Laura told Jason. She was failing at hiding the fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't have that attitude, you have to believe in yourself. Look at what I've been able to do in just one day simply by being confident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You've got more than confidence on your side,</i> Laura wanted to mention that she knew about the phone but a good portion of her was still curious about how this would play out. Still, she hadn't expected Jason would take her here. Olympus was, in no uncertain terms, the home for the biggest and strongest bodybuilders in the country. True to the name it had birthed several Mr. Olympia champions and dozens more finalists. The gym actually required an IFBB pro card just to apply for membership and even then they only took the truly elite as members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're not even going to let us in,\" Laura was practically pleading now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure they will.\" Jason took her hand and began to pull her towards the front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know anyone here. Why can't I start a little simpler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know someone here, alright. Eric Godwin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's mouth went dry. \"E\u2026 Eric?\" She hadn't seen him in quite a while. Eric had been one of Greg's high school friends, his closest actually. The two had gotten into bodybuilding together and while both had excelled at it Eric's genetics and work ethic took him a fair bit farther. While Greg was sill working to place well in amateur shows while struggling to overcome the plateau his body seemed to have hit, Eric had placed very high in half a dozen professional shows even coming in third in the most recent Arnold Classic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Eric.\" Jason said. \"I remember what a crush you had on him. How you would always talk about his huge muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, that was two years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \"And he's only gotten bigger since. You'll really love him now. Don't be a chicken!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was torn. Her fear and insecurities were screaming at her to turn back but at the same time she knew that Jason had a few tricks up his sleeve. Could this really work or was it finally time to call Jason on his bullshit?</span></div></div>",

Laura was definitely enticed by the sort of fun that she and Jason were having; she'd never even been kissed much less have a no strings attached style fling. She looked inside the gym at the pumped up men and women and wondered what it would be like to be accepted by them, to have one of them desire her. What would it be like to be held in big strong arms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to tell Jason she was ready to give it a shot when she thought of Vanessa again. It was so unlike her to just jump on Jason so quickly and the fact that he'd gone straight to Olivia in the same night was further off-putting. Laura couldn't just let it all go, no matter how much she just wanted to be selfish or at least self indulgent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed and looked from the departing bodybuilders to her friend. \"Jason, before we go any further we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you're so close. All we need to do is go in there and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know about the phone, Jason. About the app. Alterations.\" She cut him off and the conversation stopped dead for a long moment.

Well, some of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't look upset or angry, just curious. \"Oh really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know you've been making Vanessa's boobs bigger and I know you did the same to that waitress. I know you've made a lot of little changes to yourself, but most of all I know you've been controlling people somehow.\" Laura actually felt good laying everything out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so what? Let's go find Eric and I'll pair the two of you up. Doesn't that sound great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nice, Jason. It's not normal, not what they want. Olivia and Vanessa, they-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Jason's turn to cut Laura off. \"Olivia and Vanessa what? Are you saying they don't want to be with me? Am I no good? Do you think they could never like a guy like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's no what I mean. When you force them you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was on a roll. \"And you say it's not nice. Did you think it was nice when The Bitch Sisters ganged up on you and Emily pulled your shirt off in front of the school? You remember what she said? That you were built like a boy so you shouldn't have to worry about going around shirtless. Or when Jessica told you that no one would ever find you attractive? They weren't nice, were they? Was it nice when Vanessa  got all sexy and popular and just started ignoring you? Do you think Greg ever gives you a second thought? The world isn't nice, Laura. That's what makes this all so perfect, I get to have whatever I want. And I want to share it with you.\" He directed Laura's attention in through the window through the many thickly muscled men and women to a beast of a human. His back was to them (and it was hands down the widest back Laura had ever seen) but he was posing before the mirror and she could see the reflection of his front side. There was no mistaking the hard, handsome face of Eric Godwin atop the mountain of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura couldn't believe what she was seeing. \"Sooooo, so\u2026. big,\" she said quietly. \"Did you do that? Did you make him bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smirked. \"Well, maybe a little. I added some size to his cock, too. It's not as big as mine, but\u2026 The point is he's my gift to you, for being such a good friend to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let herself get lost in the fantasy for a moment but then snapped back to herself. \"No, Jason. I mean, no thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason considered this for a long time. \"I could just make you want it. I could literally just say the word and you'd walk in there and ask Eric to rub his naked body all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's face contorted into a look of disgust at the thought. There were so many things she wanted to say but she held back. Instead she asked a more broad question: \"They why don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're my friend. You're someone that I wanted to enjoy this with, not just command. I figured you, of all people, would understand what I'm doing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you doing here, Jason? Turning everyone in the world into your slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled. \"Not everyone. Just a few choice subjects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my sister?!?\" Laura was shouting now, her anger on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if I feel like it.\" His demeanor was the opposite of hers: cool and unflinching in the face of her rage. \"I don't know what your problem is, she wants me to do it. She's having the time of her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fucking monster!!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason merely sighed. \"Right now I could walk into a bank and ask for all the money they've got and they would hand it to me willingly, they wouldn't even call the police. And, even if they did I could tell the cops to let me go. AND, even if I didn't do that I could just talk my way right out of jail. There's no one on this planet that can go against me. My power is so absolute I can make your brain override your body. You want to see an example? Your arm really hurts, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly intense pain shot through Laura's right arm and she collapsed to the ground. She curled into a ball with her throbbing arm at the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels better now.\" Jason said. Laura returned to her feet with tears running down her cheeks still rubbing the arm as the phantom pains left. \"Just imagine for a moment what would happen if I told your heart to stop beating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat hung heavy in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued, \"You're right, though. I made a lot of changes to myself. Most of them were small but a few were very, very big. I wanted to make sure I didn't screw up the world in some insane sort of way.\" He laughed, \"Did you know that the app can actually alter history? Imagine if I created some sort of paradox or something. That would be pretty funny. But no, I've been very smart about my decisions so far and I think I'm ready to show you the next big change I made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sucked in a deep breath and Laura watched in awe as his body rapidly swelled. His shirt became stuffed with more muscle than it could handle and was stretching to the breaking point. Jason emptied his lungs and grinned when his mass did not recede with his exhale. He looked down at his body with glee in his eyes and ran his hands over his pumped up chest. He growled with pleasure as he pumped his arm a few times watching the 17 inch bicep solidify beneath his skin. A moment later he stretched his arms out to each side, tensed his fist, then curled his arms inward towards his stomach flexing with all his might. Jason's growl turned into a roar and this time his body didn't just swell, it exploded. Instantly his shirt ripped open in a dozen different places and his shorts attempted to follow suit, though they only tore up each side as his monstrous legs expanded to bigger around than Laura's chest. Jason raised his arms into an incredible double bicep pose with arms that now measured 24 inches around. He relaxed then flexed again making his arms swell even bigger, now nearing 30 inches. Another release and flex and his size poured into his limbs until they were twice the size of any heavyweight bodybuilder the world had ever seen. The rest of his body had continued to grow as well and now his sheer mass forced the shredded clothes to fall from his chest and waist leaving him clad in only white briefs that were grossly overstressed from his new muscles as well as his obviously enormous penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted a monster,\" Jason said to Laura. His voice was radically changed, now much deeper and forceful. He took a step towards where she stood and only now did she realize that somewhere during his growth Jason had also gotten taller. He was now just shy of 7 feet tall. \"How does this work for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura backed up until she was pressed against the gym window. Of all the possible outcomes to confronting Jason this hadn't made the list. Now she didn't know what she was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps I should give myself giant claws and razor sharp fangs, hmm?\" Clothes began to appear on his body, growing from nowhere. In instant he was wearing spandex shorts and a muscle tank. \"Personally I like this better.\" He flexed his arm right in her face and his bicep alone was far bigger than her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, what's going on? Maybe you should leave the woman alone.\" A gym goer had emerged to see an enormous man lording over a tiny woman and was brave enough to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go kill yourself!\" Jason spat over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah alright.\" The strange said then turned toward the busy street on the far side of the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's hard glare on Laura softened a moment later and he let out a frustrated grunt. \"Stop.\" He called to the man who did as he was asked. \"Just go home and forget you saw this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, pal.\" He walked toward his car and drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned back to Laura. \"You don't want to have fun, that's fine. Give me your phone. If you know about the app you might also have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to resist but couldn't. His order was absolute and she couldn't defy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pocketed her phone. \"I wanted to share so much with you. Oh well.\" Jason's body shrank back down so that he was 6 feet tall again and his muscles were more in line with an actual bodybuilder and not a caricature of one. Amazingly his clothes shrank with him so that they remained tight on his smaller body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left Laura sobbing on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes went by and she heard a voice. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up and began cleaning the tears from her eyes. Before she could see who was talking to her the person spoke her name. Clearly it was someone she knew but who?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are you alright?\" a deep voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up but the tears in her eyes blurred her vision and all she saw was a huge shape of a person. It must have been one of the many bodybuilders from the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura? Is that you?\" whomever was speaking was filled with concern. Suddenly a hand thrust out and hovered before her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blinked a few times and wiped her eyes as dry as she could. Finally her vision cleared enough to recognize Eric Godwin standing above her. \"Oh, uh\u2026 hi, Eric.\" She slid her hand into his and he pulled her to her feet. His tug was actually too strong and Laura found herself catapulted forward where she crashed into Eric's chest. The big man was only a few inches taller than Laura so their faces were very close together and suddenly she found herself wrapped up in his massive arms, then a moment later Eric jumped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to pull so hard. Are you alright?\" Eric was beginning to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura couldn't help but laugh. \"I'm fine, I'm fine. I mean I feel like I just ran into a brick wall, but no real damage done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. Good.\" Eric seemed surprisingly shy which emboldened Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck do you have in there, anyway?\" Laura asked giving him a soft punch in the chest. \"Cement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled nervously. \"No, it's just me.\" He cleared his throat and tried to look serious. \"Why were you crying? Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laura was pulled back to the reality where her best friend had turned into a super-powered super-jerk. \"Yeah,\" her smile fled from her face, \"I just had a falling out with someone I thought was my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric frowned. \"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura huffed. \"Yeah, suddenly that guy thinks he's god's gift to the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang out with the gym crowd here long enough and you'll meet several dozen gifts god has apparently blessed the world with. Every meathead who makes some decent gains suddenly thinks he's Hercules reborn. You'll see them strutting around like a peacock showing off their feathers, harassing the ladies and making the whole gym miserable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine,\" Laura said, though it was Jason she was thinking of. She found the app first and had been cautious (after an initial misstep) but he just decides he can warp people's minds however he likes. Who the hell did he think he was? She shook it off and returned to the conversation with Eric, she couldn't let the chance to talk to her long time crush pass her by. \"You seem both massive and grounded. How do you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Eric looked worried. He glanced down at his body as if it were a burden. \"Well, I mean, I don't know. I've just never been the sort to showboat, you know? I just keep to myself and focus on what I'm doing and making sure I'm doing it well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's obvious you're doing an incredible job. You're positively enormous.\" Laura desperately wanted to reach out and put her hands on Eric's giant muscles but she held off. This was the first time she'd spoken to him in over a year and she didn't want to be weird. At the same time she felt like he was actually into her, something about his behavior told her that she could end up getting a date out of this. She'd never felt this sort of confidence before and she loved it. Suddenly a thought occurred to her that sucked the wind from her sails: Jason must have messed with his profile to make him like me. He'll undo it any minute and Eric will want nothing to do with me. She shook this off insisting to herself that Jason had just planned to use his creepy mind-control trick on Eric and that this conversation, the feelings that he seemed to be exhibiting were genuine, but it was hard to eliminate the idea completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done alright,\" he said twisting where he stood as if trying to hide his wide body from view. Laura positively loved how demure he was acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood silent for several seconds, Laura just grinning at the fact that she was actually talking to Eric for the first time in well over a year. Finally Eric attempted to look serious and concerned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" he began clearing his throat, \"I know I haven't seen you in a good while but\u2026 uh\u2026 I mean, I was just going to head home and then get some dinner. If, uh, you didn't want to be alone tonight you're welcome to join me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura put her hand on her hip and played up her surprise. \"My goodness! Eric Godwin, are you asking me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Eric flushed so fast and so red she was afraid she'd pushed him too far. She had forgotten how quite and shy he'd been when he'd hung around the house with Greg. She quickly moved to stand next to him and slid her arm inside his. She placed her other hand on his thick bicep and actually managed to refrain from squeezing it, though she did give it a nice hard press to feel the tight muscle under his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy to have the company,\" Laura said giving Eric the biggest smile she could. \"Lead the way, Hercules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't help but laugh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura followed Eric to his car, an old, beat up SUV, and watched him squeeze into the driver's seat. Despite his large vehicle he hardly fit behind the wheel and Laura was reminded of her brief time with huge muscles and the occasional trouble she'd had with tight spaces. She actually missed the hassle of being so massive that ordinary tasks became a challenge and vowed to herself that when she got her phone back from Jason she would look into expanding her own physique once more, but this time she'd be smarter about it. This turned her thoughts to Jason and his new ability to seemingly grow to any size he desired. How big could he get? Was there a limit? How strong could he be? Did she actually stand a chance of getting her phone back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these questions and more flowed through Laura's head as she climbed into the passenger seat. Eric must have noticed Laura's expression had changed because before he put his car into motion he gave her a look of concern. \"Still thinking about your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura snapped out of her thoughts. \"Oh\u2026 yeah. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. These things can be hard to shake. I only hope I can be enough of a distraction for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up and down Eric's body. \"Oh yeah, you'll do nicely.\" She giggled surprised at her own forwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove to Eric's home they caught up on the past few years since they'd last seen each other. Eric asked about Laura's siblings and what sorts of things she was interested in, she made a conscious effort to be completely upfront with her nerdy exploits deciding that if Eric was going to like her he was going to accept that she was a geek through and through. Laura asked him about the bodybuilding lifestyle and his successes. She also congratulated him on his recent third place win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" he said sounding almost embarrassed. \"It was a real surprise. I didn't expect to place at all. I really believe that the other guys lost more than I actually won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so hard on yourself?\" Laura asked. She began to understand how Vanessa must view Laura's insecurities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I always have been, I guess.\" He became lost in thought for a long time. Then, \"I suppose that's what pushes me to work as hard as I do. I always feel like I can be better, bigger, stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded. \"Believe me, I know what it's like to never feel like you're good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they arrived at Eric's apartment. He led her into a cramped studio that was made more cramped by the volume of bodybuilding paraphernalia scattered about. The kitchen was overloaded with huge bottles of protein powder, supplements and other nutritional necessitates while half of the remaining floor space was taken up by a weight bench and lots of scattered dumbbells. Eric's only furniture was a sunken full sized mattress that sat on the floor in the corner, a worn but very comfy looking sofa right next to the bed, and a small computer desk with a very advanced looking computer with dual monitors and various high tech peripherals. In fact the computer looked like the newest and most well taken care of thing in the entire apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the mess,\" Eric said. \"I don't have company often. Or ever, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, it's not what I expected. Considering your successes in bodybuilding I imagined luxury cars and mansions.\" Laura tried to make sure she kept humor in her voice to communicate to Eric she was just kidding around but what she said was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Eric laughed. \"Yeah, most people think bodybuilders are rich or something. I've only placed in the one show and while those winnings should cover my rent for the next year or so this is an expensive sport. My food and supplement budget is pretty crazy. I still work my day job, in fact. Maybe if I place again at my next show in a few weeks I can pick up an endorsement deal that would let me quit, but my guess is I'll still be working for a living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your job?\" Laura asked. She began to realize how lucky her brother was to come from a fairly well off family. He just worked occasionally as a personal trainer but didn't need to worry much about expenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work in IT for a corporate bank downtown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\" Suddenly the nice computer in the corner made a lot more sense. \"Wow, brawn and brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Eric actually looked proud for once, \"I might not look it, but I just finished up getting my masters in computer science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, you don't look it at all. I honestly can't imagine your huge body squeezed into a cubicle hunched over a computer.\" Laura was loving the image of Eric in an office. \"Oh! Do you wear a shirt and tie? That'd be so sexy. I'll bet all the women in the office call you constantly looking for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again Laura watched Eric's face redden. \"Well, I have noticed that the women there tend to need more on site assistance than the men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed, \"Yeah they do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric retreated into the bathroom. \"I'm going to take a quick shower. Make yourself at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura did just that. She went to the kitchen and grabbed a soda. Then she made her way around the small apartment and examined various odds and ends. In her browsing she came across a stack of photos which appeared to be from Eric's latest contest. A photo of the top three finishers showed Laura that though Eric was several inches shorter than the first and second place winners his mass was easily on the same level. The trick was that the man in the photos was decidedly smaller than the man she'd come home with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she whispered aloud to herself, \"Jason really must have beefed you up. I wonder what you would look like next to these guys now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura heard the water shut off. Then the door to the bathroom creaked open and she could see Eric's face appear. \"Um\u2026 this is a little embarrassing but I'm usually alone so I forgot to bring a change of clothes in here with me. Could you\u2026 uh\u2026 give me a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled broadly back at the tiny sliver of Eric's face. Then she began clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny,\" Eric said. \"How about some clothes instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged and made her way to his closet. She found a few drawers stuffed inside and rummaged through. Finally she pulled out a single garment and tossed it onto the floor about five feet in front of the bathroom door. She grinned at Eric again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and saw she had selected a pair of tiny red posing briefs. He sighed and shot Laura a look that was both a sneer and a smile. Then he quickly emerged with a towel cinched around his waist then quickly scooped up the briefs before vanishing back into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A towel?\" Laura shouted. \"That's cheating!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Eric emerged dressed only in the briefs which hardly fit at all. He scrambled to the closet where Laura quickly moved out of his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You can stand in front of a crowd of thousands wearing those but you can't face little ol' me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't exactly fit like they used to.\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask about that.\" Laura held up the picture she found. \"This wasn't all that long ago but you look much, much bigger. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric finished pulling on a pair of shorts and a shirt that were both very tight. \"It's strange,\" he said. \"I don't think I should get into it. You wouldn't believe me. Heck, I don't really believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Laura knew more than Eric on the matter, but she wanted to see what he had to say. \"I bet you'd be surprised what I would believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shot her a look that said \"oh yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, try me.\" She dared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed. \"Well, I've always been on the bigger side of the scale especially for my height. I frequently weigh in as heavy as guys five or six inches taller than me. That's actually one of my downfalls, I'm too big and I start to lose my symmetry. Anyway, yesterday I checked my weight and I was a few pounds over 260, again that's pretty huge for a guy my height. Then when I woke up today I was like this.\" Eric motioned to his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing <i>this</i> is more than 260?\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Eric took a few steps towards Laura so she could fully take in just how massive he was. \"As of this morning I weighed in at 328 pounds. Somehow I just magically gained nearly 70 pounds of muscle overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Laura said. \"That is unbelievable. But you say it's true so I have to believe you. You really don't know what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t,\" he said. \"It actually scares me. What if it happens again? But the other part that scares me is that I kind of love it. Today, when I was working out I was so much stronger. So much power, I never thought I'd ever be this strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura spotted the large bulge in his shorts getting larger. Then he raised his arm and pulled his short sleeve up to his beefy shoulder and flexed his arm. The huge muscles swelled larger than Laura's head and she instantly reached out to grope the engorged peak. \"How big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday, 21 and a half inches.\" Eric extended his arm then flexed again so Laura could feel the relaxed muscle become steel again. \"Today, 25 inches flat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pawed at him Eric seemed distant, \"What if I find out how this happened and decide to keep making myself bigger? What if I become some power hungry monster? What if I shrink back down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Laura said, \"we don't know what happened or what's going to happen. I guess all we can do is live in the moment and enjoy what we know we have right now.\" She moved her hands from his arm to Eric's chest, then she slid them around his torso and hugged him tightly while laying her head on his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled then returned the hug wrapping his super strong arms around Laura gently so as not to crush her. \"I suppose you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how should we go about enjoying the moment?\" Laura asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, I would have preferred to take you out for a real date, but I probably don't have any nice clothes that will fit me at the moment,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, feeling a bit confident with how the night was going replied, \"Oh come on, surely you can think of something better than that!\" Eric blushed at this, but feel silent. \"Ok, stud, I've got an idea. How about we order in, and in the mean time, you can give me a little preview of your posing routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause Eric replied, \"Awww, hell...alright, I guess. You've seen me in the briefs already anyway, and I guess I can use some practice posing at this new size. You've been around bodybuilding enough to be my judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now we're talking,\" Laura said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't be too harsh. All this extra mass has got me a bit off balance. Everything just feels...huge right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, huge is one way to put it. And don't worry, I'm going to enjoy the view no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Eric took a few steps across the room and stood with his back facing Laura. As he stripped down to his posing briefs, Laura sat in amazement at his size. She had seen him before, but now, standing there purposefully in front of her, she finally took in his true bulk. Eric's pulled of his shirt first revealing a wide chiseled back, nearly as wide as a door frame. Huge traps and lats were framed by massive triceps. The shorts were next, but the size of Eric's legs made it difficult to remove. After struggling to pull them past his quads, he gave up and tore them off with a swift tug. The feeling of tearing the shorts like paper gave him a boost of confidence, and he began to get a bit playful himself. He turned around and tossed the shorts to Laura with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I won't be needing these anymore. Now let's get started!\" And with that he hit the biggest double biceps Laura had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric moved through the poses Laura was stunned by his size and definition. Something seemed off though. Was Eric getting bigger as he was posing? Maybe he was just getting a pump through flexing? It was hard to tell since Eric had no clothes on that were ripping or tearing as evidence of his growth. Well, not no clothes. He had the red briefs. Laura concentrated on Eric's package as he continued his routine. It was admittedly hard not to. As Eric moved into a side chest, Laura could see the front of the briefs stretching out slightly. He was obviously getting a bit aroused at putting on this private display for her, but this was something else. It was subtle, but no, he was definitely adding mass (and girth). As if on cue, Laura's theory was confirmed when Eric's briefs tore and flew across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" he yelled as he tried to make himself decent with his huge hands. Even now those huge hands were not enough to cover his huge member. \"I'm sooo sorry, this is so embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be too hard on yourself, that was quite a routine,\" Laura said, as she tried to figure out how to explain what was truly going on. \"You're going to really 'burst' the competition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, that's real funny. But, seriously, what is going on here? I swear I was growing even as I was posing. The feeling was such a rush though I couldn't stop,\" Eric replied as he headed towards the bathroom, now fully exposed and not hiding it. \"Holy shit, 340 lbs! That's another dozen pounds since this morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Eric, I think I may know what's going on, but this may be a bit difficult to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harder to explain that my exploding muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you sit down and I'll tell you everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric moved across the room and dropped down on the bed with a thud. \"Not that I'm complaining, but are you going to get dressed?\" Laura asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those briefs were probably the last thing that would fit me. Plus, no point in being shy anymore anyway. You've already seen my dick explode out of a bathing suit,\" he replied with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'll try to keep my focus and tell you the story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through everything Laura had done since discovering the app, Eric was a bit surprised. \"Well, I guess I have no choice but to believe you. And after what I've gone through, that's as good an explanation of anything. Plus, if this is an app, there's got to be some way to access it from a server or something. I bet I could hack into it and revoke his access, or give us back control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think you can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth a shot. Give me some time over here. In the meantime, you can think about what we'll do once we can control it again,\" he said. </span></div></div>",

As much as she admitted that part of her liked the idea of her friend helping set her up with a guy it felt wrong this way.  She began to text a reply then decided it would be better to call him for this discussion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Laura,\" Jason said airily, answering the phone so quickly he must have been waiting for it to ring.  \"Ready to go guy hunting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to tell him no and confront Jason about the app when she was distracted by the sound of someone giggling in the background.  Instead she asked, \"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's Olivia, she stopped by after her shift last night and hasn't left yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia?  Last night?  So what, you jumped straight out of my sister's bed into bed without some other chick?  We need to talk right now about how this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Laura, settle down,\" Jason interrupted, \"Vanessa knows we aren't exclusive, she's OK with it, everything is OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jason said, \"OK,\" Laura felt her resolve and her anger falter.  Everything was OK wasn't it?  She shook her head angrily,no, this was whatever power Jason had given himself with the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, we've been best friends for a long time and you just need a little confidence boost to get out there and start enjoying life, like I am,\" Laura began to feel as though it was impossible to concentrate on anything but the sound of Jason's voice, \"after all, you're finally getting that late bloomer thing going on like you've always wanted and you're looking better than ever, and all the workouts?  You look as good as Vanessa used to,\" Jason was practically purring in her ear.  She felt her body flush with warmth and from the sudden tightness of her clothes and the direction Jason was steering the conversation she was sure that Jason had just turned her into a clone of her sister, not the big titted bimbo he had just turned Vanessa into, but the gorgeous beach bunny she had been yesterday morning.  \"Everything is OK,\" Jason repeated again,\" now get dressed and come over, I'll help you get hooked up with someone.  I know you won't regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's resolve was all but dissolved, she found herself wordlessly kneading one of her now abundant breasts with one hand.  It felt amazing, she wished she had a mirror so she could see how she looked.  But she had always looked like this hasn't she?  Since she finally really hit puberty earlier this year?  Everything was OK wasn't it?</span></div></div>",

She shook her head and growled, holding on to her last sliver of indignant anger.  \"Jason, this is wrong,\" she was absolutely intent on having it out with Jason and confronting him about his use of the app. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Jason was momentarily taken off guard and he seemed obviously surprised that Laura wasn't simply agreeing with him.  \"What''s wrong?  I mean nothing is wrong, everything is OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop saying that,\" Laura literally yelled at her phone, hating the way that hiswords kept affecting her.  This had to stop, Laura put the phone on speaker and kept yelling at Jason as she opened the app and began drilling through the options on Jason's profile, she had to shut off this stupid persuasion power of his so she could actually talk to him.  \"Stop telling me that things are OK because they aren't, it's not right the way you're treating Vanessa, or Olivia, or even me,\"  She cursed inwardly as she tried sifting through all the changes he had made to himself.  Most of the changes seemed to be minor cosmetic tweaks, this was taking too long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, I just want you to be happy, I just want you all be happy,\" Jason droned on.  Laura felt herself relaxing again and she almost closed out of the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working backwards is getting me nowhere fast, I bet it was one of the first changes he made to himself,\" Laura muttered to herself, opening his revision history again and flicking towards the top of the list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Jason's momentary confusion helped Laura focus again and she finally found \"Commanding word,\" under Revision 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You D and D nerd,\" Laura chuckled as she swept left on the revision to strike it from the active revisions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura what are you doing?\"  Jason sounded panicked.  \"Laura stop!

She sat still for a moment, catching her breath and collecting her scrambled thoughts.  \"Jason, we really need to talk,\" she started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was interrupted, not by Jason this time but by the shrieking of a woman who she assumed had to be Olivia, \"Who are you?  What the fuck am I doing here?  What happened to my tits?  You drugged me didn't you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quickly escalating terror and anger in Olivia's voice drowned out Jason's imploring urges of, \"everything is OK, just relax.\"  The almost explosive sound of a slap right next to the phone made Laura wince and Jason's very real cry of pain and surprise was cut off by what sounded like the phone dropping to the floor.  Laura looked at her phone and verified that the call with Jason had been lost.  Had his phone broke?  Laura shrugged and set her own phone down.  The motion caused an unfamiliar shifting sensation in her chest and she looked down with surprise, she had momentarily forgotten that she had breasts now, sizable ones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood up and walked to her dresser mirror, momentarily entranced by the sight of her own body.  Jason had definitely copied Vanessa's assets onto Laura's frame and he had obviously kind of rushed the job because he hadn't taken into account the height difference between the sisters, making Laura look even more outrageously curvy than Vanessa had.  Laura turned to examine her profile and she involuntarily grinned at the sight of her new firm but well rounded hips and butt straining her cotton sleep shorts to the utter limit.  \"Damn, I look good,\" Laura whistled at her reflection.  She hefted her new breasts and almost squealed for joy,  She struggled to wriggle out of her previously baggy t-shirt and carefully appraised her new assets.  \"No wonder Vanessa was so proud of these,\" Laura murmured to herself.  The sat high and proud on her chest with an almost perfect teardop shape and perky nipples.  Laura experimentally tweaked one and felt herself go weak in the knees.  \"Oh my God.\"  She was distracted by her phone ringing and turned away from her new reflection with some reluctance.</span></div></div>",

She began digging through her closet for something to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura,\" Vanessa's voice sounded shaky like she had either just been crying or was about to start.  \"I need to ask you a very important question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Laura said slowly, \"where are you?  Are you OK?\"  Laura stopped rifling through her closet and sat on the edge of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I guess I was driving to the mall?  I'm not really sure.  It feels like I just woke up, this is going to sound stupid but did I sleep with someone last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yea,\" Laura said, not sure how this was going to play out.  \"You slept with Jason last night, we just talked about it, you seemed pretty chill about the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, it did happen,\" Vanessa started sobbing which caught Laura off guard, she hadn't expected this to happen when she had shut off Jason't power.  \"Please come get me and drive me back home, I don't think I'm OK to drive, I'm right past the bus stop.  Please hurry,\" Vanessa finished with a soft whimper that brought a chill to Laura's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, sure, I'm on my way.  Hang in there,\" Laura hung up, pulled a slightly bigger t-shirt, slipped on some sneakers and grabbed her purse before heading out the door.  She had shut off Jason's power so she could attempt to have a confusion with him without feeling like her head was underwater, she hadn't anticipated this sort of backlash and she wasn't sure whether she felt guilty for causing it, mad at Jason for starting this in the first place or maybe a little bit of both.  She reached the bus stop as fast as a brisk walking pace could get her there and saw Vanessa's car up ahead, parked on the side of the road.  She quickened her pace to jog and was startled as her new chest bounced heavily, reminding her that it was there.  \"Shit,\" she cursed to herself.  There was no way Vanessa wasn't going to notice this. She walked slowly up to the car and saw Vanessa was already sitting in the passenger seat.  Laura opened the driver's door and got in, quickly fastening her seatbelt and starting the car, hoping Vanessa was too distracted by her own problems to notice Laura's new assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Lulu,\" Vanessa said with a sniffle.  \"I don't know what happened, I think he might have drugged me, when I try to remember last night it's so fuzzy, I just felt like everything was OK but kind of numb.  It's hard to explain.  And my boobs are bloated or something.  Something must be really wrong with me,\" Vanessa's voice trailed off as she noticed Laura's new breasts, straining at her t-shirt and dramatically separated by the seatbelt.  \"What the hell is going on Laura?\"  Vanessa asked, sounding very confused and like she may be about to start crying again.</span></div></div>",

Like for instance Jason gave me your old boobs after he apparently decided you didn't need them anymore after your \"upgrade,\" he's kind of into big tits but I'm guessing you figured that out on your own already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa snorted.  \"My boobs were not that big.

OK, he wanted to hook me up with some guy, I think that was his way of apologizing to me for ditching me to sleep with at least two different woman last night.  He was super nice about it and at the time I didn't care but I think that was the commanding word thing.  The more I think about the whole thing the more pissed off I get about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two women?  Wait, not boobzilla from the restaurant last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, \"yea, I kind of called him out on it already but he said you knew you two weren't exclusive and that you were cool with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That mother fucker,\" Vanessa spat venomously.  \"I'm not a one night stand type,\" she angrily wiped at her eyes which were tearing up again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Laura said when Vanessa had seemed to regain her composure.  \"I get that you're upset, I really do.  I'm angry with him and he didn't even use his whammy to get in my pants,\" Vanessa visibly bristled at this but said nothing so Laura continued. \"I think his phone got broken so he probably can't whammy you again, we might want to go talk to him.  I'm definitely not defending what he did but I don't think he realized how it was going to turn out.\"  Laura finally pulled into their driveway and shut the car off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Vanessa said, her voice trembling with anger.  \"You know what's going on, you even said you shut off his power.  You can change people and things like he can,\" this was a statement and not a question.  \"I want to change him and punish him for this, and change myself.\"</span></div></div>",

Laura wondered how big Jason planned to grow Vanessa's boobs before he was done..  \"What size are you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shrugged.  \"At least small enough to fit into what I bought yesterday.\"  Vanessa leaned over to watch as Laura adjusted Vanessa's avatar.  \"Are you telling me that a phone app can change my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Laura hit \"apply\" and Vanessa gasped as her body adjusted itself to match the onscreen avatar.  \"There you go, back to G.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment of being stunned into immobility Laura undid her seatbelt and exited Vaness's car.  Vanessa glanced back over her shoulder and began running across the beach and Laura ran after her.  Laura initially thought she would have the advantage because she assumed Vanessa's larger breasts would slow her down but it became quickly obvious Vanessa had multiple advantages, she was already used to having large breasts to deal with whereas Laura was still adjusting to hers, Vanessa was wearing a bra which made her breasts more manageable while Laura wasn't, and Vanessa was more used to running around on sand than Laura was.  Vanessa steadily widened the distance between them regardless of Larua's efforts until any remaining hope that Laura had of keeping up with her sister vanished when Vanessa reached the boardwalk and quickly disappeared into the crowds of people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slowed to a stop and cursed under her breath while she surveyed the crowds for a glimpse of her sister.  Finally she turned away and stalked angrily back towards home.  She had no idea what Vanessa may have in mind for the app but she was obviously angry at Jason and apparently Laura as well.  Laura did note with some satisfaction when she back home that Vanessa's car was still in the driveway, driver's side door still standing open.  She took the key out of the ignition and grabbed her purse before locking up the car and heading inside to get dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even bother looking for any of her own clothes that might fit her, instead she went directly to Vanessa's room and pillaged her sisters wardrobe shamelessly.  She didn't know if Vanessa had any intention of removing the curves Jason had gifted her with or not but she figured she may as well enjoy them while she could, and what better way to do that than with clothes that already been selected to show them off to full effect?  It was a bit odd having Vanessa's dimensions without her height, it made it difficult to find a shirt that wasn't too long and pants were out of the question but Laura quickly settled on a pair of raggedly cut off denim microshorts that really showed off her ass,and a tight fighting crop with a deep v cut to display her new amazing cleavage.  It felt kind of weird to be wearing a bra for actual support but naturally Vanessa's bras fit her curves perfectly and the top showcased her cleavage much better when she was wearing one.  She ran her fingers over her stomach, surprised at her, and by extension Vanessa's, abs that the top also showed off.  She wanted to head to Jason's to talk to him as soon as possible and almost skipped putting on makeup but then decided it would seem like a waste to dress to flaunt her body and not put on makeup to go with it.  Remembering what she had been shown yesterday she quickly applied a less extensive but still flattering version of the makeover Vanessa had helped her with.  She stopped herself from also restyling her hair and slipped on a pair of low heeled sandals before heading to Jasons, both to finish the conversation that had been interrupted earlier, and in the hopes of maybe running into Vanessa and getting her phone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exited Vanessa's car and knocked on Jason's door, a little concerned about what she might find.  It was opened momentarily by Jason and she was taken aback by the extremely obvious, and very painful looking mark on the left side of his face where he been slapped, probably more than once.  His eye was puffy and partially closed, already turning purple with a vicious looking bruise and near his chin were deep scratches where Olivia had obviously gotten her nails in as well.  \"Vanessa?\"  Jason said with some surprise.  Then recognition set in.  \"Holy crap, Laura, I almost didn't recognize you, you look really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap is right?  What happened to you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason only shrugged awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you see Vanessa, keep away from her.  She's really pissed off at you and she stole my phone.  I had the same app you did on it, and she knows how to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked horrified.  \"You had the app?  Are you the one who broke my commanding word power?  Olivia wanted to kill me once it stopped it working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I shut off your stupid commanding word because you kept trying to use it on me instead of having a real conversation and it was pissing me off.\"  Laura looked around uneasily, \"but are you sure you want to argue about this on your front porch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stepped back from the doorway and angrily motioned Laura inside.  \"I didn't think it would turn out like this,\" he hissed at Laura once the door was closed.  \"I thought I was just nudging people in the direction I wanted, I wanted to be more confident but it got a little out of hand.  But, you could have got me killed,\" he shouted at Laura.  \"All the suggestions I made just vanished when you shut it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura crossed her arms under her boobs and Jason was obviously distracted for a moment by her cleavage before her angry tone made him refocus.  \"Did you hear what I told you or do you just want to piss and moan about getting slapped?  Vanessa has the app and she's furious at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped and momentarily looked thoughtful.  Laura has assumed since Jason hadn't called or texted her back that his phone was broken but something about his expression made her think that might not be the case</span></div></div>",

Does she know how to use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged, \"I'm not sure.  I mean she watched me use it when I changed you, and maybe for some adjustments I made last night, but I don't know how well she's going to remember it now.  It seems like she forgot a lot of details between the point I first talked to her and when you broke my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, \"Vanessa seemed pretty fuzzy on details also but she at least remembered enough to be angry at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is she mad at you?  You didn't do anything to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty much why she's mad.  She thinks because I knew about the app and didn't do anything to stop you that it's at least partially my fault.  Or I think that's what she was getting at.  She just kind of yelled at me and ran off after she hit me and took my phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa hit you?\"  Jason seemed shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, \"She got me on the bridge of my nose with her elbow.  It hurt like hell and surprised me but she didn't break it or anything.\"  Laura rubbed at her nose.  \"I think she just wanted to startle me so she could swipe my phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah,\" Jason groaned with frustration.  \"She doesn't know how to use the app thought right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura arched an eyebrow and glared at Jason, \"how hard is it really to figure out?\"  Jason looked sheepish.  \"Besides, she watched me adjust her boobs. She wasn't super happy with the huge rack you were growing her into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't like them?\"  Jason seemed honestly surprised.  \"Last night she told me she'd love to have bigger boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, not sure how much you can trust her judgement from last night, I don't even want to know how much bigger you planned on making those things.\"  Laura sighed.  \"What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked momentarily confused.  \"What do mean?  There's nothing we can do, they have the app, we  don't.  I don't even know why you're worried, Olivia doesn't have any reason to dislike you and even if Vanessa is mad at you I'm sure it's nothing compared to how pissed off she is at me.  Just go home, forget about it, enjoy the new body,\" Jason waved towards the door and looked at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hesitated, \"Why did you give me a new body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged and continued to stare at his feet, \"I felt like I was leaving you out, I was giving tweaks to your sister and Olivia and even though I always thought you were pretty anyway you always seemed jealous of Vanessa so I figured why not give you what it seemed like you always wanted?  I thought it would make you happy and you're my friend so I wanted you to be happy,\" Jason paused for a moment, it seemed like he was expecting Laura to say something but she was momentarily speechless so he continued.  \"I just got so caught up in what I could do with the app that I wasn't thinking of how it was going to effect other people, I felt like I just knew better, now I just feel like shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura still wasn't sure what to say, \"Thanks I guess?\"  She paused again.  \"C'mon, don't give up.  Maybe we could go try to find Vanessa or Olivia and talk through this like rational people, maybe find some way to get our phones back.\"</span></div></div>",

Before you got here I was just worried about Olivia, now it's twice as bad as I even thought.\"  Jason shuffled across the room and sank down onto his couch, cradling his head in his hands.  \"I am so screwed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura almost left Jason to mope alone, in a lot of ways he deserved to.  \"No,\" Laura finally said, walking over and standing in front of him, \"I came back to this crappy reality because we weren't friends in the other one I created, you're not ditching me that easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Jason looked up at Laura with obvious disbelief, \"you created another reality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" Laura nodded, \"I made myself the greatest bodybuilder the world had ever seen.\"  Laura smiled wistfully and flexed her biceps reflexively at the memories.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the app?  When?  I don't remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't, it was a historical change, history was rewritten, everything was different.  I turned into a cold heartless bitch and you were the bass player for some punk or metal band, but we didn't get along anymore, we hadn't been friends for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason snorted, \"I don't know how to play the bass.  Did I least get a lot of groupies?\" he asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged.  \"You were actually pretty good, you even sang a few songs, and you probably would have groupies throwing themselves at you constantly, you weren't like bodybuilder big, but you were really cut, pretty hot actually, and you spent the last few songs of the show with your shirt off, you could see the girls in the crowd go nuts for you.  But you had a girlfriend, dedicated a song to her and everything, it was really sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason finally looked up from his feet, \"I had a girlfriend?\"  There was such a plaintive ache of longing in the question it made Laura's heart hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" she said softly, \"she was very pretty, dark hair, green eyes, enormous natural boobs, and I think she worshiped the ground you walked on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason snorted again, \"now I know you're just fucking with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously,\" Laura said, sitting down on the couch next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why would you take all that away from me?\"  Jason asked angrily, he looked away from Laura but she thought he had tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hand on his shoulder, \"Because the me in that reality was plotting to destroy all that for you.  I told you she was heartless.  Things felt like they were going to escalate out of control in that reality so I undid the changes, brought everything back to how it was, made sure we were still best friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head, \"What do you think gave you the right to change my life without my...\" Jason's voice trailed off and he put his heads in his hands again.  \"Holy shit, I'm such an asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The app had a lot of power, it needs to be used carefully, I've spent the last couple days wanting to change myself again but being afraid to, Vanessa giving me the whole makeover treatment really helped me I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason said nothing for a moment, \"what were you going to change about yourself?\" he asked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \"I was going to give myself the same boobs your girlfriend had, see if maybe that would get you to go out with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, \"seriously.  I don't know if you've noticed or not but myself-esteem has always kind of sucked.  I wanted to feel wanted I guess.  I don't know if I ever really thought about it before but after seeing you with a girlfriend in the other reality I realized I was jealous.  When I got back to this one I wanted to see what it would be like for us to be together, part of me actually thought that Vanessa's makeover would do the trick and that I wouldn't have to use the app.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have gone out with you if I had know...\" Jason started to say but Laura cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your first taste of power and you went after Vanessa.  We've been friends for years and have more in common than probably some married couples but you went right for the superficial even knowing how easily that can be changed anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sputtered, \"but Vanessa is a nice girl and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea she is, and you treated her like shit,\" Laura said interrupting him.  \"Look, our friendship is important to me, like I said, I changed reality to get it back, and I still want to help you because you're my friend, but I don't think it's every going to be more than that.  Now what do you say?  Are you going to get up off this couch and try to do something about this with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at Laura silently for a moment and a lot of obviously conflicting emotions passed over his face before he finally nodded.  \"Yea, we should at least try to do something, which one of them do you want to go after first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Absolutely not,\" Laura growled.  Laura clacked loudly back to her room and grabbed a scarf and handbag before heading out to the club.  For a moment she thought about texting Nikki, Suzy or Brittany (or all three) to come with then decided against it.  As she stood in her room debating about whether to go solo or in a group she could have sworn she heard the sound of her own voice crying out faintly somewhere in the distance. For a moment she felt like she was returning to what she used to be, timid, weak, in the shadow of her brother and sister, actually being concerned about others and what they wanted.  She held her head and grunted, pushing that old feeling away.  When she felt like herself again she clacked over to her dresser and rummaged in her top drawer, quickly finding what she was looking for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are,\" Laura held up an old picture.  It was her and Jason, standing next to each other in front of the local comic shop.  She was ten in the picture, just before she started following her brother to the gym.  Small, weak.   Laura looked at this picture and her lip curled in disdain.  She used to keep it to remind herself of how far she come in the last few years, now it reminded her of what she might  be like if she hadn't taken up bodybuilding and made serious sacrifices.  \"You're not who I am anymore,\" Laura said as she crumpled the photo into a ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura clacked back to the kitchen and held the picture over the stove top, turning it on and holding the picture to the flame.  As it burned the small weak voice in the back of her mind faded to silence and oddly enough she remembered the last argument that Greg had with her before he stopped training her.  \"You've become heartless and self-centered, I get dedication, but this is something else.  You're turning into a sociopath and you're scaring me.  Hell, you're scaring a lot of people these days,\"  Greg sounded tired, like he knew this conversation was going to go nowhere before it already started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I'm a girl,\" Laura countered.  \"If a guy goes after what he wants he's determined or dedicated, if a girl does it she's a bitch or an Ice Queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice Queen?\"  Greg snorted.  \"You're too selfish and petty to be Queen, at best you're an Ice Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura brushed the dust of the burnt photo from her hands and turned away from the stove to find Vanessa standing behind her.  \"Going out again?\"  Vanessa asked with a raised eyebrow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that club was awful.  I have time to get some real action at someplace decent before it gets too late.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun,\" Vanessa said with a grin.  \"Let me change and I'll come with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \"I'd prefer to go solo if you don't mind, I was going to call the girls and bring them with then decided not to.  I need to find new toys to play rough with, I'll probably break them and I really don't feel like sharing tonight.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shrugged, \"next time then.  You must be over whatever was bothering you earlier, you sound like your old self again.  Did you get what you were after with Jason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head, \"not yet, but I will eventually.  And yes, I'm back.  Never felt better.\"  Laura turned her back on her sister and clacked loudly out the front door and into the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura decided that the chance to create a person, a boyfriend even, from nothing was too good to pass up. She tapped the \u201cCreation Wizard\u201d button and was asked to input a name for her creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m always so bad at names,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cWhat\u2019s a good strong and sexy name?\u201d She thought about this for longer than she cared to then gave up and typed in \u201cSteve Jacobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid name, but it\u2019ll do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext a series of silhouettes outlining various body types appeared. The instructions prompted her to pick a template and assured her that further adjustments to size and build would still be available in later menus. There were more options than she would have expected, from skinny as a rail to horribly obese. As she scrolled through the options the outlines began to become more and more physically fit and Laura began to get excited. Though she would never admit it (and certainly never act on it) she believed her brother\u2019s bodybuilder physique was way hot and she got super excited whenever his buff friends would come over to workout with him. She looked at this as an opportunity to have a boyfriend that was even bigger and stronger than Greg or any of his buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura scrolled until she found the most extreme muscular body shape and tapped it. The silhouette faded for a moment and she was prompted to select a skin tone from a dozen or so boxes. She tapped one that was fair but with a healthy tan then skipped the option to further adjust the lightness or darkness. Now the silhouetted form colored in with her selection and Laura felt her loins catch fire. What she was looking at was one hot body, though the fact that it was missing a head was a little off putting. She now had the chance to, as previously promised, to fine tune and adjust \u201cSteve\u2019s\u201d form to her specific liking and Laura jumped right at the chance to add even more muscle mass. She pumped her creation\u2019s form until he outgrew any bodybuilder in history. Laura salivated over his 65 inch chest and nearly 40 inch thighs, but what really got her hot was his bulging 26 inch arms. She began to massage her crotch at the thought of those muscular arms wrapped around her, holding her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make the vision complete she zoomed in on his naked waist and began increasing the size of his penis until it hung 7 inches long when relaxed and doubled in size when hard. By now her hand was inside her shorts and her fingers were rubbing at her clitoris feverishly while she operated her iPhone with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on Laura was prompted to construct Steve\u2019s head and face. She gave him dark hair parted down the left side and stunning green eyes. She adjusted his facial features until he looked young and friendly while still strong and starkly handsome. When she finished the head was added to the already existing body and her powerhouse boy-toy came into focus. Now the hand in her lap was shaking very rapidly and Laura was soon biting her lip and stiffening her entire body as an orgasm erupted inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura caught her breath and continued with the Creation Wizard which was now asking for specific information about Steve\u2019s personal life and history. She input his birthday to make him 21 years old and fixed his height at 6 feet 6 inches tall, then began setting his personality traits. She made it so Steve was smart, funny, kind, and loving. She made him confident but still occasionally awkward, a bit of a goofball and quite geeky. She made several of their interests overlap including a love of comics, anime and science fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura found a category marked \u201cLove Interests\u201d and made sure to include herself. She adjusted their relationship status so that they were deep into the couple range beyond halfway towards marriage. She went ahead and added her best friend Jason to Steve\u2019s \u201cfriendship\u201d column as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran through the remainder of the personality sections quickly making some adjustments or inputs, but leaving many alone. Finally she tapped the \u201cAll Done\u201d button and was greeted with one final screen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">CONGRATULATIONS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour profile is ready to be created. Which temporal setting would you like:<br>\r\n-Historical: Subject is given complete history back to birth and integrated with current timeline.<br>\r\n-Instantaneous - Subject is created without history and no connection to timeline.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tapped \u201chistorical\u201d since it was the only thing that really made sense to her (though she still didn\u2019t know how any of this could be possible) and when she did she was suddenly overcome by a wave of dizziness. She stumbled back towards her bed but didn\u2019t make it. She fell to the floor and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura awoke and picked herself off the ground. She couldn\u2019t remember why she had fallen, but she did remember trying to create a megahunk named Steve and, after a quick glance around to confirm she was alone, suddenly felt very stupid for believing that such a thing could even be possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crammed her phone into her pocked and stumbled downstairs where she plopped down on the couch and began channel surfing to see if she could shut off her mind and pretend she couldn\u2019t have been so silly as to think an iPhone app could create a person. What she had failed to notice as she had left her room was that there were several new photographs on her dresser that included herself and an incredibly muscular man posing together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura surfed from channel to channel for almost two full hours without really watching anything. She was still sitting zombified on the couch when Greg and Vanessa returned home from their afternoon of sunbathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lulu,\u201d Vanessa said as she sat down next to her sister, \u201cwhat are you watching?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed. \u201cNothing really. I\u2019m just zoning out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa detected some sadness in Laura\u2019s voice and put her hand on her younger sibling\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to look at Vanessa. She was struck, as she often was, by just how incredible she looked: gorgeous blond hair, perfect face, large breasts, tight body, long legs. For a second Laura wanted to tell her sister that growing up in the shadow of such a perfect specimen had twisted her mind to the point that she thought she could create a winning boyfriend out of thin air and finally be happy, but she held her tongue. Instead she put on her best smile, the one she always used when hiding her depression about her appearance, and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m just having a lazy sort of day.\u201d Laura stood and pretended to yawn and stretch. \u201cTVs all yours, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura went to the kitchen to grab a snack but as soon as she entered she saw Greg downing a giant sized protein drink with his left hand while he casually curled a 50 pound dumbbell in his right. That was his \u201ceasy curler\u201d which he used throughout the day to keep his arms looking pumped at all times. That fact that he handled the weight so easily while Laura would struggle to heft it caused her to groan quietly. She turned and made her way into the downstairs bathroom to hide for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering over the sink Laura splashed a bit of water on her face then stared down into the basin while taking deep breaths. After a minute she looked up and spoke with disdain to her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with y-\u201c she stopped. Something was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura squinted, then rubbed her eyes. Her vision cleared and remained unchanged, but this couldn\u2019t be. Laura ran her fingers through her scalp and undid her ponytail; her hand confirmed what her eyes were telling her. Her hair looked and felt very different. It was much fuller with a rich shine and felt very soft to the touch. Even the color had gone from a dirty brown to a more chestnut hue with subtle highlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Laura noticed her face which looked slightly altered as well. She was still very much herself, but her complexion had cleared completely while her overall features had softened. For the first time in her life she could honestly say she saw a resemblance between herself and Vanessa. Laura smiled and was impressed by how good it looked on her face, she wasn\u2019t nearly as pretty as her sister, but she was a stunner of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hand to her face to make sure she wasn\u2019t just dreaming then noticed something else that was new. Her forearm, usually soft and round, was tight with a plump little muscle expanding from her slender wrist to her elbow. Laura gave her forearm a squeeze with the opposite hand and was surprised by how solid it felt, she then lifted her sleeve and saw that her upper arm shared the same development and definition. She flexed her bicep and, while the muscle that appeared was by no means big, she was way hard and shredded to bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flurry of excitement Laura whipped her shirt off and found her entire torso was just as hard with freaky definition. Her eyes lit up when she spotted not just six deeply chiseled abs but an entire row of obliques lining each side of her stomach. Laura ran her fingers over these bumps before turning her attention to her lower body. She lifted one leg of her shorts and flexed her thigh. Now she found some real size as her quads swelled outward in all directions with thick cords of sinew. Laura dug her toes into the floor and examined her calf muscle which looked rock solid with a deeply defined cleft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her shirt back on over her head and lamented the fact that she was so uninterested in her own body that she didn\u2019t notice her new features until just now. She assumed it was her messing with her new iPhone app that had lead to this enhanced physique and she had been too busy sitting on the couch sulking to notice the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I change anyway?\u201d she asked herself out loud. Before she could answer herself her phone chimed from it\u2019s place in her pocket (a sound bite of R2-D2 beeping which told her it was a text message from her best friend Jason).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishing the phone out Laura found that Jason was asking her if she was still interested in going to see The Goonies later at the Foley, a  tiny movie theater in the downtown shopping district that played a different classic or cult movie every two weeks. Laura recalled that  Goonies was opening tonight and jumped at the chance to show off her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe typed back: \u201cSure. Goonies never say die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later Jason\u2019s confirmation arrived: \u201cGreat, we\u2019ll be there in 20 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a quick second Laura wondered who \u201cwe\u201d was, but then turned her attention to getting ready. She bounded up the stairs to her room and fished through her clothes until she found a pair of tight denim cut off shorts and a striped crop top that left her midriff bare putting her spectacular abs on display. Laura then took a few minutes to apply a light coat of makeup, something she rarely felt the need to do, which took her face from stunning to out and out perfect. As she finished she gave her reflection a wink then pursed her supple lips in a quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door and Laura nearly leapt out of her own skin. She charged downstairs and opened the door, prepared to shock Jason with her new body but instead she was left speechless as though the wind had been knocked right out of her. It was Jason alright, but he was changed too. He was big, way big. For a moment she thought she was looking at Greg, but a quick glance up to the face showed her that it was her longtime friend atop that mountain of muscle. In fact Jason looked like he could be even bigger than Laura\u2019s buff brother. Jason wore a Metroid t-shirt with a sexualized version of Samus on it; the sleeves had been removed leaving his bulging 22 inch cannons exposed. Jason\u2019s shoulders were nearly as wide as the doorway and a quick glance down showed her legs that she was pretty sure were each bigger around than her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason entered not noticing that Laura was solid as a statue in shock and once he was inside Laura received an even bigger surprise: Jason was not alone. There was a very familiar looking and even bigger man standing right behind him with a huge grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, Laura,\u201d the giant said and Laura nearly melted where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh.. hi Steve.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura's mouth was dry. She'd already been in a state of disbelief over her own improved appearance but to now be face to face with a person she herself had created was enough to wreck her brain for a moment. Steve looked exactly like she expected, a 6' 6\" hunk bigger than any bodybuilder in the world. Her eyes were drawn instantly to his gigantic arms which were shredded with insane detail while spiderwebs of veins ran up his forearms and across the round swell of his biceps. Steve wore huge black shorts that were somehow big enough to be loose over his monster thighs (and Laura quietly moaned imagining the super sized cock that was hidden behind the thin fabric) and a white button up shirt that, like Jason's, had been de-sleeved. The buttons across his chest were pulled taut and were just barely holding the shirt together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve came through the door; Laura noticed that while Jason's shoulders nearly reached from jamb to jamb Steve actually did have to twist slightly to fit through the doorway. As Steve got closer Laura thought of the \"love interest\" setting she'd set and braced herself expecting her creation to wrap his gorgeous, bulging arms around her. Instead he passed right by leaving her holding the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't think too much of it until she followed them into the living room and heard Vanessa let out a loud, \"Hey baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura watched as her sister leapt into the air and wrapped her long legs around Steve's waist and her arms around his neck. The big man stood steady with his hands on his hips hardly noticing the additional 100+ pounds that had just landed on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you,\" Vanessa said nuzzling up to Steve's pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking to me or my muscles?\" Steve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked up and put a finger on Steve's lips. \"Sshhh! I'll get to you in a minute.\" Then she placed her head back on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve chuckled. \"How about you say hello to these.\" He raised both arms and struck a double biceps pose, each arm swelling to a mind bending 26 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YES!!\" Vanessa's hands instantly flew from around his neck to hanging from each arm. Her hands looked positively tiny atop the mountainous peaks. \"I love it when the gun show is in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura rolled her eyes. She was feeling a whole spectrum of emotions. While she was excited and turned on by the fact that she had created a perfect specimen of muscular development she felt the sting of jealousy that even someone she had made specifically for herself had somehow still ended up with Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you two,\" Jason said. He sounded almost as annoyed as Laura felt. \"We don't have time for you to grind on each other, the movie starts in 20 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve dropped his arms and shrugged. Then he began walking toward the front door with Vanessa still clinging to him giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at Laura and winked. \"I feel like I'm rock climbing except the mountain has decided to go for a walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome left the house and piled into an oversized SUV. Steve at the wheel with Vanessa by his side and Jason and Laura in the back. As they drove Laura stole occasional glances at Jason, taking in the changes to his form. She was sure of her previous thought, he was definitely bigger than her brother, by a fair amount too. At his best Greg tipped the scales at a little under 230 pounds while Laura guessed this new version of her best friend probably weighed 270, perhaps more. She began to wonder if perhaps a relationship with him was possible or maybe it was already in place and this was a double date. Jason made for a more than acceptable consolation prize.</span></div></div>",

Same height at 6'1\", same frizzy hair, same rimless glasses.  With her eyes walking down Jason's torso she saw the same fuzzy forearms.  Before, on flabby Jason it just looked off, but now?  Well, now Laura was kinda digging it.  \"Kinda wish I'd have played with Steve's body hair\" she mused.  A vision flashed of being held in those arms, nuzzling a stubbled cheek while curling her fingers in a long and winding treasure trail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*Ahem*</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura jolted from her thoughts with a stammered \"Buh!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I said you're... really looking great Laura.  That training with Greg is paying off!\" Jason gave a trademark dopey grin and chuckle, though at 270lbs of man-meat that dopey chuckle made Laura's seat bounce a little.  Her eyes shifted down to see Jason's pecs bounce too.  Holy shit they were big.  And a distorted Samus Aran bounced with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh.  Same Jason, same awful shirt.  He wore it damn near all the time, ever since some buddy got it for him at a Con a while back.  I guess that still happened in this alternate universe or whatever the app sent her. Not only was the art style ugly as sin, but whatever hack that drew it turned one the baddest raddest techno-amazon this side of a Virtual Boy and turned her into a rubber-spined anorexia patient.  Worst thing to happen to the poor girl since Other M...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve glanced back with a grin. \"Hey, maybe Laura can give you a few pointers in the gym, Tiny.  If you don't start pumping more steel and playing less Steel Battalion I'm going to leave you in the dust! -Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason punched Steve in the shoulder with a meaty thwack.  \"Hah, it's not like I've got a chance anyway.  You had a head start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, whatever lameo.  I catch up on my animes while weightlifting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the world's biggest nerd Steve\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're still the second biggest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth titans laughed.  Jason leaned back into his seat as the conversation turned to what animes everyone was watching.  Apparently Steve had even gotten Vanessa started on Full Metal Alchemist.  Laura was boggled, she remembered trying to talk her sister into doing, well, <i>anything</i> she liked for years.  And yet here she was, talking about how cute Alphonse is and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura managed to catch Jason looking her over too.  Holy crap this was a double date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a hand on Jason's colossal thigh.  Laura felt its warmth, felt the corded muscles underneath the skin.  Jason turned and looked at Laura, but was met with a knowing look and a smile.  Years of puppy love came back to Laura, everything wasn't what she had planned on, but the new reality seemed to be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But what if she could make it more perfect?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>These thoughts didn't last long though because when they were halfway to the theater Vanessa turned to Jason and asked, \"So, where's your lady tonight? Is she joining us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \"She just finished up her shift. She's getting changed and meeting us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's heart sank a little more. This new reality was better than her original one in a few ways and worse in others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa then smiled at Laura. \"We need to find you someone, Lulu. Maybe your own big hunk of man. It's only fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve chuckled. \"She could have had this hunk of man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a dick,\" Jason said. \"When Laura broke it off with you you were even more of a twig than I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Vanessa chimed in, \"she didn't know you and Jason were about to discover your formula. And it wouldn't have changed her decision anyway. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. Yeah, right.\" Laura's mind was racing to put these pieces together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve made eye contact with her in the rear view mirror. \"I'm sorry, Laura. That came off as mean and that's not what I meant. I'm super glad we're still friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Some of her hate for Steve began to slip. Apparently she had gotten what she asked for, the app had created a relationship between the two of them, unfortunately when adjusting their history they were now broken up. And there was some sort of formula, was that why Jason and Steve were so impossibly big? If so she wanted to know more about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later Steve parked at the theater and they all got out of the SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my stud!\" Laura turned to the source of the new voice and found a woman emerging from among the parked cars. She was clad in a white halter top and a black micro-mini skirt, and Laura's first thought was that she'd be wearing the same thing if her body looked like that. The girl had fiery red hair that framed her beautiful face in waves and emerald green eyes that glowed even in the darkening light of the evening. She was a bodybuilder and her top was molded onto a swollen physique. Her broad shoulders seemed to strain the spaghetti straps while the combination of thick pecs and full C cup breasts pushed the tight top to the breaking point. Her arms were pumped and Laura guessed she could flex up her arms to a good 17 inches or so. And she was tall with legs miles long; a trait that was further accentuated by the mini skirt and a pair of black high heels. Her legs glowed with a sheen that made Laura think they'd been oiled, or at least heavily moisturized. As she approached the rest of the group Laura couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of those incredible legs as with each step an earthquake of motion quivered through this gorgeous girls massive thighs with their shredded quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nikki!\" Vanessa called, but the statuesque redhead seemed not to notice and instead zeroed in on Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wrapped his big arms around her and they shared a quick kiss before the girl, Nikki, turned to the rest of the group, flashed a dazzling smile, and greeted them all warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all turned and approached the theater as a group. As they walked Nikki hung back slightly to talk to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great to see you, I feel like we haven't hung out in forever.\u201d The amazonian girl put a heavy arm around Laura\u2019s shoulders and pulled her close with surprising strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hardly even remember you.\" Laura intended her joke to come out clean to Nikki but realized it was dripping with accidental sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed, a genuine one thankfully, and said, \"I know, right? I just wanted to say that you look great. Your workouts are really showing, your body has changed so much. It\u2019s kind of fucked up that you ended up being the control group for Steve and Jason\u2019s formula but you\u2019re really making your time in the gym count. Your legs look especially awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed. Being surrounded by such muscle gods she had forgotten about her own enhanced physique. \"Oh...um...thank you. That means a lot, I mean you know great legs, don't you?\" Laura looked down nearly gasped, Nikki's pins were even more spectacular up close, so perfect, so shiny (definitely lightly oiled, Laura decided), so inviting that Laura had to actively keep herself from reaching out to touch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's smile sizzled. \"I like to think so.\" She sped up to join Jason and Laura watched mesmerized by the sway of Nikki's hips and the hard cleft of her calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the theater Laura sat with each musclebound man at her side, Steve to her left and Jason to her right. Both of them had lifted the retractable armrest so their immense bulk could spill onto an additional seat but also so they could snuggle with their respective ladies. Laura was wedged between them still unsure of how she felt about this new reality. Her friends still seemed really nice, she had an improved relationship with her sister, she got to hang out with the beautiful crowd, and she herself looked way better. Still her improved looks were overshadowed even more than previously and the man she had crafted specifically for herself had been stolen by Vanessa. To top it off her two best friends had access to some sort of muscle growth formula but wouldn\u2019t give her any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wanted to use the phone again but she didn't know what to do. It was like the tale of the monkey's paw, you could have whatever you wished for but there was always a catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh hell</i>, she thought to herself, <i>one misfired wish is no trend. Get over yourself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie wore on Laura became very aware that she was the only one of the group still watching it. Both Steve and Jason were moving in a way that suggested they were paying more attention to their girls then anything else. She turned to her right and peered around Jason's huge shoulder. He saw Nikki's long legs crossed towards Jason with Jason's hand sandwiched between her juicy thighs. Jason's other arm was around Nikki's shoulders holding her close while they shared a deep kiss. Nikki's hands had lifted the bottom of Jason's shirt up and were feeling around his rock hard abs and obliques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a quiet sigh then turned to her left. Her eyes went wide when she realized what she was looking at. Vanessa had pulled the waistband of Steve's shorts down over his crotch freeing his enormous penis which stood tall at its full 14 inch glory. Vanessa was feverishly attacking Steve's cock sucking at the top third while her hands pumped at the base of the shaft. Steve was doing his best to remain quiet but the strain of suppressing his moans led him to tense every muscle in his body. The moment Vanessa moved one hand to play with his balls it was too much to take; with a grunt Steve's chest flexed and the buttons of his shirt gave way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura couldn't take it anymore. Knowing her creation was with her sister was annoying but actually watching him get a blowjob in a theater was infuriating. She stood and shoved past Jason and Nikki and stormed out of the auditorium.</span></div></div>",

There was a small trash can icon at the bottom of the screen which she tapped. A red button with some warning text popped up and Laura was just about to tap that too when the door opened behind her and Nikki walked in. Laura locked her phone and pocketed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Nikki approached the sink next to Laura and began retouching her makeup, though she didn't need to and Laura guessed it was only a pretense anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura did her best not to show her emotions but knew she was failing. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned and looked Laura in the eye. \"I wanted to apologize, it was a bit rude of me to be making out with Jason right next to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wanted to cry. \"No, it's fine. A movie theater make out session is one thing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you sister and your ex are another.\" Nikki finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled warmly. \"You know, Steve is a great guy but he has one disastrous flaw. As nice as he is sometimes he can be completely inconsiderate and self absorbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too bad he doesn't have a twin brother who was just like him but more compassionate.\" Nikki gave Laura a quick hug then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed out loud. \"What a great idea.\" Even though they'd only just met and had hardly spoke Laura was really liked Nikki, and as much as erasing Steve sounded like a good idea it would mean severing that connection too. She didn't know who Nikki was in her own world but she and Jason seemed happy and it'd be a shame to ruin things for them. But there was another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her phone back out she canceled the deletion request. Next to the trash can icon was a button labeled \"copy.\" Tapping on that Laura was taken through a series of menus that allowed her to create a twin brother for Steve whom she named Bobby. Because they were identical twins and shared the same DNA Laura was a little more limited in how she could customize Bobby without also effecting Steve but found she was able to amp a number of his personality traits independently. She raised his kindness and empathy stats way up then increased his sensitivity a little as well. She also wanted to make sure not to let this one get away so she raised the relationship meter until it read \"true love.\" There was still more room on the relationship slider, but only a quarter or so remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see Vanessa steal this one.\" Laura laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to press \"Apply Changes\" when she realized there was something else that could be different about the twins. \"Perhaps Bobby is just more dedicated than his brother when it comes to working out.\" She moved the muscle slider up until Bobby had packed on an additional 60 pounds and outweighed his 360 pound brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if this becomes another monkey's paw wish I'll just delete both these assholes and try something else entirely.\" Laura said as she pushed another person into the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later things went dark and Laura passed out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura opened her eyes. The left side of her face was cold and she realized this was because she was lying on a tile floor. She attempted to stand but her body and brain started to protest. Realizing that she was still at the movie theater and on the bathroom floor, however, was enough to get her motivated. She closed her eyes and forced herself to stand feeling around for the counter to help support her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steadied herself with hands on either side of the sink then slowly opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" The words were out of her mouth before she even registered what she was seeing. Laura looked around to make sure she was still the only one in the bathroom then returned to her reflection. \"I'm big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow her body had changed and was now exploding with muscle. Earlier when she had first seen Jason's new body one of her first thoughts was that he had outgrown her bodybuilder brother; now she too was bigger than Greg. Perhaps she was bigger than Jason too, it was hard to tell since he was 6 feet tall and she was till just 5' 4\" but even if Jason carried more mass Laura's shorter stature made her look far more buff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now wearing a black cami dress that looked like it had been tailored specifically for her, it was snug around her chest which probably measured a good 40 to 45 inches around but also curved inward at her slender waist which was a mere 28 inches. The dress ended high on her thighs and showed off powerful quads which were each nearly as big around as her waist. Laura extended her right arm out to her side and ran her left hand from her forearm up to her bicep. The entire limb felt solid as rock, then when she bent her arm and flexed down her bicep exploded with crazy ropes of sinew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I wish I had a tape measure,\" Laura said looking at her monster bicep. \"I'd bet this thing is a good 23 inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flexed her other arm and it grew just as big and hard as the first. \"GGGRRR!! I FEEL SO STRONG!!\" She switched to a most muscular pose and watched with excitement as her shoulders, traps, arms and chest came to life and bubbled forth. A series of snaps and pops from her dress informed her that while the garment may have been made for her size it could still rip if she pushed it too far. \"Perhaps I've grown even bigger since this was made for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laura realized that she was feeling very horny. Somewhere in this world, hopefully waiting for her in the theater, was a monster of a man with an enormous cock and she wanted him and it now. She turned and left the bathroom and entered the theater once more. She spotted her friends sitting exactly where she had left them except now Vanessa and Nikki were together between Steve and Jason. To Jason's right was a gap of two seats then another person. Laura's heart leapt when she figured this must be her Bobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached him she could see that he was exactly what she had programmed, his face was an exact duplicate of Steve's but his body was even more engorged with muscle. His shoulders were wide enough that they nearly spanned the width of two seats and his traps nearly reached his ears. Laura rounded the aisle in which he sat and her eyes fell over even more of his immense body. He wore a muscle tank top that was open down the sides and even in the dark theater Laura could see the thousands of groves, bumps, and valleys that lined his side. His pecs stuck out in a shelf a full foot beyond his chin and his legs were so thick he had to spread them out to his sides as he sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laura could take her seat Bobby turned and saw her. He smiled brilliantly and stood up, and up. He was more than a full foot taller than Laura and her eyes roamed all over his torso. Then she realized the torso was bending down toward her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby put his lips to her ear and whispered. \"I already checked with the others and I was kind of hoping to get out of here. I want to take you somewhere, is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tried to speak but the words weren't coming. Instead she just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Bobby said and took Laura's hand. As they left together Laura noticed that Nikki and Vanessa were both smiling and waving their farewells. Something was different about them, but Laura didn't have enough time to figure out what before she was pulled back up the aisle and into the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the theater Bobby led Laura to an SUV that was fairly similar to the one she rode here in except this one was black. She spotted Steve's white one a few spaces down. Laura climbed into the passenger side while Bobby just managed to squeeze behind the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I've said it before,\" Bobby said with a chuckle, \"but pretty soon you're going to have to drive everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Laura said finally finding her confidence and voice, \"but what happens when I get to big to fit over there? Are you going to hire a chauffeur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby laughed. \"Maybe I will.\" Then he slid his hand around the side of her head and ran his fingers through her hair. \"I can hardly wait to see that, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed. \"So, where are we going, stud muffin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something I wanted to show you at...\"</span></div></div>",

I have heavily edited this entry and deleted a few of the pieces that followed. I hope you all understand.       -Nicole<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was intrigued to try out her new app even though it's claims seemed impossible. She wanted to try it out but was afraid to use it on herself until she could find out if it really did the things it claimed it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a test subject,\" she said. She tapped the \"Search\" button and saw that she could put someone's name in or use the camera to find a subject. This gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura went down the hall to her parents room. They had a large balcony that overlooked the beach which gave her a great view of plenty of lab rats to experiment on. She tapped on the camera feature and began scanning the scene. She found that any person that appeared on the screen had a red outline around their body and when she tapped on them she was shown a display of their name and physical stats. This alone was enough to get her excited since this app continued to do things that shouldn't be possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spotted her siblings off in the distance and zoomed in on them. Amazingly the app could zoom almost infinitely while maintaining perfect clarity. Even though Greg and Vanessa were near the waterline she could make them out completely on her phone. As usual Vanessa was sunning herself on her towel while several guys nearby stared at her incredible body. At the same time Greg was chatting with a few of his friends, each of whom were quite buff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura though that either of her siblings would make for good tests but she'd scan around a little more and see if there was anyone else interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the southern side of her house down the beach about a hundred yards there was a burger shack with some tables set up on a small patio. When Laura looked over these she saw a pair of familiar faces: her two best friends Jason and Samantha. They were chatting and smiling though neither of them appeared to be dressed for the beach. Jason wore baggy jeans and a loose fitting t-shirt while Samantha had on pink sweatpants and a matching jacket. Both of them must have been extremely hot and uncomfortable but they enjoyed being on the beach and hated showing off their bodies. Jason hid his figure because he was tall and skinny at over 6 feet tall yet hardly 150 pounds. Samantha hid for the opposite reason, her Japanese blood gave her a height of 4 foot 10 and yet she weighed a little more than Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura knew that Samantha had a huge crush on Jason, the girl had told her as much, but Jason, like many guys, was completely oblivious. Perhaps she could give them bodies to be proud of or even kick start a relationship between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura scanned further and her heart fluttered a bit when she happened upon Eric Rodgers sitting by himself on a bench near a bike path. Eric was a boy that Laura had been infatuated with for some years. He used to be close friends with her brother and would hang out at their house often. When Eric was in high school he was a runner and had an excellent physique. When Greg had taken up bodybuilding Eric instead discovered beer and while one friend grew stronger and more muscular the other softened and gained a gut. Laura still thought Eric was a bit of a hunk and though his body was no longer a sculpted masterpiece his face was still beyond handsome. Perhaps Eric would appreciate Laura returning his fit form to him with some extra size as interest. Heck, maybe she could even use the app to make Eric feel for her the way she felt for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith muscles on her mind Laura turned northward where, a quarter mile up the sand, there was an outdoor gym right on the beach where only the biggest and strongest bodybuilders hung out. Even Greg, large as he was, didn't have the size to hang with the others there. Laura zoomed in and was not disappointed by the collection of muscle gods and buff bunnies she spied. Her nipples hardened at the mere sight of these guys and girls pumping iron. There was one guy in particular that caught Laura's eye. He was clad in nothing but a skimpy red speedo and was chatting with a pair of busty bikini babes who stood just outside the fence that surrounded the gym. When Laura tapped on the bodybuilder on her phone's screen she given all of his vital stats. His name was Daniel Waters and though, at 5 feet 4 inches tall he was a bit shorter in stature than many of his beefy brethren, he still managed to outweigh many of them with his 265 pound frame. As he chatted the girls up he was casually curling a very large dumbbell in one arm, switching hands after a handful of reps. The readouts on Laura's small screen told her that the dumbbell weighed 100 pounds and that Dan's arm was pumped up to 23.26 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura watched Dan flirt with the two girls (which Laura also looked up: a tall redhead with amazing muscular legs named Nicole and a shorter blonde hardbody named Sara) she was overcome with the desire to make the big man grow even bigger right before their eyes. Then another possibility occurred to her that also sounded fun: make the girls outgrow Dan. Laura giggled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. So many test subjects but only one to pick. Who would be the big winner?</span></div></div>",

Let's see how he deals with being weak like me for a change.\" Laura's expression faltered as she felt a slight pang of guilt. \"Just for a little while. Maybe then he'll appreciate what he has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelecting Greg's profile and navigating to his muscle mass sliders she reduced his size until he was a 6' 2\" waif. She was astounded at how the 3D model looked, it was Greg alright but like she'd never seen him before. It was as if a feather could knock him over, and not a particularly stiff feather either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could chicken out Laura hit the \"Apply\" button at the top of the screen. The 3D image of Greg vanished for a moment while the word \"Processing\" appeared then skinny Greg returned but this time his swimsuit had been replaced with denim pants and a Star Wars t-shirt. Just as the question began to form in her mind about why that would happen there was a bright flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura caught her breath as her eyes came back into focus. Once she could see properly again she quickly looked out to the beach to see if the app had worked and shrunk Greg down. She quickly identified the gaggle of hardbodies and bodybuilders that was his crew but couldn't find Greg among them. Even using the zoom feature on the app it was clear that Greg just wasn't there. Not only that but no one seemed concerned that the big man had just vanished. She was just about to see if she could use the app to search for her brother's whereabouts when there was a knock at her bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to find a 6' 2\" waif with Greg's face wearing denim pants and a Star Wars t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lulu.\" Greg said. His voice was higher pitched and almost whiny. \"Jason's coming over and we're going to go to the comic shop. Did you want to join?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure.\" Questions were buzzing in her head but being a smart girl Laura had the answers or at least the gist of them: the app altered the past. Part of her was bummed out since Greg wouldn't feel the loss of his huge body and thus understand how precious a gift his physique was but another voice spoke louder in Larua's mind:<i> This means I can change anything and it won't be strange to anyone. I can go as crazy as I want!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll let you know when he gets here.\" Greg vanished leaving Laura alone with her magical phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her wanted to be cautious while another part was ready to leave the life she was given behind and become everything she had ever dreamed of. The possibilities were endless.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Laura stared at the phone, contemplating the possibilities, she decided to walk around for a moment to check out the changes that had taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving into the hallway near the balcony railing above the family room Laura turned toward the wall and stared at a life size picture of her sister, Vanessa.  But not the Vanessa she had known, but a full blown goddess of pure muscle!  Laura\u2019s jaw dropped as stared at the picture, not knowing where to look first!  Vanessa was standing with one massive, shredded leg pushed outward, her dainty toes pressing into the ground with her small feet, bulging her calf the size of a cantaloupe and tensing her thighs into insanely large and separated quads.  As her gaze moved upward Laura zoned into the small white bikini bottom hugging hips slightly pushed to one side, as her tight 8 pack abs were flexed harshly on her narrow waist.  Muscles Laura didn\u2019t even know existed riddled the sides of Vanessa\u2019s abs and curved out dramatically to a wider than wide back.  Laura gulped as her eyes moved up and got stuck on massive pectorals tensed into magnificent slabs of rippling feminine wonder easily four inches thick, barely covered by a white sequined bikini top molded over her breasts, that while smaller due to the dieted condition, were still prominent, and appeared natural.  As Laura\u2019s breath quickened she took a step back to take in the double bicep pose that rocked Vanessa\u2019s upper body.  Large, striated shoulders roared out to the biggest, hardest biceps Laura had ever seen on a woman.  They were larger than what Greg used to have and appeared to be cut from granite.  The base of each muscle was large and prominent, the splits were deep and clear and her peaks pushed up to the sky.  Laura had often seen biceps of bodybuilders and pictures of some of the best due to Greg\u2019s obsession.  But she had never seen biceps this perfect or this large.  Her massive muscles had to be 24 inches around!  Even the thick veins that snaked around the massive mounds of muscle appeared to be placed there by a biology master.  Vanessa\u2019s forearms were thick and veiny as well and curved to her narrow wrists and slender fingers balled into fists.  As Laura sighed, releasing a breath she was holding she shook her head as she stared into Vanessa\u2019s bright baby blue eyes surrounded by long lashes.  Her long blonde hair was dressed incredibly and her smile was bright.  Vanessa appeared as beautiful, if not even more beautiful, than Laura could ever remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally backing away she looked over at the large trophy next to Vanessa and the caption at the bottom.  Ms. Olympia winner Vanessa Freemen.  Laura wondered, how long ago was this picture taken?  Pulling up her phone to check, Greg came out of his room, looked over at the masterpiece on the wall and sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGad, I still can\u2019t believe she put that picture right in the hallway so we have to walk by it every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up at Greg, deciding it was best to agree for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?  Oh, yeah, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg cocked his head to one side.  \u201cYou were the one speculating about putting a mustache on her.  You usually violently agree with my assessment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blinked her eyes, realizing there was a LOT she didn\u2019t know about the changes she created just by changing Greg.  But now she needed to know more about Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, well I was distracted.  Besides, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to let us move it, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shook his head.  \u201cWell yeah, since Mom and Dad moved out, she is the money maker.  She lets us live here so we can go to the local college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded; mentally glad that she hadn\u2019t said anything that would put her in a bad situation.  Clearing her throat and trying to sound nonchalant, Laura looked back at the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh, where is Vanessa now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled.  \u201cDown at the beach of course, likely holding court.  With her being in the off season, her cuts are down a bit, but her strength has grown to new levels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s heart raced and she gulped.  \u201cOh yeah, what was I thinking.  So just how strong is she now?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shook his head.  \u201cWell not that we all don\u2019t obsess about it, but last I checked she\u2019s benching over 700 pounds.  I think she\u2019s added another inch to her pecs.  The woman is a machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s jaw dropped open.  700 pounds?  That would have to make her the strongest woman on earth!  At least she thought so.  Desperately wanting to head back to her room to find Vanessa in the crowd on the beach, but wanting to maintain whatever current relationships she had with Greg and Jason, Laura bit her lip, once again staring at the massive mountain of female muscle on her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe sure is.  Hard to believe anyone is that strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded, staring at the picture and sighing.  Laura had to wonder how jealous he had to be.  So knowing that Jason was coming over, but needing to find Vanessa, Laura put her gaze back on Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve got a few things to do before Jason gets here.  Let me know when he arrives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded as Laura walked back toward her room and casually shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura quickly went to the balcony off her room and stared down at the beach.  How could she have missed Vanessa initially?  This time she now quickly found her.  Even from a distance it was clear she was larger than any other woman and was on par or even surpassing the men. Laura sighed with renewed jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s incredible!  Who would have thought that by reducing Greg I would amp up Vanessa to this level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her binoculars, Laura saw that Vanessa was in a bright pink bikini, only slightly more modest than the contest bikini she had on in the hallway picture.  And Greg was right, she was even larger now!  And the hardness and detail of her muscles barely looked reduced.  Laura decided she wanted a close up view of Vanessa and to have a chance to talk.  What was their relationship now?  If Greg indicated she wanted to put a mustache on Vanessa\u2019s picture, was she distant and jealous?  Did Vanessa treat Greg and her poorly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo without much more thought, Laura came out of her room and headed down the stairs to find Greg on couch working his phone.  Laura bound toward the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Greg, I\u2019m heading to the beach for a minute to talk to Vanessa.  Don\u2019t leave without me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg barely looked up from his phone and mumbled.  \u201cOK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura moved toward the beach and her amped up sister, her body tingled and her breath quickened with nervous energy.  She had always been intimidated by Greg\u2019s friends with their big, strong bodies and they generally had treated her like a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached the group of bodybuilders, a few men saw her coming and they apparently recognized her.  Instead of smiling with condescending looks they went stone faced and moved out her path toward Vanessa.  Laura narrowed her eyes with wonder as to why they didn\u2019t want to engage her, but that was fine to her.  She closed in on Vanessa and caught a conversation between her and a beautiful red haired girl with a gorgeous fitness level body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Vanessa, just how big are your arms now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled, knowing that others around them heard the question.  Apparently relishing in the attention, Vanessa pulled up her right arm, staring at the massive limb with appreciation, and casually flexed her biceps into a thick, ripped mound of glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I would guess around 25 inches.  Maybe a bit more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was now staring at her incredible flex.  Vanessa turned to smile at the red head, whose jaw had opened slightly, but then she noticed Laura and she released her flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Lulu, what brings you out to the beach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura noticed the crowd move back, giving them some space, which once again caused Laura to wonder if something had happened previously that would have everyone react that way.  Smiling weakly and looking up into Vanessa\u2019s sparkling blue eyes, Laura sighed and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to let you know that Greg and I are heading to the comic book shop with Jason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled and pushed a few strands of her silky blonde hair off her shoulder and thick pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou came all the way out here to tell me that directly?  You could have just texted me.  What do you really want?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura bit her lip.  Vanessa\u2019s stance and reaction wasn\u2019t cruel or condescending.  That was nice to know.  So she decided to see just how close they might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was wondering if you were going to work out later.  Greg indicated you were reaching some new records.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled brightly and laughed softly.  \u201cYou want to update my website with some new stats?  I am so glad you and Greg are running the IT stuff for me.\u201d  Vanessa paused as Laura let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa placed her hands on her narrow, but devastatingly muscular waist and cocked out one hip, pushing her massive pectorals up and out, tensing her chest and pumping those thick pectorals up and down a few times, causing Laura\u2019s eyes to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was planning on lifting at the outdoor gym up the beach in a few hours.  Let me know when you guys are back from the comic book store.  But don\u2019t be late, they close the gym at night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, happy and anxious.  \u201cNo worries, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be back in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded, the sun behind her gorgeous, Greek Goddess shaming figure.  Laura gulped as she squinted against the rays and her heart beat at the incredible sight, then nodded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, see you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way back home Laura wondered, should she pull up the Ap and make some changes or explore this new world?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura looked through her pictures and found a recent one of her sister Vanessa in a similar outfit that she was currently sporting.  Loading the picture into the ap, a small delay resulted and soon a 3D image of Vanessa was on display.  Only it was Vanessa as she was currently dressed.  The sunglasses, the purple bikini and even her white sarong were now clearly seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head at the strange events, Laura began to think how she could change her sister.  Perhaps shrink her chest down or make her shorter.  An evil smile crossed her face momentarily, but she soon dropped it back down.  Vanessa wasn\u2019t really mean to her, so that kind of revenge was perhaps a bit too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrolling through the options, she did move back to muscle size and staring intently, slid the muscle size up.  Soon Vanessa\u2019s 3D model was expanding with well placed muscles across her frame as if the ap knew just how to place the muscles to keep a feminine look.  The interesting thing was that as she moved it up a bit higher, the bikini top actually fell away, exposing the same DD breasts, only they seemed closer proportioned with her muscular upper body.  Stranger and stranger thought Laura.  Panning to another drop down, she saw strength.  Wondering how that would affect the model, Laura slid that up and noticed that Vanessa\u2019s muscles looked harder and more defined as she moved it up.  Staring at the model, she didn\u2019t notice the numbers flash up as she moved it upward, 10 flashed and disappeared, then 100, then 1000.  Laura hummed as she saw Vanessa\u2019s breasts rise higher and looked incredibly firm, as if gravity was no longer affecting them.  Moving back to the muscle menu she saw a few other options, including expansion.  Not sure what that meant exactly, she selected it and it started at 1 or normal.  Another bar came up and she slid it to the right, but the model didn\u2019t appear to change at all this time.  Once again numbers flashed on the bottom, but Laura was only staring at the image, looking for a change.  Sighing, Vanessa looked out her window and saw that Vanessa was close to Greg and some of his bodybuilding friends.  She knew Vanessa felt intimidated by the large men, even if she was a 5 foot 10 inch drop dead gorgeous woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Laura looked back at the phone and saw an Apply button flash, she nodded her head.  Perhaps giving Vanessa great muscles and strength would make her feel more comfortable.  Glancing at the model with a bit of her own added jealousy she figured that it worked for Vanessa then she could always try it on herself next.  So without realizing what the strength or muscle expansion settings were set at, Laura hit the apply button and a low hum came from the phone.  A large bar appeared and slowly filled up.  After 15 seconds, the bar was complete and the phone dinged.  A message came up.  Alterations set, applying now.  Laura looked out the window and watched with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa had set up a towel on the busy beech at a familiar spot not far from their house and had removed her sarong, working some low level sun block onto her skin when two of Greg\u2019s large friends came up.  Greg nudged her to stand up and talk to them, even though she would have preferred to stay on the towel.  Greg liked to show her off a bit, which she didn\u2019t mind per se, but she always felt out of place when three very large men started talking about work-outs and best lifts and all.  As she pushed her bare toes into the sand and smiled absently, a strange sensation came over her.  She felt warmth fill her body, followed by a tingling from the tip of her toes to the top of her beautiful blonde head.  She felt energized, like she had just finished a triple espresso.  And not only that, but she felt\u2026  Stronger?  It was a hard feeling to pinpoint, but it as if she could feel power well within her and that she somehow now knew that she truly was changing.  As she stood upright to accept her growing strength, she also felt that her top was feeling tighter and as she pulled her arms up to adjust the top, she noticed that her arms looked different.  It was if they were swelling with.. Muscle?  And she now knew that she wasn\u2019t just growing stronger, but her muscles were expanding as well.  The ap had delivered the knowledge of what had happened.  Vanessa didn\u2019t know how, but she now knew what.  She WAS going to grow stronger, much, much stronger than the three large men in front of her.  And she was going to grow muscles to put them to shame, with an added bonus.  Those same large muscles when flexed hard would be able to expand to preposterous proportions.  Vanessa smiled and she cleared her throat to pull the attention of Greg and his buddies to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you boys think your muscles are big and you\u2019re all pretty strong, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked upset that Vanessa would interrupt them, especially with a strange comment like that.  But as the three annoyed men, each one over 6 feet tall and at least 225 pounds looked at Vanessa, they\u2019re expression soon turned to surprise and Vanessa held her hands on her sides and shifted her weight onto one hip, tensing her legs, and tightening her abs.  Both acts would have normally pulled in her slender, but tight muscles.  But now that simple act caused the muscles to bunch and surge across her lower body in waves of expanding female beef and her abs to bristle with a clearly defined six pack and beyond.  Tensing her upper body, her back and shoulders both pressed up and out.  Pushing out her magnificent breasts, the surging pectorals served to display those breasts even more prominently as they rose and nearly spilled out of her top.  Snickering, Vanessa brought her arms up lazily and leaning forward slightly, gently tensed her fists into a double bicep pose, sending torrents of muscles racing to her arms.  The once slim, yet well sized arms bulged with fitness sized muscles immediately and then raced on to high end female bodybuilder size with her first gentle tense.  Her biceps now bulged up at 17 inches around each and were steadily growing on their own accord without another tense from Vanessa.  In fact all of her muscles continued their steady growth toward eclipsing all other female bodybuilders.  At 5 foot 10 she would be taller than most as well and her height allowed her to only look up slightly at the stunned men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter boys, never seen a girl flex up HER muscles before?  After all, we girls can be just as big and strong as any man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling sexily, Vanessa pulled in a strong inhale that snapped her bikini top off, pushing her muscular torso further ahead and exposing fully her DD breasts that sagged only momentarily before gently rising back up as they grew denser and her pectorals expanded out to 6 inches thick.  The six pack abs spread out to an 8, then a 10 pack surrounded by newly forming ab muscles and rippling obliques.  Her legs were now as big as any of the men staring at her and were steadily growing bigger.  But not just bigger, but better shaped, harder, denser and more detailed.  Her calves flared out dramatically into twin balls of distended pulsing muscle over 20 inches around.  Her thighs continued to bull their way forward as they surged up over a foot wide and nine inches thick.  Her skin wrapped around her throbbing muscles tightly.  Strength multiplied by strength was also pounding in her body beyond a hundred Gregs!  Giggling as she held her bicep pose, the muscles continued to push up and were soon a solid 24 inches around each!  Her body was now a symphony of female muscle power.  As big and as muscular as any man on earth, but with achingly female curves, topped off with the same DD breasts, her natural long blonde hair and supermodel quality face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr better yet, we girls can grow more muscular and much stronger than any man!  Can anyone here match my biceps for example?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and his friends looked at their large arms and each one brought their own arm as if they didn\u2019t know how big they were.  Vanessa laughed and pulled down one arm and placed it on her hip as she reached the size and strength level that Laura had programmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked on and chuckled back in her room.  Greg and his friends looked dumbfounded.  The ap worked!  A chime indicated that the application had completed and it caused Laura to look at the phone.  When she looked down at the flashing screen she also noticed that the stats for Vanessa were also now on display.  Vanessa matched the size she had programmed, but now Laura noticed the strength and muscle expansion numbers and her eyes widened.  Vanessa wasn\u2019t just stronger than Greg, she was as strong as 5000 men!  And the muscle expansion number still didn\u2019t make sense to her, but as she looked back out the window, she realized what it meant.  Vanessa was literally glowing with confidence and power.  She was already more muscular than Greg or his friends and they were all stunned beyond words.  Vanessa was thoroughly enjoying this change in positions.  She was now the strong, powerful, cocky one and the three men were the uncomfortable, intimidated one.  But she also knew that she was just brushing her abilities.  She had yet to demonstrate her strength or her flexing ability.  So with the men still trying to take her nearly naked, super buffed form, Vanessa chuckled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo while you boys looks like you can appreciate the new me, I\u2019ve only just begun to show you what I\u2019m capable of.  I think it\u2019s time to show you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So boys, what do you think?\" Vanessa asked squeezing her DD cup breasts which now sat atop thick slabs of pectoral muscle. She flexed her chest and made her boobs jiggle while she slid her hands down to her sculpted abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this even possible?\" Stan, one of Greg's friends and the largest of the trio, asked. He looked at Greg, \"I mean you said your sister was a pretty nice little hardbody, but this in insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, man,\" Greg said. His eyes were locked on his sister who was now the most muscular person he'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hardbody am I?\" Vanessa asked. \"A hardbody? Oh please, hard doesn't begin to describe me. Diamonds look to me for inspiration. Here, feel.\" Vanessa held her arm up and flexed it. Her 24 inch biceps swelled before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan looked to Greg then David, the third friend, as if looking for advice. Both men just shrugged, so Stan held out a trembling hand and gripped the towering peak of Vanessa's bicep. \"Oh my god,\" he said as he squeezed her bulging muscle. \"You're hard as a rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harder,\" Vanessa said, \"In fact their so solid because I have more muscle packed inside my muscles. Watch this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa tightened her fist and flexed with all her might; her face contorted from the effort she was putting forth. Then, amazingly, her swollen bicep began to inflate. She then straightened her arm and flexed then curled her arm back in. The split peak of her ripped muscle exploded upward higher than before. She continued to move her forearm out a few inches then back in squeezing more and more size from her already massive arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan, for his part, was still holding on tight to the ever growing muscle that Vanessa was somehow making bigger right beneath his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the sand Laura could see Vanessa working her arms to unheard of girth and suddenly understood what the \"muscle expansion\" setting was all about. She looked at the phone and saw she had dialed Vanessa's expansion to 1.6x. She had only moved the slider a little since she hadn't seen any changes and given up, but she thought she just might use a much higher expansion setting on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you boys like me now?\" Vanessa asked now sporting a 38 and a half inch arm. \"I'll bet you didn't know girls could get muscles like these, did you? I can pump my whole body up to match this size if I want.\" She caressed the bowling ball sized bicep with her free hand. \"And it's not just about size, I'm sooooo strong. Watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Vanessa walked over to a nearby trashcan which was really just a steel drum with the top removed. She picked it up and began crushing it between her hands, the steel squealed with resistance but she moved as of she were folding paper. Vanessa compressed the metal drum into a misshapen mass roughly the size of a melon. She tossed this steel ball to Stan to prove to him that she wasn't playing any tricks. It landed at his feet with a dull thud.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Stan said struggling with the weight of the ball. With effort he passed it to David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the three guys stared at Vanessa's muscular form and contemplated her amazing strength she gathered her things.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, bye boys,\" she said. \"I'm going to go find some new clothes and head out for a night on the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Greg began. He has so many questions but before his brain could even form them he was watching his younger, larger sister walk away, her tree trunk thighs pumping and her giant calves flexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" Stan said to no one in particular, \"what the fuck just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was making her way back to her house but Laura took no notice. Now that she had verification that the app worked she was in her room designing a new body for herself. Laura furiously made adjustments to her own body, she enhanced her breasts, muscles, height, strength, expansion ability, facial structure, hair, anything she could think of. She was turning herself into a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finished her alterations and tapped the \"apply\" button. She watched with great anticipation as the status appeared then filled. Once done the same message she'd seen earlier greeted her: \"Alterations set. Applying now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt a surge of power blast through her body. Then she heard the creaking of her denim pants as her legs lengthened and he height crept higher. A smile spread across her lips, this was going to be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs Vanessa was entering the living room in a blissful haze. She was about to go upstairs to her room when she paused in front of a full sized mirror in the hall. She took a moment to examine her new, massive muscles. This was her first chance to see her legs since growing because of her enlarged chest, and she had to admit they looked amazing. She stuck one leg forward and flexed her quads, watching as they hardened into plates that expanded her leg out to 35 inches around. Then she tightened even more and activated her expansion ability and her thigh slowly beefed up and grew in all directions. By the time it was done expanding her leg measured 56 inches around. And was bigger around than Greg's chest. She dug her toes into the floor and pushed her calf muscle from a very large 21 inches to a mind blowing 33 and a half inches. Vanessa released her flex when she realized the floorboards under her foot were cracking and breaking from the pressure she was exerting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Vanessa heard a voice upstairs scream out. For a moment she was panicked, but then she recognized the sounds of a young woman in the throughs of ecstasy. Laura must have decided that since she was all alone she could play around with herself. Vanessa decided to give her little sister a shock and snuck upstairs towards Laura's room with a stealthiness that should have been impossible for someone of her mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she threw open Laura's door Vanessa heard what sounded like ripping clothes then a \"ding\" sound like a cell phone text message alter. Ignoring these sounds she pushed Laura's door open and shouted: \"Hi little sis- oh!! You too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa discovered she wasn't the only one with a new body for Laura was now a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow, Lulu!! You look, well, incredible. I hardly recognize you. That is you, right?\" Vanessa had completely forgotten about her amazing new body as she examined the changes her younger sister had now gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at the girl she'd been envious of for years and smiled. No longer did she hide in the shadows of her busty sibling, now she would be the one to turn heads wherever she went. \"Oh it's me alright.\" the new and improved Laura said. Even her voice had taken on a slightly deeper and much more sultry tone. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked her sister up and down. Laura's height had increased by more than half a foot, and it seemed that her legs had reaped the benefits of her additional height the most. They were long and packed with curvy muscle. Slim ankles curved into plump calves then back into tight knees before swelling back out to strong, succulent thighs. Her muscle tone was obvious but she also carried enough fat to keep her curves soft and round instead of sculpted. Laura's pants lay in rags on the floor and her lower body was clad only in pink panties that were taut across her expanded and very round yet very firm behind. Laura's hips were wide while her waist was surprisingly slender and her abdominal muscles were outlined across her tummy. The trimness of Laura's middle was exaggerated by the outrageous bustline just north of it. Each breast had swollen dramatically and were now each the size of a small watermelon. Vanessa didn't know what size bra would be required to contain such magnificent mammaries but they made her former DD sized boobs seem downright tiny. Laura's shirt was still on, but holes has formed along her sides and under her arms from the strain of her growth. Laura's shoulders were more broad and helped keep her giant breasts from looking completely out of place. Vanessa also noticed that Laura's arms were toned and shapely.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's face had changed into a symphony of sexiness. Her lips were full and red (though she wore no lipstick), her cheekbones were rounded, and her eyes were a piercing blue. Finally her hair had changed from a dirty brown to a rich chestnut color with a few darker streaks. Her luscious mane had thickened and fell wavy over her shoulders and to the middle of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty neat, huh?\" Laura slid her hands down the hourglass shaped curve of her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" Vanessa agreed then raised a massive arm and flexed her unexpanded but still very impressive 24 inch bicep. \"Look at me. I never really thought I would enjoy being this buff, but I feel so sexy and so strong. I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura remained silent but her smile gave her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how this happened, don't you?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded and held up her iPhone. \"I did it. With this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. I found this app that can.... well, change things, people really. I really didn't expect it to work, but I could see you growing from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's eyes were locked onto the phone. \"Can I see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned and put her phone on the desk behind her. \"I don't think so. It's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took a step forward. \"Look, I really don't want to be a bully here but I've got you outclassed in almost every way. And I'm much, much stronger than I look. You can't even imagine my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed which stopped Vanessa in her tracks. \"Did you forget already, muscles for brains? Of course I know how strong you are. I made you this way. And yeah, you're superhuman. You have the strength of 5,000 men. Not only that but you can expand your muscles by 60%, which doesn't make you any stronger but it sure looks intimidating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa tingled with excitement. 5,000 men? Was she really that strong? She could probably bench press locomotives! \"So you know that I could just take your phone if you won't give it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head. \"You still don't get it, do you?\" Laura put her hands on her hips and tensed her body. Instantly her muscles surged outward in all directions. Right away her shirt, already under considerable strain from her breasts, gave way and fell to the floor alongside the remains of her pants. Laura's shoulders were getting both wider and thicker while her chest crashed forward like an avalanche. At the same time Laura's arms, neck, legs, lats and every other muscle group grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds after her shirt tore apart Laura's panties followed suit, ripped apart by her massive glutes. She was now stark naked and still expanding. Moments later she was equal in size to Vanessa, then she eclipsed her older sister. And still she grew; she was now well beyond the realm of human possibilities and into sizes only ever depicted in comic books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Laura stopped growing and stood before her musclebound sister as a hulking goddess. Laura's shoulders were nearly 5 feet wide and as looked like the tops of football helmets under her skin. Her pectorals were three feet of steel-belted sinew atop which sat her enhanced breasts which now, amazingly, looked small. Laura raised her arms and flexed insane 80 inch guns that defied logic in their physiology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really think I'd just let you have all the power?\" Laura asked Vanessa in a booming voice. \"You may be as strong as 5,000 men, but I'm as strong as a hundred of you. Now, if you'd be so kind as to bow before your queen and kiss my feet I just might be willing to forget all about your feeble attempt to steal from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa quickly dropped to her knees and groveled at the feet of her enormous sibling. It was not lost of her that the calf muscles just above her were nearly triple the size of her head. She kissed Laura's feet and pleaded with her to forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Laura said in a much lighter tone of voice. \"That's enough, stand up.\" As Vanessa got back to her feet Laura relaxed her body and allowed it to return to the super busty beauty she'd been minutes earlier. \"Now, let's go find us some clothes and have some fun!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura jumped as Vanessa entered the room, her nearly naked 6 foot 6 body having grown up from her previous 5 foot 4 inch height.  She had decided to go straight to a tall, muscular and sexy; her thoughts drifting to her comic book hero, She Hulk.  Laura had added enough muscle to outmatch her brother, but still wanted to start out slow, as she was unsure of how everything had worked out for her sister.  Pulling her ruined top off, she blushed as she stood there topless, her large breasts jiggled across her powerful pectorals.  The jeans had split and torn, but were still clinging to her inflated and lengthened legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked up and grinned.  \u201cMind telling me what is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled nervously, barely taking in her growth and realizing that in fact she had made herself taller than her siblings, with muscles nearly as big as Vanessa.  Her muscles were large, feminine and curved around her body sexily.  Laura glanced at the phone, contemplating not telling her sister everything, but with a sigh figured the truth would be as easy to take then some lame lie she didn\u2019t have time to put together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s a new ap that showed up my phone.  It allows you to alter people.  For real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled, raising up her right up and flexing her 24 inch bicep and with a small grunt, causing it to rise even higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say.  And was I the first one you tried the ap out on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed again.  \u201cWell, uh, yeah.  Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggled.  \u201cDon\u2019t be!  The muscles, the strength, this incredible expansion super power is erotic.  Did you see the faces on those muscle guys out there?  I thought Greg was going to pee in his gym trunks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \u201cYeah!  You seemed completely in tune with everything.  How is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa glanced back at the phone.  \u201cI don\u2019t know.  I just\u2026  Did. It was as if once you worked the ap, which you need to show me by the way, that I just knew what I was capable of.  Did you realize how strong you made me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \u201cNo, not really.  I didn\u2019t know about the expansion ability either until after I hit apply.  Are you really 5 THOUSAND times stronger?  That would make you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled confidently.  \u201cFucking Supergirl, bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed at the completely out of character statement.  As they both composed themselves Laura looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then.  What now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at Laura and smiled.  \u201cWell first thing we need to do is check out the ap.  Then we need to go shopping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled.  This was the longest, most personal conversation they\u2019ve had in years.  And Laura loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled up the ap and showed her how it worked and they fiddled with their images.  Vanessa saw that Laura had made herself ten times stronger, so she was nearly twice as strong as Greg.  Vanessa let out a lustful breath when she saw she could move her strength even higher, grow even more muscular and have even greater muscle expansion.  Vanessa moved all the sliders to show what that would do and pouted a bit when only the larger muscles showed any change on the 3-D model.  Vanessa saved the changes, but decided not to hit the apply button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggled and talked as they struggled to find clothes large enough for either of them to leave the house.  Heading to the clothing store both girls got plenty of attention and the women helping them were shaking with fear, surprise and a bit of jealousy.  Everyone was complimenting both girls on their looks and incredibly toned body.  As they were driving home, deciding on what club to go to that evening, Vanessa pulled her own phone out of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should see about downloading the ap myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was driving and simply nodded as Vanessa worked her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is.  I\u2019m downloading it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments it was on the phone and when Vanessa opened it up it put out a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNote:  This ap has been modified from the original and is now for display purposes only.  The original Alterations ap had a major flaw that if activated was found to be dangerous.  If you know of anyone with the original Alternations ap, please ask them to delete it immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tone from Laura\u2019s phone let her know that she had received a message and with both girls now concerned, Laura pulled into a parking lot of an auto body shop and pulled up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a message giving me the same warning and telling me that to delete the ap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa licked her lips.  \u201cI wonder if people had gone nuts with the ap.  I\u2019m going to Google it to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed when another warning popped up on her phone.  \u201cThe Alterations ap will lock into the last profiles set, make the changes and alter history to adjust.  Once completed, the ap will be deleted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa was searching, Laura yelped, causing Vanessa to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nearly yelled.  \u201cThe ap is going to be deleted!  But not before it adjusts for changes and alters history!  How can that be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her head.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, but from what I could quickly see on the web, there were only a few mentions of surprising muscle growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa then paused as her entire body tingled and she shivered.  \u201cWait, did you go back into the ap and hit apply for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head, now even more concerned.  Her eyes quickly widened.  \u201cWait!  The ap said it would apply the last changes saved before changing history and shutting down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa moaned as her body began to pulse and she opened up the door of the SUV and put her feet on the ground.  Laura gulped, knowing she wouldn\u2019t have time to see what Vanessa had done.  So without thinking further, Laura tried to turn off the phone and when it wouldn\u2019t shut down, pulled the battery.  By this time Vanessa had taken a few steps away from the car.  Laura jumped out to see what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at Vanessa it was apparent that\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Loosing the income his father provided his mom couldn't afford to by clothes for him. For the first four years of his life he was dressed as a girl in his older sisters' hand-me-downs. Imagine looking at your baby pictures and seeing that. Then, he had to endure growing up with all that estrogen and his mother talking about how horrible men are.

The settings seemed too amazing and outlandish to be believed.  The app apparently could change intangible things in addition to physical ones.  There were settings for almost everything, including emotional states, likes and dislikes, intelligence and more.  As she searched through the options and settings Laura noticed one for \"implementation\" which was currently set to \"real time.\"  She thoughtfully opened the drop down and selected \"historic\" then began modifying her sister with a less vengeful result in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began picturing what life would have been like if she and Vanessa had shared similar interests.  Would they be closer?  Maybe even real friends with each other?  Laura began going through Vanessa's likes and dislikes, swapping out things like \"cheer-leading,\" \"swimming,\" and \"sun bathing\" for \"comics,\" anime,' and \"video games.\"  She also began taking out hobbies and activities like jogging, exercising or anything else that Vanessa may be doing to keep in shape, the imaginary sister/best friend Laura was imagining would be a couch potato.  And it certainly wouldn't hurt Laura's self esteem if her sister maybe was pudgier than she was.  She grinned mischievously as she nudged down Vanessa's metabolism a few notches and added some junk food cravings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to start adjusting Vanessa's desire to apply makeup and style her hair, and then finally get back to shrinking down her bust again when the sound of someone coming in through front door caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Laura!

She couldn't remember him saying he had planned to come over but it wasn't uncommon for him to just drop by either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my room,\" she yelled back.

Nothing I wouldn't do I hope,\" Vanessa chuckled as she walked into Laura's bedroom.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura had to fight to keep her jaw from dropping as Vanessa entered the room.  Whatever she been expecting when she changed the settings on her sisters profile, this wasn't it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa had changed almost every aspect of her appearance, her normally long blonde hair was now dyed a brown that was so dark it bordered on black with reddish streaks throughout.  It was now barely longer than shoulder length , framing her head in what resembled a thick unkempt bob with errant tendrils of hair poking out everywhere though it seemed too eye catching and well presented to be completely accidental.  Vanessa ran a hand through her bangs, sweeping them off to the side where they almost covered her right eye.  In seconds stray strands stuck out in an aggressively random manner again.  It was at this point Laura noticed that instead of the eyebrows that Vanessa normally kept plucked so thin she had to draw more on with a makeup pencil each day were now much thicker.  They were obviously still shaped but the difference it made in Vanessa's expression was noticeable, she almost appeared like she was glaring or grumpy though her eyes themselves didn't give off the same vibe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes traveled downward, taking in the heavy eye shadow but overall less makeup Vanessa was now wearing, along with a thick, black leather choker around her neck.  Vanessa didn't appear to have a double chin she noted.  When her focus got to Vanessa's body she had to try to digest it slowly, when she tried to take it all in at once she felt overwhelmed, like she was staring at the sun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowing down Vanessa's metabolism and removing her drive to be active had definitely made her gain weight, but it was how and where she gained it that was shocking to Laura.  Vanessa's waist had gained almost nothing, in fact the short sleeve crop top she was wearing showed a stomach that seemed nearly as thin as Laura remembered and still had a subtle hint of abs under the thin layer of baby fat.  Everywhere else on the other hand, Vanessa had put on considerable weight.  Vanessa's arms were thick, but not droopy or overtly fat looking.  They strained at the sleeves of her shirt and her forearms were now covered with armbands and bracelets but her arms definitely weren't unattractive.  The same could be said of her legs and hips, which had widened and thickened considerably, to the point where by all logic they should have been wrinkled with cellulite but the short pleated miniskirt displayed more than enough flesh to clearly show that this was not the case.  A studded leather belt wrapped around her waist and Vanessa's legs were covered from the knee down with heavy looking, heeled boots that were decked out with way more buckles and straps than were probably necessary. As she walked into the room it was evident that Vanessa was not only aware of her ridiculous curves, she was literally strutting to get the most sway and jiggle out of them, showcasing her body in almost mesmerizing motion.  The sheer width of her new hips should have put her upper body far out of proportion but Vanessa had packed weight onto her chest as well and Laura silently cursed herself for not nerfing her sisters boob size before applying these changes.  Instead of being being dwarfed by the width of her new hips, Vanessa's breasts had gained in size to such an extreme degree that her upper and lower were well balanced.  The overall effect of her outrageous curves and still skinny waist was of cartoonish excess but this was real, it was in the flesh and it was her sister.  Vanessa stopped and it took a moment for the ripples of motion in her body to stop as well, Laura could not tear her eyes away from Vanessa's bust, which was not only shockingly large, it was so tightly encased in the shirt she was wearing that it looked like her breasts might burst free at any moment and whatever logo or design was on the chest was so distorted Laura couldn't tell what it was supposed to be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon sis, what are we doing back here?  We were playing a game remember?\"  Vanessa asked, putting her hand on her hip and cocking it to one side, setting her assets into motion again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at the point Laura almost found her voice to answer her sister Jason reached out his hand and cupped Vanessa's butt cheek with one hand, squeezing it until his fingers seemed to sink improbably far into the flesh.  Vanessa chuckled throatily and ground her backside against his hand.  \"Later big guy, gaming and snacks for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned slowly to face Jason, she almost forgot he was in the room at all and she definitely hadn't looked at him since Vanessa made her big entrance.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every time she tried to look away or think of something else to say she failed and the long silence felt like it was dragging out to awkwardness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Jason dressed in baggy t-shirts and loose fitting jeans or cargo pants.  In fact just a few minutes ago he had been wearing exactly that, a Flash t-shirt and cargo shorts.  Now he was wearing a tight fitting sheer black tank top and dark blue, skin tight bike shorts.  A few moments ago Jason would have looked ridiculous in such an outfit.  Now he looked... Laura let out a shaky breath she didn't realize she had been holding.  \"Amazing,\" she whispered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe later Laura would attempt to figure out how changing her sister to be a couch potato would have transformed Jason into what appeared to be a serious bodybuilder but for now she was enjoying looking at the results.  Jason was very nearly as large as her brother Greg but Laura had never seen Greg so well defined or symmetrical. Jason's muscles bulged like his skin was barely containing them, even when he was standing at rest and every minuscule move he made, even to shift his weight from foot to foot, or to cross his arms after he let go of Vanessa's ass, made his muscles flex and dance.  Laura's eyes followed the line of veins from his swollen forearms, up and across his craggy biceps and then her gaze drifted across this massive and prominent pecs.  She sharply sucked in a breath when he uncrossed his arms and his pecs bounced dramatically.  She allowed her gaze to wander downward, following the line of his sharply defined abs.  When her view drifted below Jason's waistline she involuntarily gasped.  Between the narrowness of his waist and the swell of his muscular thighs the shorts clearly accentuated Jason's package and it was big.  Much bigger than Laura ever would have imagined it was.  The shorts were pulled so tight she could clearly make out the outline and she forced herself to jerk her eyes up and away.  She was now meeting Jason's clearly puzzled gaze and she could feel her cheeks burn as she blushed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I,\" Laura started to say something but was distracted again as she realized Jason's complexion was much clearer than she was used to and his hair was shorter and better combed.  He looked good, really good.  How had adjusting Vanessa changed all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" Jason asked with a note of concern in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura realized that Vanessa was  also looking at her with obvious concern.  \"Yea, what's up sis?\" She asked with an arched eyebrow.  Laura almost found her voice again when Vanessa shifted her weight from one foot to the other and even this relatively small movement made her body jiggle distractigly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wasn't sure what to do, she was feeling overwhelmed. </span></div></div>",

Her mind churned, trying to make sense of this new reality she had created.  She knew there were memories available regarding what was going on, after all she had automatically answered Jason's question about where Vanessa was without even thinking about it.  The memories felt like they were almost tangible, as though they were swirling around her in a cloud just out of reach.  \"Hey Van,\" Laura paused momentarily as the unfamiliar nickname crossed her lips when she had meant to say \"Hey Vanessa.\"  Vanessa arched an eyebrow.  \"Where's Greg?\"  She asked, finally overcoming the momentary self awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason surprised Laura by answering the question, \"he's probably getting things ready for our trip to the gym later.\"  Laura's eyes almost bugged out her head when Jason fully flexed his bicep.  At rest his biceps were impressive, fully flexed they were unbelievable, with a perfectly formed peak deeply defined separation, and a vein like a fire hose snaking across it.  He laughed and swatted Vanessa ass, once again causing a chain reaction of jiggles.  \"You should come back to the gym with us,\" he said, clearly addressing Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa wrinkled her nose with obvious distaste, \"no thanks, I already gave it a go with you guys, it's not my thing.\" Vanessa punctuated her statement by flexing her own bicep and the modest peak that appeared made Laura realize that there was a layer of muscle somewhere under all that fleshy padding.  A few pieces of memory clicked into place and Laura almost sighed with relief when at least some of her new world made now sense to her.  Of course Vanessa and Jason ended up together, Jason and Laura had been close friends in their \"real\" lives where Jason had crushed on Vanessa from afar.  With Vanessa and Laura now being all but inseparable, and with all of them sharing extremely common interests Vanessa had seemed far less threatening to Jason and therefore more approachable.  Laura now \"remembered\" that the two had been dating for years.  Another connection was made, flashing like a lightning bolt in her minds eye.  Laura had changed a lot of things about Vanessa's interests but she had never altered her attraction to jocks or muscular guys.  Jason had thrown himself heart and soul into trying to fulfill this desire for Vanessa and he had succeeded in spades.  Another flash had Laura \"remembering\" that Jason had turned to Greg for advice and the two had quickly become work out buddies.  \"Memories\" of Vanessa going to the gym with them but eventually losing interest as her new sloth-like ways took firmer hold were also there and at least partially explained her somewhat bizarre physique.  But apparently Jason absolutely adored Vanessa's lush curves.  This was underscored by Jason choosing once again to lift the back of Vanessa's short skirt and blatantly grope her ass.  Vanessa grinned but swatted his hand away, \"I said later, stud.  C'mon, game time,\" she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Laura agreed, vaguely remembering some kind of co-op space shooter they were in the midst of. \"We could use a gunner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh,\" Vanessa disagreed.  \"He's taking shields, you're taking guns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Laura protested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're shield skillz are weak, Jason is on shields, you're on guns,' Vanessa's tone left no room for discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't, that last death was your piloting,\" Laura protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch, do not ever talk about my piloting like that again,\" Vanessa smirked and they walked out of Laura's room and towards the living room.  Jason put him arm around Vanessa's waist and she leaned into him.  Laura was fascinated at the contrast between their hard and soft bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura reached into the back pocket of her jean shorts and was startled to simultaneously discover a few things.  She no longer had her phone.  She was no longer wearing jean shorts.  And she had apparently not come through this new reality without some drastic body changes of her own.  \"My ass,\" she gasped involuntarily as her hand encountered a body part that now felt completely unfamiliar to her.</span></div></div>",

Just a glance downward seemed to indicate she was only wearing a sports bra and bike shorts like Jason's and that she had some serious abs going on.  \"I have to go to the bathroom,\" she finally declared, turning to scurry away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Vanessa sighed, \"we're never going to finish this damn level.\"  Vanessa leaned over and grabbed a bowl of Doritos from the coffee table and was loudly crunching her way through them as Laura left the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura flicked the bathroom light on and closed the door behind herself as she tried to psyche herself up to see how the new reality had changed her body.

Oddly enough the first few things that caught her attention were the most superficial.

She also noticed she was wearing well applied makeup that accentuated her good features like her cheekbones.  New \"memories\" of Vanessa coaching her on makeup technique overlapped with the purely meta observation that hair and makeup were one of Vanessa's passions she was glad she hadn't got around to adjusting with the app.  Laura smiled, she hadn't expected to benefit from not changing something of Vanessa's.  Thinking of hair and makeup made her absently wonder why Vanessa had decided go with a markedly \"mall-goth\" look in this reality.  Almost immediately Laura's new grasp of things like complexion and contrast theory answered her own question for her. \"Because she hardly ever goes outside anymore her skin is naturally much paler, this look makes the most of her new complexion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's focus finally went beyond the surface and she took a more detailed surveillance of her body itself.  Laura's new body was similar to Jason's in that her musculature was insanely cut, defined and symmetrical but Laura was much leaner and had far less mass.  She flexed a bicep experimentally and while she was pleased with the pronounced peak that rose in response she couldn't help feel slightly disappointing that it wasn't larger.  Looking at her reflection Laura felt like she could still see the framework of the painfully skinny girl she had once been under this new body.  The longer she looked the more she realized that she was attempting to sculpt curves onto her body using muscle instead of generous genetics.  She was obviously focusing on her shoulders and legs in an attempt to provide the illusion of an hourglass figure.  Her abs stood out as one of her most spectacular features, and she ran a finger across the hard ridges of her abs.  She had meticulously shaped her stomach for strength and definition while taking great pains to make sure it didn't become any thicker.  Her dedication had etched out insanely powerful and prominent abs and her incredibly narrow waist helped add to the hourglass illusion she was sculpting herself into. She had a flash of memory where Greg was guiding her through an ab routine and she realized that Jason's relationship with both Vanessa and Greg had served as a bridge of sorts between herself and her brother. She experienced a rush of memories of the three of them working out together. Mixed into those memories were some with Vanessa temporarily joining them in the gym and Laura experienced almost overwhelming feelings of love and kinship with Vanessa who had at least tried out something that everyone else she was close to was enjoying even if she didn't particularly like it herself. Laura also felt herself almost tear up at the thought that she had become so close with Greg who had seemed like a distant and almost mythical figure to her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to survey her ass in the mirror and gasped out loud, she never would have imagined she could possess an ass this spectacular. A moment of groping and slapping revealed it was composed pretty much entirely of muscle and it evoked memories of grueling exercise and extensive research on how to best shape it. Her body literally quivered at the memories of time spent at the squat rack and she licked her lips in anticipation of doing more of the same later today. \"Damn right I talk about my ass every day,\" she told her smirking reflection. \"This thing is fucking perfect.\" She giggled and mimed the \"just right\" meme like her sister had done earlier while giving her ass a smack that was hard enough to make her hand sting. Otherwise she barely felt it and this made her laugh out loud.  Having an ass this amazing took away some of the sting of disappointment from not having an overall larger physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun slowly around, regarding her body from every angle.  While she wished her arms were thicker and noted that her calves needed some serious work to catch up with her sleek and powerful thighs she was definitely in far better shape than she had ever been in \"real life.\"   She did frown slightly as she ran a hand across her chest.  While she had never really had noticeable breasts before, now even the minuscule layer of softness that had been there was gone, only rock hard pectoral muscles remained though given her currently shredded condition she assumed that might be the case no matter how large her breasts may have been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped spinning and gave herself one more head to toe look.  It was amazing how dramatic the effect that just changing Vanessa had made on Laura's entire reality. She could think of a few things she would still like to change.  Larger muscles, maybe some boobs.  Then the image of Jason's new body rose unbidden in her mind, her skin flushed as she thought of his obviously prodigious penis and his rock hard and god-like body. Why hadn't she ended up with Jason instead, she wondered. Some memory seemed to be in the process of forming when her thoughts were interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Lu,\" Vanessa's voice carried from the living room. \"I swear if you're wasting time staring at yourself in that damn mirror again I'm going to break it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hastily flushed the toilet in an attempt to try and salvage the apparently ineffectual charade of her having to use the restroom before she flicked off the light and left the bathroom.  She paused in the hallway, her mind still thinking of things like muscles, boobs, and not least of all, Jason and Vanessa as a couple. Should she try to find where she had left her phone and \"fix\" one or more of these things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious Lu, get your perfect ass over here,\" Laura could hear Jason laughing in response to Vanessa's good natured grouching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura stood, momentarily frozen with indecision before she finally turned and walked back towards the living room.  There would be plenty of time for that later, for the moment maybe it would be a good idea to get a better feel for this reality.  If only a few intentional changes to Vanessa had caused so many other unplanned changes to this reality Laura would have to tread carefully.  Especially difficult to navigate would probably be the relationship between Jason and Vanessa if she ever decided she wanted to tamper with that since it seemed to be the basis for how Laura and Jason had achieved their new bodies.  Laura once again wished her muscularity was a little more pronounced and this time she \"remembered\" a conversation between herself and Greg that seemed to be have been fairly recent.  \"Don't get discouraged Laura,\" her brother was telling her as she was shuddering with exertion after a particularly brutal workout.  \"Your dedication and progress have been incredible so far but some people just build muscle easier than others, you're a hard gainer.  If sheer guts alone could grow muscle you'd be the biggest she beast that ever lived, you've done good kiddo, stick with it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had been so engrossed in this memory she had zoned out and was only brought back to reality by the sound of Vanessa giggling.  As Laura walked around the couch she realized that Jason and Vanessa were currently lying across the couch, limbs tangled and in various states of undress.  \"Shit,\" Vanessa pushed Jason off of herself and sat up, \"we figured you'd be screwing around for a few more minutes still.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Invader Zim panties?\"  Laura snorted as Vanessa rearranged her clothes.  \"A Hot Topic from 2005 just called for you, they want their goth crap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bite me, gym bunny,\" Vanessa pointedly smoothed her skirt down before flipping her sister off and returning to fixing her clothes.  She wriggled her shirt back down over her bra covered breasts then leaned back, grabbing a controller as she settled into the couch.  \"There,\" she said, waving for Laura to sit next to her while Jason sat on the other side. With a surprisingly loud pop the fabric of Vanessa's shirt finally gave up its tenuous hold on life and split almost all the way up the middle between her breasts.  It was stopped from becoming two completely separate pieces only by the hems at the top and bottom, leaving a gaping boob window open to showcase Vanessa's breathtaking cleavage.  \"Oh well, there goes another one,\" Vanessa barely reacted to the occurrence.  Jason was momentarily transfixed by the sight then he shifted awkwardly, trying to conceal his quickly stiffening hard on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt herself flushing again.  She tried to ignore both her sister and Jason as she grabbed her own controller and sat down.  It felt both strange and strangely familiar to be leaning against Vanessa and her extreme curves like this.  It was surprisingly comfortable and she soon stopped thinking about the seating arrangements as she got more absorbed in the game.  Laura could not remember having ever played the bizarrely colorful 2-D space shooter before but she took to it with an instinctual ease that made her think that she must have.  True to her word, Vanessa monopolized the pilot's chair and barked out orders to her crew while Jason manipulated the shields to try to stop incoming fire.  Laura ran back and forth between the gun emplacements with occasional assistance from Jason.  \"That's what I'm talking about,\" Vanessa crowed as they rescued the last captive and escaped to the next level.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, where do you think you're going with that beam crystal?\"  Laura asked incredulously, \"I need that for the top gun turret.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need it for the shields,\" Jason disagreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up stud, Lu is right,\" Vanessa interjected, \"wait for a metal power up so you can upgrade to the capture shield, it's more versatile.  Another rapid fire laser cannon would be better use to us right now.\"  Jason shrugged and put the crystal in the gun's upgrade slot then glanced at his watch, \"we probably have time for the world boss before we'll have to head to the gym, Laura,\" Jason told her as they moved on to the next challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, \"Want to come with us today Van?\" Laura asked without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you know it's not my thing, sis.  Besides, you have to spend some time away from me once in a while, it's healthy for you.\"  Vanessa turned to look at her sister and Laura must have looked let down by the answer because after a moment Vanessa sighed, \"fine, if we can beat this boss and get the solar flare achievement I'll come with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already have the solar flare achievement,\" Laura protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason doesn't,\" Vanessa said with a shrug.  \"You worried about your skillz?\" Vanessa asked with hint of teasing in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no,\" Laura pressed her lips together.  \"His maybe, don't screw this up Jason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jason protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Vanessa elbowed him, \"try to keep up, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey three gamed in silence for a few moments until the bosses health dropped almost to nothing.  Finally Vanessa broke the silence, \"Remember don't kill him yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I'm doing,\" Laura said, resisting the urge to roll her eyes.  She opened fire on the next flare that appeared and cheered as the resulting fireballs finished off the boss.  After a moment Jason's achievement popped and Laura cheered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa tossed her controller onto the coffee table with a \"thunk\" and stood up, stretching and groaning.  \"Alright you two, let's get a move on then, I'll drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Van, don't you think you're a little,\" Laura leaned closer to Vanessa and said in a loud stage whisper, \"exposed?\"  She pointed at Vanessa's chasm of cleavage for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea, that,\" Vanessa shrugged, causing her assets to jiggle dramatically.  She went upstairs towards her room while Laura grabbed her gym bag.  Jason apparently had his bag stashed somewhere nearby because the next time Laura noticed him he had it in his hands.  She fought off the urge to glance at his package again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lu, catch,\" Laura turned to see her phone arcing towards her through the air, \"you left it on my charger again.\"  Vanessa said as Laura fumbled to catch her phone, nearly dropping it before she finally had a firm grip on it.  \"You really need to find yours, I have to charge mine once in a while myself,\" Vanessa picked up her purse and opened the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura noticed that Vanessa's attempt at covering herself was hardly an improvement.  She had merely put on a black hoodie over the semi-destroyed shirt but she hadn't been able to zip it up past the swell of her breasts so there wasn't much reduction in the amount of cleavage on display.  And her breasts caused the hoodie to ride up almost to the bottom of her breasts, covering barely anymore flesh than the crop top underneath had.  Laura also couldn't help but notice that at some point the sleeves of the hoodie had been raggedly cut off, whether because they were too snug for Vanessa's arms or because Vanessa just wanted to show off as much skin as possible.  Laura resisted the urge to point out to her sister that the hoodie was hardly an improvement and merely followed Vanessa and Jason to her car.  Predictably Jason got into the front passenger side seat and Laura let herself into the back seat.</span></div></div>",

Vanessa began driving towards what Laura assumed was a local gym.  Laura momentarily wondered why they weren't using Greg's home gym in the basement but she seemed to \"remember\" that it wasn't up to the task of the more focused and deliberate training Greg had graduated to following the addition of his siblings and new friend to his workout routine.  Laura was also mystified by Vanessa's music choice.  Instead of her typical diet of pop music Vanessa was listening to something much different.  This was more moody, atmospheric and filled with synthesized and electronically generated noises.  Whether by accident or design Laura couldn't hear whatever Vanessa and Jason were talking about in the front seat and she didn't feel like shouting over the music to wedge herself into the conversation.  Instead she turned on her phone with the intent of opening the app to see what she may be able to adjust with it to improve the deficiencies she perceived in her current situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you OK?  What's wrong,\" regardless of the volume of the music Vanessa had apparently noticed Laura's frustration and had turned down the music to talk to her sister.  Laura jumped, startled to be addressed by her full name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she said finally. \"I must have uninstalled an app on accident and now I can't find it to re-download it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it got pulled from the store there was probably something wrong with it, want me to see if I can help you recover it though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blinked in momentary confusion.

She knew it was useless to argue the point any further.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you download this app?\" Vanessa asked as they pulled into a parking space near the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This morning,\" Laura answered right away, \"why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might help me recover it if I know what time frame to look at in your purchase history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got out of the car Laura shouldered her bag and handed her phone to her sister to work on.  Vanessa followed them into the heart of the gym and sat down on a weight bench, her nose quickly buried in Laura's phone with only her oddly angry looking eyebrows noticeable over the phone case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to say something when Jason stopped her, \"don't bother,\" he said, \"you know how she gets when she's like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't know, she wasn't even sure what \"this\" was but she didn't want to admit it to Jason.  \"You're right,\" she agreed instead.  She glanced around the gym trying to locate her brother.  It took her a few times of looking at the enormous man in the far corner of the gym by the heaviest weight racks was her brother.  Greg was huge, even though the Greg that Laura knew was no slouch this version of her brother was monstrously muscular.  He was currently warming up with a set of barbells that looked insanely heavy and his biceps already had the almost glowing flush of a substantial pump.  Greg noticed Laura and Jason approaching but finished his current set of alternating curls before racking the weights and gesturing the two over.  Laura had to concentrate on not appearing surprised or overwhelmed by her brother's sheer size.  If she was being critical she would say that Jason had better symmetry and had far superior definition to her brother but then again... \"Still bulking for the competition?\"  She asked Greg as she dropped her bag next her brothers and began stretching out before she started exercising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded, \"yea, I won't start cutting until next week.\"  Greg gave Jason a slap on the shoulder.  \"If you were just a few pounds heavier you'd be in the super heavyweight class with me bro.  Then I'd have something to worry about.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smirked and gave Greg a thump on the arm in return, \"I'll be there for the next competition with no problem.  Though they might create a new weight class for you by then at the rate you're going.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the banter caused a feeling of concern to flicker through Laura's mind.  She had a sense of unease and a moment of strong cognitive dissonance.  How had Jason and her brother gotten so dramatically big just because they started exercising together?  She had no idea what Jason's potential for muscle building was in \"the real world\" so she had nothing to gauge how well he could progress as a body builder.  Having no reference point to measure against she had been willing to believe that he was capable of the incredible body he had now.  \"Besides, I always heard that juicing shriveled up the dick,\" she thought to herself as she stole another glance at the bulge in Jason's shorts.  But she had lived with Greg and knew that bodybuilding was something he took seriously, she had a hard time believing he would be this much bigger than she was used to unless he had some kind of pharmaceutical help to get there.  \"Oh no,\" she whispered under her breath.  \"I'm not taking steroids am I?\"  She stopped in mid stretch when she realized she couldn't remember for sure whether or not she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though how would she even ask the question without sounding like a lunatic?  Instead she buckled down and let Greg guide her through her workout.  Before long she was wrapped up in the workout experience and had lost track of everything else, she was absorbed in the focus and in the repetition.  She felt more acutely aware of her body than she ever had before and she wished that \"the real her\" had been into weight lifting.  This felt so empowering and fantastic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was apparently \"arm day\" and the entire trio was working their arms like there was no tomorrow.  During the cool-down before her final set she began adding weight to the bar she was using for curls when Greg tried to stop her.  \"Hold up Lulu,\" he cautioned, \"that might be a bit much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Vanessa gets to call me Lulu,\" she practically snarled at her brother.  His eyebrows raised with surprise and Laura felt shocked at the outburst herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry, I'm just trying to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she said with less venom in her voice, \"but I also know what what my body can do, and I know I'm not getting the burn I need.\"  She spun the weight lock into place and checked her watch.  \"Excuse me, time for my next set,\" she said grabbing the bar and beginning to curl it. Greg looked like he wanted to say something else but instead he just stood nearby silently, ready to step in if Laura looked like she was starting to struggle.  Laura's mouth twisted into a grim smile as she felt the burn settling in right in the center of her biceps, this was perfect.  She methodically curled the weight, ensuring her form was flawless no matter how much she felt like cheating the last few reps.  She grunted with exertion and then the grunt turned into a roar as she powered through the final rep, her form still as perfect as it had been when she started.  \"Told you,\" she huffed through clenched teeth after setting the bar down.  She was stretching and shaking her arms out to keep the blood flowing and she couldn't stop smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, sis,\" Greg said with a grin, \"you told me.  Great job,\" he thumped her on the shoulder and then moved on help Jason work through his last set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned back, feeling exhilarated and pumped.  She flexed her arms a few times and savored the swollen feel of her muscles, already dreading the impending fading of her pump.  That thought reminded her of the app.  She glanced over at Vanessa, wondering how she was coming with possibly recovering the app for her phone.  Vanessa was looking at Laura with an expression of concern but she quickly looked back down again when she noticed Laura looking in her direction.  Vanessa was now holding her own phone, one of the over-sized iPhones that tried to split the difference between smartphones and tablets.  Laura didn't see any sign of her own phone.  \"I'm going to hit the showers,\" Laura yelled in the direction of Jason and her brother as she tried to towel her sweat away and began walking towards Vanessa.  \"Were you able to recover that app?\"  Laura attempted to ask casually as she approached her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It can have far reaching consequences that you probably don't even comprehend yet,\" Vanessa was looking directly into Laura's eyes with an uncomfortable intensity but Laura couldn't bring herself to look away.  \"I know we're different, Lulu,\" the use of the nickname Laura was most familiar with hit her in the gut like an emotional sucker-punch and she wondered what caused that reaction, or her earlier outburst when Greg had used it, \"but we also have a LOT in common,\" Vanessa continued.  \"You are more than just my sister, you're my best friend in the world and I will not let anything happen to hurt you if I can possibly help it, you understand that right?\"  Laura nodded, and Vanessa seemed satisfied for now.  \"Now go get your shower taken care of, you stink like a locker room and you're not sitting your ass, no matter how nice it is, on my couch until you stop reeking,\" Vanessa made a show of shooing Laura away before she returned her focus to her own phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura draped the now sweat soaked towel over her shoulder and began making her way over towards the women's locker room when she felt two hands roughly grab her by the ass, a hand over each butt cheek.  She was goosed so firmly that she was lifted slightly off the ground and had to go up on her tiptoes to keep her balance.  \"There's that perfect ass,\" a voice said directly into her ear with a laugh before letting go, \"guess who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stiffened slightly at first but found herself unable to do anything but melt as their tongues intertwined.  This felt natural and comfortable and she realized that on top of having the feeling that she still had a lot of energy to burn off after her workout that she was also very, very horny.  The figure wrapping their arms around her felt up her ass again and Laura returned the favor, then lifted Brodie by his own butt, carried him across the aisle and dropped his ass on a weight bench hard enough to make him yelp with surprise.  She quickly straddled him and wrapped her arms around his neck, grinning mischievous as she made it perfectly clear he wasn't going anywhere unless she let him.  \"Whoa Laura, hold on a second,\" he protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Laura said before kissing him again.  \"You started this, better be ready to finish it,\" she ground herself against his rapidly stiffening hard on and grinned wickedly.  She enjoyed the brief flare of panic in his light blue eyes which she appraised the rest of him.  He had shaggy sun bleached hair, a deep tan, and he was tall with a slender but well muscled body.  She pegged him instantly as a surfer.  She didn't even stop to think about how or why she seemed to be dating (or was at least sexually involved) with a surfer but she instinctively knew that this was the case.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on babe,\" he protested, \"you're a little ripe, how about a shower first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You started this,\" she repeated with a pout.  \"You're just ashamed of PDA's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not?  So you're ashamed of me personally then?  You're going to break my heart,\" Laura stood up and Brodie awkwardly crossed his legs, trying to hide his prominent boner.  Maybe not as big as Jason appeared to be but he certainly didn't appear to be a slouch either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he said with a note of fear in his voice, \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax, you're cute when you squirm but I don't want you to be too scared to perform.\"  Laura tossed her sweat soaked workout towel into his lap to cover his obvious erection and winked before she turned on her heel.  \"Wait here, I'll be out in a minute,\" she called over her shoulder.  The spring went out of her step and she felt herself blush when she realized that Vanessa was still sitting there and that she had pretty much dry humped a guy in front of her sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Vanessa said before Laura got a chance to say anything.  \"I have plans for mine when we get back home anyway, give me a call if you need a ride afterward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, um, OK,\" Laura finally got out.  She wiggled her fingertips at her sister, \"see you later then,\" she started jogging towards the showers, \"have fun!\" she called back to Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I intend to,\" Vanessa said to herself.  Brodie looked at Vanessa, over towards Jason and Greg then back at Vanessa.  He looked like he was going to say something then decided not to.  \"Good idea,\" Vanessa said, glancing over her phone at him and narrowing her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and dropped the towel into one of the bins, \"If you see Laura looking for me let her know I'm out by my truck OK?\"  Vanessa merely nodded so after a moment he turned and left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was gone Vanessa muttered to herself, \"I know she can do better if she wanted to.\"</span></div></div>",

She dried off with a towel and pulled on a loose fitting, open shouldered crop top.  Despite the long flowing sleeves it showed off her toned shoulders and of course, her amazing abs.  She didn't bother putting her bra on but she did put on its matching lace panties and a tight denim micro skirt that covered her butt cheeks and not much else.  She slipped on some low heeled sandals that helped accentuate both the curve of her ass and the shape of her calves.  Laura then pulled her still damp, long hair into a clip on the top of her head before she hastily applied the bare minimum of makeup which consisted of eyeliner, a light application of blush and some lip gloss.  Taking one more long look at herself in the mirror she barely registered that before this morning she never would have been able to judge whether or not she was using the right shade of gloss or blush.  Happy with what she saw she grabbed her gym bag and stepped as fast as her heeled sandals would let her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura passed through the parking lot, looking for Brodie's pick up truck, not sure how she knew he had a truck or what it looked like but confident that when she saw it she would know.  At almost the same time she recognized his truck, a pale blue and rust accented older model with surfboards in a rack attached to the roof, she noticed she was passing near her sisters car.  Oddly enough she realized that Jason was behind the wheel and Vanessa was sitting in the passenger seat, nose in her phone.  Because of the over sized screen Laura could clearly see that there was an image of her as she appeared right now on the screen.  \"Hey,\" Laura called, trying to get Vanessa's attention.  The loud sounds of electronic music were clearly audible even where Laura was and she doubted anyone in the car could hear her.  Laura began to jog closer to the car to either confirm or deny her suspicion but before she got close enough Jason pulled away and turned onto the street, quickly leaving Laura behind.  Laura stood in the parking lot fuming, unsure whether Vanessa now had a copy of the app and equally unsure whether they had purposefully avoided her or just didn't realize she had been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharp bark of a car horn made her turn her head and she realized that Brodie had spotted her and was signalling her to come over to his truck.  Laura turned back to look at at direction her sister had disappeared in and remembered how precisely Vanessa had said, \"I wasn't able to restore the app onto your phone.\"  Vanessa was a stickler for precise wording and meaning, was that merely a way of not admitting that she had been able to find the app and install it on her own phone instead?  Laura was torn with indecision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura gave one last lingering look in the direction her sister had vanished before turning and heading over to Brodie's truck.  She tossed her gym bag into the back then climbed into the cab next to him.  Without thinking about it she leaned against his chest and wrapped her arms around him.  He put an arm around her shoulders and gave her a peck on the lips.  \"Hey, babe, you're looking hot as always,\"she felt a flush of pride that the hard work she had put into her body had made someone so attracted to her, she wasn't used to being the object of someone's desire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not looking so bad yourself,\" she said, lifting his shirt and firmly slapping his abs.  She let her hand drift downward until she was caressing his package through his shorts.  Between looking at Jason's hot new body most of the day, being turned on from her work out, and now having a pretty decent looking/built guy who obviously found her at least as attractive as she found him were all combining to make her extremely turned on.  She squeezed gently and looked up to meet his eyes, \"well what are you waiting for?  Aren't we going back to your place to hump like rabbits?\" she asked with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" Brodie nodded, starting his truck and putting it into gear.  Laura sighed and closed her eyes, letting herself relax as she almost dozed off next to him.  She opened her eyes with a start after the truck came to a stop and she felt his hand brush a stray hair away from her face.  \"You aren't too worn out from your workout today to do anything are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head, \"no, of course not.  This is exactly what I need right now.\"  She surprised herself with how true that was, she and Brodie were making out with a feverish intensity before they even made it into his apartment and they were barely inside with the door shut before she started tearing his clothes off of him.  Between deep, intense kisses she yanked his shirt over his head and got his shorts and underwear down to his ankles.  He stumbled backward, trying get his feet clear of his shorts and ended up falling backward onto the couch.  Laura took this moment to kick off her sandals and slip her panties off before she strode purposefully toward him as he attempted to rise up off the couch.  \"No,\" she said firmly, putting her hand in the middle of his chest and pushing him back down onto the couch as she stepped up onto the couch herself and lifted her skirt.  She swiftly but firmly lowered herself onto his hard on.  He moaned softly but Laura was concentrating so intently on the experience that she didn't make a sound, instead she looked deep into his eyes as she straddled him and used her powerful abs to twitch and rock herself against his throbbing manhood.  He groaned as she continued to quicken the pace until the couch vibrated and squeaked as it slid across the scuffed hardwood floor.  The couch itself squealed and something in it broke loudly from the exertion.  Laura reached her hands over her heard and undid her hair clip, tossing it to the side where it landed near her sandals and panties.  Brodie panted as his hands crept up under Laura's shirt and he tweaked her hard nipples, finally eliciting a gasp from her as bolts of pleasure shot through her at his touch.  He let one hand drift down to her ass where he groped and kneaded it while the other continued to play with her nipples.  She incredibly was able to increase her pace even faster and the couch continued to scuff its way across the floor until it hit the wall next to his bedroom door.  Very shortly afterward he came hard inside her and she smiled as she slowed down her pace and eventually stopped.  \"Alright, you can take a break for a few minutes but then it's my turn, and you better not disappoint me,\" Laura said with a smile before getting up and leading him by the hand into the bedroom. If he was bothered by the fact his couch had been broken or his floor damaged he didn't show any sign of it.  Within minutes hey were both completely naked and going at it again.  Laura smiled as she began to feel an orgasm of her own quickly building.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward Laura lay next to Brodie, her head on his shoulder with their arms wrapped around each other and at a moment she should have been happy doubts began creeping in. \"Am I just incapable of being happy with what I have?\" she wondered silently to herself.  She couldn't remember much about her relationship with Brodie, who he was, how they had met, but right now despite the satisfying love making they had just had, the only thing she could think about was how he wasn't as big Jason, either his muscularity or probably even his penis size.  She had to admit his current size certainly wasn't disappointing but she couldn't help but wonder what it would be like if he were even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrodie ran his hands over her abs, upward across one of her breasts until it eventually came to rest on her cheek.  \"Man, I love how strong you are,\" he said finally.  \"That tight little body can go all day long, but sometimes you scare me a little, like I think we broke some stuff today.\"  Laura shrugged.  \"What's wrong Laura, you look like you have something on your mind,\" he asked finally after she didn't react to his attempts at conversation.</span></div></div>",

He must have seen something in Laura's expression that confirmed his suspicion because he pushed her hand away and sat up.  \"We've done this before babe, surfers can't be bulky.  I won't be able to compete if I'm too heavy and slow on the board.\"  Laura reached for him but he pushed her hand away again.  \"What are we doing here?  Are you coming in here and fucking me while you fantasize about your sisters boyfriend?  I'm into you for who and what you are, Laura.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was stunned into silence.  Both from the revelation that she had apparently already discussed this with  Brodie but couldn't remember it, and by the vehemence of his response.  She looked slowly around his bedroom, taking in details that she had missed earlier due to her singular focus on sex.  Details like a wall full of surfing trophies, a poster advertising board wax featuring Brodie, surfing dramatically deep inside the pipe of a large wave and a handful of framed surfing magazine with Brodie on the cover.  Her mind dully tried to shift gears as she struggled to remember anything about Brodie, how they met or why they were dating each other.  Or were they just friends with benefits?  She had no idea and the feeling of not being able to remember was driving her insane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to force herself to remember something, anything suddenly left her with the bizarre feeling that she was in two places at the same time.  Brodie was standing in front of her saying, \"\"That's cool, I wish I lived closer to the beach.\"  He then a took a beer from Laura's hand and quickly downed it.  As suddenly as it appeared the strange experience was over and Laura felt a blinding spike of pain knifing into her brain so intensely that everything else was blocked out for an instant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"  Brodie asked, noticing Laura's obvious discomfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"I can't talk about this right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  His voice was incredulous.  \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of frustration began to run down Laura's face.  \"I mean I can't, I literally can't.  Something is wrong with me and I don't know what it is.\"  She wiped angrily at her eyes and began to get out of bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrodie reached for her but she jerked her arm away as she stood up.  \"Are you on something right now?\"  He finally asked as she began roughly pulling her clothes on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No!\"  Laura shook her head, not wanting to admit that she couldn't even be positive that this was the case.  Why did her memories have to turn out so scrambled?  Would this world ever make sense to her?  \"I have to go,\" she said scooping up her panties and sandals as she left the bedroom and made her way to front door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura,\" Brodie's voice was hard to read, she couldn't figure out if he was upset or just resigned.  \"Laura, please don't leave like this.  Stay, talk with me, help me understand what you're thinking, or how you feel about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to face him and of all things recognized her phone charger sitting on the table next to the door.  She reflexively picked it up then had to stop herself from crying again with even more frustration.  Why could she recognize her charger and know it was hers and not recognize a guy who apparently cared about her?  \"I can't right now,\" she repeated.  \"I need to figure some things out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"  Brodie threw his hands up with frustration.  \"What can possible be so hard about this to figure out that we can't talk about it right now?\"  Laura ran her eyes up and down his body, part of her wanted to go to him and hold him, maybe screw him again.  That part of her really wanted to work this out.  But the rest of her just felt too lost and confused to deal with it. She wiped at her eyes again and reached for the doorknob.  \"Laura, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" Laura said as she left.  She shuffled back out to Brodie's truck in a daze to grab her bag out of the back.  Realizing he was still carrying her panties, sandals and phone charger in her hands she slipped her sandals on then put the charger and panties into the bag before grabbing her phone.  She sniffled and wiped at her eyes again as she scrolled through her contacts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura's first instinct was to call her sister but as her thumb hovered over the button to dial her Laura hesitated.  Vanessa had all but said that she planned on spending quality time with Jason following their workout at the gym, and Laura wasn't sure if she wanted to wreck Vanessa's evening just because she may have just broke up with a guy she wasn't even sure if she was dating.  Laura began to scroll through her contact list again, wondering who else she may be able to call when a trick of the light caused her to see a flash of her reflection in her phone's screen.  Her nose wrinkled in disgust at the streaks of eye-liner smudged around her eyes and the tangled rats nest of hair she never really taken care of properly.  She turned her phone off and glanced around the unfamiliar neighborhood until she spotted a coffee shop nearby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked purposefully into the coffee shop and made a beeline for the restroom, trying to avoid looking at anyone and hoping no one would notice her while she was in such a state.  A few moments of self reflection may have made her realize that she had never been this concerned with her appearance before but at the moment she wasn't thinking of anything but scrubbing the smeared makeup off her face and brushing her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura locked herself in the bathroom and proceeded to do just that.  She also opted to put her panties back on since she wasn't confident in her micro skirt to preserve her modesty.  After re-applying her makeup she scrutinized her reflection before deciding that she looked fantastic.  Properly good enough to go out and snag herself a new guy to replace whatever it was she had going with Brodie if she wanted to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura exited the restroom, bought  an iced coffee and sat down at a table as far away from the other patrons as she could.  She pulled her phone out and began going through her contacts again when someone sat down at her table.  Laura glanced up and saw a very beautiful girl in sitting directly across from her, engrossed in her own phone.  Laura took in details about the girl as she waited for her to either notice she had sat at the wrong table and leave or say something.  The girl had, extremely long, pale blonde hair that framed a face that Laura could only describe as flawless, a figure that at least from the waist up was well proportioned and attractive and displaying breast that given their size and obvious lack of bra, were surprisingly pert.  Despite being dressed casually the silent girl sat with poise and grace that so pronounced it seemed out of place in their surroundings.  Laura set her own phone down and cleared her throat but the girl failed to react at all, her eyes remained fixed on her phone and her only movement was the occasional flick of her fingers across the screen.  Laura was about to clear her throat again when the girl finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good Laura.  You stumbled onto a fairly decent thing this time, better than some of your others anyway, and this time you can finally use makeup to your advantage,\" the girl spoke quietly, without ever raising her eyes from her phone and her almost emotionless delivery was unsettling.  \"It's a pity about the boobs though, \"she smiled coldly before continuing, \"and the boyfriend.\"  Laura's fists clenched involuntarily and she realized that she was sizing the girl up.  She was confident that she was stronger than this girl and could take her in a fight if she needed.  Laura was about to ask the girl to leave her alone when she spoke again, interrupting her.  \"We really need to talk about your sister Laura.  She may end up disturbing my plans and I will not allow that to happen.  Help me and and I can help you.\"  The girl paused to do something on her phone before continuing.  \"What do you want?  Bigger boobs?\"  The girl turned her phone so Laura could see the screen and it showed her, in the App, with a pair of DD or larger breasts high and perky on her chest. She looked breathtaking.  \"More muscle?\"  The girl took the phone back momentarily and then showed Laura the screen again, this time she was a gorgeous female body builder.  Laura began to reach for the phone but the girl took it back.  \"Maybe both at the same time?  Or maybe you want to Jason to love you instead of Vanessa?  I can make it happen for you, any of it.  But you need to help me first.\"</span></div></div>",

So much smarter.  Do you know what most people do as soon as they get the app?\"  The girl continued on too quickly for Laura to answer even if she had wanted to.  \"Something immediate, something raw, something simple like bigger boobs, better butt, a bigger dick.

Even if,\" the girl held up a finger as Laura began to protest, \"even if you did this by accident, it still makes you a thousand percent more interesting than most of the people I've met who've used the app.\"  The girl sat up somehow even straighter and Laura tried not to stare as the motion pulled the fabric of the girls shirt tighter across her nipples.  \"So please, don't insult the respect I actually have for you right now but playing dumb,\" the girl picked up her phone again, seeming to indicate that she was done speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sipped at her coffee again.  \"Why do I need your help then?\"  Laura asked finally.  The girl raised an eyebrow as Laura continued.  \"If Vanessa has this app, don't you think she would give me whatever I ask her for since I'm her sister?  Why would I need to jump through hoops for you and hope for a handout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl chuckled.  It was a dry mirthless sound that Laura immediately disliked.  \"True enough, I suppose that is a possibility however as I said, your sister having the app risks my plans which I will not allow to happen.  And I like to bribe rather than threaten though even if your sister gives you something with the app that you want, what is there to keep me from taking it back again?\"  The girl turned her phone again so Laura could see it and she gasped when she saw an image of herself on it, the image of what she had looked like before using the app.  \"And really, when you come to think of it, you don't look so bad here,\" the girl said, returning her focus to her phone as her fingers flew across its screen.  \"Your face is symmetrical, your teeth are clean and in place, your hair is healthy even if you don't really do anything special with it, complexion is clear, body weight is healthy, your cheekbones and eye's are fantastic...\"  the girl paused and turned the phone back to Laura again.  \"After all, things could be so much worse.\"  Laura shuddered at the sight of girl the phone showed.  Patchy, stringy hair, a pockmarked and acne covered complexion, overweight with some kind of tilt to her shoulders, a hunch?  There was something decidedly off about the face, it was still recognizably Laura but nothing seemed to line up right.  Laura shuddered again as the girl turned back to her phone.  \"That's still in the realm of acceptable appearance Laura, not attractive by any means but not entirely hideous either.  You could be a living freak show if I want you to be, can your sister protect you from that?\"  The girl drummed the fingers of her free hand on the table top as she continued to use her phone.  \"So what is it going to be Laura?  Are you going to help me and the carrot, or choose not to and get the stick?\"</span></div></div>",

She hesitated long enough for Laura to wonder if she actually planned on explaining anything before finally continuing.  \"What I need is for someone to uninstall the app from your sisters phone, the sooner the better but by no later than midnight tomorrow.  The tricky part is that no one already registered to the app can do use someone else's copy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Registered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl held up her thumb and a bit of her growing impatience with Laura flared to the surface, \"registered,\" she said sharply.  \"The thumbprint the app makes you take before you use it was supposed to make sure only one user can use their own copy the app.  However the feature wasn't implemented properly, it only works to lock out other registered users.  And before you ask,\" the girl stopped to glare at Laura before continuing, \"because of the nature of the changes you made, you are no longer a registered user for the app, now stop stalling.  Are you in or are you out?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I want a down payment first?\"  Laura asked, evading the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what were you thinking exactly?\"  The girl asked coolly, without looking up from her phone.  \"You're hoping that  I could bump you up to maybe a B cup right?  Something that would look fantastic on that body of yours without being so large people who know might not be surprised?  Something they may be willing to assume is the trick of a well padded bra, maybe a little extra weight, or possibly both?  Something perfectly shaped and pert, despite being smallish, maybe with slightly larger nipples than average just for grabbing that extra bit of attention?\"  The girl continued, still without looking up.  Laura could easily picture herself with the breasts the girl was describing and just the thought was beginning to turn her on.  \"And speaking of nipples, would you also prefer these \"down-payment\" boobs to have slightly more sensitive nipples than average so you can get the most enjoyment possible out of them?\"  The girl slammed the palm of a hand down hard on the table, making Laura jump.  \"Maybe you're forgetting that instead of a \"down payment\" I can just as easily give you a giant wart on the end of your nose or something else equally unsightly, until you do what I ask you to?  Cleft pallet?  Cauliflower ear?  Crossed eyes?  Club foot?  Do you get my point?  Are you ready to stop wasting my time now?  Yes or no, are you going to help or are you not going to help?\"  The girl held up her finger to shush Laura as she continued talking, \"as I said before, I respect you which is the only reason I've humored you for this long.  You have gotten probably ninety percent of what you would have considered a perfect life but that remaining ten percent is still eating at you, I can see it in your eyes.  You won't give up, you'll do what it takes to get your last ten percent.  Fine, but just remember, I am just as motivated as you are to finishing my dreams, and I have the app while you currently have nothing.  So this is the last time I ask, partners, or enemies?\"  The girl lifted her eyes to glare at Laura while she waited for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura inhaled sharply as she realized her nipples had suddenly became incredibly sensitive.  The skin of her chest flushed with warmth and she gasped as she could suddenly her feel the fabric of her shirt rubbing against her breasts as they began to grow, slowly at first then rapidly picking up speed.  In seconds the fabric of her shirt was pulled tight across still swelling breasts and she cupped them with her hands, moaning involuntarily as this only served to reinforce how sensitive her breasts and nipples had now become.  Her shirt began to strain to the breaking point and Laura arched her back, ready for her breasts to explode forth from their confines.  She was nearly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of sensory input suddenly radiating from her breasts and as she tweaked her own nipples she felt certain that the moment she burst free of her shirt would be the moment she would orgasm.   Then just as quickly as it had overtaken her the feeling began to fade and she her breasts began deflating under her hands.  \"No,\" she mumbled softly, trying to mask her feelings of panic, \"no, no, no.\"  She rocked back and forth, trying to keep tears from forming as the deflation continued until her breasts were almost as small as they had been before this started.  \"What did you do to me?\"  Laura demanded as she held onto the edge of the table they were sitting at and and drew in ragged breaths, still feeling the insistent desire from her almost orgasm on top of her anger and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you a taste of what I can offer you if you don't screw this up,\" the girl said, standing up without taking her eyes off of her phone.  \"Enjoy your \"down payment\" and don't leave me waiting longer than we agreed upon.  I am not patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sat up straighter at the mention of a \"down payment\" and tentatively groped her chest again.  She moaned softly with pleasure as she realized her breasts hadn't completely vanished, they were now solid handfuls and just like the girl had teased her with earlier, her nipples were now larger and extremely sensitive.  Laura rose shakily to her feet and staggered back into the coffee shop restroom where she locked her self in, roughly pulled her panties to one side and furiously fingerbanged herself with one hand while the other groped her new breasts and kneaded at her nipples.  Laura couldn't remember ever feeling so turned on in her entire life and the need for release was absolutely overwhelming.  When she finally came she didn't even realize she was screaming with ecstasy until the harsh echoes of her own voice reflecting back from the tiled walls and floors began to hurt her ears.  She lurched forward and had to grab the sink with both hands to keep from collapsing to the floor as the orgasm faded and her body felt like it was turning into a limp rag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, when Laura was finally able to catch her breath and have something approaching rational thought she looked at her reflection and sighed.  \"Shit,\" she said softly, resigning herself to once again cleaning up and reapplying her makeup.  As she did so her mind swirled, what had she gotten herself into?  How was she going to get out of it?  Would it really be so terrible to uninstall the app from Vanessa's phone?  Laura surveyed her reflection one more time, everything was as good as it was going to get and she had to admit, even the modest boost to her bustline seemed to provide her with an overall better balanced looking physique.  What did she have now?  B-cup maybe?  She twirled around once, getting a look from all angles before she sighed and left the restroom.  She didn't detour back to her table to retrieve her drink and she tried not to look anyone in the eye as she left as quickly as she could without running.  Her one quick glance around the shop only confirmed that the mysterious girl was long gone and the eyes of everyone in the shop were following her as she left.  She could feel her face burn with not only embarrassment at her extremely vocal orgasm these people had obviously overheard, but also the incredible sensitivity of her new nipples which clearly felt even the light touch of her top every time she moved.  As much as she wanted to go take care of this task she had saddled herself with as quickly as possible she didn't think she could wait long before getting into a new bra.  She exited the coffee shop and turned in a random direction, walking far enough away that she was no longer in direct sight of anyone inside the shop before she stopped to consider her next move.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura had almost convinced herself that she needed to get the app uninstalled from Vanessa's phone as soon as possible to get out from under the thumb of the creepy pale haired girl when a gust of air from a passing truck changed her mind.  Her shirt fluttered in the air flow and the rapid scrape of fabric across her incredibly sensitive nipples was almost enough to make her involuntarily moan.  No, she thought shaking her head.  There was no way she would be able to deal with that kind of distraction always being a random puff of air away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking about it she made her way to the nearest bus stop and was pleased to see that she was arriving at the same time as the bus.  Her feelings of good fortune were quickly dashed as she fumbled through her purse and wallet trying to find her bus pass.  She had a momentary burst of panic when a memory bubbled to the surface.  \"I never take the bus, Vanessa usually drives us everywhere,\" she mumbled to herself as she switched gears and began looking for cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it Laura, I got it,\" she looked up and her planned thanks died on her lips as she recognized the owner of the voice.  Her girlhood crush, Eric Godwin.  \"'C'mon, let me have this,\" he said with a chuckle, \"it's not every day I get a chance to act smooth with a bus pass,\" he chuckled as he passed his card through the reader and motioned for Laura to go ahead of him.  \"After you pretty lady.\"  Laura jerked her eyes away from Eric and numbly chose an empty seat, she was more than a little surprised when he sat down next to her. \"Where's Vanessa?  You two are usually inseparable.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Laura coughed discretely, \"she's spending time with her boyfriend.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric laughed, \"how's Jason doing?  Haven't seen him in a while but damn, he's getting bigger all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Laura hesitated, \"you're doing pretty well in that area yourself,\" she said, feeling like it was the understatement of the century.  In the world that she could remember Eric and Greg had been workout buddies but at some point after graduating high school they had drifted apart.  While still obviously strong looking the last few times she had seen him Eric had been sporting a bit of a beer gut and obviously not maintaining the same rigorous regimen.  In this reality he appeared to not only have stuck with his lifting, but had taken it to the next level.  He wasn't as big as her brother now appeared but he was easily larger than Jason and just as cut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled, \"I've been doing OK for myself.\"  Laura had to struggle not to stare at him like she used to get caught going when she was crushing hard on him.  It was difficult though, he had a certain rugged look that seemed like a throwback to older film area B movie actors.  \"Your brother though,\" Eric let out a low whistle, \"I can't catch up to that dude no matter what I try.\"  He raised an arm and flexed his bicep for Laura to examine. \"Remember back when I used to bigger than Greg and he struggled to keep up with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was glad she was sitting down because she felt literally weak in the knees at the sight of his bicep.  \"Yea,\" she nodded. She could clearly remember those days though he was now obviously even larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric chuckled again as he let his arm down.  \"You're doing well yourself, great genetics run in your family,\" Laura was too surprised to even react when he gave her shoulder a strong squeeze.  \"Fantastic,\" he said, after letting go.  She felt a bit let down when the physical contact was broken and she rubbed absently at where his hand had just been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Laura said, feeling herself blush self consciously.  She wasn't sure how else to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame Vanessa gave up on it so quickly, she showed astounding potential,\" Eric looked off into the distance, remembering something that Laura probably should have been able to remember as well.  \"So,\" he said finally breaking out of his reverie, \"what are you up to these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question prompted Laura to consider her current mission to buy a new bra and the fact that the bus was approaching the stop nearest the mall.</span></div></div>",

As much as she liked the direction this conversation was going, as much as seeing Eric had re-ignited her old crush, and as much as she was incredibly turned on just by sitting next to this gorgeously muscled body and movie star good looks she also felt the weight of incredible fear regarding what the pale haired girl might do to her if she didn't live up to her end of the bargain.  \"Look,\" Laura said with a sigh, \"I would love to hang out and talk to you, catch up and all that,\" Laura dug a pen out of her purse and scribbled her phone number on a dollar bill, the only piece of paper she could find in her purse, \"maybe get a bite to eat or grab a movie or something?\" she continued as she handed Eric the dollar and motioned that she needed to get past him.  \"But anyway, I <i>really</i> need to get some stuff taken care of as soon as possible.\"  Eric got up and let Laura out while looking quizzically at the dollar in his hand.  \"I mean it,\" Laura said pointing back at him as she began heading towards the exit, \"call me.  I let you be smooth with your bus pass remember?  Let me pay you back.\" Eric laughed and waved as she stepped off the bus, making sure she gave Eric a good look at her ass as she did so.  Her stomach fluttered both at the fact that she was acting uncharacteristically bold, but also because despite the fact he hadn't said so, she was certain he was going to call her.  She laughed as she realized he was waving at her from a window as the bus pulled away and Laura waved back while she mimed using a phone with her other hand.  \"He'll call,\" she told herself as she turned away from the bus and headed towards the mall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't dawdle with her shopping, she went straight to Victoria's secret and picked out two bras, one lacy unlined one and one of the extreme padded push up bras that was supposed to add two cups sizes.  Unsure of what size she needed exactly she grabbed both B and C cup bras.  Her first attempt at trying them on failed utterly because she had failed to take into account that the additional muscle she now had between her back, lats and pecs had added to her band size and the new bras were definitely too small.  She swapped them out for the proper size and tried again, once again cursing the strangely selective and unpredictable nature of her memory regarding her new life.  Just like the pale haired girl had implied, the B cup bras fit perfectly and Laura paused for a moment to regard how perfectly formed her new breasts were. The gentle slope of her breasts combined with the provocative angle of her plump nipples thrusting outward were mesmerizing and she gently cradled them, sighing with pleasure at the sensation.  Laura loved how she looked with the padded push up bra but for the moment went with the unlined bra.  While her breasts were definitely larger than their previous all but non-existent size they at least looked plausible in the unlined bra.  With the push up bra, anyone who knew her would be taken aback by the dramatic difference.  As it was now, it looked like she was wearing a push up bra and she grinned as she pulled her shirt back on and shook her hair out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paid for her purchases with almost the last of her cash and was debating whether or not she was going to spend the last of it on a bus ride home or call her sister for a ride when her phone buzzed with an incoming text.  She pulled her phone and checked to see who it was from.</span></div></div>",

She oddly felt as though she was taking a step over the edge of a cliff as she pushed the \"call\" button and the phone began ringing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at the point Laura was sure it was going to go to voicemail without being answered Vanessa finally picked up.  \"Hey sis, what's up?\"  It sounded like Vanessa was eating something and Laura's mind unconsciously categorized the substance as popcorn just from the sound.  \"Are you almost home?  Oh yea, you're on speaker with like,\"  Vanessa's voice paused for a beat, \"half the league?\"  a note of uncertainty turned the statement into a question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The league?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Vanessa paused again and it sounded like she was digging a piece of popcorn shell out of her teeth, \"raid night big gal, we need our tank.  I'm not going to be able to keep these squishy DPS afloat without someone taking the big hits for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" an indignant voice came across the line, Laura assumed from over Vanessa's computer speakers. \"Not all of us our squishy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, Death Angel, you're a total glass cannon,\" Laura found herself sniping back at the unseen voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when are you going to be home?  We'll be ready to get this party started in probably about ten minutes as long as you're here by then,\" Vanessa said, cutting off whatever retort Death Angel began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea...\" Laura said slowly, \"about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can see you from here,\" Vanessa said, cutting Laura off, \"keep it up babe, momma like.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Van, are you making Jason exercise while you watch?\"  Laura was incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to exercise anyway, may as well be where I can enjoy it,\" Laura could picture the shrug her sister was undoubtedly making even if she couldn't see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be done by the time you get here,\" Jason's voice cut into the conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed and started again.  \"About that...\" </span></div></div>",

She had tried to text Nikki, than when that didn't work she attempted to call her, still with no luck.  Laura was about to try again when she saw Vanessa pulling up near the bus stop.  Laura started to jog towards the car then stopped, both because she was startled at the unfamiliar bounce of her new chest and because Vanessa was getting out of the car.  \"You drive,\" Vanessa grunted as she walked around to the passenger side of the car, engrossed in her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's your friend and you'll have a better idea of where she might be and also because I'm busy.\"  Vanessa sat down and slammed the door shut behind herself with finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't even attempt to argue, she just slid into the drivers seat and began navigating out of the parking lot.  As she turned her head to check for traffic her eyes were inadvertently drawn to Vanessa's improbably large bust, which was dramatically separated and emphasized by the seat belt that vanished between the mounds of flesh.  Laura caught a glimpse of her sister's phone screen before she wriggled in her seat to slouch lower, blocking the view of the screen with her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura drove, admittedly with no real direction in mind while her brain mulled over the two issues she was currently facing.  How she was going to get her sister's phone away from her, and where she might find a friend she couldn't remember having.  Laura found herself dwelling more and more on Vanessa's phone, she had decided that trying to snag it the next time Vanessa charged it was probably her best bet when Vanessa interrupted her train of thought.  \"So where are we checking first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura opened her mouth expecting \"I don't know\" to come but instead she surprised herself, \"The first place I want to check is the old arcade where Nikki and I first met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a diner or something now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, \"yea, the arcade went out of business years ago but that's always kind of been an important landmark for us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you meet in the arcade first?  Before the accident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccident?  Laura felt nothing but confusion but somehow she continued to speak on autopilot.  \"OK miss technical, you're right, we didn't first meet in the arcade, it was on the street corner outside.\"  Laura turned to stick her tongue out at her sister and as she did so she tried to sneak a peek at her phone screen.  This time she got a look but it appeared to be nothing but lines of code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to ask Vanessa what she was working on when Vanessa pointed to the left without looking up from her screen.  \"Don't you need to turn here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cursed under her breath as she made the indicated turn.  The two rode in silence for the next couple of minutes until they arrived at what could only be what Laura now thought of as \"the old arcade diner.\"  Looking at it Laura could feel the ghosts of memories of how the building used to look, where her favorite machines had been.  Had this arcade existed in her \"real\" past?  She honestly wasn't sure.  Laura was surprised when Vanessa fell in step behind her as they walked to the front door.  \"I assumed you were going to wait in the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her head and slipped her phone into a holster on her belt.  \"No, if Greg is here looking for her we'd be better off together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you bring Jason if you were that worried?\"  Laura asked as she pushed her way through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa snorted.  \"I want to try to control this, not escalate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laura could ask Vanessa what she meant by that the girl behind the counter waved to her, \"Hey Laura, good to see you again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jackie,\" Laura found herself responding without thinking.  Laura made her way to the counter, passing by a man who had just paid.  Vanessa stayed in step behind Laura, crossing her arms under her breasts and glaring at the occupants of the sparsely filled diner.  \"You haven't seen Nikki tonight have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry, haven't seen her since the last time you two were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud smacking sound caused Laura to turn away from her conversation and she looked with surprise at Vanessa and the stranger who had just finished paying for his food.  He was frozen in shock, his hand inches away from groping Vanessa's butt-cheek and her hand had obviously intercepted his.  Vanessa jerked her hand back with a growl.  \"Try it again and you'll regret it.  Even if you do manage to touch me I promise you it won't be worth it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't even realize she had clenched her fists and was standing on the balls of her feet, ready to throw punches if Vanessa needed her help.  \"Hey, don't be harassing my customers,\" Jackie interjected.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man slowly raised his hands as though in surrender and backed slowly away, \"Sorry darlin,\" he drawled, though the way he leered at Vanessa as he said it made it obvious he was only sorry he had gotten caught before he got a handful of her backside.  Vanessa sneered in his direction then purposefully turned her back on him.  Laura waited until he was well on his way towards the door before she relaxed.  She unclenched her fists and turned back to Jackie to thank her for her time when an ear splitting howl rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to see Vanessa side stepping improbably fast as the stranger stumbled forward, his wrist firmly in Vanessa's grip.  \"I fucking warned you,\" Vanessa growled as she jerked his arm behind his back and then upward, using her strength and his momentum to make something in his arm pop loudly.  The man spun forward, his face impacting the corner of the counter with a resounding crash.  Still holding his wrist behind his back Vanessa propelled him to the floor.  He landed heavily on his stomach, gasping as Vanessa drove the air from his lungs.  She set a knee firmly on his back and settled her weight onto him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" the man gasped for breath as everyone in the diner turned to see what was going on.  \"You broke my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't break anything,\" Vanessa barked.  \"Probably....  Your elbow is most likely dislocated, not broken, and your nose is cartilage, not bone.\"  Any reply the man may have had was cut off as Vanessa roughly drove the air out of his lungs again as she used his back as leverage to regain a standing position.  \"So if you get medical attention fast before things really start to swell this will be relatively easy to fix.  And you didn't even get a feel, so I doubt this worth it for you,\" Vanessa turned towards Laura, \"I'll be outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry,\" Laura began apologizing to Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not your fault,\" Jackie waved Laura towards the door.  \"But you probably don't want to be here if he decides to call the police or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was dumbfounded by this turn of events and the relative nonchalance everyone else seemed to have but she woodenly thanked Jackie and numbly left the diner.  She wasn't even surprised to see that Vanessa was already waiting in the passenger seat of the car, nose buried in her phone.  \"So that didn't work out,\" Vanessa said in what felt like a huge understatement to Laura.  \"Where's our next stop?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura gasped audibly, both at the sight of her new body and the simultaneous flashes of memories that seemed to be spontaneously connecting themselves in relation to how she had achieved it.  Laura could still see the framework of the painfully skinny girl she had once been under this new body but everywhere possible she had packed on muscle to provide the curves that generous genetics had not.  Her wide shoulders along with her muscular legs and hips gave the illusion of an hour glass figure and she had meticulously shaped her stomach for strength and definition without making it any thicker, instead etching out insanely powerful and prominent abs.  She had a flash of memory where Greg was guiding her through an ab routine and she realized that Jason's relationship with both Vanessa and Greg had served as a bridge of sorts between herself and her brother.  She experienced a rush of memories of the three of them working out together.  Mixed into those memories were some with Vanessa temporarily joining them in the gym and Laura experienced almost overwhelming feelings of love and kinship with Vanessa who had at least tried out something that everyone else she was close to was enjoying even if she didn't particularly like it herself.  Laura also felt herself almost tear up at the thought that she had become so close with Greg who had seemed like a distant and almost mythical figure to her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to survey her ass in the mirror and gasped out loud, she never would have imagined she could possess an ass this spectacular.  A moment of groping and slapping revealed it was composed pretty much entirely of muscle and it evoked memories of grueling exercise and extensive research on how to best shape it.  Her body literally quivered at the memories of time spent at the squat rack and she licked her lips in anticipation of doing more of the same later today.  \"Damn right I talk about my ass every day,\" she told her smirking reflection.  \"This thing is fucking perfect.\"  She giggled and mimed the \"just right\" meme like her sister had done earlier while giving her ass a smack that was hard enough to make her hand sting.  Otherwise she barely felt it and this made her laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun slowly around, regarding her body from every angle and reveling in how thick and powerful her arms were, practically drooling at how the muscular curves of her legs flowed from her sleek and strong thighs, narrowed to her knees and then flared out into thick and amazingly defined calves.  She alternated between doing calve raises to see them explode into diamond shaped slabs of muscles and flexing her biceps to see the peaks raise to heights she would have previously thought impossible for a female, much less her.  Laura had a momentary, internal, question of how thick her arms were which was quickly overridden by her own voice whispering the stats as though on autopilot, \"nearly eighteen inches, and I'll be past eighteen inches in a few weeks at this rate.\"  She flexed hard and felt her own bicep, her knees practically shook with ecstasy at how hard it was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed she was wearing well applied makeup that accentuated her good features like her cheekbones, the new \"memories\" came to her more easier all the time and of course Vanessa had coached her on makeup technique, it was on of her sisters passions.  Laura smiled, glad that she had benefited after all from not removing her sisters interests in makeup and hair.  Speaking of hair, Laura noted that her hair was now much longer than she normally kept it and that she apparently opted to dye it from her mousy brown to a shade of blonde that was very similar to Vanessa's natural hair color.  \"I wonder why she decided to go with the whole mall goth look,\" Laura mused before her new grasp of things like complexion and contrast theory that she now apparently had access to answered her own question for her.  \"Because she hardly ever goes outside anymore so her skin is naturally much paler, this makes the most of her new complexion.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing how dramatic the effect that just changing Vanessa had made on Laura's entire reality.  It was practically perfect in every way she could have imagined.  \"Practically,\" she murmured to herself thinking again of Jason's obviously prodigious penis and his own rock hard and god-like body.  Why hadn't she ended up with Jason instead, she wondered.  Some memory seemed to be in the process of forming when her thoughts were interrupted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Lu,\" Vanessa's voice carried from the living room.  \"I swear if you're wasting time posing in that damn mirror again I'm going to break it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hastily flushed the toilet in an attempt to try and salvage the apparently ineffectual charade of her having to use the restroom.  She couldn't help but fire off one more double bicep pose in the mirror before she flicked off the light and left the bathroom while her mind once again turning to Jason and Vanessa as a couple.  Should she try to find where she had left her phone and \"fix\" things so her and Jason were an item together instead of Vanessa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious Lu, get your perfect ass over here,\" Laura could hear Jason laughing in response to Vanessa's good natured grouching.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Laura left the bathroom she laughed to herself noticing for the first time that her walk had changed. Her gait had widened slightly to accommodate her thicker thighs, though they still rubbed together with each step and she found herself standing with her arms slightly away from her torso accentuating her broad chest and shoulders. She also felt altogether different as well and recognized the feeling for what it was: power. Strength like she'd never felt before coursed through her body. It was amazing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nReturning to the living room Laura found that Vanessa and Jason were missing. Before she could begin to question where they had vanished to Vanessa's head popped up from behind the couch, rising as if she were on an elevator. Vanessa giggled then descended vanishing again. A second later her head reappeared then dropped out of sight. Confused, Laura approached the couch that was blocking her view so she could see what was going on. She found Jason on the floor doing pushups with Vanessa seated on his back. Vanessa continued to giggle with each up and down motion like a child on a carnival ride. At the end of each motion Vanessa's body jiggled wildly, her expanded curves sloshing around like jelly. Laura's heart jumped when, upon closer inspection, she spotted that Jason was performing his pushups one-handed. The smoothness at which he lifted their combined several hundred pounds spoke of incredible strength. After a few reps he switched arms and continued at the exact same pace, steady and graceful.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What am I up to?\" Jason asked. Even his voice was even, unstrained. Like he was just standing around shooting the shit with his pals.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Tiger, getting tire?\" Vanessa winked at Laura as if they shared some secret though Laura could think of none and nothing was coming from that strange source that had been filling in her memories.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Baby, I could do this all day. You were the one that was in a hurry to get back to the game.\" He switched hands again and kept right on going.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this is fun too.\" She looked down at her breasts and watched them shake at the top of Jason's pushup. \"I think you're somewhere around forty.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJason began counting his reps out loud starting at 1.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I said you were at forty!\" Vanessa said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSwitching hands Jason stopped his count for a moment but kept on pumping. \"I know, but I don't want there to be any chance of you welching on the bet.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAgain Jason began calling out his pushups beginning at 1 and counted them loudly all the way to 50. When he kept going Vanessa threw her hands in the air. \"Okay, okay, you win. You can stop now.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two of them stood. Jason's face was slightly pink but he didn't seem to be sweating or even breathing heavily. Laura wondered if he couldn't actually do that all day.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nVanessa turned her back to him and folded her arms under her titanic bust straining her tight shirt obscenely. \"One of these days I'll win. I'll find something that you can't do.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJason grinned. \"Not as long as you continue to underestimate my power, Obi-Wan.\" He raised his arms to the ceiling, bent slightly with his hands open as if he were catching lightning bolts. He flexed and Laura actually gasped. It wasn't just his size, though that continued to be startling for her, but just how insanely cut he was; there didn't seem to be an ounce of fat on his body anywhere. The grooves around the base of his biceps were so deep it looked like someone could just walk right up and pluck them right off the tops of his arms. Laura felt a heat welling in the pit of her stomach that was spreading down to the space between her legs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I know,\" Vanessa said turning back to her boyfriend. \"How about you go try to bench press my car?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJason laughed. \"No bet. You know I'm not that strong. But\u2026,\" he trailed off. Then he looked at Laura, \"You never know, right? As long as Laura over here keeps putting her mind into her muscle then maybe someday we will be bench pressing cars.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nVanessa purred and leapt at Jason pawing his thick pecs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What did you win?\" Laura asked trying to pull her mind away from Jason's incredible body and the need to be the one feeling him up instead of Vanessa. \"What was the bet?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"The usual.\" Jason said almost dismissively. Once again he was sending his hand under Vanessa's tiny skirt to squeeze her soft ass, and this time she didn't swat him away.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nVanessa turned her head and smiled at her sister, it was a strange smile both happy and annoyed somehow. \"That means I owe him a blowjob.\" Laura's eyes dropped down to Jason's incredible package and she thought to herself: <i>I'd give him a blowjob</i>. Then that memory, the one that had been coming to her in the bathroom, began to  surface again. Something about her and Jason, something about a relationship or the lack of one. It was close, Laura eased her mind to let it come but-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"C'mon, I'm sick of waiting. Lets get back to some good old fashioned space combat.\" Vanessa said returning to the couch and picking up a controller. Laura's thoughts were once again dashed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura and Jason sat down on either side of her squeezing her between their big bodies and they resumed playing. Laura wasn't too familiar with the game but she found herself naturally working the controller as if she'd played for years. In fact, the less she thought about it the more her instincts, the ones from this universe, would take over. This gave Laura the chance to ponder her current situation. She desperately wanted Jason for herself and she meant to have him. She felt bad for taking this from her sister but Vanessa had never had a problem getting guys. And that would likely remain true given her insane curves. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo that was it then, simple.<i> I'll just alter Jason's profile so that he's always been in love with me instead of Vanessa. Oh shit, no! That won't work. His love of Vanessa and her love of bodybuilders is what made him big. And him being big is what made me big too. I don't want that to change. </i>She realized that this was going to be complicated especially since just a few simple personality changes to Vanessa alone had altered each of their lives so greatly. So what to do?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe trio continued playing games for two hours, the whole time Laura loving the camaraderie with her sister and her best friend. It made her a little angry at herself for wanting to change things but still\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFinally Jason stood and stretched. \"Okay, Ness, that's it for us. Lu, you ready to hit the gym?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Laura stood. Then without thinking added, \"Let me just grab my bag.\" She wandered down the hall to her room and picked up the already packed duffle by her dresser. She glanced over to her bed and spotted her iPhone. She felt that they typically left her phone at home during workouts, that time was all about building muscle and no distractions. But this time was different. Her phone was magical and she wanted to use it. Perhaps it was better to continue to think about what she would do, though.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The app really was magical and she could have it all and have it right this second. She took a step towards the bed and reached out her arm then stopped. She looked down at the thick forearm and even thicker bicep.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So much changed with just one little personality edit. I will have my dreams but it's going to take some planning. Things got better this time but they could get much worse very easily if I don't think this through.\" She nodded but still hesitated looking longingly at the phone. Finally she spun on her heels and left the room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJason was already outside getting into a pickup truck that Laura didn't recognize. A moment later her memories filled in: Jason had owned the truck for over a year, she had even helped him pick it out. This memory was fun but also scary. She never knew when it was going to work or how much she was going to learn but she supposed there was nothing to be done about it except go with the flow and trust that she would be fine.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura jogged over to the passenger side of the truck and climbed in. Jason pulled out and the two rode in silence for a few minutes. Laura realized that it was good that Jason was driving because she didn't actually know where they were going. This city was a major haven for bodybuilders and there were gyms all over the place. Which one did Jason mean when he talked about the gym. Laura began to have that familiar sensation of memories about to reveal themselves when she was interrupted by Jason.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Does it bother you when Vanessa and I get\u2026 I don't know\u2026 sexual?\" he asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I mean you see me grabbing her, she talks about giving me a blowjob. I just wanted to make sure it doesn't bother you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Jase, I'm fine. You and Van have been all over each other like that forever. Why would it bother me?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJason sighed. \"Yeah, I just wanted to make sure things were still cool since, well you know.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura didn't, and her brain wasn't downloading any new information either. They sat in silence once more with Laura trying to find the doorway in her mind that could give her the answers that would let her feel more comfortable in this reality. Then she ran her hands down her bulging thighs and squeezed her quads and reminded herself how good she had it right now. The memories would come, and even if they didn't she had the phone to help her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura felt her heart begin pounding in her chest as they pulled into the gym parking lot. Holy shit! We work out at Mount Olympus?!? Of all the gyms in town none were more elite or prestigious than Mount Olympus. As the name suggested it was the place where you went to train for the top competitions in the world, especially the Mr. Olympia. They wouldn't even let you in the door if you weren't a pro or about to earn your pro card. Laura had listened to her brother opine for years about how he would have truly made it as a bodybuilder the day he was allowed into Mount Olympus.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura followed Jason in and found that instead of a reception desk there were a pair of bouncers, enormous men standing shoulder to shoulder, watching over the doors. One of them nodded at her as she approached, tacit approval that she was buff enough to enter. Once inside Laura took in the giant room as well as the giant clientele. There weren't as many people there as she would have expected, maybe slightly over two dozen, but each and every one of them was among musclebound to an extreme degree. With a sense of pride Laura noticed that of the 8 or 10 women in the gym she was probably the biggest.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJason checked his watch. \"Greg should be finishing up with Andy any  minute now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy?\" Laura asked without even thinking that perhaps she shouldn't.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's the new posing coach ever since Zach quit.\" he said. \"He's really good. Helped me a lot, that's for sure. Why don't you stow your stuff and we'll all meet by the back.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura nodded and headed to the women's locker room to put her bag away. The hall leading to the locker room was painted with hyper-muscular caricatures of Greek gods and goddesses and the theme continued in the actual room itself with stone pillars and olive branches painted along the walls above the lockers. In the center of the room was a huge plaster statue with a plaque that identified it as the Greek goddess Nike, goddess of victory and strength. Nike wore a robe that was hardly covering her body at all and showed that she, just like the paintings in the hall, was impossibly muscular.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura locked up her duffle then looked around to get her bearings. She found a door that lead to the showers and beyond that the bathroom. Another door, though, led to a very bright room with mirrors covering every wall. Stepping inside Laura found a woman who looked like a middleweight bodybuilder posing and flexing for her reflection. The woman must have been finished because she turned to leave giving Laura an appraising look and a smile.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You look incredible,\" the woman told Laura.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShocked she could hardly respond. \"Oh! Uh\u2026 thanks. Um, so do you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura was left alone in the posing room and she walked about watching her reflection closely enjoying the movement of her beefy legs and the sway of her wide shoulders. She spotted something strange on the mirrors and approached to get a better look. She found that every 15 feet or so the mirror was superimposed with a silhouette of a former winner of the Ms. Olympia title. At the moment Laura stood behind the outline of Iris Kyle and while the silhouette was taller than she was by a few inches Laura noticed that she had the same level of muscle mass and nearly identical measurements. Laura raised her arms and mimicked the double bicep pose that was outlined before her and beamed when she saw her arms swell slightly bigger than Ms. Olympia's.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly a voice startled her from behind. \"You know she won more Olympia's than any other woman ever, right? And you're just as buff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura turned and found a tall, beautiful girl standing in the doorway leading back to the lockers. She looked out of place but only because she was clearly not dressed for they gym. She wore a black suit with a white button up shirt and form fitting pants that ended a few inches above her ankle. The girl was tall, especially since she wore shiny black 4 inch heels. Laura guessed that between the shoes and her incredibly long legs the girl stood 5' 11 or maybe even 6'. She had a thick mane of gorgeous red hair that spilled down over her shoulders which made her brilliant green eyes pop. The girl's face was very pretty and made even more so by an incredible smile that even made Laura's stomach flutter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStrangely, the girl look bereft of confidence and actually looked down at the floor almost ashamed. \"I mean, of course, I know you know that. Iris Kyle, the winningest Ms. Olympia ever before they discontinued holding the event. I just can't get over the work you've done and how incredible your body is.\" She pointed around the room at the various silhouettes on the mirrored walls. \"Lenda Murray, Kim Chizevsky, Juliette Bergmann, Cory Everson, Valentina Chepiga, you've got them all beat.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura's head was spinning. She was familiar with the names that were being rattled off, she'd followed the sport through her brother even though he tended to focus much more heavily on the men's division, but to think that someone could compare her to a list of bodybuilding champions was insane. Laura's natural introverted nature kicked in, \"Well, I'm alright.\" But when she turned back to the mirror and compared herself to the outline once again she recognized that her dimensions were nearly identical to the 10 time Ms. Olympia and on a frame that was shorter, no less. Laura's shyness faded a bit and was replaced with pride.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe girl entered the room and walked up behind Laura, towering over the muscular girl. \"I mean it. And now that they're finally letting women back into the Olympia you're a shoe in to be the next champion.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura was about to speak when she was cut off.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I know, I know, the statuesque redhead said. \"You keep telling me not to get my hopes up because the industry has finally changed and started to accept bigger, more muscular women so lots of girls are bigger than they used to be. But you're only 19 years old and look at you! Your brain has done so many wonders for your brawn and you're only getting started. I know it! And, no, this isn't just me being your assistant and pumping up your ego. I'm your friend and I truly believe in you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura couldn't help but smile at the kind words but she felt frustration that this woman who was apparently a friend was still a mystery to her. She didn't even know the girl's name.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Now come on,\" the mystery woman spun and began walked for the door, her high heels clacking on the hard floor. \"Everyone is waiting for you.\" As she walked away Laura was treated to the sight of the second most spectacular ass she'd seen in her life. The tight pants looked ready to split over the perfectly bulbous behind and Laura even did a quick check in the mirror to remind herself that her own butt was better.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura followed her friend back out to the main gym. As they walked Laura's assistant turned and smiled. \"I almost forgot, I have great news. Your Instagram followers passed 50 thousand today. You're really putting together a strong group of fans.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"50 thousand!\" Laura didn't know what to say. A common theme on the day.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA moment later they arrived at the back of the gym and joined Jason who was standing next to a monster that Laura finally realized was her brother Greg. The Greg that she was used to was around 230 pounds at his biggest, this beast, however, was probably over 300 pounds at least. It was clear by the layer of fat coating his giant muscles that Greg was deep into a bulking phase and that he would definitely shrink down once he dieted. Even when he did, though, he would be leaps and bounds bigger than the brother she was used to.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSomething about that struck Laura as strange, though. Greg had always been a fanatic when it came to muscle building so why should he be any bigger now than before? What else changed when Vanessa became a homebody and Jason and Laura had become jocks?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere was a tiny blonde girl hanging onto Greg (tiny in stature only, her physique was very impressive) that Laura recognized as Greg's girlfriend Sara. While Sara's body had been altered much like everyone else's Sara perhaps had changed the least. She had always been a hardbody but now she had gained perhaps 20 pounds of muscle crossing the gap between fitness model into bodybuilder territory.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSara grinned, \"Thank god you found her, Nikki. Once Laura starts staring at herself in the mirror almost nothing can rip her away.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNikki. Was that the redhead's name? The tide of memories that had been so constant the past few hours had ebbed and nothing new was coming. Laura grew frustrated and more lost.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Enough chit chat,\" Greg said in a voice that was a full octave lower than normal, \"we need to get to work.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura nodded hoping she would be able to keep up.</span></div></div>",

Then he gave them orders for what he expected from them, it was arm and shoulder day and he told them each where to start their workouts. Laura was suddenly terrified, she had no idea what she was doing or what she should do. Greg had pointed at some crazy big hand weights so she knew she was supposed to pick them up, but what then?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe looked at Nikki and saw that she had removed her suit jacket and rolled up the sleeves of her blouse to her elbows. The girl had slender but substantially ripped forearms with prominent veins spiderwebbing on all sides. Nikki was holding a camera up ready to snap pictures of Laura as she went through her workout. Perhaps for her social media accounts or maybe even a personal website. When Nikki raised the camera Laura could see the sleeves of her shirt pull taut around some decent biceps. Glancing down Laura realized for the first time that Nikki's pants weren\u2019t just tight because they were cut to fit that way but because this girl had some plump quads filling in all the available space. As long and as developed as those legs are they must be quite the sight to see in the flesh. Laura thought to herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura shook her head. She was getting distracted. She turned back to the weights feeling panic rise even further, any moment now she would go running from the building. It didn't matter that she was, if Nikki was to be believed, in the running to win bodybuilding contests she didn't know the first thing about exercising. With a sigh she reached for the weights that Greg had told her to start with. The instant her hands closed around them it was like a bomb went off in her head. Memories were flooding her mind going all the way back to when she was sixteen and scrawny like she'd been before she'd found the app. She could remember some girls at school picking on her until she cried and confiding in her brother who suggested that she start working out. She could remember the first few weeks of struggles which became months of hard sessions and slow gains. She remembered how incredible she'd felt once she realized that she really was getting stronger, that her body had been changing. Pieces from the last 3 years of the life she never lived fell into her mind and suddenly she knew exactly how to perform the exercise Greg had asked her to do. Hell, she knew how to do it better than he did because she had treated bodybuilding like a science. She crafted her own supplements, she tweaked exercises for maximum effect and even invented her own, she'd even enlisted Jason's help though even his mind couldn't keep up with hers when it came to building muscle. Still he reaped the benefits all the same.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWithout a word Laura launched into her routine like a woman possessed. Damn right she could take on top level female bodybuilders, she was like no one else in the world. Laura smiled as she pumped more weight in each hand than she'd ever lifted in her life. She'd remembered something else too: she was on the verge of a breakthrough that would catapult her to the forefront of the bodybuilding world. Her goal all along wasn't just to dominate the women's field but to be the first woman ever to go toe to toe with the men and put them in their place. She didn't know what it was that she had up her sleeve, her memories hadn't filled in those details just yet, but she was confident that they would. Besides, she had the app on her phone to help if she needed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGreg moved around and stood behind Nikki as she snapped photos. \"Make sure you get some shots tight on her face, people need to see that look in her eye. That's fucking fierce. That's where her real strength comes from.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNikki smiled and moved in to comply. Before taking any pictures she stared into Laura's eyes seeing the determination and passion within her. She could feel the energy radiating off of Laura and it sent goosebumps up her arms. Shaking the cobwebs out she resumed her duties as photographer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwo hours later Laura came back to herself. It was as if she'd been in another world watching her own body on autopilot. Now she found herself naked in the shower with cool water dousing her sweaty body. A look down showed her insanely pumped arms and shoulders with skin to tight and thin it looked ready to split open. She ran her hands over the skin of her chest and arms basking in the afterglow of an intense workout.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"If only I'd known how amazing this felt I'd have started working out way sooner.\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura leaned forward and let the water run over her face as a way of verifying that she wasn't dreaming. Before she drifted too far, though, she was surprised by a clicking sound behind her. She opened her eyes and turned to find Nikki once again snapping photos.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe tall redhead lowered the camera and shrugged, \"I know, I know, you prefer to pose to really show off your body but your fans like the candid shots too, you know?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura was a bit mortified. She'd never in her life dreamed she'd be posing for nude pictures. \"Do you think this is the best time?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNikki looked confused. \"I'm just doing what you always ask. You said the best time for pictures is right after a workout when you're the most pumped.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe confidence Laura had gained with the memories of her development vanished. Once again she was on her heels, betrayed by her other self. \"Uh\u2026 right. Sorry, you just caught me daydreaming.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNikki laughed. \"No problem. I've got my head in the clouds pretty much all the time. Now say beefcake!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaura held one arm across her chest to hide her nipples while she flexed her other arm. Her engorged bicep rose into a fantastic peak that made her lower her inhibitions somewhat. She turned her hips to hide obscure her crotch and went up on her toes flexing her calves and quads for all she was worth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Nikki shouted. She talked Laura through a quick model session snapping photos like crazy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>This day has been insane,</i> Laura thought,<i> what else could possibly happen?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the same time, though, it didn't seem right to just change them without asking. She'd never forgive herself if she caused harm to Jason or Samantha all because she wanted to keep herself safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura exited the Alterations app and called Samantha's phone. She watched from the balcony as Sam pulled her phone out of her pocket then glanced back at Laura's house and waved while she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Samantha was probably annoyed that Laura was interrupting her time with Jason but her voice sounded excited to hear from her nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam!\" Laura replied. \"I was wondering if you guys would be willing to come over. I found something interesting I wanted to share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. We'll be up there in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura returned to her room and paced around waiting for her friends to arrive. Once they did she explained everything about the mysterious app and what it claimed to be able to do. Of course she left out just how close she had come to experimenting on them without their permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it probably doesn't do a thing,\" Laura told them, \"but the fact that it identified me then you and even people way up the beach is at least intriguing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Samantha were silent for a long time. Finally Jason said, \"Well, are we going to try it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"But who do we try it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura decided to leave it up to chance. It was only fair to include herself in the running to be altered. She reached into a drawer that contained her old Dungeons and Dragons supplies and pulled out a six sided die. \"Okay, Jason you're one and two. Sam you get three and four. I'll take five and six. Whatever number comes up is the one that will go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Samantha agreed. Then Laura took a deep breath and tossed the die high into the air spinning it wildly. It landed on the floor and rolled finally coming to a stop by Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's it going to be?\" Jason asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sam, it landed on four.\" Laura said looking at her Asian friend. Samantha was short and stocky but that was soon to change. Or at least Laura hoped it would. She opened up the Alterations app and navigated to Samantha's profile. A 3D rendering of Samantha clad in her pink sweats and jacket filled the screen and along the side were various bits of data, sliders, and menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want me to change?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha opened her mouth to speak but her words caught in her throat. Then she blushed bright red. \"Um, Jason? Would you be willing to wait outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked confused but then shrugged and left to go watch TV in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were alone Samantha sighed. \"Okay, first of all I'm sick of being so short. Can you make me taller, like five foot eight or nine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded and began tapping on her phone's screen. She was surprised to see that as she made Sam nearly a foot taller her clothes stretched out as well keeping her body properly covered. The outfit did change a little, though, she saw as it became a little more form fitting which allowed her to see that Samantha's weight was now more evenly spread out across her taller body giving her a more slender figure. Playing around further Laura discovered that she could adjust Samantha's torso to leg ratio giving her longer legs without adjusting her height further. Once she took her finger off the screen the image of Samantha blinked for a moment then her sweatpants changed into tiny pink shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tilted her head to the side. <i>I wonder why her clothes changed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Samantha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I've got your height dialed in at five foot nine with legs that go all the way up. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some boobs, I guess,\" she said putting her hands on her chest. \"Nothing too big. Maybe like a C cup or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Laura made the change on the screen plumping Samantha's avatar's chest up a bit. Just like before there was a quick update to her outfit. The jacket vanished and her sweatshirt was replaced with a tight t-shirt that outlined her new bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good,\" Laura said. \"What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Samantha blushed again, this time even brighter than before. \"You know how I feel about Jason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you aware of how he feels about girls with... muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head. \"Muscles? I don't think it's ever come up but with all the meatheads in this town it's not too surprising. You want me to beef you up, girl? Make his head turn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well... yeah, big. I mean, not too big but like obvious. Strong, you know? Sexy, I want-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Sam. I'll make sure you'll leave Jason drooling. I just want to be sure that this is what you want, not just something he wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough for me.\" Laura began adjusting the muscle sliders watching as Samantha's body expanded on her phone. She increased her friend's physique little by little watching as muscles developed across her entire form. Her shoulders and chest swelled out while her arms plumped. At the same time her thighs and calves grew at an accelerated rate compared to the rest of her. Laura stopped when Samantha's impending body crossed the divide between athletic and bodybuilder. The readouts told her that Samantha's chest would now measure 38 inches around with 16 inch arms and 25 inch thighs. Her body fat levels were so low that individual strips of sinew were clearly visible giving her an incredibly shredded look. Just like earlier there was another quick update to the avatar's clothes which removed the sleeves from her shirt and pulled the hem up exposing a deeply defined six pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, did you want to take a look at what we have here before I finalize everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was about to take Laura's phone but then reconsidered and backed away. \"No, I'd better not. I might panic and back out. Better if you just do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the boss.\" Laura tapped a button labeled \"Apply Changes\" and suddenly felt a buzz of electricity crackly through the air. She was about to announce that it seemed to be working when she found herself unable to move. In fact everything around her seemed frozen as well as if time itself had ceased to move. A few moments later Laura could see Samantha's body changing. She grew in all directions at once getting taller, thicker, wider, and bigger by the second. Despite being frozen excitement rushed through her mind now that she realized that the phone actually worked just as it said it did. This was incredible, her life would never be the same again. She could have anything and everything she ever wanted!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samantha's body mirrored the once on her phone her clothes morphed into her new super tight shorts and shirt. Laura marveled at how incredible her friend looked. She even noticed other subtle changes that she hadn't made like Samantha's jet hair was fuller and shinier than before while her face had a new thin layer of make-up despite the fact that she rarely every applied any. She also noticed several additional ear piercings all along Samantha's earlobe and what looked to be a hint of a tattoo on her side just barely poking out beneath her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later the energy that filled the room seemed to dissipate and Laura was able to move again. At the same time Samantha looked down and gave her arms a cursory flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura couldn't help but gush. \"Oh my god, you look incredible!! How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked at Laura and said...</span></div></div>",

The Asian amazon frowned, \"I feel the same. I guess it doesn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, you're totally different!\" Laura shouted. How could Samantha think she was the same after such a drastic transformation? \"I mean look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Samantha could respond there was a knock at the door. \"Can I come in?\" It was Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Samantha called. \"But don't get your hopes up. It looks like this whole thing was a bust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Jason entered. Laura expected him to back up her claim that Samantha had just changed from short and stout to tall and built but she could see on his face right away that her new appearance was old news to him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell is going on?</i> Laura thought to herself. Then she spotted her dresser which had about two dozen photographs taped all around the outside of the mirror. There was one with her and Samantha on the beach, knee deep in the surf, hugging and laughing except it was the new Samantha that was pictured, the one that stood several inches taller than Laura and more than a few pounds heavier. In fact now that she looked around Laura noticed that all of the pictures featuring Samantha had changed to feature the new version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't work, huh?\" Jason said standing in front of Samantha and putting his hands on her shoulders. He gave a squeeze then moved down to her biceps and squeezed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Samantha flexed her arms fighting back against Jason's grip. \"I guess you're stuck with me looking like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I love you looking like this.\" Jason put his hand into the waistband of Samantha's skintight shorts and pulled her towards him. Their bodies collided and they began kissing while Jason's hands grabbed fistfuls of her copious rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was smart enough to figure out that the phone must have altered history right along with Samantha's body to account for the changes. This was even better than she could have imagined, she could make whatever change she wanted and the past would go right along with it. She wouldn't have to explain it to anyone as it would just be normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason and Samantha continued to make out right in front of her (clearly they were a couple in this reality) Laura noticed that Samantha wasn't the only one who had changed. Jason's clothes had transformed from an overly baggy pants and shirt to a much more properly fitted pair of shorts and a t-shirt, and Jason's muscles had grown as well. Not by very much and he was still pretty skinny but Laura could see some slight development in his calves and his arms. Plus she thought they way his shoulders filled out his shirt was pretty impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever historical change got Samantha to be a bodybuilder must have put Jason in the gym along with her, at least a little. Her attention drifted back to the jumble of photographs looking for further clues. Instead she happened upon a picture of herself in a skimpy bikini. She had to try very hard to keep her jaw from hitting the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sexy!</i> She too was different, more muscular. Her stomach in the photo was etched in tight abdominal muscles while her legs were shapely with plump thighs and bulging calves. Her upper body was still lacking in breast tissue but had beefed up enough to amplify her hourglass figure. She had to admit it, she looked really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's hand drifted to her stomach where her fingers found hard bumps beneath her shirt. Her heart leapt with excitement. She discreetly curled her arm and felt the surprisingly large and quite hard bump that formed. This was all too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha and Jason ended their embrace. \"C'mon baby,\" Samantha told Jason, \"looks like I'll have to grow my muscles the old fashioned way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \"Sorry to run, Laura, but we've fallen behind on Sam's Instagram feed. We're going to hit the gym to get some new photos to upload. Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll meet you there later.\" Laura said. \"There's something I want to work on first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy couple said their goodbyes and left at which point Laura went straight back to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT WORKS!!\" Her mind raced with the possibilities. Now that she knew it would also change the past she could do whatever she wanted. But she also knew she should remain cautions since she didn't seem to have control over how the past was changed. Maybe another test was in order.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that she was alone Laura took off her shirt and stood before the mirror above her dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" She looked even better than the picture on her wall would suggest. Six perfectly cut stones lined her stomach, her shoulders were broad and strong, her chest had a faint line bisecting her pectorals. She pressed her palms against her nipples and frowned, she would have liked to have some breasts too but all in good time. Her smile returned when she raised her arms and flexed her biceps. Small but mighty rocks hardened beneath her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would have thought that just a few changes to one person could affect so much? I wonder what else has changed.\" Laura pulled her shirt back on and looked around her room. Most everything seemed to be about the same, same geeky posters, same video games, even the same mess of clothes on the floor. However when she looked closer there seemed to be a few interesting additions: a pair of free weights on the floor by her bed, workout clothes mixed among her dirty clothes, even a tub of protein powder in the corner by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable!\" Laura scooped up her phone and opened her own profile and was greeted by her new body. She was just about to set to work modifying herself when but she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and steadied her shaking hands. \"This could cause some more crazy ripples. Perhaps I need to be scientific and run another test.\" She desperately wanted to push her body beyond the sexy goddess that Samantha had become but she also knew that lustful frenzy could be her undoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sat on her bed at a loss for what to do. She almost didn't trust herself to even make a good decision, her desires could too easily get in her own way. That's when she spotted the die on the floor right where it had landed before Samantha's transformation. Laura picked it up and thought about how strange it was that some things in this reality remained the same while others had changed. She sort of wished she had some way of accessing more of the past here but then she thought the might lose touch with the changes. Sure Samantha was happy with her body but she wasn't as over the moon as she would be if she could remember how short and stubby she'd been just a little while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tossed the die into the air and watched it fall to the floor and roll. It stopped with a single pip on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jason. You win this round.\" Laura opened Jason's profile and was greeted with his new and slightly improved body. \"I wonder if there's a way to figure out what he would want to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began searching through menus taking time to look over the various features of the app. She eventually came upon a menu that listed various components of Jason's mind including his likes and desires. Though she felt a little like she was prying where she didn't belong Laura dug through Jason's mind, fascinated by what she found. First and foremost she discovered that Samantha had been right: Jason liked muscular women. In fact it seemed that for Jason the bigger the better even up to and beyond what was humanly possible. Similarly he liked huge boobs and super strength. There were lots of other things on the list but they all seemed more normal like \"scalp rub,\" \"legs,\" even \"blow job\" but scattered throughout were \"bodybuilding,\" \"muscle growth,\" and \"penis growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned, \"I have to say I love your kink, Jason.\" She found a list of Jason's relationships and was not surprised to find that Samantha was right at the top next to the words \"intense sexual desire\" and \"girlfriend.\" Just below Samantha was Laura's sister Vanessa who was listed as \"sexual fantasy\" and \"crush.\" Surprisingly Laura even found her own name on the list as \"sexual desire\" among many other names she didn't recognize like Wendy Lindquist and Shannon Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a tab marked \"body image\" Laura found that even though he was a bit more developed Jason still was not pleased with the way he looked. He considered himself too skinny and wished he could bulk up significantly. He was rather proud of his penis which, Laura discovered, was an astounding ten inches long but he even wanted that to be bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura went back to the main page of Jason's profile and was just about to increase his muscle mass just as she had done for Samantha when she paused. Instead she tapped on a menu called \"aptitude\" and selected \"muscle growth.\" A scale appeared on the screen which showed Jason's natural ability to build muscle. The scale went from 0 to 100 with Jason's natural setting on 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder you're so skinny.\" Laura said. \"You must be working your ass off just to have as much muscle as you do in this reality.\" For reference she pulled up her brother's profile and found his aptitude for muscle growth was 51 which was listed as \"above average.\" She flipped back to Jason and began increasing his growth ability watching as the heading changed as the number rose. At 40 he was \"average,\" then \"above average\" like Greg, the 60s were \"top level athlete\" and the 70s were \"extreme.\" Laura stopped at 85 which was listed as \"superhuman growth ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is that too much? What if I went all the way? What's this going to do to him? Should I back up?</i> Questions swirled through Laura's mind. Before she could let any more doubt enter her thoughts she stabbed the \"Apply\" button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before the air crackled with electricity then she found herself frozen and unable to move. With no one too watch change Laura tried to focus on changes that were occurring around her as her room altered again but it seemed the changes were more extreme and hard to watch, everything was blurry and out of focus. Finally the energy faded and she was able to move again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first Laura thought something was wrong with her eyes since it was quite hard to see. She waited several seconds before realizing that the room was simply dark. Looking to her bedroom window she found that her blinds had been replaced with blackout curtains. She opened them enough to let a thick shaft of light in then returned to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Once again her body had transformed, this time much more dramatically than before. In fact she wasn't sure if she was happy with what she saw. To say she had bulked up was an understatement. Laura's body was enormous but no longer cut and defined she was now big like a powerlifter. Muscle and fat together made her look huge but also soft. She was reminded of her brother when he was going through his bulking phases complaining about how fat he would get after weeks of eating and eating all the time. She hoped that's what was going on here, that she was just in her offseason mode and that cutting calories would bring out the stark definition of the huge muscles that she knew were in there somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura raised an arm and flexed, the 14 inch rock she'd had minutes earlier was now replaced with a much bigger yet much softer-looking 20 inch monstrosity. She gave the muscle a squeeze with her free hand and found the layer of fat to be surprisingly thin and a boulder-like muscle lay just beneath. This gave her reassurance of her might and she found herself welling with power and strength. She tightened her fist and flexed harder causing the sleeve of her t-shirt to scream in protest against her ever swelling arm which drew her attention to her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt was shoddy and worn and far too small while her pants were so old and tight they had actually split in a few places succumbing to quads that looked like too much meat stuffed into a sausage casing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just her clothes that were unkempt, though, it was clear that in this universe Laura didn't really bother to take care of her own appearance much. The fact was that she never really did in her own reality but this was much worse: her hair was unwashed and hung down in greasy tangles, her skin was shiny with oil and there were patches of acne across her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned at her reflection. \"One step forward and a few steps back. Still, I'll bet I can do something with this.\" She thought to herself about how strange it was that she would change so dramatically after altering her friends but not herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thoughts of her friends, and Jason specifically, in the front of her mind Laura's attention was drawn directly to a collection of pictures and magazines in the corner of her room near her bed that seemed to be arranged into a shrine of sorts. The subject of this alter was a man of ungodly muscular development and size. He was impossibly large, each muscle group on his body was swollen to enormous size but none so much as his arms the peaks of which, when flexed, nearly spanned the length of his forearm and touched the fingers of his clenched fist. Laura approached the end table which held a large stack of muscle magazines and was surrounded by carefully cut and pasted pictures up and down the wall. It didn't take long to confirm her suspicions: it was Jason. His body was completely transformed but the face was unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura picked up the magazine that sat atop the pile and examined the cover. Jason was dressed in a toga that fit snug across his massive chest, keeping his shoulders and arms bare. He was surrounded by muscular women in skimpy string bikinis who pawed at his chest, arms and legs, looking at each other in disbelief. Bold letters across the bottom declared \"The God of Muscle Has Arrived!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock over what she had created Laura drifted to her bed and sat down. She flipped through the magazine until she found the interview with Jason that was advertised on the cover. She quickly devoured the article glad to have found at least some exposition to her new reality. She discovered that Jason had, at an early age, been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition that caused his body to develop muscle at an incredible rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Superhuman,\" Laura said out loud remembering the label on the Alteration's app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason described a life in which he was always the biggest and strongest kid around even though he wasn't very active. \"I've always been pretty lazy,\" he said in the interview. \"Mostly a nerd, really. I mean why workout anyway when my body just gets huge on its own, right?\" He went on to talk about how during his high school years his body developed faster than ever before. He said that when he entered high school at 14 he was 5' 5\" and right around the 200 pound mark but by the time he graduated he was 6' 1\" and 360 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You workout now, don't you?\" the interviewer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jason replied. \"I actually started in my senior year which is why I got so massive by the end. I'm still pretty lazy, though, so I only hit the gym a few times a month. That along with my diet are more than enough to keep my body growing bigger and bigger all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big to you plan to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll ever stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura closed the magazine and set it down. She realized that she was covered in sweat and her breathing was shallow and rapid. She moved to stand up but was distracted by a fire in her crotch that turned her legs to jelly. She closed her eyes and moaned while pressing her thighs tightly together. She couldn't remember feeling so horny in all her life, it was dizzying. In fact her hormones felt completely out of control. All at once she felt horny, excited, sad, angry, and thousands of other feelings at once. What was wrong with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood and left her room. She went down stairs with the intention of going to the garage to use Greg's exercise equipment. She wanted to see if the power she felt in her expanded body translated to actual strength. At least then she wouldn't mind looking like a fat lump. As she walked she absentmindedly tensed the muscles of her upper body pushing her shirt to the breaking point then relaxing. She rubbed her hand across her chest and shoulders feeling the stone beneath the blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Lulu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped. She was standing in the kitchen surrounded by her family. Everything had stopped in mid motion and they were staring at her. Something about the look they were all giving her made something deep inside her chest stir. It was her sister that had spoken but no further words came. Laura's parents, off to the side, could hardly look at her while Vanessa and Greg's expressions seemed filled with pity and sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Laura asked sounding overly annoyed. The fact that she couldn't get her feet under her for more than a minute was aggravating. They were looking at her like she was a freak which only compounded the feeling she already had at her oversized form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Vanessa said. \"It's just\u2026 just\u2026\" Silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura huffed and stormed through the kitchen toward the door that lead to the garage. She went in and turned on the light but before she could attack the gym equipment and test her strength a voice spoke from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found your stash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to find Greg's large body nearly filling the doorway completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's annoyance grew. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb, we need to talk about this. We're all really worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura knew this was her chance to glean some information about her new reality but for some reason she no longer had any interest in knowledge. Her muscles were begging to be put to the test, yearning to be pushed to the limit and grow even bigger, stronger. Greg's supposed concern was putting a stop to her. \"Look, just leave me alone,\" she barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Greg had never shouted at her before but instead of being afraid it only boiled Laura's blood further. \"Mom and dad are worried. I'm worried. I found the stuff you're taking to bulk up. There's some really dangerous stuff in there. Hell, there's stuff I've never even heard of. Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said. LEAVE. ME. ALONE.\" Laura's body was tensing all on its own. Her clothes groaned and snapped from the pressure of her enormous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg continued. \"Do you think this will make him notice you? Do you think he'll suddenly like you if you do this to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside Laura snapped. Faster than she would have thought possible she shot forward grabbing Greg by the throat. His 250 pound body was in the air, feet dangling, his face turning red. Laura, not even realizing how easily she was manhandling her big brother turned and slammed his body against the garage wall. It felt so good to use her power she did it again causing cracks to form in the drywall. Greg began to pull at the hand on his throat but couldn't get it to budge. Instead he began to beat on Laura's forearm but the blows did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura spotted a look in Greg's eye that was a mix of fear and confusion and a realization came to her. Words began to flow from her mouth but it was as if someone else was speaking for her: \"You didn't know I was stronger than you, huh? Well I am!\" To prove her point she squeezed Greg's throat and pressed him harder against the wall. Her shirt could take no more and began to split open across her shoulders, arms and chest. Tears welled in Greg's eyes and began to flow down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to tell him off, \"I don't care what you found or what you think any of it means. I've become more powerful than you can imagine and there's no chance I'm stopping now. Those dangerous drugs you've never heard of are turning me into a goddess so don't come in here thinking  you can push me around. I'll make you wish you were never born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's eyes rolled back in his head as he passed out. Laura let go of him and he slumped to the floor in a heap. Part of her was terrified of what she had just done but the delight over her strength overwhelmed any and all concerns.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura\u2019s mind was racing as she stared at Greg\u2019s unconscious body lying on the ground.  Part of her wanted to ignore him and start working out to see how strong she really was.  But another part of her now desperately wanted to find Jason.  His super human muscles turned her on and she just had to get closer.  After all, from the profile she pulled up on Jason previously, he was really into muscle women.  And she was a really big girl now!  Part of her wondered about Samantha, but for some reason she felt a tug toward Jason and apparently unresolved desires.  Pulling up her phone, a note had popped up, showing Jason\u2019s schedule.  Scrunching her face, Laura opened it up, realizing quickly that she was already obsessing over Jason, keeping track of his every move apparently.  Smiling, her breath quickened when she saw it was one of rare days at the gym, but was also acting as a photo shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting a parting glance at Greg, Laura found a bike that she somehow knew was hers and was soon peddling toward the gym, enjoying the feeling of power that came from legs that propelled her forward quickly.  Several stares came her way along the route and they weren\u2019t happy looks.  Some were dumbfounded and others leaned more toward disgust.  Laura saw them, but didn\u2019t care.  By the time she made it to the gym, she could tell by the video trucks that Jason was on schedule and already in the gym.  Parking her bike, she strode in, but was stopped at the front desk.  A fit man, likely a trainer and someone who obviously knew her, spoke loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura!  The gym is closed for Jason\u2019s shoot.  He\u2019ll be done in about an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused.  She must be a member.  That made sense, since this was Greg\u2019s gym.  Anger rose up and she was about to pounce all over him, but she paused momentarily and let out a labored breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just hoping to watch and maybe talk to Jason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer gave her a blank stare, but then seemed to soften.  \u201cAlright, fine.  You can watch.  But don\u2019t get in the way of anything or you\u2019ll be asked to leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded.  Why was her wanting to simply watch such a big deal?  She saw other people milling around.  Not wanting to wait in case he changed his mind, Laura moved quickly toward the bright lights, certain that was where the shoot was happening.  Moving carefully around several people and bumping a few, most everyone gave her curious and then slightly disgusted glances.  One who gave her a longer look was Jason\u2019s twin sister Jasmine.  She was done up nicely as well and was very fit, but not up to Laura\u2019s frame.  She had an outfit that appeared to have something about Jason on the front.  Laura smirked briefly.  Jasmine had always been fitter and stronger than Jason and generally gave him a very hard time.  By changing Jason, Laura had obviously changed that dynamic.  Now he was the one lording his superior physique over her and she did not appear thrilled.  Not really wanting to interact with Jasmine right now, Laura took another path toward the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting close, Laura stared at Jason, all 6 foot 1 and 375 pounds of gigantic muscles.  He was at a cable machine; performing hero curls as the cameras ran.  Two bikini girls were on either side behind him.  Laura grunted with anger at their high heels, overly done make-up and hair and their lack of muscle tone.  They were barely fit enough to enter a bikini contest.  As Jason completed another curl, Laura stared over at the weights, apparently modified for him.  He was using about two thirds of the stack, but was curling 600 pounds with each arm!  That really DID make him super human!  Laura watched as he struggled to complete the curl, bulging his arms to 36 inches of glory, or maybe even a bit larger!  Laura gasped at both the site and the thought of how big and strong those arms were.  Of course he was shirtless and sporting only some black gym shorts and black workout shoes, showing off the biggest, hardest, most muscular body the world had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason allowed the weights to head back down and the ground rumbled when he released the handles and the weights dropped the final inches to the stack.  He moved to the other side to release that handle with the same effect.  Sighing, he shook his arms and pulling up into a double bicep pose, the cameras zoomed in and the girls moved in, eventually rubbing their fingers along with arms, across this chest and back up to his biceps as he pumped his arms a few times.  Laura\u2019s excitement dimmed with the site of the bikini bunnies ruining her view.  After several minutes, Jason finally released his flex and the cameras all cut out.  The girls stood to the side, waiting for directions from the producer, who nodded his head, apparently indicating the end of the shoot.  The lights dimmed and Jason was able to see the small group of on lookers.  Laura smiled and when he caught her stare, he frowned.  Laura\u2019s smile dropped.  That wasn\u2019t the reaction she was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked closer and as others saw him approach, they moved away from Laura.  She glanced to the side, wondering what this meant.  Laura soon found out as Jason\u2019s voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?  I told you if you didn\u2019t stop stalking me that I\u2019d take out a restraining order on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was taken aback and her stomach sank.  What reality had she put in motion here?  Not knowing what to say, she stammered at his angry stare.  He gave up waiting for a response and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just look at you.  You think that by growing those big muscles that you\u2019ll win me over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced up at her overall bad appearance and shook his head.  \u201cYou look awful.  I would have thought you\u2019d at least make yourself up if you were hoping to win me over.  Your hair is a mess, you aren\u2019t wearing any make up and your shirt is all torn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt crushed, but then her face turned red.  \u201cAnd you find those stupid bikini bitches attractive?  You should be with someone who can match your strength.  Someone with muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed cruelly.  \u201cNobody can match MY strength.  And while I do appreciate the fitness and bodybuilding girls, they had better be good looking as well.  I know you\u2019ve been chasing me trying to get bigger and stronger, but face it; I grow bigger and stronger without even lifting.  And I certainly don\u2019t need any gear to get these muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grit her teeth and seethed with anger.  She knew he lusted after muscle women, but somehow in her desire to fulfill his fantasy, she\u2019s gone too far.  At least in his eyes.  Jason again waited for some type of response, but he had apparently hit all of her buttons, so he smiled and casually bouncing his massive pecs up and down a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can head home to your garage gym and lift as much weight as you like.  You\u2019ll never catch me and all of your muscles will never get me back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and walked back toward the bikini girls, rapping his arms around them and they giggled and they sauntered away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stared at the cable machine, wondering just how strong she really was and wanting nothing to take her frustrations out in a serious workout.  But she paused.  However strong she was now, it was apparent Jason was much stronger.  Narrowing her eyes, she pulled her phone out of her back pocket and turned away from Jason and the few people still around.  Laura again wondered what happened to Samantha.  Why wasn\u2019t she here?  Maybe they never even got together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the Ap, Laura huffed with swirling emotions, unknowingly caused by the drugs and her judgment was a bit clouded.  Should she make Jason smaller or weaker, turn his muscle growth potential down to nothing?  No, that wouldn\u2019t provide the proper amount of revenge.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura thought for a moment as she clicked on the Ap and moved toward an isolated spot in the gym.  Revenge was on her mind.  Sure, amping herself up and lording he superior body over Jason would provide satisfaction, but with the change in history, they might be friends again and who knows what her attitude might hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, if Jason was to suffer, who better than his twin to dish that out.  In their lives before the Ap, that was how their life was.  So pulling up Jasmine, Laura stared at Jasmine\u2019s buff and disturbingly beautiful features.  Her long dark hair framed her bright hazel eyes, small nose, narrow chin, light red lips, bright white teeth and high cheekbones.  Her high-end fitness shoulders and narrow, tight six-pack abs gave her a pleasing and dynamic T shape that curved down to wide, muscular sprinter legs.  Her arms looked very large with her biceps bulging out along her arms with thickness and definition. Simply put, Jasmine had a tight muscular body and possessed beauty, size, thickness and detail to win any fitness competition and with a bit more definition, any bodybuilding competition.  Lauren paused, wondering if she shouldn\u2019t check out what Jasmine was up to in this reality, other than working for her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Laura closed the 3D model lest there she received some unwanted attention and dove into the Ap and was surprised to see a single input for Jasmine labeled twin upgrade.  Seeing this as the simple way to input the information, Laura toggled the switch and the Apply button came up.  Moving around, she wanted to find Jasmine so she could be there when the change occurred.  Finding her, Laura moved closer as she was talking to one of the directors.  Jason was close by as well, still flirting with the two girls, but hanging around apparently to see if there was anything more he needed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both of them in view and her anger re-ignited with her sight of Jason and those other girls, Laura hit \u201cApply\u201d and the air once again crackled as history was re-written and Jasmine received her upgrade.  Laura had figured that being a teenage girl, best case Jasmine might be close to Jason\u2019s level and hopefully a bit above just due to her greater desire to lift weights.  She was worried that she would find Jason still larger and stronger.  But as she watched the shadow of Jasmine shift against the din, she began to wonder what she had really done.  Jasmine\u2019s form grew wider and wider and seemingly thicker and broader.  Jason appeared to remain unchanged, but Laura wasn\u2019t quite sure.  Also, she noticed that the cable machine appeared to be changing as if larger plates were morphing on either side.  Frozen, she could only watch within her field of view as a large poster came into view along the back wall.  The energy dissipation slowed and soon Laura\u2019s view cleared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blinked her eyes.  The high-end fitness Jasmine was gone.  In her place was the largest, most muscular girl, hell human, she had ever seen!  Laura gasped at the site.  Jasmine didn\u2019t even look real!  She had to be over 5 feet wide and she possessed gigantic ripped muscles that bulged everywhere with ridiculous size and definition.  Hell, Jasmine appeared to have muscles on top of muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill talking to the director, Jasmine smirked and looking up toward Jason she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that my dear brother has shown everyone that he is still the biggest, strongest MAN around, it\u2019s time to show everyone just who has the real power in this family.  And that one girl is more powerful than any man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gulped as she noticed Jason\u2019s massive shoulders slump a bit as he looked down at the ground.  He was dressed the same and if anything, he looked even larger than before, but only by a bit.  Jasmine completely outclassed him now.  And she was 4 inches shorter and a girl!  As Laura continued to stare wide eyed at the hugely muscled, curvy creature she created, Jasmine glanced over to see Laura and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Laura, you can have Jason soon enough.\u201d  Laura tried to look calm as Jasmine gave her a quick once over.  \u201cOh, and nice biceps by the way.  Keep up with my training and you\u2019ll catch up to Jason in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura returned a weak smile and nodded wondering how that could be possible.  She was still stunned by the monstrous, beautiful vision of Jasmine.  As Jasmine smiled back, she turned toward the cable machine and walked toward it.  Laura glanced down at her own arms and her eyes widened with wonder.  Pulling up her forearm to crook her arm and flex her muscles, she was shocked at both the size and hardness of her bicep.  The damn thing had to be 30 incredible inches around!  Still not near Jason\u2019s 36 inches, but damn, she was really jacked now.  She felt incredibly powerful and with a quick once over she smiled at how large she was all over, figuring to be beyond a high-end female bodybuilder.  But as she watched Jasmine walk up to the stack of weights, she quickly felt inadequate.  Puny even.  Laura now gulped as she looked at the weights.  Each bar on the stack before was 100 pounds and Jason had curled six with each arm.  Now each block was one THOUSAND pounds!  Jasmine pulled the pin out from the first block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were barely able to curl 1000 pounds Jason.  Although your gains remain impressive, faster than any other man by far, my gains continue to outpace you.  We\u2019ll either have to get a bigger stack or I\u2019m going to get a new machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wicked smile, Jasmine noisily clicked the pin down the stack, one after the next until she reached the bottom and placed the pin into the hole.  Laura gulped.  This would be 10,000 pounds!  How was that even possible?  As Jasmine moved over to move the pin on the opposite stack, Laura quickly open the Ap and scrolled to Jasmine.  Her face scrunched with wonder as she saw a red blinking indication on the \u201cmuscle growth\u201d \u201captitude\u201d.  She clicked on it and the number 100 was blinking with a text box next to it.  Laura read it and her pulse raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJasmine\u2019s initial setting was at 55.  By selecting twin, her number was increased by 73 to match her sibling.  This pushed the result beyond 100 to 128, providing Jasmine with ultra super human abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gasped as she checked out the other attributes.  With Jasmine starting out with a much stronger base for every physical trait, including strength, hardness and overall athletic ability, she grew beyond the settings and limits set on the phone.  Jasmine was now an unstoppable, indestructible Supergirl with the ability to become more powerful faster and faster!  Laura gulped.  What had she done?  Laura closed the Ap and as Jasmine moved into position to perform an impossible feat of strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine pulled the handles toward her and set herself for a moment as the cameras and lights were readied.  Laura felt light headed as she took in the goddess of muscle before her.  Jasmine was barefoot and her feet and ankles remained small, which only further highlighted the huge curvature that pushed out toward twin molded volleyball sized calf muscles and then up to tree trunk shaming ripped quadriceps of doom!  Each thigh was over 2 feet across and just as thick with feathered muscle ridges and insane separation between the quad muscles.  The front quads hung over her knees like cliffs!  Her thunder thighs curved wickedly in toward her narrow, sexy, cleanly separated and bullet proof 8 pack abs.  The only material in between was a black string bikini bottom that barely covered up her shaved privates.  Looking back toward her magnificent abs, Laura marveled at each brick that was so perfectly shaped, Laura had to blink to take it all in.  From there Jasmine\u2019s back pushed out at a nearly 90 bend into the widest set of wings every flexed as her piano key oblique muscles riddled the sides.  As Jasmine took in a few breaths to ready herself for an apparent world record shattering lift attempt, her gigantic pectorals heaved forward in defiance of reality.  Her cubed mega pecs had to be 18 inches thick and nearly touched her chin with each breath!  The matching black sportsbra was more of bikini top than athletic wear as no normal outfit could hope to contain Jasmine\u2019s massive chest!  Her nipples pushed obscenely against the material like twin bullets.  Jasmine licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the strongest man in the world was able to curl 1000 pounds, which is around 10 times what the next strongest man could perform.  Yet here is his twin sister, a teen-age girl, ready to knock out curls with 10 times that!  This will highlight the fact that I am one HUNDRED times stronger than any human outside my brother!  Several hundred times stronger than an average man.  And the more I lift, the stronger I get.  There is no limit to my power!  Watch as I re-define what Superhuman is all about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gulped, wondering where this was all headed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The nervous looking director pointed, Jasmine smirked, and her outstretched, super muscular arms flexed hard for the first time and Laura nearly passed out from the site and sound.  Both stacks of weights clanked loudly together and the military grade cables and bearings slowly hoisted the entire stack of weights upward!  Five TONS of hardened steel rose ever upward as Jasmine\u2019s biceps erupted with the Ultra Superhuman muscles of a young goddess!  Biceps the size of basketballs and triceps larger than bowling balls flexed and pumped up into twin volcanoes of super power!  Half way into her lift, her peaks were up to the top her fists and as she smiled for the cameras, those biceps continued to grind larger and harder and more defined as half inch thick veins pulled to the surface, her forearms could reach no further than vertical and her bicep peaks continued to rise up over the top of her fists toward the height of the top of her head!  Yet somehow, through her super human flex and feat, Jasmine laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!  10,000 pounds with each arm is already well within my ability!  I am soooooooo strong!  Looks like a new machine will be in order.  Each plate will need to be 10,000 pounds!  And give me enough time and I\u2019ll be curling THAT stack!  Ha-ha-ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine allowed the weights to move back down and with a subtle twist to her stance, she pulled the weights back up and was soon working out with them, her small grunt at the top of each curl the only indication this was taxing her in the least!  Laura figured that she could curl more than this.  Probably much more!  After 15 hard reps, Jasmine crashed the weights down to the ground; shaking the foundation of the entire gym to highlight just how much weight she had lifted with each arm!  Stepping forward, Jasmine turned toward Jason as she grabbed a towel to wipe the sweat from her upper body as she was huffing from the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow grab the tape Jason and measure the muscles of your superior.\u201d  Jason glumly marched forward and Laura smiled.  While she had underestimated just how powerful Jasmine would become, Jason was suffering!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jason did as he was told and with the cameras still running, wrapped the tape around her beyond massive bicep muscles and measures her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour, uh, bicep is 74 inches around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine grinned at Jason and then toward the camera.  \u201cOver twice that of my twin brother.  More than double the biggest, manliest biceps ever flexed.  Guess that makes me a goddess.  Too bad I\u2019m still capable of increasing my power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glumly pulled the tape off and measured her left bicep, also seemingly magically at 74 inches around.  Jasmine laughed, taunted and bounced her mighty biceps for the cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow THESE are the muscles of a REAL stud.  Keep following my progress folks and someday I may be flexing up biceps in the triple digits!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered and the lights dimmed.  With the cameras off, the crowd quickly filtered away, the crew started breaking things down and heading for the trucks outside.  Before long, Jasmine\u2019s minions had her cleaned up and she smirked at Jason, then chuckled toward Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel free to use the equipment Laura.  You don\u2019t want Jason to get the better of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and walked away.  Jason grunted.  \u201cShe\u2019s just messing with you.  I admire your strength and love your muscles, but your best curl is 140 pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was going to let that go, but something within her told her different.  Was this new reality more than just what she programed?  After all, the fact that she has become the strongest, most muscular girl outside of Jasmine wasn\u2019t something she would have thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a mischievous grin, Laura walked over the machine and pulling the pin out, pushed it back in at 2000 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted.  \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura moved to the other side, as the inner voice seemed to drive her forward.  Figuring she really had no chance to lift the weight, she still reached over to one handle, enjoying the fact that Jason was getting upset.  \u201cJust messing with the stacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grumbled.  \u201cWell when you\u2019re done wasting time with that, I really need to finish cleaning up so we can finally leave.  The last thing I want to do is hang around here any longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ignored Jason\u2019s whining and reaching over to grab the other handle, set herself.  It would appear that Jason preferred his dominance to her, even if he did still enjoy the muscles she sported now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if I really could curl this much?  To flex up even bigger muscles than I have now?  What if I became as stronger as your sister?  Maybe even stronger.  Then I could flex up muscles even larger!  Would you love that or hate that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped and his member started to stiffen.  Those comments did excite him even if his brain told him that two dominating women in his life would be more than he could handle, especially since he was the strongest man on earth by a very wide margin.  So clearing his throat, he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve talked that way before, but we both know it\u2019s not realistic.  Jasmine and I are unique.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head and let out a short \u201cYeah,\u201d knowing that if she COULD grow stronger than Jason that he really would be a wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with wild ideas in her head, Laura started to tug against the weights and....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jason finally broke the silence, \"it's a five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's you,\" Sam said, nudging Laura.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura only nodded.  Despite still not knowing whether or not the app was capable of actually doing anything the fact she was going to be the first to try it was almost too exciting to describe.  \"What am I going to try changing?\" She finally said.  As she opened the app and looked at all the potential options the available choices began to feel overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not keep things random?\"  Jason said, turning Laura's attention away from her phone.  She looked up to see Jason was rummaging in the same drawer she had grabbed the six sided die from.  He set some dice and a coin down next to the six sided die.  \"Look,\" he said, \"pushing the coin towards Laura.  \"You said the app can make you stronger or sexier,\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it can do more than that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure,\" Jason said, cutting her off.  \"But we can worry about introducing additional variables later.  For now let's focus on those two.  it will make it sort of like a controlled experiment, just a little more interesting.  What I'm suggesting is this, flip the coin, make one of the choices strength, the other sexiness.\"  As he spoke Jason pushed the dice towards Laura as well, two ten sided die as he said \"strength\" then a twelve sided die for \"sexiness.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like this idea,\" Sam said, picking up the twelve sided die and looking at it thoughtfully.  \"So each number on here would be what?  An extra cup size for our boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Jason said, excited that he and Sam were on the same wavelength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or an extra inch to your dick?\"  Sam arched an eyebrow and smirked at Jason.  He blushed fiercely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed and picked up the two ten sided die.  \"What would these do then?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those,\" Jason cleared his throat and looked relieved to have something else to talk about besides his penis size.  \"Easy, read the red one as the tens place, the blue as the ones place and add that much muscle to your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hundred pounds of muscle?\"  Laura said with incredulity.  She couldn't even picture what that would look like on her frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, potentially.  But how often have you actually rolled two tens at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam set the twelve sided die down and Laura set the ten sided dice down as well.  After exchanging glances with her friends she picked up the coin and looked at both sides, making sure it wasn't a double sided coin or something.  \"I don't know,\" she said slowly as she fiddled with the coin.  \"Seems complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads for muscle, tails for sexy?  What's complicated?\"  Jason asked.  Sam nodded agreement with him though that didn't surprise Laura, she would probably agree with Jason for almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Laura felt a bit of regret she hadn't rolled higher but at the same time there was some relief as well.  A full hundred pounds of muscle seemed like an awful lot to add all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Sam watched expectantly at Laura as she opened the app and began fiddling with the settings.  She watched as her avatar on the screen swelled larger when she pushed the \"weight\" slider to the right.  She frowned as her virtual self began to form a pot belly, she quickly found another slider that indicated she could change the body fat percentage of additional weight.  After resetting her avatar to its default and Laura adjusted the \"weight\" setting to 0.0% body fat and began pushing the slider to the right again.  This time her avatar packed on pure muscle and Laura grinned as she saw her top stretch tighter and tighter across her swelling shoulder and lat muscles.  Once the readout showed she had added exactly 34 pounds of muscle Laura's virtual self looked like it was about to burst out of her top.  She looked sleek, strong and sexy, the muscles adding enough meat to her shoulders and thighs to give the illusion that she had curves.  Before she gave in to the temptation to see what she would have looked like with one hundred pounds of muscle she pressed the \"apply changes\" button on the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt a \"twinge\" in her body.  It was hard to describe or put into words, it was something like an electrical shock yet it was purely physical, coming from somewhere deep within her.  She suddenly became aware of the beating of her own heart, despite her excitement it was slowing down even though each beat seemed stronger and more intense.  Her body shuddered slightly with each beat and she quickly realized that her muscles were swelling larger with every beat.  It started slowly at first but each burst of growth was larger than the one before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, it's working,\" Sam gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was so focused on what was happening to her body that she barely heard her friend.  She sucked a breath in sharply as her shirt pulled tightly across her nipples.  The feeling of growth had been turning her on already but now along with the  stimulation to her nipples this was pushing her towards an orgasm.  Just when she was convinced that the next surge of growth would cause her to either spontaneously orgasm, burst out of her shirt or both it finally stopped.  Laura stood gasping with frustration and was about to program the app to give her more growth when she was reminded that Jason and Sam were in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, it worked,\" Jason said with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Sam said softly.  \"You look great Laura,\" Sam said with more enthusiasm.  Laura looked down at her body and even that simple motion caused her top to strain audibly.  Taking a deep breath caused seams to loudly pop, raising her arm to experimentally flex a bicep caused her sleeve to peel back from her arm like a banana skin.  \"Wow, hopefully I get to try this next,\" Sam said reaching for the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped inspecting her body, \"what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean,\" Sam asked incredulously.  \"I'm going to flip the coin to see if Jason or I get to use the app next, you had your turn.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could have kept it all to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stood and got toe to toe with Laura. Even though the newly minted bodybuilder stood a half foot taller than Sam, the short Asian girl was stout enough that she still outweighed Laura's 139 pound body. There was no question who was stronger but it was obvious that Samantha wasn't going down without a fight. \"You said you called us here to share this gift but now it seems like you just want an audience.\" Samantha jabbed a pointed finger into Laura's chest. \"Don't let this power go to your head like all those assholes that have picked on us over the years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood her ground for a moment then realized how selfish she was being. She relaxed her body, seeming to shrink, and nodded. \"I'm sorry, you're right. God it just felt so good I wanted more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha let out a huge sigh of relief. \"Oh thank god.\" She shook her hand then flexed her fingers and relaxed them. \"You're hard as a rock, are you sure that's muscle in there. I think I broke my finger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned. \"You wanna feel for real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Laura's surprise Sam reached out and put a hand on Laura's chest groping at the area just above her breast. \"Insane,\" Sam said. Then Laura flexed her pecs and Samantha's eyes nearly popped out of her skull. \"It feels like steel. I hope I get to go next. I need to get me some of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then flip already,\" Jason was a bit disappointed to have been left out of the touching episode and was now just as anxious as Sam to see who got to go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam readied the coin. \"Here we go. You're heads and I'm tails.\" She flipped the coin high in the air and backed up to let it land.</span></div></div>",

Let's make Dirk Diggler jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took the die but dropped his hand and sat on Laura's bed keeping his eyes on the floor. Laura sighed and sat next to him. She wrapped her arm around his shoulder and hugged him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, we'll play a couple of rounds. I'm sure by the end of this we'll all be very happy with the way we look. But look at me,\" she flexed her free arm showing off her impressive 16 inch bicep and puffed out her chest. \"One round of moderate muscle growth and my clothes are about to give up the ghost. I guarantee that very soon we'll all be naked so we need to be okay showing off our bodies to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded then looked up. \"I know that, that's not really the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stepped forward and touched his cheek, \"So what's the trouble, Jase?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... I already have a really big penis. I just really wanted muscles. And what if I grow <i>too</i> big?\" He blushed so bright he was practically glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were silent for a long time stunned to learn that their skinny, nerdy friend was well hung. Finally Laura held up her phone and spoke, \"Jason, we just learned that this thing really works. That means that we're basically gods. There's no such thing as too big for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up, a light seemed to have gone on his in mind. The truth of what Laura was saying as well as the hidden meaning behind her words. Excitement washed back over him and he smiled wide. \"Yeah, you're right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Laura added, \"we can always undo anything too crazy later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood and readied himself to toss the die while Laura began tapping away on her phone getting Jason's profile selected and prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha stood at Jason's side and gave his free hand a squeeze. \"So, um, how big are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could answer Laura interrupted. \"Shit! You weren't kidding.\" She looked up from her phone. \"He's just a smidge shy of 10 inches long. Pretty damn thick too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down at Samantha with the red flush returning to his face. \"Uh, what she said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat that had been growing in Samantha's crotch since Jason's was selected at the next player to go was becoming a raging fire. She couldn't believe that the guy she had a crush on was in possession of a porn star sized cock. And now it was going to get even bigger. \"Roll it, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tossed the die then laced his fingers between Samantha's while they anxiously awaited the result.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason's mouth dropped open. He'd made his peace with the fact that he was going to go from well hung to oversized, but this was insane. Part of him was afraid of what was about to occur but another, larger part (no pun intended) was over the moon. <i>Twenty inches</i>, he thought to himself, <i>think of how good that will look when I finally get some muscle on me. If I can get really big I'll be a sex god.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought back to reality by Laura and Samantha who were looking at each other and giggling. Samantha was especially giddy and the skin of her face and neck were gaining a reddish glow. \"You've got quite an enhancement coming your way,\" Laura said. \"Are you ready for this?\" Her finger was hovering over the screen of her phone, the alteration to Jason's manhood apparently already keyed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to say he was when he realized something. \"Wait!\" he said putting his hands up. Before Laura could ask what the trouble was Jason was loosening his belt and pulling his pants down leaving him clad in his briefs. \"I have enough trouble stuffing myself into clothes at my current size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Samantha said then regretted it. She'd been staring at Jason's package which was hardly covered by his overstressed underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just smiled with a strange sort of pride. The face was that Jason chose to wear briefs over boxers for just this reason: he loved how he filled them out. His large penis was the one physical attribute that he liked about himself, but it was also the one feature he was too shy to ever share with anyone. Now he could hardly wait to expose himself to his two best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to keep your underwear on?\" Laura asked. She wanted to make sure Jason was completely ready before she started his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jason said, \"lets see if I can grow out of-aaaaaaaaaAAAHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jason had given his confirmation Laura had hit the \"submit\" button on the app without waiting for him to finish his sentence. He was cut off mid-word by an intense electricity in his crotch. For a moment he was afraid that his transformation was going to be very painful but it took a turn for the pleasurable instead. In fact it was the most intense pleasure he'd ever experienced. His cock was hardening with an erection that tented his tight underwear but the electricity that was flowing through the base of his spine into his penis was pushing the head further out than it had ever gone before. The power that supercharged his manhood didn't take very long to burst right through his briefs revealing the most magnificat cock Samantha or Laura had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls gasped and took a step back in shock at the enormous member that sprouted from Jason's crotch. He followed their stares down, their expressions filling him with concern. Based on the looks on their faces he half expected to find a snake or a balloon or something equally strange but it was the penis he was familiar with, only better. Already he was up to about a foot in length and super thick. He realized that the electric current was pulsing inside him and that each surge caused his penis to twitch and gain about half an inch in length. It felt like the most intense orgasm of his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's legs gave out and he had to sit on Laura's bed to keep from falling to the floor. Still his cock flexed and grew little by little. He gripped the edge of the mattress tightly turning her knuckles a ghostly white then let out a loud yell. Come erupted forcefully from his surging penis spraying farther than anyone in the room though possible at hitting Laura's closet door six feet away. By the time Jason's orgasm concluded he was somewhere around 16 inches long and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's panting and howling began to concern Samantha who asked Jason if he was doing okay. \"OH YEAH!\" Jason said between sharp breaths. He laughed a little as well. \"This... is... aaaaaaaaa...\" He came again this time landing an even larger load higher on Laura's closet door. \"Amazing.\" Jason finished meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally his growth was subsiding. Jason caught his breath and examined the impossibly huge cock that was now his. He took it firmly in one hand smiling at the fact that his girth was such that he could only just touch his finger to his thumb. When he squeezed he found no give at all, his shaft was like a lead pipe. He pulled his penis towards himself and held it against his body to measure it. The head reached all the way to the middle of his chest, just about even with his nipples. \"Unbelievable,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood up and aimed his monster cock at the space between Laura and Samantha both of whom were transfixed. \"So, what do you ladies think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura spoke first, \"I think it's incredible. Though I also think you made quite a mess over here.\" She pointed to the come that had splattered across her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrank slightly, \"Sorry about that, I'll clean it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \"No big deal. We're just having fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded then turned to Samantha. \"How about you, Sam? Pretty cool, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's face expressed sheer astonishment. She slowly reached a hand out to touch Jason's penis, stopping just inches away realizing what she was doing. She looked up at Jason and he could see hunger behind her eyes. \"I... uh, can I touch it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin slid across Jason's face. \"Go ahead.\" Before she could even move again he closed the gap between his cock and her hand. She pulled away for a quick moment after making contact, as if she were afraid the fantasy would vanish. Once it didn't she laid her whole hand on top of Jason's member feeling the heat of it. She wrapped her fingers around the shaft, or tried to since her petite hand couldn't grasp the full circumference, and squeezed with all of her might. Jason grunted pleasurably and moved closer to Samantha who now took him in both hands and guided him upward between the two of them. As Jason got closer his cock-head went higher until it was right at Samantha's face. She examined Jason's organ closely, so close in fact that Jason though she was going to put her lips to his skin. Instead she smiled wickedly at him and pumped both of her hands up and down several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's eyes rolled back in his head and he moaned. \"Wow,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow is right.\" Samantha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I think,\" Laura cut in. Surprised Samantha spun around to face her musclebound friend and found a coin pushed into her hand. \"It's Sam's turn. Go ahead, Sam, flip. Muscles or boobs. What prize do you win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady for anything Sam flipped the coin into the air.</span></div></div>",

She wouldn't admit it out lout but she was actually pretty excited that, for the time being, she would be the only one with big muscles. Heck, if she could land another muscle buff with a pretty good roll in their next round she'd be truly huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Samantha's turn to blush. The plump Asian girl was excited to add to her curves, especially since her large belly and thick thighs were exaggerated by the fact that her chest was rather underdeveloped at a B cup. At least now she'd be able to get some boobs to show off and then she could find a way to slim her body down with Laura's app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go- oops! Sorry!\" Jason went to hand Samantha the d-12 but accidentally slapped her arm with his giant cock. \"I guess I've got to get used to this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha took the die from Jason with one hand while she stroked the top of his penis with the other. \"I don't think I'll ever get used to it.\" Never in a million years would she have expected that she would be casually handling her crush's enormous member and yet here she was. Filled with excitement she tossed the die across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I get?\" she shouted. \"How many cup sized do I get to grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura called out the answer...</span></div></div>",

Sam mentally counted off the conversion from numbers to letters and cup sizes in her head.  \"That's only a D cup, I mean it's not bad but it isn't much better than what I already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I don't think that's right,\" Jason said, interrupting Laura from saying the same thing.  \"It's adding four cups on top of what you have, so if you're a B cup now,\" Jason paused to see Sam nod, \"then you'll end up with F cups.  That's not shabby,\" Jason did stop himself from rattling off a list of models with F cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's eyes widened slightly as she realized Jason was right.  \"OK,\" she said with a bit more enthusiasm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready when you are,\" Laura said, reviewing the modifications pending on Sam's profile.  Laura had edged her friends bust size to right at the upper threshold of \"F\" cups, anymore would have tipped them into G territory.  She didn't think Sam would mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, um... OK?\"  Sam took a deep breath and smoothed her shirt across her breasts tensed up, waiting for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?  You look nervous.  Do you want to take your bra off first or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Sam paused to thing about then shook her head.  \"I'm ready, just hit it.\"  Laura nodded and Sam audibly gasped the instant after Laura pressed the \"apply changes\" button.  Her nipples shot to attention, straining through the fabric of both her bra and her shirt and they seemed to gain a ridiculous level of sensitivity.  Sam could feel the material of her bra against her nipples and even her areola as though new nerve endings had suddenly been activated.  The intensity of feeling increased until it almost reached unbearable levels then the growth began.  Sam's breasts jiggled as her bustline increased with small but dramatically quick bursts of growth.  She moaned with discomfort as the underwire from her bra began to cut into her as her breasts began to overflow the cups of her bra.  She was distracted from her own discomfort by sight of Jason's cock, which had finally reached a relaxed state but was now raising to attention again.  She began so fixated on staring at his cock and so distracted from the sensations of her own transformation that when her bra finally tore to pieces she was startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" Jason moaned under his breath, as Sam's growth slowed to a stop.  Her shirt looked like it was millimeters of breast tissue away from tearing open entirely, or maybe just a deep breath.  Regardless, it was stretched so thin it did nothing to conceal Sam's nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends looked awkwardly at each other in momentary silence until with a loud tearing sound Sam's right breast burst free from the confines of her shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Laura asked with a chuckle, \"who feels ready for round 2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked from her own breasts, to Jason's massive penis and then slowly over to Laura.  \"Actually, I feel pretty horny.\"  Jason blushed deep red as he realized his penis very clearly announced his own arousal and Laura chuckled again, this time with some unease in her voice as she recalled how horny she had been during her transformation.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tension in the room grew thick as Samantha's words hung heavy. She was sure Laura was going to kick her out for being weird or that Jason was going to never speak to her again and the longer the silence went on the worse it got. Even worse, though, she was getting even hornier. Her breasts were charged with electricity and she longed to have someone tweak her nipples or slap her tits. Her eyes moved from Jason's penis to Laura's beautiful muscles and she realized that she wanted both of them badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" a sexy grin appeared on Laura's face, \"what do you suggest we do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha wordlessly charged Laura, a wild feral look in her eye. She grabbed the hole her cantaloupe sized breast had ripped in her shirt and ripped it bigger freeing her left breast as well. Sam leapt into the air at Laura wrapping her legs around the muscular girl's waist. Laura was surprised by Samantha's charge but had just enough time to ready herself to catch her friend and hope her 134 pound body could support Sam's 150 pounds which was inbound like a missile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura braced herself then their bodies collided. Laura put her hands under Samantha's butt and took a step back to absorb the shock but her powerful legs held. She was just about to say something about how cool it was to be so strong when Samantha's hands locked onto either side of her head. Sam lunged forward voraciously and locked her lips onto Laura's. An instant later Sam's tongue was inside Laura's mouth, then she was biting and sucking on Laura's lips while one of her hands traveled down her body to the hem of her shirt where it slid underneath and began feeling the hard ridges of her defined abs and obliques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was startled at first but within seconds Samantha's acts rekindled the fire that burned inside her during her own transformation reigniting it even stronger than before and she found herself returning Sam's affection. Laura carried Samantha to her bed passing a dumfounded Jason along the way. He watched rapt but unsure on how to join in especially with a penis that would never fit where he wanted to put it. He settled instead to enjoy the show for now and see if he could help one or both of his friends soon. He wouldn't have to wait long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slammed Samantha's body down on the bed and mounted her shifting her hips to one side so that she could slide her muscular leg into Sam's crotch and grind against her vagina. Sam wrapped her short legs around Laura's longer one and helped guide her. At the same time Laura twisted her torso so that she was face to face with Samantha's huge breast. Laura clamped her mouth down on the huge, juicy nipple and began sucking hard. She then grabbed Samantha's other breast with her hand and kneaded the soft flesh while pinching and twisting. Sam's reaction was explosive, she let out a huge scream then used her own hands to urge Laura on, clamping one hand behind Laura's and the other grabbing a fistful of Laura's hair and mashing her face against her perfect boobs even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH!! Just like that, oh god, oh god I'm COMING, I'M COMING!!\" Samantha screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty girl writhed in orgasm for nearly a full minute before Laura had to pull her head back and come up for air. The two sat panting for a few moments, then Samantha's hands traveled to Laura's arms and began squeezing her plump biceps. Laura responded by flexing her arms to their full 16 inch glory which caused Samantha to moan with excitement. Laura found herself incredibly turned on by the muscle worship, how astounding that she could get such a sexual charge from someone simply touching her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how hard you are,\" Samantha said and that was all it took. Now Laura shook as a silent orgasm washed over her. Her breathing shuddered and her eyes rolled back and then the wave passed. But she needed something more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched as Laura bent down and began whispering into Samantha's ear. A huge smiled spread across Sam's face then both girls looked right at him. Jason was overcome by a wave of both fear and excitement but it didn't have time to really sink in because Laura lunged at him, lifted him into the air and threw him down on the bed next to Samantha. Jason was astounded at the strength he could feel in Laura's movements but didn't have time to think on it long before both girls attacked his giant cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura worked the base of his shaft with both hands while Samantha sandwiched the upper portion between her melons. Each girl had nearly a foot of his penis all to their own and, judging by Jason's howls of pleasure, they were doing a magnificent job. A mere thirty seconds of this pleasure was all he could take and Jason's hips began bucking wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gonna blow!\" Samantha called out then shoved as much of the head of Jason's penis into her mouth as she could. She felt his entire cock flex then fire warm come into her mouth with surprising pressure. The second shot was even harder than the first and she became worried that she wouldn't be able to take another but she had just enough time to swallow what was in her mouth and prepare for the next round. Samantha and Laura milked Jason's monster cock until it finally calmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends collapsed onto the bed next to each other and lay still for a very long time. It was obvious that, with her enhanced physique, Laura's endurance was the best among the three of them because she was the first to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her phone, \"You guys ready for round two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat up, his penis finally soft enough to lay down was draped over his right leg. \"I had a thought about that. Rolling for muscles or... sexual enhancements is great but before we go again how about we each take a free action?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A free action. We each pick one thing to change about ourselves but it can't be muscles or boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Samantha sat up. \"Or your penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, twenty inches is more than enough for me.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty-one.\" Laura corrected. When Jason looked at her confused she continued, \"Well, you were so close to ten to start with that I just rounded up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head in disbelief. \"Fine, twenty-one. It's plenty. But what do you guys think?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think I want to lose some of this flab,\" Sam said immediately, pinching at some of the flab around her stomach for emphasis.  \"What about you Jason?\"  Sam tried very hard not to leer at Jason's cock while she spoke to him but she mostly failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acne, definitely want to clear up my acne,\" Jason said with almost no hesitation.  \"Why do you think there is something else wrong with me I should fix first?\" He asked, suddenly sounding self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're a good looking guy Jason, really good looking,\" Sam blushed as she said it which seemed odd to Laura, just a moment ago Sam had been vigorously jerking Jason off.  She would have thought that crossing that sort of line would make flirting seem like no big deal but apparently that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Laura?\" Jason asked, clearing his throat and changing the subject.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned thoughtfully as she began altering Sam's profile.  Reducing Sam's bodyfat really accentuated how poor her overall muscle tone was but at the same time it emphasized how large her boobs were.  Hopefully she'll get some muscle the next round Laura thought to herself.  \"I hadn't really thought about it,\" Laura said in response to Jason's question.  Which wasn't quite true, she could think of a bunch of things she wanted to change about herself.  It was trying to pick just one that was hard for her.  \"How does fifteen percent bodyfat sound?\" Laura asked showing the phone to Sam before changing anything.  Sam looked over the image on the phone and enthusiastically nodded her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, yes.  That makes my boobs look even better.\"  Sam cupped her breasts in her hands and gently bounced up and down on the balls of her feet waiting for the change to hit.  She didn't have to wait long.  Within seconds her body was overtaken by a tingling sensation and she shivered as pounds of fat melted away.  She swayed slightly on feet after it was over and looked uncertainly down at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I weigh now?\"  Sam asked, sounding slightly wooden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, not quite 114,\" Laura said.  Sam still had enough of a layer of fat to appear smooth and soft without looking pudgy anymore.  Until she got muscle on her frame or more deliberate tweaking of her bone structure it was probably the best she was going to look.  \"But you didn't really answer my question, are you OK?  You look like something is bothering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam poked and pinched at her stomach, obviously happy at how flat it was.  Then she craned her neck trying to look at her own ass.  \"I'm alright I guess,\" she said finally.  She slapped her butt a few times experimentally and grinned.  \"Shrinking just feels different, I don't think I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Laura said.  \"How about you stud?  Ready for that clean complexion?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Jason said.  Laura pushed the button and Jason flinched as his skin went from greasy and moderately acne covered to perfect in an instant.  He rubbed his cheek experimentally and grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good Jason,\" Sam said with so much smoldering lust in her voice it made Jason blush and pointedly reminded Laura that she had just screwed Sam a few minutes ago and that it might happen again before the afternoon was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Laura?\" Jason asked, turning away from Sam in an attempt to bring his stiffening penis under control.  He cleared his throat awkwardly and tried to find a place to stare that WASN'T at one of his naked friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \"I don't know, can I just save my freebie to use when I decide what I want?\"</span></div></div>",

She's a H cup right now.  H plus eight cups is P, not N.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be a P cup,\" Sam protested, \"that's too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged, \"It's actually the same amount of boobs, it just sounds bigger because your waist is skinnier now that you lost that weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but,\" Sam was starting to whine.  \"It just sounds enormous.\"  She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be OK with this Sam,\" Laura asked as she began setting up the changes on her friends profile.  \"We're not going to force you to do something you don't want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the rules of the game..\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began to protest but Laura cut him off.  \"Don't be an ass Jason.\"  Laura finished altering Sam's profile and showed her the image.  \"I won't press go until you tell me you're OK with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam regarded the image of her profile, her breasts obscured most of her torso, hanging down almost to her hips.  After giving Sam a few moments Laura slowly spun the model to display Sam's new body from all angles.  \"Can you make them a little less droopy?\"  Sam asked eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason started to say something that sounded like a protest but Laura cut him off, \"sure, I had just added size and kept your natural breast shape, let's see what else I can do with it.\"  Laura made some adjustments and showed the profile to Sam again.  \"How about this, a little more pert, a little more rounded so they don't look like they're pointing in opposite directions.\"  Sam gazed at the image for a few long and silent seconds.  \"If you're not sure,\" Laura began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's good,\" Sam said firmly.  \"Hit me.\"  Sam closed her eyes and firmly grabbed her own breasts, looking like she was bracing herself to take a punch or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said hit me,\" Sam said sounding frustrated.  The barking tone was replaced by a surprised but excited moan of pleasure as Laura pushed the \"apply changes\" button on her iPhone.  \"Oh my GOD!  This feels so good,\" Sam purred as her breasts began to visibly grow.  Like before they grew in small but intense bursts, jiggled against her hands.  Sam began kneading her breasts, as the growth accelerated, each pulse adding more and more flesh to her already sizable breasts.  Soon she was cradling them in her arms and panting in ecstasy as they continued to overflow her grasp.  Eventually the growth stopped but Sam's urgent groping of her own breasts continued until she eventually opened her eyes and looked sheepishly at her friends.  \"The feels so good, I can't even describe it,\" she said sounding apologetic.  Laura merely nodded, trying not to acknowledge that she could clearly see evidence of her friends state of arousal dripping down the inside of her thighs.  Jason merely grunted and tried not to make eye contact with either of his friends but the erect throbbing of his enormous penis was impossible to hide.  \"Geez these things are heavy,\" Sam griped as she slowly lowered her arms to release them.  \"My arms are starting to cramp from holding them up.\"  She wobbled unsteadily on her feet as she tried taking a step forward.  \"Whoa,\"  Sam waved her friends away as they moved to help her.  \"I got this,\" she insisted as she carefully made her way towards Laura's bed and sat down.  \"I definitely have to get some muscle for hauling these around though.\"  Sam giggled as she poked at her breasts and watched them jiggle.  \"Any bigger and they'd actually be in my lap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Jason said, finally breaking away from staring at Sam as he reached for the coin.  \"If we're going in reverse order that means I'm next right?\"  Not really waiting for an answer he flipped the coin and they turned from regarding Sam's immense new breasts to watching the coin rattle to a stop on Laura's desk.  </span></div></div>",

Finally a smile spread across his face and he leapt into the air. \"JACKPOT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're talking,\" Samantha said already trying to imagine what Jason's new body would look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned but inside she was a bit sad, she was enjoying being the strongest person in the room and that was about to vanish. She shook this feeling off, though, reminding herself that Jason deserved some muscle just as much as she did and that she still had plenty of turns ahead of her as well as the app itself. Don't be selfish, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright stud, are you ready for this?\" Laura asked pulling up Jason's profile and making the appropriate change. She watched Jason's avatar pack on size going from skinny 6' tall, 152 pound waif to a beefy 241 pound hunk. \"I'm pretty sure this will officially make you bigger than Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jason and Samantha giggled at the thought. \"Alright,\" Jason said his monstrous cock already swelling from excitement, \"bring it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tapped her phone's screen then sat back to watch. Right away Jason sucked in a trembling breath. At the same time both girls watched as Jason's meager physique began to bloom into something much more impressive. Jason closed his eyes and tightened his fists willing himself to grow and grow his did. Muscle flowed into his body like ocean waves, little surges that didn't recede. One moment he looked like a scrawny nerd, then a professional athlete, and finally a fully fledged bodybuilder. Jason raised his arms and flexed every muscle he could all at once roaring with the feeling of power. His roar was cut short, though, when his penis began to quiver and yet another orgasm ripped through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it passed he blushed and looked at Laura, \"Sorry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just laughed and shook her head. \"Are you going to come every time you grow? Do I need to get a bucket or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged then turned to Samantha. \"So, how do I look?\" He moved through a few poses, unsure of exactly how to do them but looking incredibly impressive nonetheless. He finished by raising his arms and hitting a double biceps pose, his arms swelling to 21 inch cannons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was speechless, her eyes roaming all over Jason's bulging body, absent mindedly kneading her huge breast. After a long pause she spoke in a voice so soft Jason almost couldn't hear her: \"Can I touch them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah you can.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's words knocked Samantha out of her trance and she rushed him. Jason expected her to grab at his new muscles but instead she wrapped her body against his in a tight bear hug nuzzling her face against his chest, smashing her breasts against his stomach and running her hands through the grooves of his back. Jason reveled in her touch loving how his new body drove her wild; he could feel her desire growing by the second. Her hands were moving more rapidly finding new muscles to paw, exploring his ass and thighs, then his stomach. She began kissing his chest and arms, her breathing becoming a panting. Jason put his hands on Samantha's hips and lifted her into the air so her breasts were level with his face. Clamping his mouth down on her nipple he began sucking and licking with abandon; Samantha grabbing the hair on the back of his head and pressing his face into her soft tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't believe how easy it was to hold Samantha's body up, he felt like he could do it with one hand. Was this how Greg felt all the time? Or maybe the app bestowed muscle that was even more powerful than the average person. Jason was just imagining challenging Greg to an arm-wrestling match when he heard Laura clear her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Samantha stopped their playtime and looked to where Laura was standing with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Laura,\" Jason said. \"Feeling left out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're asking if I'm ready to take my turn then, yes, I am.\" She tried to hold a stern expression but her smile kept breaking through. This whole game was just too much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura picked up the coin but Samantha stopped her. \"Hold on, you're supposed to use your free action before your next turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling Laura set the coin back down and picked up her phone. \"Fine! I think I know what I want anyway. I'm going to be taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we roll to see how tall?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to protest but Samantha got to it first. \"No, it's a free action. She should pick as long as she's not turning into a 12 foot giant or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll save that for later,\" Laura said giving Sam a quick wink. \"Besides, I really just want to be taller than my sister, not much more than that.\" She tapped her phone's screen a few times then closed her eyes as her body filled with energy once more. She moaned as her body lengthened, her head moving ever upward, her legs becoming incredibly long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done Laura opened her eyes and steadied herself from a wave of vertigo. She then took a few cautious steps getting used to her new height. She approached Jason now nearly equal in height to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking a little slimmer, Beanstalk.\" Jason said. It was true, the muscle she had gained was now stretched over a much larger frame and though she still looked incredibly toned she was no longer as buff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura flexed her bicep regarding it's slightly reduced size then shrugging. \"That's okay. We're still playing, aren't we?\" She turned and sauntered back to where she'd left the coin, she already seemed to be in complete control of the miles long legs she possessed and Jason suddenly wanted to get his hands on them very badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura picked up the coin and turned to face Jason. \"And since we're at the end of our rotation I get to go twice while we reverse the order. That's two chances for some more muscle.\" She flipped the coin over her shoulder onto her bed while keeping her eyes locked on Jason's. \"What do I get, Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha checked the coin, \"It says\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

She quickly expanded into a behemoth that looked ready to win titles on the bodybuilding stage. At the same time her breasts were rapidly inflating becoming cantaloupe sized globes. Laura moaned deeply squeezing her swelling boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you were so right, Sam, this feels incredible.\" She let one of her hands drop to her crotch and begin massaging her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you get mad at me for coming after every transformation?\" Jason said. He didn't really want to put a stop to the show, but he also wanted to get on with his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" Laura said with a laugh. Then she raised her arm and flexed her 18 inch bicep. \"Don't get too mouthy, Big Boy, I'm catching up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that,\" not waiting any longer, Jason flipped the coin. \"Muscle!\" he shouted with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar,\" Laura snapped out of her pleasure session and glared at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's true,\" Samantha said.

The super busty Asian pressed her body against Laura's thickly muscled back, smashing her enormous breasts against her then reaching down to Laura's chest to massage her more than ample bosom. Laura sucked in a breath as sharp bolts of pleasure shot through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" Sam said dropping her voice to a whisper with her mouth right by Laura's ear, \"how about after we finish this round we all roll for muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura moaned her approval. \"Mmmmm, why not double roll for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're speaking my language,\" she giggled. \"But I need to take my turn first to finish the round first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jason added, \"and you still owe me 94 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes shot open, \"How the hell do you keep rolling so high?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just laughed and shrugged. \"They're your dice. They must like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head as she lifted her phone up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is going to be good.\" Jason said, his penis already awakening at the mere thought of his impending growth. A moment later his body was swelling again and moments after that his penis flexed and spasmed with another orgasm. Jason was now far larger than Laura's brother and quickly outpacing just about every bodybuilder around. His thighs swelled into tree trunks that pressed into each other, his chest steadily grew thicker, his shoulders more broad. Jason flexed his arms tightening and relaxing his bicep watching the enormous muscle get bigger and bigger with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange energy finally faded from Jason's body and he stood before Laura and Samantha a 335 pound beast sporting insanely ripped muscle across nearly every inch of his body. Since arriving at Laura's house he had more than doubled his body weight with muscle taking him to the upper echelon of what was physically possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look now?\" he asked then, just like with his first round of growth, began hitting various poses. Hands on his hips he tensed his pecs causing his chest to swell to just over 70 inches around. He tried his quads putting one leg forward then the other, each thigh swelling to 35 inches which was bigger than either Laura or Samantha's current waist measurement. Just like before he finished out with a double bicep pose, his extra bulk quite obvious with his new 27 inch arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Samantha said in awe. \"Are you the biggest man alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's voice carried equal parts wonder at the giant man before her. \"Not yet, but at 335 pounds he's getting up into the top five percent or so. There are a few guys that have made it as high as 350 or even 400 in their off season weight, but very, very few that can be as big as Jason is with such low body fat.\" Having a brother with serious bodybuilding aspirations definitely had its advantages when it came to this sort of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha approached Jason slowly, her hand out, almost afraid to touch Jason as if that would break the illusion and she'd find the 150 pound weakling before her once again. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason closed the gap between them guiding her hand to his abs then up to his pecs. \"Like I could bench press a bus.\" He curled his arm for her and let her paw at the steel-hard boulder beneath his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get me some of this,\" Samantha said. She looked back at Laura. \"I still get my turn then we're all doing double muscle rolls, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hurried to scoop up the coin and flipped it. \"HEADS!! That's muscle!! That with the next round means I get three muscle rolls. Can I take them all right now?\" She looked back and forth at her friends pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see how we could say no,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it,\" Jason agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquealing with excitement she grabbed the dice and tossed them three times in rapid succession calling out the numbers as they landed. \"Fifty-nine! Twenty-eight! SEVENTY-THREE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Laura said, \"You get to pack on 160 pounds of pure muscle. I don't know as much about women's bodybuilding as I do the men, but I'm pretty sure this will make you the biggest woman in the world.\" She quickly entered Samantha's rolls into the app and applied the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away Sam's skin flushed and beads of sweat appeared across her chest and neck. Her hands shot straight to her N-cup breasts and began kneading them for all she was worth. As the first signs of growth became visible she began to scream, the most epic orgasm of her entire life cascaded over her like a tidal wave. Every cell in her body was awash with pleasure, and many of those cells were multiplying at an amazing rate. Bigger and bigger her body grew, all the while she continued to thrash about in ecstasy. As her muscle mass eclipsed that of Aleesha Young's Samantha's eyes shot open and she looked at Jason with ravenous hunger. She launched her still growing body at him leaping into the air and wrapping her thick thighs around his waist. She lowered herself down slightly so that her red hot sex was rubbing against his monster cock. Jason, not one to let an opportunity pass him by, wrapped his arms around Samantha and began bucking his hips in time with hers. He slid one hand down and squeezed her juicy thigh, then took a handful of her ass. He could feel her muscles growing beneath his fingers, against his body, the sensation was beyond his comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's growth subsided followed shortly by her orgasms. She remained cradled in Jason's arms for a little, catching her breath. Finally she released her legs and climbed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she said, then, \"sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be!\" Jason replied too quickly, causing him to blush. \"I mean, that felt great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha purred then ran her hands up her torso giving her huge breasts a quick squeeze as she did. \"Yeah it did.\" Finally she turned her attention to her new assets and her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" Samantha said taking in the spectacle that was her massive arms. \"I'm as big as you are, Jason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" Laura said causing both muscle monsters to look her way. \"Sam, you now weigh just shy of 280 pounds meaning Jason has nearly 60 pounds on you, BUT you're also more than a foot shorter than he is so your mass has to fit on a smaller frame making you look\u2026 incredible.\" It was true, Samantha's 4' 10\" body was packed to exploding with huge slabs of sinew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shucks,\" Sam said twisting her body side to side in faux embarrassment. \"I don't even exercise, but look at these guns.\" She raised her right arm and flexed a 25 inch bicep that peaked so high on her short arm she could almost reach out and brush the top with her fingers. Instead she reached across with her free hand and felt all over the gorgeous muscle. \"I can't believe this is mine, I feel like I could punch a tank into orbit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have to say your boobs are looking much more at home now.\" Laura commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded her agreement. It was true that her prodigious chest stuck out even further now that there was a thick shelf of pectoral muscle beneath it, but it definitely held her volleyball sized breasts up much more effectively. That coupled with her broader shoulders and expanded hips gave her an extreme hourglass look that was beyond anything the world had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha turned to Jason, cocking her hip to the side and flexing every muscle she could. \"What do you think, big boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's 21 inch erection was pointed straight at her and he grinned. \"I think I want to get my hands on those killer thighs again. Your whole body is out of this world, but those legs are spectacular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" she said twirling on her toes and giving Jason a full view of her fully flexed 24 inch calves as well as her 33 inch quads. \"Once you get even bigger we'll have to see if you still fit between my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" Jason held out his hand and Samantha placed the dice in his palm. His next two rolls were not nearly as impressive as his first two, but they still added up to another 66 pounds which brought his full weight just over 400 pounds total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I the biggest person ever yet?\" Jason asked, his voice was noticeably deeper now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned, \"Well, I've heard that Greg Kovacs would get up over 400 pounds but that was his off season weight which included a lot of fat. I'm willing to bet no one in history has ever been as big as you are now with next to no fat on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason growled approvingly and flexed his new 31 inch biceps, placing a kiss on the peak of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn, Laura.\" Samantha said handing over the dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny,\" Jason said, \"just this morning you would have been over the moon to be a 175 pound bodybuilder but now you're not even the biggest person in the room. And it's going to take some serious luck to close the gap between us. I'll tell you what, take 3 rolls. Let's see how close you can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked to Samantha. \"You okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah! I told you, I'm on muscle's side. The bigger the better. Besides, you're the one that decided to share this gift with us. Get all you can, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here goes.\"</span></div></div>",

Jason was right, even with two perfect rolls she would only hit 375, she definitely needed a third to even have the chance to match Jason.  And deep down she really wanted to be bigger.  She was no longer jealous of her brother or sister but as she looked at her friends she could feel that familiar sting of jealousy was still there.  She rattled the dice harder and frowned before finally letting them go.  Laura barely registered the numbers on the dice before scooping them up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, 89,\" Sam breathed, \"great roll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded once in agreement as she let the dice go again.  They rattled to a stop and Laura's friends both gasped at the new number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, 98!\"  Jason breathed as Laura snatched the dice back and shook them intensely.  She grimaced and shifted her stance when she realized her new assets were getting in the way of her forearm.  Laura paused to rub her breast then gave the dice one last angry shake and threw them down.  The three friends looked intently down as the dice rattled to a stop with two zeros showing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100,\" they all said at the same time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"287,' Laura said solemnly after taking a moment to silently add up her rolls.  She eagerly picked up her phone and began inputting the changes into the app.  Her hands were shaking with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Jason said with a tone of concern as his own mind processed this new turn of events.  \"Are you sure about this Laura?  That's over 460 pounds total, and you're still shorter than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure about what?\"  Laura looked up from her phone and stared at Jason with an intensity that made him take a step a backward.  \"Sure about being bigger than you?  What, are you jealous?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not,\" Jason sputtered, trying to put his thoughts back together as Laura looked back down at her phone in response to an unexpected beeping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome kind of popup was now on the screen, \"WARNING:  The proposed changes are outside the limits of normal human development and may cause unpredictable side effects.  Proceed?  YES/NO.\"  Laura's finger hovered over her phone's screen as she tried to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

Warning!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, hovered over the Yes and looked up at her friends... it was now or never... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grimaced only a little... and depressed the Yes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash of light... then blackness and then.... indescribable feeling of power... roared through her body... she moaned to the void and it moaned back.in triplicate... when her vision returned, she had to keep her jaw off the floor... which was easy, because her pectorals were almost as big as her breasts and jutted out... imperiously, gravity had no control... nor would it ever... she didn't know why that mattered at the moment but she stood... and noticed she rose higher and higher than she should've. She was 7' 10\" she noted abstractedly. Noticing her diminutive friends below she was in awe... as they appeared to be in her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is something lodged in my prodigiously gorgeous bust?\" Laura said coolly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, not exactly...,\" Jason said, his magnificent physique seemed wimpy even though he was like her a meta super human... *again something she didn't know she knew*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... just that you're... floating,\" Sara said rather imperceptibly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\" Laura looked down and after a bit of a struggle to look beyond her magnificent physique. \"I AM!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what that means... right?\" Jason said a bit downcast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n.. maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means you're part of the elite now, the elitist group of them all...,\" Sara said ending in a whisper... \"Demigod/goddesses...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" Laura was taken back a bit as her memories were filtering in this new world she had created n because of her 'game' with her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... on the bright side... you'll be able to see your sisters... again,\" Jason said still forlornly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis.. oh Georgina...and Vanessa... right, they made the elitist at puberty day one... I remember... now,\" Laura recalled watching her brother now (sister) Greg burst from her clothes and become so blindingly muscular and beautiful and her skull enlarge with her evolved brain... the next day she disappeared when the men from the God Society and took her away... since it was believed they were beyond such petty needs such as family and friends and could instead focus on evolving further until becoming actual gods or goddesses. Three years later Vanessa burst from her room and destroyed part of the house and her physique was even more awe inspiring... she flew off with a smirk before the society came calling. She joined her sibling without reservation. She wrote a single letter explaining her family while super 'human' was nice, being Demigoddess was so much more stimulating and that she would only miss Lulu but hoped the littlest sibling would soon join them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was her time, she frowned, she didn't want to leave her friends but she knew in a matter of hours they would be here... she might have been a late bloomer to Demigoddesshood but she had finally arrived and the new life she would embark upon would be so interesting... she looked at the phone and raised her eyebrow... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Warning!!! Histories incomplete further changes will be applied as system works please be patient and do not input further information until this warning disappears* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, so she couldn't do anything else until this weird godly phone program finishes rewriting the past and present she guessed. It was a moment of introspection that she realized everything she ever learned... was instantly available to her recall, proving her memory and brain were changing to adapt to her changing self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shivered as she felt her reflexes improve a thousand fold and then another thousand fold on top of that. She lowered herself to the ground now, knowing how her powers, yes her 'abilities' which would increase ten fold or a hundred fold in the hours since she evolved worked. New parts of her cerebral cortex were lighting up with control centers for her yet untested abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned now, she would have to leave... it sucked... she knew the God Society was a secretive society that formed long ago... when people went from normal to super... to meta... and finally demigod... it was believed that their would be a meta super human which was proven in less than a hundred years... and from their the near deity level... which showed up fifty years later... eventually it was hypothesized than the human race would soon cease to exist and everyone would become more thanks to the advances in sciences that were never lost during the Dark Ages that thankfully never happened... in this universe. The society then deemed there would be one that would become the God/Goddess in true embodiment and would lead the super race into the universe.. to rule in peace and prosperity forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she would see inside this elusive society and see her siblings... she went to the wall outside her room and looked at her family photos... her mother and father double in height and insanely ripped, her siblings starting out fairly normal but by the time 5yrs old rolled around it was evident that Georgina and then eventually Vanessa were something more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice as tall as Laura in a span of moments, she still short and plain looking of the new 'normal' in this reality which was fitness level competitor for kids her age... until she hit 9yrs old... then she grew as big as her siblings were... and her parents were so proud to have produced three exceptionally empowered children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason came up behind her, he put his immense hand on her shoulders and squeezed with all his might but sadly couldn't make even a ripple in her musculature...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go out and have one last hurrah together, eh?\" Jason said amiably, forcing out a grin he didn't feel like giving but had to for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's go. Sara!! You coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara nodded reluctantly and stood, from her diminutive height of 4' 11\" in the previous reality to the 6' 10\" height she had now... she looked so incredibly gorgeous with her fabulous chest and superior Asian backed beauty that now Laura eclipsed, she could feel her face remodeling her facial features to accentuate her beauty hundred thousand fold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura frowned thoughtfully at the warning and sighed. She tapped her finger on \"No\" and slowly rotated the model of her virtual self with a critical eye.  Maybe some proportions didn't look quite right?  Was that what the warning was about?  Maybe something worse than bad proportion would happen?  Either way it wasn't worth the risk right now. She could always mess with the app more later if she wanted to push it past the warning point.  She looked around the screen as she pondered what she was going to do next and noticed a small exclamation point blinking next to the pounds of muscle mass still pending application. <br>\r\n Laura slowly dragged the slider down until the blinking icon disappeared.  She frowned again as she nudged the slider back upward again until it re-appeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"  Jason asked eventually as Laura continued to adjust the weight into smaller and smaller units, trying to get the absolute maximum amount of muscle onto her frame as the app would allow, no matter how minuscule the increment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right, maybe over 460 pounds is too big.  But I'm still going to be bigger than you,\" Laura said finally, having reached the maximum apparent amount of muscle her current frame was able to handle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big is that?\" Jason and Sam both asked as Laura's thumb flicked across \"Apply changes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" she started to say.  She was cut off mid breath as her body suddenly stiffened.  This change felt much different than her previous ones and she struggled to catch her breath as her muscles began quivering.  Her phone tumbled from her hand and Jason lunged to grab it before it hit the floor.  His initial reaction of joy at saving the phone was immediately replaced by concern as he looked back at Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura struggled to nod her head or say something but only a grunt came out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam leaned forward and reached towards the phone.  \"You have to stop it Jason, she's in pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  Laura's voice thundered, surprising both of her friends.  Laura had finally caught her breath and now her lungs were heaving like bellows.  \"No,\" she said again. \"I'll be fine, it just took me by surprise.\"  She tried to find the words to describe how she was feeling but it was just so overwhelming.  Instead of feeling like her muscles were merely  growing in response to the app something else was happening, it felt like her entire body was being prepared for the growth that was coming.  She could feel her tendons and bones aching, she would even swear that she could feel her veins and airways burning as her body was restructuring itself to attain the absolute pinnacle of muscular development that it was capable of.  Laura grunted as those feelings faded and an intense burning built deep inside her muscles.  Another ragged breath tore through her body and became a low moan.  \"Oh my god this feels. So. GOOD!\" Laura gasped through gritted teeth as she finally feel the growth she had been waiting for begin.  Her skin stretched taut as her muscles strained against it, surging outward in every direction.  \"YES!\" She shouted, not even caring that she was obviously riding the crest of another growth fueled orgasm.  Jason involuntarily took a step backward as Laura's muscles continued to swell with no sign of slowing or stopping.  He glanced down at the phone to see the image of the body Laura was in the process of growing into and almost dropped the phone himself with shock.  He carefully set the phone down on Laura's desk with shaking hands and took another step backward.  Laura let out a low chuckle that rumbled across the room as she ran one hand down her hard, sculpted stomach and wrapped the other around her still growing upper arm, enjoying the feeling of the stone-like muscle swelling under her hand.  Her hand drifted further downward, dipping between her legs at which point she sank heavily to her knees with another shriek of ecstasy, while the entire room shook from the impact.  She threw her head back as she kneaded one of her breasts and continued to pleasure herself, easily bringing herself to another loud orgasm.  Laura's let out a ragged sigh and moaned happily as her growth finally slowed to a stop.  For a moment the room was filled only with the sounds of her heavy breathing and the overwhelming scents of sex and sweat.  Finally Laura stood up and surveyed her body, poking, prodding and flexing while Jason and Sam both unconsciously backed away from her.  Laura couldn't even be described as huge, no simple adjective was enough to capture not only the sheer size of her muscles but also the sheer, raw power they obviously contained.  No matter how she moved, no matter how she held herself she looked like she was coiled tight and ready to explode.  Jason mentally searched for any fictional depiction of a muscular human that came close to capturing the kind of strength Laura obviously contained, not even the Hulk had ever looked as though he held as much potential power.  Laura giggled as she extended a leg out in front of her and flexed her thigh, making the muscles jump.  \"Holy crap,\" she said finally.  \"I guess it's a good thing I didn't go any bigger, I don't where any more muscle would possibly fit.\"  Both of her friends nodded with numb agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you still look girly,\" Sam said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Laura said, finally taking her eyes off of herself to regard her friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam could tell she flinched in reaction to Laura's attention and she swallowed, telling herself her friend would never hurt her but it was hard to not feel overwhelmed just by the sheer physical presence Laura now had.  \"I mean,\" Sam swallowed again, trying to find her voice.  \"I mean you still have those new boobs and all but even if you didn't you still have a great figure.\"  A note of fear crept into Sam's voice as she said it, she didn't want to sound like she was criticizing her friend's new body.  \"Like some muscular chicks look kind of like dudes but you look great,' Sam continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do look really good,\" Jason agreed.  His erection twitched, very clearly showing what he thought of his friends newest body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura swept a handful of sweaty hair back from her forehead and both of her friends flinched backward again.  Laura chuckled nervously, \"it's OK guys, it's still me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled nervously himself, \"sure you are, but I don't think you fully understand how fucking massive you are now.  It's kind of intimidating,\" Jason began to reach towards the phone but Laura's arm flew out faster than expected and swept it up.  Sam and Jason both jumped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously guys, relax.\"  Laura looked back and forth between her friends.  \"I think we messed with this thing enough for right now, what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam glanced back and forth between her two friends with thinly veiled lust in her eyes.  \"I can easily think of some things we should do next,\" she said with a deliberately husky voice that made Jason's cock twitch noticeably again.  Sam hefted one of her breasts and smirked at them both.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure there's at least one thing you want to change right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the trouble, there are several. I just don't think I want to decide right this second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should pick now before we move on.\" Jason said folding his arms across his chest and trying to look stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Samantha said and mimicked Jason's stance, or at least she attempted to. Her first try at folding her arms were foiled by her huge breasts so she instead tried to fold them underneath her bosom which only served to set her boobs to jiggling which elicited a laugh from everyone around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the laughing subsided Laura feigned indignant annoyance, \"Fine then! I want to be taller.\" She half expected either Jason or Sam to agree that was to great a change and to go for something else but they both seemed fine with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Samantha said. \"How tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Laura decided to push the boundaries of their game and aim high, at the same time she could feel that familiar warmth returning to her loins at the prospect of another body modification. \"Six foot four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Samantha both made the same shocked expression. Jason was the one to speak, though, \"Wow! Okay, you really want to go for it, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed a little. \"I've always wondered what it would be like to look down on Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to find out,\" Samantha said tapping the hand that held the magical iPhone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura set to work adjusting her height in the app. It was an easy matter of changing her height stat from 5'4 to 6'4 but once she did she frowned. There were no reference points around her avatar so all it looked like was that she had reduced her muscle mass. Laura knew this was due to the same muscle being spread out over a greater surface but she wasn't sure if she wanted to slim down like that. She reminded herself that they would be starting the next of many rounds and she would have plenty of chances to buff up some more. Then another feature caught her eye, one that would allow her to adjust the ratio of length between her torso and legs. She adjusted this setting giving herself insanely long legs. For a moment she wondered if this could be considered a second change and dismissed the thought as it was still bundled in her height increase, just much of her new height was going to a specific area. Without any further hesitation Laura pressed \"apply changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before Laura was infused with electric heat that seemed to will her body to change. This time the force burned right through the entire core of her seeming to electrify her very bones. An instant later the ground seemed to be moving away. The strange movement of the room around her steadily downwards made her dizzy and as much as she wanted to watch her body transform she just couldn't take it anymore and had to close her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the energy subsided and Laura was able to open her eyes again. She almost didn't recognize her own room now that she was viewing it from such a different vantage point. She looked to Jason and smiled when she realized she now stood four inches taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey short stuff!\" Laura said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason held up his penis which, even though it was soft, still measured nine inches. \"I don't think anyone can ever call me short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took stock of her body. While she was a little bummed that she didn't seem as muscular anymore she did love that she was still very defined. Her abs still looked carved from stone, her chest and arms were cut, and her legs... oh goodness, her legs were long and shapely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wasn't the only one impressed, Samantha whistled then said, \"All you need for those legs are some high heels and a mini skirt and you'll stop men's hearts. You're a goddamn weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura liked the thought of finding some sexy outfit to wear and show off her new body but she had a deeper desire. \"I don't want to stop their hearts I want to crush their bodies. Let's get round two going, I want more muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Jason said, ready as well. He held up the six sided die, \"Same rules as before? I'm one and two, Sam is three and four, Laura, you're five and six. We roll for player then muscle or boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or cock,\" Samantha said pressing her naked breasts against Jason's arm. It was clear that she was becoming much more comfortable with her body as well as he affection for Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed as he wrapped an arm around Samantha's waist and held her close savoring the soft feel of her boobs. \"Fuck that,\" he said, \"I've already got more than either of you can handle. I'm with Laura, bring on the beef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tossed the die across the room past Laura. The giant turned, still getting used to her new height, and bent down to see the result of the throw. \"Damnit, I didn't get it,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's it going to be this time?\" Samantha asked.</span></div></div>",

Samantha had had a crush on Jason for who he was, and Laura wasn't sure that it would remain the same if Jason changed; Samantha might not like him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the crowd, Laura spotted some more of her friends, ones that were a few years younger. They were two teens, Matt and Katie. Matt was about 5'11\", and was pretty skinny for his height, at only 120 lbs.. He was very smart, but also very shy. He had dirty blonde hair as well. Katie was 5'8\", and was fairly fit at 125 lbs.. She was stronger than Matt, but she never brought that up. She had B-Cup breasts, but on her they looked beautiful. She had dirty blonde hair that went to her shoulders. She had a playful, but not, mean personality. The two were both 15, and had started dating a few months ago, when they found out how much they actually liked each other. Since then, there love for each other only grew stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it couldn't hurt, Laura decided to pull up Katie on the app. Suprisingly, the app pulled up a perfect copy of her, even including her current blue bikini. Looking at all the different options on the app, but found an interesting option: Personality. Looking through that, she found out that it was possible to change someone's personality, any aspect of it. Laura looked through it, and even found a love interests section. Looking at it, Laura saw that Katie had a deep love for Matt. Moving the slider as high up as she could get it, it now said the connection between the two was \"Soulmates\", and said that they would be inseparable. Smiling, Laura realized that she could change her friends without any qualms over them breaking up. She went to the main menu and pressed accept, but a small warning popped up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Love Interest option you have selected for \"Katie Nolwind\" will also change \"Matt Anderson\"'s Love Interest option to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura knew that's what she wanted, so she pressed yes. Now she was going to use the app to either make Matt as big as a bodybuilder, someone Greg would be envious of, or make Katie grow into a supermodel, someone that Vanessa would be envious of, or both! She just hoped that the two wouldn't have sex before they should, the reason for Laura's worry being that she made thrm love each other extremely.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura focused in on Eric. She hadn\u2019t seen much of him in a few years, for some reason he and Greg didn\u2019t hang out anymore, but her heart still fluttered when she saw him. The way he was sitting she could only see the side of his face, but it looked as handsome as ever, perhaps even more so as he now had an air of maturity about him. She was a bit sad that after graduating high school Eric hadn\u2019t kept up his fitness habits, in the past she had loved watching the way his muscular body would move and bulge with the slightest twitch. Because of Eric\u2019s physique Laura had always had a bit of a muscle lust but since watching Greg explode in size and seeing his new crop of massive friends her desire for a buff boyfriend had grown as well. Now she could potentially merge her fantasies into one. \u201cThe bigger the better, right?\u201d she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped on Eric\u2019s image on the phone and was given a 3D model to play with. She grinned and she went to work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was angry. The truth was Eric was always angry, or at least that\u2019s how it seemed these days. He sat on a bench watching countless beautiful people go by and thought about the days when he was one of them. In high school he had had a beautiful body, strong, lean, toned; now he was soft, flabby and pudgy. He held a beer in his hand and raised it to his lips then frowned when he found it empty. He expertly tossed the empty into a nearby trashcan then reached into a small cooler at his feet and pulled out a fresh beer. He cracked it open and took a long drag then glared at a group of hardbodies playing volleyball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe real problem is this fucking town,\u201d Eric said out loud not caring who heard him. \u201cToo many fucking bodybuilders, it\u2019s meathead central. If I didn\u2019t have to see them all the time I wouldn\u2019t be so miserable.\u201d He spotted his old friend Greg in the distance and thought about the days when the two had been close. Greg had always been stronger but Eric had the good looks; at the time he was such a ladies man that he had dated Greg\u2019s sister, Vanessa, who was one incredible specimen when it came to perfect tits and ass. Just remembering the way she used to bounce on his dick, her giant boobs flopping all over the place, got him hard. Well, as hard as he could get while wasted on the better part of a 12 pack of beer. Eric rubbed his crotch a few times massaging his soft erection without a care that he was being watched by a few passersby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric glared at Greg and his muscular friends as they laughed and showed off for a group of girls in tiny bikinis. \u201cIf that asshole hadn\u2019t just left me hanging I could have been all buff too.\u201d Of course Greg had desperately tried to get Eric to come to the gym with him but instead Eric had become a drunk and spiraled so out of control that Greg had no choice but to cut his former friend from his life. \u201cI know he was just scared that I would show him up, get bigger than he could keep up with. Typical chickenshit meathead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Eric became extremely dizzy and his body began to burn with a strange heat as if a volcano had gone off in his chest and was now filling his veins with lava. He stumbled to his feet and wandered onto the bike path while joggers and cyclists swerved around him. HIs first thought was that he was having a heart attack but that fear went away when he began to feel good, like really, really good. The lava in his veins was filling his body with power. Eric was breathing heavy but then began grunting from a combination of pleasure and overwhelming strength. He felt his t-shirt constricting around his torso and forced himself to open his eyes. She smiled when he saw that, as he suspected based on the feeling in his body, that his shirt wasn\u2019t shrinking after all, he was growing. His shirt, formally loose, was tight around massive pectorals and widening shoulders and was crying out in a symphony of pops and snaps. Eric raised his arms and flexed brand new 17 inch cannons that tore through his short sleeves like they were made of tissue. At the same time he could feel his denim shorts opening along he sides as his thighs expanded outward in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small crowd had gathered around the mysterious swelling man which only made Eric bolder. He lowered his arms and pulled them in with his elbows at his sides. He gave his chest a quick but hard flex and popped right out of his shirt sending a gasp like a wave through the onlookers. Eric laughed and began putting on a show for his public moving from pose to pose mimicking the bodybuilders he\u2019d loathed for so long. His body was still rapidly expanding and sometimes he would hit the same pose twice just to make it look like his flexing was causing him to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric\u2019s 6 foot 2 inch body now carried Olympian levels of muscle and he was still swelling. He was covered in sweat and breathing heavy but he had never felt stronger or more powerful in his life. He turned to the bench he\u2019d been sitting on which was made entirely our of concrete. Without even thinking or hesitating Eric brought his fist down on the foot thick slab that made up the seat and broke it into 2 huge pieces. He picked up one chunk in each hand knowing that they must each weigh several hundred pounds but feeling to strain at all. He stretched his arms out to each side then clapped the concrete pieces together in front of his chest demolishing each of them into dust. Then he curled his arms inward and flexed monstrous muscles never before seen on a human being while roaring like a beast. Everyone who had stopped to watch the odd display took a step back from the crazed muscle monster who was somehow still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Eric felt the heat leaving his body. \u201cAww, I was just getting started. Still,\u201d he raised his arms into a double biceps pose and whistled at his nearly 30 inch arms, \u201ccan\u2019t be disappointed with these guns.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d A woman asked stepping forward from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sneered. \u201cI have no idea and frankly I don\u2019t give a shit. Now stay out of my way, I\u2019ve got some payback to dish out.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From her parents balcony Laura watched Eric transform into a super powered beast just as she had programmed. Her panties were soaked through from the excitement of seeing her fantasies realized and the proof that her phone now out her in control of amazing powers. Her day, her life, was about to go from good to incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for phase two!\" Laura said then began tapping quickly on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt invincible and as he began stalking towards Greg he thought about all the things he wanted to do to his former friend. His life had taken a sharp turn downwards right around the time Greg started bodybuilding and left him with no one to call a friend. Several years of pumping iron had given Greg a giant ego to go with his big muscles but now Eric was the bigger one and Greg was going to see what real strength looked like. Eric tensed his 29 inch arms and felt the power flow through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and his buddies were less then a hundred yards away now and none of them yet saw the impossibly large Eric heading their way. That was just like them, Eric thought, so lost in themselves they didn't even see their own doom on the horizon. Eric could also see Vanessa sitting on her towel and talking with some beefed up hunk. Vanessa always did like her guys to have big muscles, that was one of the things that drew her to Eric back in high school. Now he'd have her back for sure, after all no one had bigger muscles than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, 50 yards from his targets, Eric suddenly was overcome by thoughts and even feelings about Greg and Vanessa's younger sister. The feeling was so strange he stopped in his tracks. Eric hadn't thought about Laura in years, why would she pop into his head now? He'd never even really liked Laura; not that she was bad or anything, just she was so plain and ordinary compared to her older siblings. Still, he couldn't think of anyone else, even his anger with Greg, though still very real, took a backseat to his need to see Laura again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turned and began making his way to the house he swore he would never set foot in again looking for the girl he hardly ever noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Eric was knocking on Laura's front door hoping she would be home. Almost instantly the door opened and he was greeted by a girl who was older than the last time he'd seen her but no more attractive. As she regarded his enormous bare chest with hunger in her eyes Eric again tried to figure out why he was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm,\"Laura practically purred, \"you look a million time better up clothe. Come on in and have a stheat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric did as he was told. He actually felt nervous, like he wanted Laura to like him and wasn't sure if she would. He entered the living room and sat on the couch which groaned under his weight but held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura entered holding her phone and grinning from ear to ear. \"Tho, what bringth you here?\" Laura asked then giggled as if her question was just so silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric frowned. What was he even doing here? Why did he give a damn what this girl thought about him? She was as plain as ever: short, too skinny, no tits, ugly hair, and now she was speaking with a lisp. That was new, did she have a retainer or something? Everything about this day was beyond strange, but still he pined for her affection so he decided to talk about his obvious new feature. \"You, uh... um, don't really seem all that surprised by my, you know, uh, my muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pthat's becauth I'm not.\" She wiped some drool from her chin. She pointed at her mouth and shrugged, \"Thorry, thith will make thence in a minute. Firth we need to make one more change to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lit up, \"Change? Then you did this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded, her grin getting even bigger. \"Yep, I gave you thothe huge, thexy muthulth and now I just need to grow one more to matth the reth.\" Her eyes traveled over the swell of his pecs, beyond the hard ridges of his abs to his crotch where his shorts still held somehow though the denim around this thighs flapped open and free almost like a strange skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't completely understand what Laura was saying, but it sounded like she had made his super powerful and now was going to make his penis grow too. But how, and, for that matter, why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura held up her phone and tapped a few times on the screen. \"Tho, how big do you want it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was caught off guard by the offer. \"How big can it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up, \"Well, we've got ten foot thelings, if you want to go beyond that we'll have to go outthide.\" She wiped more drool from her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not kidding, are you?\" Eric had to think, his dick had always been pretty average and he had frequently dreamed of being bigger. A foot seemed like a good size, but there were people in the world that actually had foot long cocks. He wasn't a normal person anymore, he was beyond huge and his penis would be too. \"Make me twenty inches long and as thick as a beer can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thur thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura made a few more taps on her phone and suddenly Eric could feel fire burning in him once again, but this time it was all in his groin. He immediately felt like he was going to come and he grabbed onto the cushions on either side of him. A second later Eric heard a pop then felt cool air on his cock. It felt bigger and harder than ever before and he could feel the head continuing to rise.  He grabbed his huge shaft and could feel it thickening in his hand until his fingers were no longer touching his thumb. At last his apple sized head stood so high that not even his giant pecs could hide it from his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric ran his hand up and down his giant pole squeezing in various places and finding that, even with his superhuman strength, there was no give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'th hard, ithn't it? I made it even thronger than your body. You could plow a hole through a theel.. a thhh..\" Laura was visibly frustrated with her ability to speak. She slowed down and enunciated as best she could. \"A steel wall. Plus I removed any need for recovery time, increathed the thize of your load, gave you total control over your erecthionth... uh, erections, and made your tethtaculth, er, balls, a lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you do all this for me?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed a little. \"Well, I like you. And I want you to like me too. Pluth I wanted to teth out my new powerth. Now,\" she took a few steps towards him and reached her hand out placing it on the head of his penis and giving a firm squeeze, \"I can finally thow you why I can't talk well. I wath able to make one change to mythelf before you arrived. Take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pursed her lips and stuck her tongue out, and out, and out. Eric's eyes went wide as Laura's tongue kept getting longer inch by inch curving down like a slide. It reached six inches long before she slurped it back up again. \"Pretty cool, huh? And that'th not all, it'th thooper thretchy too. And I can do all kindth of trickth with it. Watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her ridiculous tongue out once more then stretched it even further until it was a foot long. Then she began making it ungulate like waves moving across a plane before she rolled it up like a tape measure and closed her lips around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was insane!\" Eric yelled both out of excitement and fear. What he saw was both creepy and intriguing and he was curious to see where this was leading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura spoke slowly to try to mitigate her lisp. \"It's really strong, too. Really, really strong.\" She paused and reality set in a bit. \"Weird, I know. But I wanted to do something special. You have the body of a god with a cock to match. I need to be able to give a blowjob worthy of your new prowess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eric could respond Laura slid between his giant thighs and wrapped her lips around his giant penis head. Her tongue slithered out and began wrapping around his shaft like a ribbon on a maypole. Eric moaned from the feel of wet warmth wrapping around his penis but then Laura showed him just how strong her tongue was. It felt like a boa constrictor had just tightened around him and he realized that she was exerting force beyond what he had been capable of using his hands. Her tongue then began pulsing, writhing, and squeezing all along the top half of his cock while her hands slowly pumped the lower half. Eric was in heaven; never in his life had he experienced such overwhelming waves of pleasure. He roared his approval and moaned so loud the windows rattled. After a mere 30 seconds of oral ecstasy Eric came hard dumping loads down Laura's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done he expected Laura to release him but instead she only sucked and licked harder moving her hands faster demanding him to come again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sucked Eric's cock for 2 full hours until they both were sweaty and sticky though Laura was a lot more worn out than Eric, the big man still felt like he could run a marathon at super speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had climbed up onto Eric's broad chest and was running her hand over the swell of his pectorals. \"Did I please you?\" she asked. She was glad that she was getting better at speaking with her enlarged tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible. I don't know how I could ever repay you.\" Eric said wrapping his enormous arm around Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just the tip of the ithberg. Now I want you to tell me how to change my appearance. Make me your dream girl. Huge boobs, long legs, muscles like yours, anything. I'll be your goddess.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Goddess</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's words hung in Eric's mind. Somehow this girl had created muscles from nowhere, given him a monstrous cock, given herself a freaky yet wonderful snake-tongue. How? Maybe she was already a goddess. No wait, hadn't she done something on her phone a minute ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop fucking worrying about it</i>, a voice in his head screamed, <i>she's offering to become anything you want right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all so weird, but a flex of his arms and chest reminded him that it was no less real. \"My goddess, huh?\" Eric asked. \"Does that make me a god?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura purred from her place on Eric's lap and stroked his chest. \"You're my god, for thure.\" Her lisp was getting a little better but she still struggled to speak with her oversized tongue. Laura squeezed Eric's pecs, then his shoulders. \"But you're right, perhapth just a demigod at the moment. Maybe thereth thill more we can do together to become literal godths and thow the world our power. First make me your dream woman, I want to make you come just by looking at me.\" Laura stood up and posed before Eric. She knew she wasn't much to look at now, but that was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked dumbfounded. \"Wow, where to begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and picked up her phone. \"How about height. How tall is your dream woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric thought about it. \"Tall, but not as tall as me. Maybe like five foot ten. And, like, long legs. Crazy long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting to five-ten will add about thix inches to my height, I'll put it all into my legs. What else? How about the rest of my figure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big hips and a huge booty. Seriously, I want your ass so big and round that finding pants that fit is a real problem. Hips so wide they feel like handles for fucking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura moaned slightly. \"I love it, what else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tits.\" Eric said. He was easing into his role as designer and his base desires were coming out in full force. \"Big ones,\" he added, his hands hovering over his own chest to show her what size he had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura closed her eyes and moaned again. \"Oh yeah, baby. What else do you want? How about my muthulth\u2026 er muscles? A hunk like you deserves someone that can keep up with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric considered this. \"Yeah, but a little muscle on a woman goes a long way. I love a good hardbody, six pack, fit legs, but don't go making yourself into some bodybuilder chick. That's just gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura fought off a frown but then nodded. \"As you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric continued, \"But you're right, you know. You gotta be able to keep up with me in the sack. Is there a way you can give yourself super endurance or something? Like enough to fuck me all night long and not get tired.\" Eric tested out his ability to bring his penis to instant erection and began stroking the huge shaft. \"This beast is hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, I was going to do that anyway.\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Eric frowned at his 20 inch erection. \"And I guess you'd better shrink me down some or I'll never fit inside you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that, I've got a plan.\" This time Laura didn't even look up from her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura continued to tap away at her iPhone Eric raised an arm and began pumping his impossibly huge 30 inch bicep, his other hand continuing to stroke his enormous cock. Tensing his fist and watching the peak of his arm surge upward he could feel power crackle within his muscles. \"How strong did you make me?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very,\" Laura said. This time she stopped tapping her phone's screen for a moment and shifted her eyes to meet Eric's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric squeezed his fist for all it was worth and watched muscle fibers bristle across his mountainous bicep. His veins were so jacked they looked like they were sitting atop his skin. \"Right,\" he said returning her gaze, \"but how strong?\" His thoughts returned to the concrete bench he destroyed with his bare hands and how easy it was. The word \"superhuman\" was dancing around in his head and he really liked the sound of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped what she was doing with her phone and dropped her hands to her hips. Eric couldn't quite figure out the look she was giving him. It was equal parts suspicious and mischievous. After a long pause Laura smiled, \"After adjusting the size of your muscles I found an additional thlider that focused on thrength. Sorry, strength. I set it to ten meaning that if someone your size would normally be able to bench press five hundred poundth, you'd be able to bench five thousand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was shocked. He knew he was strong but that was well beyond what he had even imagined. Looking down at his engorged chest and arms he said, \"I have a feeling that someone this size would normally be able to bench more than five hundred pounds, too. How high does that strength slider go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched Laura's expression shift from mischievous to downright sinister. \"Why do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing they were on the same page Eric said, \"I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a little revenge in mind. There are a few people out there that I think have some payback coming their way. It may be petty but I just figure that the more power at our disposal the better. It would be kind of nice to run this town, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded slowly with a look that said she was mulling this thought over in her mind. \"Run this town, eh? Interesting idea. There's just one problem.\" She raised her phone and gave the screen a single tap before setting it down on an end table next to the couch Eric was sitting on. She then stood before him but didn't finish her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was about to ask her to go on when he noticed that her skin was flushed and she was beginning to sweat. All at once her face looked radically different. No longer plan and forgetful she was gorgeous. No, she was beyond gorgeous; she was perfect. Facial features that were somehow both chiseled and hard while also soft and feminine. Eric spent so much time staring at her incredible face that he never saw her hair change and only noticed after the fact that she now had a thick mane of shimmering gold spilling over her shoulders and halfway down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of snapping fabric drew Eric's attention down to Laura's shirt. Moments ago her top had been loose over a flat chest but now large breasts had grown from nowhere and were stretching her shirt to the breaking point. Laura grabbed at her swelling chest and gasped while she closed her eyes and rolled her head back in ecstasy. Looking further south Eric saw that Laura's pants also weren't fitting so well anymore, the bottoms had risen all the way to her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Laura looked pained and she gritted her teeth while the hourglass figure that Eric had requested fought against her clothing. She sucked in a deep breath and all at once her shirt popped open and her pants exploded off of her. Her dimensions were incredible, a large bust (already far larger than Vanessa's) continued to swell above a slender waist that was lined with tight abdominal muscles. Just below that was a pair of wide hips. Laura turned slightly to take a look at her rear and Eric nearly lost his mind. Her ass was huge, round, and perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the heat left Laura's body and she let out a long, pleasurable sigh. She hefted her volleyball-sized breasts in her hands and giggled to herself, then, leaving her boobs hanging in perfect teardrops, she ran her hands down her hips feeling her new contours and curves. She purred and swiveled her hips from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laura remembered that Eric was still watching. She leapt onto his lap like a tiger and, without hesitation, grabbed the head of his enormous cock and placed it against her sex. The heat coming out of her made Eric feel like his penis was up against a furnace, he longed to enter her but knew he was just too big. Nonetheless Laura pressed herself down with all of her weight adjusting slightly from side to side forcing his cockhead into her. A sudden pop and he was in causing them both to gasp in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to Eric's shock, Laura continued to slid down his 20 inch pole, little by little. His penis was on fire and her juices were flowing out and down his shaft. Every moment he expected her to cry out because she'd bottomed out but she kept taking more and more of him into her. Inch after inch she drew him in, Eric had never felt a pussy so tight in all his life but he also realized that a penis as thick as a beer can would be tight in any woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura started crying out in quick shouts but still she forced herself downward. Eric was certain that she was coming because he could feel the muscles around his penis tensing and spasming. With one final shove Laura's vagina touched Eric's pelvis, his entire 20 inch monster was inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took gasping breaths, her body was covered in sweat but she still looked as beautiful as ever. \"There, you see. I told you I had a plan for that monster of yours.\" Her voice was deeper, more sultry, and her lisp was completely gone. She swiveled her hips around in a circle and laughed as Eric let out a surprised grunt. \"As I was saying, why just run this town when we can make the world our bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightbulb went off in Eric's head.<i> I like how this girl's mind works</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now fuck me, my muscle god.\" Laura said with a fire burning in her eyes. \"Earn your power, fuck me like there's no tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's big hands grabbed Laura's hips and ass roughly. He was more than happy to comply.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki couldn't help but be a little embarrassed to be hanging out by the Meat Locker, in her mind this was the sort of place that only egocentric losers would come to hang out; or work out for that matter. The raised platform was perfect for beefy narcissists to put on a show of their superior physiques, and there were even rows of benches for girls and guys alike to surround the small gym and pay worship to their favorite muscle gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a normal day Nikki wouldn't have been caught dead anywhere near the place and had even, in the past, made fun of both the bodybuilders that frequented the establishment and the crowd that surrounded it. Today, though, wasn't a normal day and Nikki had to be supportive of her best friend Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a week ago Sara had been through a nasty break up with her former boyfriend, Greg. Now Sara was rebounding and wanted to prove to herself that she was still desirable and sexy (two things Greg had assured her that she wasn't anymore since she had added 30 pounds of sleek muscle to her frame during the time they had been dating) while also flirting with men who were even bigger than Greg. Much to Sara's delight that's exactly what they had found the moment they had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Nikki, look at these hunks.\" Sara had said as they walked up to the gym. \"Even the scrawniest guy here has a good 30 pounds on Greg's sorry ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki had been pretty sure that Sara was beginning to salivate. They made a few laps around the place before Sara pointed out a particularly built man working out his massive arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one?\" Nikki asked. She was doing her best to be supportive but this whole endeavor felt a little pathetic. \"He's a midget!\" The man stood about 5' 4\" and was the shortest guy on the workout stage, though his short stature made his bulk that much more impressive looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's enormous,\" Sara said. \"And gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki had to admit that he was quite handsome, and his physique was beyond compare. In fact Nikki was pretty sure the guy wouldn't do well in a bodybuilding competition because he was <i>too</i> big. She tried to let her cynicism slide and held any further comments while she and Sara sat and watched the big man work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki noticed that the big man and Sara very quickly began making eye contact with each other and after about half an hour of casual glances he came over to where they sat still carrying a huge dumbbell. Sara was on her feet immediately and approached the raised platform on which the big man stood. She was eye level with his monstrous quads which, Nikki noticed, were each about as big around as her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man introduced himself as Dan and shook both girls' hands. The girls gave their names back with Nikki making sure to give her full name, Nicole, in the hopes that Sara would hear the disapproval in her voice. Dan continued to pump his dumbbell as they spoke which annoyed Nikki a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great to meet you both,\" Dan said then pointed to Sara with his free hand, \"I'm pretty sure I've seen you down here a few times recently, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara blushed so bright that her face, neck and even her chest glowed red. Nikki gave her a look but then backed off; Sara had asked her here for support not judgements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan sensed the tension and moved on by complimenting Sara's muscle tone. \"You wear your muscle really well. I'd be willing to bet you could get even bigger if you wanted and still look beautiful. Do you compete? I could see you doing really well in bikini or even figure shows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki knew this was exactly what Sara had been hoping to hear and it instantly endeared her to Dan a little. Greg had done a number on her self esteem by telling her she looked bulky and mannish, he even called her ugly. Nikki knew this was so far from the truth it was laughable, her friend was stunning, but Greg's words had hit hard. Now Nikki saw relief in Sara's face that told her the pain was beginning to wash away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's kind of a dumb question, but do <i>you</i> compete?\" Nikki asked while Sara gathered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan grinned. \"Not a dumb question at all. Pretty perceptive of you really, you'd make a good judge. I do compete from time to time but I never place well. My body is pretty out of proportion, especially my arms.\" To prove his point Dan squeezed out a slow rep with the big dumbbell making his arm swell greatly. Nikki had to do her best not to roll her eyes when she heard Sara purr with approval. \"I don't know, I guess I just like being as big as I can be instead of winning shows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something of a Napoleon complex, I guess.\" As soon as the words were out of her mouth Nikki regretted them. She hadn't meant to dig on Dan's height and certainly hadn't meant for him to hear her doing it. Sara's eyes were wide with disbelief over her friend's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan, however, just let out a huge laugh. \"Yeah, I've been there. I was really bad in High School and the first half of college. My problem is that I've always been short but naturally very strong. When I started working out and building muscle, getting stronger, I was even worse. I always like to point out that there are tyrants and assholes of all shapes and sizes, fat, fit, tall, short, but that was one cliche, the Napoleon one, that was definitely true for me. And you know what's really funny? I found out later that Napoleon wasn't even short. I guess it was something people made up to tear him down a little. No excuse for me being an ass, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was genuinely curious. \"What happened? What changed you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked thoughtful for a moment. \"I hurt a girl that was really special to me. Not physically, mind you, I never hit her, but I guess I said some things that did more damage than my fists could have. That whole thing made me really look at who I was and why I was acting that way. And then a few days after that the offensive line of the football team kicked the shit out of me.\" Now Dan laughed again. \"That really put things in perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact is I really did start getting into bodybuilding and strength training because I was overcompensating for being short. I hated my height but now I realize it's just a part of who I am. These days I work out because it's fun. I build my body because I'm good at it and I just really love being big. And, not to be too forward, I love the looks I get from beautiful women like this one.\" He turned toward Sara. \"I can tell that you really, really love muscle on a man, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really, really do.\" Sara said with breathy desire. \"The bigger, the better. And I don't think I've seen anyone bigger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan puffed out his chest and tensed his arms and legs. \"Well, I know we've only just met but I really, really like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big man was just about to ask Sara if she'd like to go for a walk along the beach when something strange began to happen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura had always received top grades in school and was quite adept at computer programming, even though being the only girl in the advanced classes, she receive less attention from the instructor.  But now that she had a potential magical app at her disposal and wanted to see what it could do, she went about using those skills to gain more information about the three individuals she was focused on.  So running back to her room, she grabbed her laptop and using her phone for basic references, she searched out social media to gather data on the three.  Laura opened up a window to keep track of each person\u2019s vital statistics.  If she was going to change them, she thought, it would interesting to see their reactions.  She was already Facebook friends with Sara and quickly was able to get to Nikki as well.  Dan took a bit more digging, but she soon had all the information she needed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo typing up a summary she knew she had:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan Waters:  24 years old, 5 foot 4, 265 pounds.<br>\r\nSara Steele:  21 years old, 5 foot 6, 140 pounds<br>\r\nNikki Richards: 20 years old, 5 foot 9, 130 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura noted other stats, but those were easily seen from the app.  She caught up with the three as they had moved toward the edge of the workout area, possibly ready to walk along the beach.  Smiling, Laura focused back on Sara.  She had felt bad for her, seeing as Greg had treated her poorly when she started gaining muscle.  What better way to start some tests than to beef her up even more, seeing as Greg wasn\u2019t that far away.  Laura started working the phone and Sara\u2019s stats, deciding to focus on just a few things to start to see if this crazy app would even work.  With a smile on her face, Laura hit the Apply button and waited to see if anything changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara had blushed after Dan had stated that he really liked her and a broad smile sat on her beautiful face.  She then let out a surprised grunt as her muscles all tensed and jerked.  Her white athletic top and sports bra both tightened and she felt a sudden wave of energy sweep across her body, followed by more jerking as her muscles pulsed and then with another grunt, expanded across her frame.  Nikki was giving her a quizzical stare and Dan, who was about to ask her to take a stroll along the beach, gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSara, are you?  Are your muscles\u2026..growing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara flushed again as conflicting emotions washed through her.  She felt immense pleasure as she felt her muscles grow larger and seemingly denser with added strength, but she also felt concern that Dan, much like Greg, would be frightened off.  Not really caring about how this could happen, Sara nearly cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI..I think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer top split with a muffled tearing noise and Sara nearly instinctively pulled her arms up, ready to flex her expanding muscles.  She glanced teary eyed at Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan sucked in a breath.  \u201cSorry?  For what?  You\u2019re looking hotter by the moment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s frown turned toward to a relieved smile.  \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a ragged breath and gulping in some air, Sara allowed the energy to continue to flow and noticed that it was her arms, specifically her biceps that continued to snap with energy.  So as she pulled her arms up, she glanced at Dan and then at her right arm.  Incredible pleasure washed over Sara as she flexed her bicep and the once 13 inch bicep grew and grew.  Muscle fibers consolidated as the base of her lower bicep expanded across her arm and bulged up like a football, while her upper bicep pulsed higher and thicker into a solid ball of muscle the size of a softball.  Sara smiled as she mirrored the flexing of her right arm with her left, glancing back and forth between them as she continued to flex harder, driving more intense, cut muscle into her expanding biceps.  The rest of her body had stopping growing, settling into the body of a Greek Goddess with muscles the size and shape of a champion female bodybuilder.  But whatever magic had provided this incredible muscle growth; it was her biceps that received the greatest attention as they were approaching double their initial size, surpassing those of her former boyfriend and reaching those of the stunned and turned on Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki\u2019s eyes were like saucers.  Dan was building up an erection greater than he had ever felt before and Sara felt like a super woman, moaning a bit with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow!  The sensation is so intense!  I can just FEEL the power flowing into my biceps!  They\u2019re\u2026.they are enormous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final, hard flex, Sara\u2019s bicep finally stopped their impossible growth and settled into two of the largest muscles ever flexed by a female and by Nikki\u2019s estimation, even larger than the guns sported by Dan.  Holding her pose and still flush red from the experience, Sara giggled at the site of Nikki\u2019s stunned expression and Dan\u2019s tented shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone got a tape measurer?  I\u2019d love to see just how big these babies are now!  Greg\u2019s arms are now toothpicks compared to MY guns!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan shook his head, blinked at the smiling Sara and turned his head toward a spot he knew a tape measure sat.  He moved quickly to pick it up as Sara flipped her long blonde hair over one shoulder and continued to pump her right arm, staring at the giant ball of power dancing under her thin skin and rumbling into a mound of ripped muscle that peaked over her broad shoulder and pushed her forearm away.  Nikki moved closer and leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSara!  How\u2026how is this possible?  People don\u2019t just grow larger muscles out of the blue?  Are you related to the Hulk or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was highly intelligent, but this display was shorting her synapses.  Sara snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.  But whatever happened, it appears that Dan likes it.  What about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki wasn\u2019t so sure.  She had supported Sara\u2019s fitness endeavors and had no issue with the physique she was sporting moments ago.  But this was sudden and unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.I\u2019m still trying to get my head around this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nearly flushed at the now confident Sara, her expanded body and her oversized biceps.  Nikki always had the ability to add muscle quickly and she had done her level best to avoid lifting weights as that wasn\u2019t something she was interested in pursuing.  Even so, her legs were still very fit and to her previous dismay, were rather thick with muscle.  Now, however, for the first time, she felt a bit jealous of Nikki.  As Nikki bit her lower lip in thought, Dan had returned and was dutifully wrapping the tape around Sara\u2019s giant bicep and marveling over the hardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god Sara, your muscles\u2026.They\u2019re like STONE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara chuckled.  \u201cHmmmm.  Maybe even HARDER!  They certainly feel strong and powerful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan gulped as his erection pulsed and he pulled the tape into position.  Everyone tilted their head to stare at the readings as Dan sputtered out the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty eight inches.  Holy cow Sara, your bicep are twenty eight inches around!   That\u2019s two inches larger than mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara continued to beam, \u201cTwo inches, huh?  And I\u2019ll bet these guns are easily EIGHT inches bigger than Greg\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan shook his head with disbelief as he pulled off the tape and Sara finally released her incredible flex.  Placing her hands on her midsection, Sara thrust out one hip and tensed her body into a wall of feminine muscle and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how about a little strength test.  I need to see if these muscles are just for show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking toward a deadlift bar set for 850 pounds that a large man had just finished using, Sara walked up next to him and giving him a flirty smile asked, \u201cMind if I give this a try?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large man was taken aback and then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing honey.  But there\u2019s 850 pounds on there, you may want to pull a few plates off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara smiled and walking up the weight, reached down with both hands in a reverse grip.  \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m thinking I can give this a go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the large man, Dan and Nicki all looked on, Sara set herself, shook her thick, sexy, muscular ass and with nary a grunt, pulled the weight up in one smooth motion and held it for the shocked group.  Sara held her smile and winked at Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if thought that was impressive\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara focused for a moment, then with a light grunt, pulled the weight up toward her bulging, muscular chest, curling the huge weight with relative ease!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large bodybuilder backed up, clearly in awe and fear.  Nicki stood there stunned and Dan let out a shocked, \u201cHoly crap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara giggled as she allowed the weight to head back down and then with another giggle, started working out with the 850 pound dumbbell!  Rep after impossible rep was cranked out with piston precision and Sara\u2019s biceps bulged larger and appeared even harder as more detailed striations and veiny glory ripped to the surface of her larger than large super girl muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 hard lifts, Sara bent down and dropped the weight to the floor, stood up and pulled her arms back into a massive, awe inspiring double bicep pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!  I AM as strong as I feel.  And these biceps look even better and maybe even a little bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her mighty flex, Sara sauntered forward, passing Dan and Nicki, pausing at the end of the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone up for a walk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled herself away from the binoculars she had snagged from her brother\u2019s room and smiled.  The program for Sara obviously worked.  She was stronger than anyone, had big bulging muscles all around and a set of biceps to blow away most any man.  She couldn\u2019t here what they were saying, but the expressions and actions were making her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as she pulled up the phone again, she contemplated her next move.  With a mischievous smile, she decided to\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She aimed her camera at them and selected the tall redhead which brought up a 3D image of her on Laura's phone screen under the name Nicole. Various menus now became available, Laura tapped the 'Physical' tab and another selection of menus dropped down the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying with various sliders, Laura set Nicole's height to an amazonian 7', the muscularity setting she slid until Nicole toned up all over, her abdominals becoming washboard and defined muscles. Thinking it'd be fun to give her the advantage over the men, Laura giggled as she slid up the strength slider. Starting at 1x it read what Nicole could lift in pounds, at her base level it displayed 90lbs. Laura slid it right, at 5x it now said 450 pounds. Laura carried on wondering how far the slider would go, it showed no signs of stopping at 100x nor 1000x. Her thumb aching she let go, the slider sitting at 5000x base strength indicating now Nicole could lift 450,000lbs. \"Oh my!\" Laura gasped as she shocked herself, \"what if this actually works???\" she thought to herself. Wanting to test it already she tapped the Apply button and watched to see what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan was about to reach for Sara's hand when her friend's clothes suddenly snapped loose, making all three jump. Nicole was shocked, she reached to catch her failling bikini and tried her best to tie it back around her waist but realized it would barely fit. It was then that she noticed her abs. \"Woah! What the hell!?\", looking at the others she seemed shocked once more, \"Hey did you guys get smaller or something? No wait! HAHA! Its me! I'm bigger! Ooh look at these guns! How did this happen?!\" she excitedly barked forgetting to question logic as to how this could be possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah you're HOT!\" Dan exclaimed, completely transfixed on the goddess redhead before him, ignoring his former crush who he never noticed scowling at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am little man\" Nicole responded with an almost arrogance, \"now I know why you do this all day, I feel amazing! Haha and you've been doing this for years, how does it feel to see me achieve it in seconds? Haha!\" Nicole taunted, \"want to touch?\" as she flexed her bicep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to contain himself Dan reached almost straining due to the height difference and grabbed her bicep. Giving it a squeeze he couldn't even dent it, \"its as hard as steel!\" he shouted. \"Sara you wanna feel too?\" Nicole winked at her friend who couldn't even form a sentence due to her growing rage, \"No!\" she yelled and stormed away, her face red with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to see whos the strongest?\" she turned back to Dan with a grin. \"You're on!\" he replied, reaching for a 50lb barbell, \"Try a girly one for starters\" he winked back as he passed Nicole the bar. Accepting it with open palms, Nicole found it was completely wieghtless, \"HAHA! Seems I'm stronger than I look!\" she screamed as she began to curl the bar with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, lets add more weight, that must be a fake weight on it\" Dan said puzzled as he added two more 45lb plates to the bar as Nicole supported it in the air. The redhead began curling again, \"Hahaha! Nothing! This is boring, lets try something new!\", the girl grabbed the bar with both hands and began to push inwards. A gasp of delight escaped Nicole's lips as the iron groaned and the bar bent in half. Dan became errect in his speedos at the sight, \"oooooh oh.... myyy goddD!\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm oooh! NOW. THAT. IS. POWER! HAHA!\" Nicole bellowed, discarded the bent iron as she noticed Dan's bulge, reaching down to scoop him up with a single palm under his crotch, \"mmmm.... someone enjoyed that...\" she said with a wry grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was immensely turned on watching the display, her nipples were rock hard and she found her hand had slipped into her panties without realizing. This was too good of a show, she decided to play with the app once more with her free hand...</span></div></div>",

Glowing red hot metal discouraged the guy from even thinking about touching the handle. Occasionally moaning, still fondling herself, Nicole practiced the use of her heat-gaze. She had always been a quick learner it took her seconds to figure out how to control it properly. As a short exercise she merged the door with the metal doorframe, rendering it effectively unusable for all times.

Her fingertips brushed the ice-wall gently. Only now, she realised she was still carrying the ox, who had insulted her. Carelessly she dropped him on the ground, whimpering he started to crawl away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had superpowers\u2026 There was no way of denying it, her breath alone was able to create storms and freeze objects she had the body of a goddess, which was apparently even stronger than it looked\u2026 by now margin a small feat. She finally got the powerful muscles she had fantasised about her whole life. The amazon redhead turned around and hurried towards one of the mirror-walls. She longed to see the reflection of her new body. By now, she had completely blocked out the people around her, the noise their shouts and awed whispers created. Arriving at the mirrors, Nicole let out a pleased gasp, her body was more amazing than she had thought. Her shoulders were cannonballs and her biceps and triceps huge enough to match these. Her calves and glutes were bulging out more than she could have ever dreamed possible. Her ample breasts looked even larger on her massive pectorals, but despite her massiveness her body hadn\u2019t lost its feminine shape. Her mighty torso formed a perfect \u2018V\u2019, her tree-trunk-like legs were proportionally long and shaped and her cute face made her look almost angelic, with that broad joyous smile and sparkling, vivid eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m outta here!\u201d she heard the wanna-be-bully shouting. It broke the spell, which had obviously captured the other onlookers and many started to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, I should keep a low profile and find a less public place to test my new abilities, Nicole thought. Quickly she hurried into the men\u2019s changing room, searching for \u2018Grizzy\u2019s\u2019 locker. Arthur \u2018Grizzly\u2019 Ryan was one of the trainers, who owned his rather unsubtle nickname to his statue. He had been a professional bodybuilder for more than a decade and was the tallest and most muscular man, Nicole knew. Additionally, she knew he kept a second set of clothes in his locker, in case he spontaneously started a spare-time workout, so he hadn\u2019t o go home in sweaty clothes. Far from being shy about his body, \u2018Grizzly\u2019 nonetheless preferred wide, baggy clothes, which made them suitable for Nicole\u2019s new needs. She quickly found the metal cabinet, ignoring dumbfounded onlookers, half-dressed men fleeing in panic or more or less openly voiced protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrizzly\u2019s personal locker was a more sophisticated model than the average member lockers. It was clearly more massive and had a security lock, which was directly integrated into the door. Nicole\u2019s grin became even broader. Secretly, she had been hungrily looking for another opportunity to test her new strength, without delaying her escape too long. The locker was really heavy, small cracks on the floor tiles betrayed it had been hastily dropped into position, when it had been delivered. For a second she wondered why \u2018Grizzly\u2019 would need a locker more akin to a safe than a workout outfit and streetwear wardrobe. But without further delay, she moved in front of the locker and hoisted it about her head with contemptuous ease. Grunted protests were replaced by shouts of unbelief and shock, the last brave bystanders fled the room. Leaving the towering redhead alone, the locker still held above her head. To Nicole\u2019s delight it was as light as feather to her and she started to move it between her hands for some seconds. Finally, she held it one handed and ripped open the front door, toppling \u2018Grizzly\u2019s\u2019 belongings on the ground. But she wasn\u2019t finished with locker. She began squeezing the massive locker in her hands, trying to crush it into a ball. Almost disappointed she realised it was no real challenge, metal creaked and groaned as it gave way to her strength. It only took seconds to form the locker into a solid metal ball. With a giggle, Nicole dropped it on the floor unceremoniously. It cracked several floor tiles and dug and left a small impact crater, while Nicole started to put on \u2018Grizzly\u2019s\u2019 clothes. They were a bit too tight and too short on some places, despite the fact Grizzly measured impressive 6\u20195\u2019\u2019, but at least they covered her. She put on his base-cap and approached the emergency exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

She collected herself, sighing in pleasure from the feelings of her super senses. Calling her wet would be an understatement. She soon walked outside, noticing the entire gym was completely empty, not even noticing Laura. She smacked her lips and giggled. \"You'd think they'd be amazed! They just saw the worlds ONLY SUPERGIRL!\" She laughed as she walked towards the door, soon realizing there were sirens blaring outside. \"The police?!

She shook her head to snap out of it. \"No! Not right now girl! Right now you need to test these super powers!\" Hearing herself say that caused her to shiver. Super powers. Fucking SUPER POWERS.

Usually she enjoyed the sensation of warm water following the contours of her hard body, seeing her breasts and muscles creating myriads of small waterfalls, but now she was just trying to wash away the mind and body-numbing feeling of betrayal. Nicole had been there to support her, not vanquish her and steal her Dan\u2026 Well, technically stealing wasn\u2019t the correct term, but she hadn\u2019t even been interested in him before. Within a heartbeat she had stolen Dan\u2019s attention and her body had transformed into a body Sara secretly dreamed of. Now she was uninteresting again and her \u2018best feature\u2019, her muscles, was just laughable compared to her friends\u2019 mighty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, Nicole?\u201d Sara sobbed, the shower drowning the noise, coating her body with warm water, while she felt cold and left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura glimpsed at Sara\u2019s image. Nicole was a real stunner, but Dan wasn\u2019t her type. Maybe she could arrange for something far more attractive. Loading a quickly taken picture of Sara, she opened the body-slider menu. Still pleasuring herself one-handed, she began to adjust some sliders. This was so hot\u2026 and it was definitely time to test some of the other sliders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s tears mixed with the warm water and coated her face, when the numbness recoiled. Suddenly a tingling sensation filled her whole body. It was incredibly intense, reaching every inch from head to toe. The blonde gasped, when it intensified in her chest region. Suddenly she was nearly overwhelmed by a jolt of pure pleasure; a deep moan escaped her lips. Unable to comprehend her sudden arousal she was completely overwhelmed by it. Sara\u2019s soaked sportswear felt very tight. Her already ample breasts were straining the spandex top and threatened to \u2018spill out\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, the\u2026?\" she moaned, while she unconsciously started to massage her inner thighs, still cowered in shower. Now she realized she was growing, just like Nicole before. Her already well-defined muscles became more massive, as Sara\u2019s whole body slowly expanded like soft, rising dough.  Her bosom underwent the most spectacular changes, growing even faster than the rest of her body. Second by second Sara\u2019s boobs were swelling up, peeling the wet tank top away from her skin as they grew. Almost lost in the fog of ecstasy, Sara became aware of a low-pitched creaking noise coming from the vicinity of her chest. With an orgasmic grin she realized, it was the straining fabric of her over-stressed workout shirt. Tiny tears had appeared along the seams. The feeling was indescribable. Sara started massaging her ever-swelling breasts, enjoying their sensitivity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bigger! BIGGER!' she moaned, urging her growth on, willing it to happen faster. Her wish was granted, she continued surging upwards and the shirt ripped open down both sides, revealing two enormous, perfectly tear-drop shaped breasts. Her rose-coloured nipples were fully erected and pointed slightly upwards, betraying her aroused state. Sara massaged her breasts more vigorously; she had been a C-Cup before, now it was easily a large double G-Cup.  Despite the sheer ecstasy she felt she was aware of the other wonderful changes that were happening to her.  Sara knew wasn\u2019t only becoming more voluptuous, she also was becoming stronger and more muscular than ever. The proportions of her rock-hard body were passing beyond 'ideal' and into the realm of \u2018impossible.\u2019 The blondes butt was swelling to overflow her tight short workout pants. They weren't tearing at all, but simply bulging out of shape. The stubborn things were sticking to Sara\u2019s growing massive body like a dark-blue coat of paint, presenting her with a problem. She was getting so big that they were starting to cut off her circulation, and the resilient spandex material showed no signs of giving up. Unwilling stop exploring her body with her hands and to \u2018waste\u2019 precious seconds of savouring the feeling of touching herself, Sara trusted in her growth to resolve the problem. It took five long seconds, during which she feeling felt body expand and swell, and with a sound like an unravelling roll of duct tape, Sara\u2019s pants finally split open. Gloriously naked she reached for the velvet folds of her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every passing second the shower cubicle became confining, her increasingly enormous body starting to fill it all up.  Effortlessly her broad shoulders and tree-trunk like arms caved in the side-walls of her now way to small sanctuary, she was able to feel her head touching the shower-head, while her outstretched elongating legs already bridged the gap to the opposite cubicles. Her feet slowly but uncontested ploughed through its brink, maiming concrete and ceramic. Sara\u2019s chest was so massive by now that a large part of her enormous bust was jutting out of the shower. Unable to see her new improved abs, Sara caressed her sculpted massive eight-pack, before she returned to running both hands along the rim of her apple-sized clit, and the pleasure this brought caused black curtains to creep in at the edge of the blonde amazons\u2019 vision.  She moaned at the top of her lungs as she tilted her head back. Finally Sara felt herself pulsing, streaming out, coming again and again. Her body overwhelming the last constraints, the touch of her own hands, the massiveness of her muscles, her towering size, the sensation of growth, it all added up. She wasn\u2019t just having multiple orgasms, but having multiple orgasms simultaneously.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Just after she and Greg had left the house they realized they wanted to bring Laura\u2019s stereo along since hers was the only one that ran on batteries. Vanessa was just about to grab the stereo and go when she saw Laura\u2019s iPhone on her bed displaying an image of Greg\u2019s body. Vanessa picked up the phone and quickly discovered that edits could be made to reshape the 3D model any way she wished. Wondering if she could do the same for herself and see how she\u2019d look taller, bustier, or stronger she tapped through the app\u2019s menus until she found the search function. Entering her own name brought up a 3D image of herself. She frowned when she realized the virtual Vanessa was wearing the exact same purple sequined bikini and even had the white silk wrap around her hips. Feeling silly but also curious she untied the sarong and dropped it to the floor. When the garment also vanished from the image on the phone she got an excited chill. She didn\u2019t quite know what was going on, but the idea that this application was somehow tied to reality was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa glanced into the hallway to make sure Laura wasn\u2019t around, then she snuck a few doors down to her own room for some privacy. She quietly closed the door, sat on her bed and began tapping through options altering the 3D model of herself. She decided to start small, with details, and work her way to the really exciting attributes. She adjusted her blond hair into a fiery shade of punk rock red then added a hot pink streak and thickened her mane so that her shoulders and upper back were covered in luxurious locks. She changed her eye color from hazel to a sparkling emerald green that contrasted her neon hair spectacularly. She then sculpted various details of her face taking her from very pretty to drop dead gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa moved on to her body starting with her midsection. She reduced her waistline down from 24 inches to 22 while expanding her hips from 34 inches to 38 creating an ultra sexy juxtaposition. She spun the model around and increased the size, roundness and firmness of her behind until the bikini bottom looked taut and ready to snap off. She spun the model around to the front once more and zoomed out to admire her body entire. She hungered to increase her bust size, but decided to save the best for last and instead increased her height up slightly to 6 feet even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa trained her eye on her second favorite attribute, her incredible long legs (though her butt was quickly gaining ground) and scanned for a way to lengthen them. It didn\u2019t take long to find and before she knew it she had taken her avatar\u2019s legs from a lengthy 34\u201d long to a mind bending 42\u201d from hip to heel. Afraid her lower limbs were becoming too thin she zoomed in on them and began adding small amounts of muscle tone to beef them up. She continued adding mass until the shapely curves were obvious and the area just above her knee curved out into swelling quads that looked strong and solid while her calves bunched even with no pressure or flex applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she really enjoyed the look of fitness so she continued upward adding muscle to each area of her body. She gave herself defined abdominals, broader shoulders, strong arms and a chiseled back. She then pumped her pectorals up slightly in preparation of her final and more exciting alteration. Vanessa zoomed in on her chest and put her finger immediately to the slider that controlled her breast size. As she began slowly inflating her boobs she saw the readout above the slider begin ticking upward as the 3D model\u2019s bikini top became more stressed. By the time the display listed her bust size at a G cup the swimsuit\u2019s straps gave in to the pressure and ripped away exposing the model\u2019s beautiful globes in all their glory. For years Vanessa had found her body to be her greatest asset and her fantastic bosom the source of her power; now she watched with sheer glee as the virtual breasts expanded to the size of basketballs, then beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait until the boys get a load of these babies,\u201d she said to herself as her nipples tightened in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa continued to inflate her proxy\u2019s breasts until they reached the size of small beach-balls. Laura\u2019s phone told her that, should she look like the 3D model, her new cup size would be PPP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa zoomed out and grinned at the image on the phone. \u201cMy god,\u201d she said, \u201cit would be so awesome if I could look like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eye caught the \u201cApply\u201d button, and for a moment she dreamed that the application really would do what she dreamed it would. At the same time she was curious about some of the other options and adjustments she could make that went beyond simply physical.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tScrew the other options, Vanessa wanted the perfect body and she wanted it now. Jamming her finger on the \u201cApply\u201d button, Vanessa closed her eyes and hungrily waited for the changes. Seconds went by, the repetitive ticking of her bedroom clock annoyingly breaking the otherwise silence of the room. \u2026Nothing was happening. \u201cI suppose it was too good to be true. Probably an app Lulu downloaded for a bit of fantasy.\u201d Vanessa said out-loud, well aware of her sibling\u2019s frustration with her genetic shortcomings. The apps accurate portrayal of her clothing had been spot-on; maybe it was just using the camera. Vanessa shrugged and decided she wanted one last look at an even dreamier version of herself before giving Laura her phone back. But instead she saw a screen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWARNING<br>\r\nYou haven\u2019t picked your temporal settings. Would you like:<br>\r\nImmediate<br>\r\nHistorical<br>\r\nPending<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tVanessa felt a thrill shoot her, maybe there was still that one-in-a-million shot. \u201cVanessa! Are you coming!?\u201d She heard Greg shout from outside, shit she had completely forgotten about grabbing Laura\u2019s stereo for the beach. \u201cBe right there!\u201d Vanessa shouted back and thought to herself, \u201cand better than ever.\u201d Without any hesitation she picked \u201cImmediate\u201d. Immediately the top of her head started itching and Vanessa ran into her bathroom to see what was going on. Looking in the mirror she just caught the end of her hair changing from it\u2019s usual lustrous blond to a fiery punk rock red and before her eyes a hot pink streak emerged as her hair grew thicker. Then her eyes faded from a striking hazel into a piercing emerald green. Exactly like she had told the app to do. The changes continued, \u201cand even in the order I put them in.\u201d Vanessa realized. Looking in the mirror, Vanessa watched her face subtlety reconstruct itself. Her nose got a sexier inward arch, her cheekbones became more pronounced but not overly so, her jaw re-aligned correctly just a few degrees from the childhood injury where she taken a seriously nasty fall off her bike, her lips filled out seductively, and all the (albeit slight) blemishes on her face completely vanished leaving Vanessa with absolutely flawless silky skin. The next change was even through the sarong, Vanessa saw her waist visibly shrink from its usual 24 inches to 22. Already looking incredibly sexy Vanessa\u2019s hips expanded from 34 inches to 38, her bones audibly reshaping themselves thankfully without pain.<br>\r\n\tFollowing the exact order of the changes she had made to the 3D model of herself, Vanessa couldn\u2019t help but grip her rear as it grew, becoming larger and firmer, feeling the sexy expansion beneath her fingers. Completely entranced by the figure in the mirror, Vanessa barely noticed her eyes slowly approaching the top of the mirror. She was growing taller, just two inches taller but that was two inches she had asked for and the app had delivered. At 6\u20190\u201d even Vanessa\u2019s legs were perfectly seductive, long and slender with just a tone of muscle. But that wasn\u2019t enough for her, the 34\u201d limbs stretched up and up all the way to 42\u201d. Now at a rather leggy 6\u20198\u201d Vanessa\u2019s legs seemed to travel forever, elegant limbs with outstanding if subtle curves that just begged to be worshipped. Vanessa couldn\u2019t help but giggle at the prospect of towering over everyone with every inch of her radiating pure sexiness and she wasn\u2019t even done. Her body stopped expanding up and started expanding out. Adding small but defined muscle tone across her body, if anything it accentuated her curves. Her new abs leading down to her sexy thin waist, small biceps on her already fit arms leaving just a trace of noticeable muscle when she didn\u2019t flex it, and flared calves on her legs leading up into tight thighs. Vanessa grew excited as she felt her back tense up as muscle rippled and grew across it, \u201cnearly there. Just a little more.\u201d She internally begged, waiting for that one moment. Nearly salivating as she felt her pecs pop out a little. \u201cYes. YES!\u201d Vanessa screamed with joy on the inside, her breasts expanding from their glorious DD size to even larger, even sexier. Quickly surpassing E her breasts surged even farther passing F and approaching G. Her sequined bra becoming seriously strained as it tried to contain even more beautiful tit-flesh, it finally snapped and her breasts bounced free growing larger all the time. They were an M-cup, no an N-cup, O-cup, drool started forming in the corners of Vanessa\u2019s mouth as her breasts finally stopped at their final PPP size. The biggest natural breasts to grace the Earth \u2026and they were on her chest. Well that depends on your definition of \u2018natural\u2019, she was good before but with a little help from\u2026 yeah that had to be magic, a magic app she was beyond perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \u201cI can\u2019t wait for the beach!\u201d Vanessa thought, nearly walking downstairs without her modesty. \u201cHeh, modesty? With these jugs?\u201d Although still wanting to cover at least a little for decencies sake Vanessa realized that there was literally nothing she could wear on this planet that would fit except maybe a bed sheet but that wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near revealing enough. With no better ideas, she opened the app and tried to find an option for clothing. Finally she came across: Adjust previous attire? Clicking yes, Vanessa found her torn bikini top on the floor where it had fallen repaired and undoubtedly larger than ever. Slipping it on, she went downstairs to meet Greg. Granted without the radio she had come for in the first place but she didn\u2019t care, she had found something far better.<br>\r\n\u201cVanessa!? What in the blazes?<br>\r\n\u201cI had a little\u2026 growth spurt.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure you did and my name is Benny Hill. Don\u2019t lie to me Vanessa. Nobody simply grows breasts larger than their own head and\u2026 woah a LOT taller.\u201d Bless Greg\u2019s heart he was a meathead but he wasn\u2019t stupid.<br>\r\n\u201cWell Greg.\u201d Vanessa said looking down at her 6\u20192\u201d brother. \u201cAre we going to go to the beach and enjoy ourselves or play 20 Questions for something that neither of us can simply explain?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou owe it to me to try.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMagic.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the power.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk fine don\u2019t tell me. But if you\u2019re going to reference the song at least put it on.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhen all hell\u2019s breakin\u2019 loose you\u2019ll be right in the eye of the storm!\u201d The lyrics blasted out of Vanessa\u2019s phone as the duo left for the beach, never the wiser that Vanessa had left Laura\u2019s phone behind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vanessa was just about to the beach with Greg when she checked her phone and saw a message from Laura. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up to you in a sec. But why was my phone in your bedroom? Took me a second to find it.\u201d Shock went through her as she realized that she had left Laura\u2019s phone behind. If Laura saw the new her she\u2019d be even more pissed after putting two and two together. Quickly texting the first excuse she could think of, \u201cSorry Lulu couldn\u2019t find mine and got confused. Having the same case is a bit of a pain huh?\u201d Vanessa was looking forward to a fun day down at the beach; that was happening no matter what, she just needed to snag Laura\u2019s phone first. As Vanessa arrived on the beach, jaws literally dropped as everyone caught sight of the achingly sexy 20-year old. She smiled, waved, and put a bounce into her step for\u2026 *cough *cough to show off her new assets. The two globes jiggled wildly, their mass too much for her pecs to properly support. They were also, heavy. Very heavy. But Vanessa reasoned she could fix that in just a little bit. The last group of people here to see the new and improved Vanessa were the jocks playing football. Yes, on the beach. It\u2019s football! And Vanessa loved watching the muscular guys go at it. But their game stopped altogether as all eyes became riveted on Vanessa and specifically her bobbing breasts. One poor guy got hit in the head by the football as it came down, another jock having thrown it just before the hypnotic sight that was Greg\u2019s sister arrived.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you boys stopping for little \u2018ol me? I don\u2019t mind. Keep staring.\u201d Vanessa said, thrusting out her chest. She loved every second of this attention.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Knowing every single straight guys eyes were rooted firmly on her she turned around to find a good spot to lay out her towel on the beach and get some sun. It also gave her the perfect excuse to show off her tantalizingly ass to the guys. Of course she knew it was perfect, she\u2019d designed it and Vanessa knew what body shape turned on guys. She\u2019d already had it, she might\u2019ve just\u2026 exaggerated it. Just a little though. They were only beachball sized breasts. Perfectly manageable.  The thought of using the app to make them weigh less never crossed her mind. She\u2019d just be stealing Lulu\u2019s phone to strengthen her pec muscles. Imagine that, immense PPP breasts and perky ones at that. Smiling that her fantasy was now more real than she could have ever hoped Vanessa put in her earbuds and finished listening to her absolute favorite 2006 song. Occupied with watching the shirtless hot beach guys playing beach football and with her earbuds in Vanessa never had a chance to hear Greg\u2019s bodybuilding buddies come up to him and start a conversation.<br>\r\n\u201cDude I know the whole \u2018bro\u2019s before hoes\u2019 thing but seriously: Bring that skank back to your place and go to town. We can hang out later.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDude that\u2019s my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cVanessa!?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNaaaaaaahhh it\u2019s Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEither way those are helluva big implants.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Greg laughed nervously. \u201cImplants.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know her plastic surgeon? I\u2019ve been thinking about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYour breasts are big enough already.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Chad puffed out, indignant. \u201cThose are pecs.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOur last bench-off says those are moobs. Need to work on your definition.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure but another time jackass. I\u2019m busy thinking dirty thoughts about your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still oblivious to their conversation Vanessa leaned over to the right, her twin mountains of breast-flesh cascading downwards, and waved to them. She was pretty sure all the guys, who\u2019d been watching this entire time, creamed their Speedo\u2019s instantly. Not that she minded. The beach was a good place to get wet and, unable to help herself, decided to splurge a little bit more. Lulu wasn\u2019t here yet after all.<br>\r\n\u201cNeed another for football?\u201d Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She had to wait a good couple seconds before any of the guys responded. They were drooling so much you\u2019d think the tide had come in. After a moment one of the guys blathered out an incomprehensible mess that sounded like yes, which was followed by earnest enthusiasm by the rest of the guys. Smiling, Vanessa walked up to one of the team captain and enjoyed looking down at him from her titillating six-foot-eight height.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what team am I on Slick? Shirts or Skins?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWelll\u2026 I\u2026 you know\u2026 uhhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShirts it is.\u201d Vanessa said, taking her place on the rough \u2018field\u2019. \u201cSorry guys your fearless leader has spoken.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The \u2018fearless leader\u2019 got more than a few death glares for that. Besides\u2026 Vanessa didn\u2019t need to take her humongous bra off to thrill the guys. Right as the other team did the\u2026 thing with the ball, Vanessa didn\u2019t know football well, or at all, she got distracted as she spied Laura arrive on the beach. Just a moment later one of the guys ran headlong into her cleavage and was promptly laid out on the sand. To him it was like running straight into two airbags. You don\u2019t simply \u2018fall\u2019 backwards you get ejected backwards. Before Vanessa could say anything sassy to him like \u201cguess you weren\u2019t man enough for those boobies\u201d, and God knows she wanted to, the football immediately fell deep between her breasts with a WHHUUUUUMMMPPFFF! sound.<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s still got the ball! Dog-pile!\u201d One of them shouted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Uh-oh. With a bit of a girly shriek Vanessa was knocked down on her back by all the guys tackling her headlong. Her cute little abs had taken most of the hit since the guys were aiming a little low, to be able to look up as she was falling and see nothing but her stupendously large breasts. They stung a bit from the impact but Vanessa had found she rather liked the feeling of the guys hit her rock-hard muscles. Besides\u2026 she found herself surrounded by the pleasantly warm sand with three guys wrapping their big strong arms around her. It was shaping up to be one hell of a good visit to the beach and it was about to get better.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Vanessa was on the sand, not having any trouble at all convincing the guys to help her, Laura looked around for her siblings but only saw Greg and a dog-pile over by where all the jocks where playing football. \u201cNeanderthals.\u201d She sighed, turning back to her phone and wondering where exactly Vanessa was. Figuring to herself that it didn\u2019t matter much as she didn\u2019t fit in with her sister\u2019s crowd she got away from the crowd and found a nice spot to admire the surfers from, wishing one of them would look her way at least once. She was so enraptured in the way they rode the waves she didn\u2019t even notice when someone took her purse, with her phone inside, from behind her.<br>\r\n\u201cGood job Jake.\u201d Vanessa said, some distance away.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Jack.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vanessa definitely needed to take some of the pressure off her back, much as she loved the gigantic breasts they were already a bit of a strain. All things considered: a good problem to have. But she also liked the firm unyielding feeling of her muscles when she was tackled. Question was: What to do first?<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirm up her pecs<br>\r\nTake the toned look farther<br>\r\nMake her breasts even larger<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly finding the \"Physical\" tab in the app on Lulu's phone Vanessa scrolled down until she found an option called \"Density\". Tapping on it a slide popped up, currently set at 1, with each successive number a multiplier. Just dragging the slider over to 2 Vanessa found the 3D image of her had significantly perky breasts. It would also make her sexy toned body about as strong as a couple of the jocks here. Noticing there was still plenty of room on the slider Vanessa wondered just how high it could go. Moving the slider all the way to the right it stopped at 50,000 before the system automatically updated the slider to 'zoom it out' per say allowing her to go from anywhere from 1 to a couple hundred thousand. But fifty thousand times as strong as she currently is was a lot. Just at 5x she would still be able to bench a thousand pounds. Vanessa wasn't sure if that would break a record or not, but she did like the sound of it. All that strength just running through her body. Hers to command. Oh yeah. Definitely. Why settle for anything less when she can be nothing less than perfect?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Get 5x stronger. Take on the muscle heads over by Greg and probably use the app more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Go crazy!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa tapped the \u201cMental\u201d menu and scanned the options there. Most of them seemed to be the sort of thing you would use to adjust someone else\u2019s personality (if that were possible), but she did see an option for IQ which told her her current score was 115. She went ahead and upped her intelligence a bit to 130.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t really find much else of interest in the \u201cMental\u201d category so she tapped the \u201cMisc.\u201d menu. Now THIS was more like it. She scrolled through a myriad of options ranging from ordinary to impossible. She skipped past the duller options like piercings and tattoos and continued down until one option caught her eye. It said \u201cMeta-Human Abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck does that mean?\u201d Vanessa asked tapping the selection. Her eyes went wide when she saw what was listed. \u201cOk, there\u2019s no way this is real.\u201d The list that appeared contained various superpowers of nearly every type she could think of. Energy blasts, flight, telekinesis, and many many more. At the top of the list was a note that read, \u201cDue to the fragile nature of human DNA no more than 3 abilities from this list can be activated at one time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt every step it seemed as though whoever programmed this app really believed it would work on real life people, and every step of the way Vanessa believed it more and more in spite of the fantastic nature of the abilities she saw here. She looked through trying to narrow her selections down to just three superpowers that she would want. Finally she decided that, if this this really did work, she\u2019d be able to change her mind later. First she clicked on flight having always dreamed of being able to soar above the ground like a bird. Next she picked super-strength. She, just like Laura, envied Greg\u2019s muscles and the power they brought. After selecting the strength enhancement a slider appeared labeled \u201cStrength Factor Multiplier.\u201d Below the slider, which was set all the way to the left it said \u201c10 X Avg. Human.\u201d As she began moving the selector to the right began increasing the number. She continued to move up until it read \u201c50,000 X Avg. Human.\u201d There was still a lot of slider remaining, but the level\u2019s of power they opened upon scared her a little so Vanessa decided to hold here for now. Should she want an increase later she knew how to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her third power she scrolled up and down the list a few times before settling on pyrokinesis. In the end it was the unnatural flaming red hair color she had previously selected that got her to decide on the ability to create and control fire. Plus she liked the idea of thinking that her new body was so incredibly hot that it could burst into flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her superpower selections she pressed the \u201cDone\u201d button at the top of the screen which caused a pop-up screen to appear. It read, \u201cBecause of your selection of pyrokinesis we would recommend a flame-proof clothing layer. Go to \u201dCostume Selection?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about the increasingly strange options that were appearing Vanessa tapped the \u201cYes\u201d button and was returned to the screen that showed the full body model of her gorgeous enhanced sexuality. Now, however there were arrow buttons on either side of her body and when she pressed them her body was encased in various \u201csuper hero\u201d outfits of differing styles starting with rather basic leotards which continued to get skimpier and wilder. Each of these were black, red and yellow and colored to look like flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virtual Vanessa was now wearing a pair of black leather boots with 6\u201d, stiletto heels.  The remainder of her body was covered with thin straps of latex that were connected, but just barely. Her left leg was entirely bare, as was her right arm, her stomach and all of her back and chest above her enormous breasts. The globes in question were covered by a lick of flame that was born of the suit that ran the left side of her waist and wrapped around her shoulder and left arm. Her bosom was covered, but once the fabric reached her right nipple it stopped leaving nearly the entire sphere of her right breast exposed. She spun the figure around and was not surprised to find the costume covered nothing on her back except for a line of latex less than an inch thick that spanned the distance from hip to hip and an even smaller string that bisected the hemispheres of her glorious butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with her costume choice Vanessa again tapped the \u201cDone\u201d button and was confronted with yet another pop up question: \u201cWould you like to make this template an \u201dAlter Ego?\u201c\u201d An info box below gave the definition of this term: \u201cAn alter ego allows you to appear as yourself until you wish to transform into your superpowered, enhanced body. Transformations are performed at will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her head. \u201cThese people thought of everything. I can be a total superhero... or villain.\u201d She chose \u201cYes\u201d and, when prompted to enter a name for the superhero template decided on the name \u201cWyld Fyre.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger then moved slowly toward the \u201cApply\u201d button. \u201cPlease, please, please, please,\u201d she whispered hoping that she wouldn\u2019t feel silly in a few seconds if nothing happened.</span></div></div>",

As the seconds ticked by with no change the crashing feel of reality crept back in. Of course nothing happened, she couldn\u2019t just tap a few buttons on a phone and get superpowers. How gullible was she? With a great sigh she left her room and reentered Laura\u2019s. She tossed Laura\u2019s iPhone on the bed and scooped up the stereo she\u2019d originally come in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa was leaving she passed Laura in the hall who was fresh from her shower. \u201cHey Lulu, I grabbed your stereo. I hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. No problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Vanessa said. She almost asked her sister about the weird app on her phone, but decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she left the house Vanessa paused before a mirror and took in her reflection She adjusted her purple bikini top and hefted her generous bust in the process. Then she turned sideways and ran a hand down her slim waist to her hips. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to be happy being hot, not on fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa left the house and joined Greg on the beach. She spent the day relaxing on the sand taking in the sun. As usual her body was turning heads left and right and it wasn\u2019t long before she forgot the superpowers she\u2019d programmed for herself. As she was sunbathing several of Greg\u2019s friends showed up. Since these were all friends he\u2019d made at the gym they were all, like him, very muscular and they stood around flexing and discussing their current lifts and supplement regimens. Ordinarily Vanessa would be super excited about being surrounded by a bevy of buff bodied boys, but her mood was dampened by the inclusion of Clint Arnold. Of all of Greg\u2019s friends he was clearly the largest. He was about 10 inches shorter than Greg but still outweighed him by more than 50 pounds tipping the scale at 282 pounds of jacked up beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble was that the combination of short stature and insane physique gave Clint an obnoxious Napoleonic superiority complex. He spoke of nothing but himself and how amazing he was and put down everyone else. He treated women like trash and referred to all of them as bitches or worse. Vanessa assumed that he never got laid which also fed into his misogyny. Ironically if he were nicer he could probably get any woman he wanted because the fact was that he looked incredible. Vanessa frequently found her eyes exploring the extreme bulges and swells of his musculature, his thick chest, his powerful thighs, his pumped up arms, but then Clint would open his mouth and turn himself into a foul creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa could tell she wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t enjoy Clint\u2019s company because shortly after he arrived several of Greg\u2019s friends found excuses to leave. Only Greg\u2019s best friend Tommy remained with the two other guys. A few more minutes passed and Vanessa herself could take no more. She stood up and dusted some sand off of her hips. \u201cI\u2019m need to use the bathroom, I\u2019ll see you guys in a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Greg said. \u201cIt may be a while, though. I think I\u2019m going to take a swim. Tommy, Clint, you guys in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy agreed to go but Clint shook his head. \u201cNo thanks, I think I\u2019m going to scope things out around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa didn\u2019t like the fact that Clint had locked his eyes directly on her breasts. To make matters worse because of the differences in their heights Clint\u2019s eye line was closer to Vanessa\u2019s bust line than her face. Then Clint, without even pretending to look away, licked his lips. That was all she could take and she quickly turned on her heel and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vanessa emerged from the bathroom she saw that Clint was waiting for her. He smiled wide and approached her with his heaving chest pushed out for maximum effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey baby, your brother tells me you don\u2019t have a man in your life. How would you like to have the manliest man around keep you company?\u201d Clint then raised his right arm and flexed a very impressive 24 inch bicep. There was no question he was the most muscular guy Vanessa had ever seen in her life, but he was such an ass that she wanted nothing to do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thank you,\u201d she said and began to walk past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, honey.\u201d Clint wrapped his left arm around her waist and steered her toward a bench and sat her down. He joined her and the wooden bench groaned slightly under Clint\u2019s nearly 300 pound body. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you\u2019ve been staring at my body. I know you want to feel if it\u2019s as hard as you imagined.\u201d He then used the arm still around her waist to pull her close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa still had hopes that she could just reject this guy quickly and be on her way, but as soon as his right hand landed on her upper thigh she suddenly realized just how alone the two of them were. And this guy was so strong there was little she could do to stop him if things got bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Clint, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d She tried to peel his hand off of her leg, but he just slid it further inside and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm, that feels nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep your hands to yourself, creep.\u201d Vanessa wrapped both of her hands around his wrist and tried to pull his hand away from her, but she couldn\u2019t budge him an inch, he was just too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mouth says no, but your tits say suck me.\u201d He removed his hand from her thigh and placed it on her breast and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside Vanessa snapped. It was like an explosion went off, no it was bigger, it felt like a neutron bomb detonated inside her chest and poured lava into every cell in her body. And apparently Clint felt it too because he removed his hands from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What the hell is-\u201c But before Clint could even finish his sentence Vanessa was on her feet and engulfed in fire from head to toe. Slowly the flames receded and Clint was face to chest with Fyre. And what a chest it was too, breasts bigger than basketballs covered in a thin strip of latex swayed inches from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEyes up here, asshole.\u201d Vanessa\u2019s voice was deep and sultry and commanded Clint\u2019s eyes to move up toward her face. With her added height and high heeled boots she now stood 6 feet 6 inches tall and towered over the 5 foot 4 inch man. What he saw when he looked up was a woman of sublime beauty with bright, unnaturally red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should thank you,\u201d the amazon woman said. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been such a pig I wouldn\u2019t have found the right way to trigger my transformation. Now that I know the feel of it I can switch back and forth at will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWa....ho.....I-\u201c Clint stammered. Vanessa\u2019s knockout good looks combined with the insanity of her transformation caused Clint\u2019s brain to short circuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa continued in spite of his challenges to speak. \u201cHowever, the fact still remains that you put your hands where they didn\u2019t belong.\u201d She reached up and grabbed the short but strong man around the throat and lifted him off the ground. She further accentuated his dilemma by floating about 5 feet into the air as well. Then she held her free hand so that Clint could see it, palm up and fingers slightly curled. Jets of flame erupted from her fingertips and formed a fireball in the center of her hand. The softball sized flame spun fast enough to blow very hot air in Clint\u2019s face. \u201cSo now I get to make a very important choice. Am I a super heroine or a super villainess? A super heroine would just give you a stern talking to about inappropriate touching and send you on your way. But!\u201d The spinning fireball surged to the size of a cantaloupe. \u201cA super villainess wouldn\u2019t think twice about using her incredible powers to burn every inch of your feeble body before punching you to China.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClint was sweating very hard. The heat from the fireball that hovered inches from his face was scorchingly hot. He was pretty sure his eyebrows had already been burned away, and now it felt as though the skin of his face was about to catch fire. He pleaded to Vanessa with his eyes, preying that she would let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Wyld Fyre,\u201d she said, \u201cand I am a...\u201c</span></div></div>",

She began to run her hand faster and faster, the texture of her hands becoming increasingly rough which increased the friction of her rubs, until the movement of her hand became nothing but a fast blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!\u201d Clint screamed in horror as Wyld Fyre\u2019s hand turned scorching hot and began to burn his cock. However, at the same time, he couldn\u2019t control himself from pumping out a load of sticky cum which sprayed out onto her amazing abs and huge tits. She almost willingly let him savor the sight of his juices running down her superb breasts before she unleashed another red hot streak from her eyes, vaporizing him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her open hand into a fist, instantly extinguishing the fireball, and ran upstairs to Laura\u2019s room. Wyld Fyre continued to use her newly gained powers to vaporize the room door and quickly grabbed Laura\u2019s phone. \u201cI guess it does work after all\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m going to need more abilities if I\u2019m going to be a true super villainess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the superpowers section and pressed the little icon with a plus symbol and gave herself\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looks up into the sky and tenses her thighs slightly, soon to be rewarded with a pleasurable sensation throughout her body as she drifted from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to laugh out as she slowly rose further and further into the air and out of the window. She tensed her thighs even harder to try to go faster but she soon figured out that she could merely levitate. \"Hmmmm, we are gona have to change that!\" She looked back over to her bedroom window and slowly floated back in and her heels clicked loudly as she came back to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to her bed where the phone rested and scrolled further down to find just the super power she was looking for. She pushed the apply button and she soon felt a intense warmth spread over her body. At that moment she couldn't help but moan out quietly as she caressed her own body in pleasure. Soon she turned her gaze back outside and walked over to the window. Bending down slightly, she pushed off the ground with the use of her super strength and began to rise up into the air thousands of feet high. When she felt gravity take over again she tensed her legs as hard as she could.

As she's being a Super villainess she really should introduce herself to world gently before really letting loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging direction she sped towards a nearby town and quickly located the police headquarters for the area. Strutting in through the front door 2 seconds later she leaned over the front desk, showing off her uber boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa purred to the sergeant on duty \"Hi.. you're the only one i'm going to let live.. tell the world 'Wild Fyre' will soon play with you all..'' and moving super fast she threw the policeman over her shoulder, out through a window and into a coffee shop on the other side of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I should bring some light into all these sad policemen's lives..'' And with a click of her fingers, flames erupted out of the ground all around the building, rising all the way to roof so no-one could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she walked through the door's into the main offices to play with all her 'toys', Vanessa suddenly realised she wasn't actually invulnerable, she'd not yet selected that as an additional superpower.. she was still flesh and blood (albeit superpowered).. but she quickly came up with a solution as 2 officers burst through door's with their guns pointing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their eyes the insanely beautiful red head standing infront of them was suddenly covered in blue/white flames, the heat of which began to drive them back into the main office, with Vanessa following ''Come on boys lay it on!'' she taunted, casually throwing a fireball at one of the officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once the 60 policemen and women of the room opened fire with a range of pistols, rifles and shotguns, unfortunately for them Vanessa's fire cloak melted and vaporized the metal before it could come into contact with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww am I too hot for your widdle guns? Lets see if you're better personally!'' A split second later Vanessa had moved superfast and wrapped herself around the closest policeman. The others could only watch in horror as her fire covered body incinerated him slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up, Vanessa could barely contain her pleasure at treating them like her playtoys, and her annoyance that the resistance appeared to have stopped so quickly \"Oooooh don't give me the cold shoulder guys... *huff* This fire really is too much for you to handle isnt it... I'll make it fairer for you...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa, supremely confident, straightened.. and with a click of her fingers dropped the fire cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officers opened fire.. And the bullets seemed to Vanessa to be be moving in slow motion and as she sped herself up internally. To the officers eyes she became a blur whilst they shot at her, and when they stopped firing (because they'd run out of bullets) they realized by her bending and twisting forward that she'd just dodged every last round they'd sent at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed \"My turn!\" and before any of them could even move a muscle to begin reloading.. they were all dead. Vanessa took a deep breath then started laughing, she could not believe how amazing it was moving so fast she could do anything to them and they'd never had known (if she'd not been playing with them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered going to play with the criminals in the cells, but she could see on the TV in the corner of the room that the news teams had turned up and were live outside her wall of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for the world to get a wake up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Hudgins brain really couldnt comprehend what was going on.. which was obvious to everyone watching her report live outside the reasonably sized police HQ. The filmcrew were taking shots from multiple angles, including from a chopper, of this impossible scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire seemed to come from nowhere and no one had any explanation. They didnt have to wait long for the answer as Sarah screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD THERES SOMEONE WALKING THROUGH THE FIRE!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll cameras trained on the form walking casually through the flames.. An insanely beautiful woman, 6'6'' with a tight fitting latex outfit, red hair with a pink streak and deep green eyes. The flames didnt seem to bother her at all as she walked out and up to Sarah as if it were the most natural thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and held up a hand which was immediately enveloped in flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello world,\" she purred \"I'm Wild-Fyre.. I'm just giving you a little demonstration of whats to come.. a heads up..\" she lashed out in a blur with that flaming hand and a split second later was holding Sarahs head in her hand, the flames slowly eating it, \".. as it were..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be no negotiation from me, there will be no escape. I will do what I want, when I want.. and you'd better make it fun for me or else..\" Sarahs head vaporized, \"there will be nothing left of this world but ash by the time I'm through with you all..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she and the fire was gone, and the film crew and chopper were hit by several sonic booms as she rocketed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't believe how easy that was! Her mind raced with possibilites as she flew back into her room (picking up laura's phone on the way) and began looking through the App's list potential powers, upgrades and 'world resistance' options..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey sis, can we borrow your stereo?\u201d Greg entered Laura\u2019s room and stopped when he found it empty. He was about to turn and leave when he noticed her cell phone laying on her bed. Normally he wouldn\u2019t have cared, but he saw there was a picture of himself on the screen so he picked it up for a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found that it wasn\u2019t just  a picture of him but a fully rendered model of his whole body, and it was wearing the exact same clothes that he himself currently had on. He turned and zoomed the image, admiring himself from all angles with a grin. Then, just as he was about to return the phone to its former resting place, he noticed the button marked \u201cMuscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching it he was greeted with two sliders at the bottom of the screen. One read \u201cMass\u201d and the other \u201cDensity.\u201d Beneath that was a message that said \u201cZoom in on body parts to adjust specific muscle groups.\u201d Greg saw that while the density slider was set all the way to the left the mass slider was located very slightly away from the home location. He touched his finger to this slider button and began slowly moving it further to the right. Instantly the 3D model of his body began expanding with muscle. The shirt the rendered Greg was wearing tore apart and vanished while splits appeared in the shorts as massive thighs appeared from nowhere. He continued to add mass slowly, watching as the computerized version of himself grew to insane proportions larger than any living bodybuilder he\u2019d ever seen. He took his finger off the screen and saw that the digital readout placed his creation\u2019s weight at 390 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give to look like that.\u201d  The truth was Greg would have given most anything to put on just a little more mass, much less 105+ pounds of muscle. He had recently been coming to terms with the fact that his physique had peaked, his gains having slowed to a complete stop that had him seriously considering steroids for the first time in his brief career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg then noticed the \u201cApply\u201d button in the top corner of the screen. Without even thinking he pressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly he felt an intense pressure build within his body. He quickly realized, with rapturous joy, his muscles were swelling. After only a few seconds of growth Greg\u2019s shirt split apart and fell from his meaty body just as it had on the animated version of himself. He desperately wanted to watch what was happening to his body, but his expanding pectorals now completely blocked his view and as far as he could tell Laura had no mirrors in her room. Instead he held his arms aloft and watched as they continued to grow, filling with thick ropes of sinew. All the while he could feel his already considerable strength growing by leaps and bounds. The feel of power he now possessed was intoxicating. Greg couldn\u2019t see his legs, but he could feel his shorts splitting along the sides as his tree trunk quads easily overcame the thin material. He flexed his thighs relishing the feel of bursting out of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally his growth subsided and he stood examining his new 390 pound physique. He ran his hands over the iron plates of his abdominal muscles to the broad swell of his pectorals which stood about 7\u201c beyond his chin. Lastly he raised his arms and flexed a pair of mountainous biceps far bigger than any he\u2019d ever seen before. Greg didn\u2019t have his tape measure but he guessed his monster arms were 27 or 28 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t believe his good fortune, and it was all thanks to Laura\u2019s phone. Realizing that he had dropped the device during his transformation Greg bent over (his new girth causing some minor mobility challenges) and found the iPhone on Laura\u2019s bed. He picked it up and was about to try playing with it some more when he heard a gasp from behind him. He spun around and saw Laura standing slack-jawed in the door way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled down at her, placed his free hand on his hip and flexed his chest. \u201dHey there little sister,\u201c he said. \u201dNeat toy you have here.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Laura couldn\u2019t speak, her mouth moved but not voice issued forth. At last she was able to string together two words: \u201dIt works?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed. \u201dI\u2019d say so. I have no idea how, but I really don\u2019t care. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me I\u2019m going to head down to the weight room and test my new limits.\u201c He started for the door with Laura\u2019s phone still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey, that\u2019s mine! Give it back!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNo, I think I\u2019m going to borrow it for a little while. I still have a few more changes I\u2019d like to make.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGive it back or....\u201c she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOr what? You\u2019ll take it from me?\u201c Greg puffed out his chest again to further display his superiority, then readied himself to shove Laura aside if she refused to move.</span></div></div>",

Her hand went to her head, which had smacked the wall fairly well, and she glared at Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat phone is MINE!\u201d Laura shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d he tried to look reasonable as he rationalized his theft, \u201cI\u2019m just going to borrow it. You\u2019ll get it back in a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left before she could respond and quickly made his way to the weight room. The room was really the basement where Greg had set up a fully functioning gym filled with weight machines, dumbbells, a large full body mirror and numerous posters of male and female bodybuilders everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg made sure to lock the door before heading down the stairs into his sanctuary. The wooden stairs groaned under the weight of his new 390 lb. frame. For a moment he worried that he\u2019d go crashing through, but they held and he made it safely down.  He set Laura\u2019s iPhone on one of the weight benches and went immediately to the mirror on the far side of the room. This was his first chance to really see the muscle beast he had become and he was overjoyed with the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs, previously hidden from his view by his massive chest, were huge. Each of the four muscles that made up the quadriceps seemed to be fighting to hold on and pressing against the others. When he flexed his thighs his quads swelled outward with such size that for a moment he thought they were going to envelop his knee.  Greg\u2019s swim trunks had split up the sides all the way to the waistband and now hung on more like a loin cloth than anything else. The waist of his shorts was snug, but still fit showing that he hadn\u2019t really gained very many extra inches to his waist. Everything else, though, swelled outward in all directions, his chest and back most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bounced his pecs one at a time grinning as the huge slabs of muscle jumped. He ran through a series of poses watching his vastly expanded muscles expand as he pumped them full of blood. Each flex pushed him further into a sort of frenzy, adrenaline was pounding through his veins as he hit pose after giant pose. He rapidly switched from a front biceps to a crab flex, then a most muscular followed by a side triceps. Faster and faster until with a grunt he grabbed the remnants of his shorts and ripped them away leaving him completely nude and breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said with a slight chuckle, \u201cthat\u2019s not good.\u201d His eyes were drawn to his penis which even before his transformation was rather below average. Now, compared to his vastly enlarged frame it looked downright pathetic. In fact he would have ordinarily been ashamed and depressed by the view of his not quite 5\u201d member, but this was no ordinary day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what we can do to fix this,\u201d Greg said turning to pick up Laura\u2019s phone. He unlocked it and began tapping through various options looking for the one that would control one body part in particular. Finally he was met with a chart with his current measurements listed. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><b><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">Flaccid -  Length: 2.57 inches       Diameter: 1.1 inch<br>\r\nErect -  Length: 4.75 inches       Diameter: 2.5 inches</font></b></span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tapped on the numbers and adjusted until the chart read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">Flaccid - Length: 6 inches  Diameter: 3 inches<br>\r\nErect - Length: 13.5 inches  Diameter: 4.25 inches</span></b></font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg knew that this sort of penis would be a bit too big for a woman to take, but he figured he could always shrink back down if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr I could make her big enough to take it,\u201d he said to the app and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he used a slider below the chart to enlarge his testicles. He didn\u2019t want to add too much since he would have enough trouble transporting his soon to be giant penis. He increased their mass until they looked to be about the size of golf balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath and pressed the apply button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg felt an explosive jolt of energy in his crotch that brought him to his knees. He couldn\u2019t see around peak of his pectorals, but he watched in the mirror as his member began inching up, up and away. The head of his penis continued to reach upward, higher and higher until it stood over a full foot from the base. The shaft was still growing thicker, though, and reminded Greg of the expansion his body had gone through earlier. By the time the electric feeling faded from his groin the body of his penis was smaller than a soda can, but not by a whole lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg got back to his feet and watched with glee as his massive member bobbed up and down with the motion. He wrapped his hand around his cock at felt a shock of pleasure shoot up his spine. He squeezed the shaft, but much like the rest of his body it felt as though it were made of steel. He slid his hand up and down feeling the full glory of its size and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a cock worthy of a muscle god like me,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked around while deciding what to do next. He was curious to find out how much stronger he was now with his enlarged muscles. He felt like he could bench press a ton, but he knew that was just the adrenaline talking. He was also excited to show off his new body to his girlfriend, Sara.\t She was a big fan of his muscles, and he was sure she would really love to explore his new body even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he would...</span></div></div>",

The bar was holding 340 pounds which Greg would typically be able to press for a dozen or so reps. He was about to lay down on the bench when he hesitated, a grin spreading across his face. Instead he walked around behind the weight as if he were spotting an invisible man then tensed his arms and chest feeling the power pulse through his muscles filling him with confidence. He gripped the bar and sucked in a deep breath. Tensing his body and expecting quite the struggle he lifted the bar off the rack and nearly fell over backwards when it shot straight to his chest with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Greg shouted pumping the 340 pound weight up and down as if it were nothing. He adjusted his grip and let go with one hand and continued curling the bar with no trouble. Overloaded with excitement Greg re-racked the bar and began adding plates to either side until he was all out. Moments later the bar was sagging slightly under the stress of 900 pounds. Once again Greg took the bar in both hand and curled it to his chest. This time he could definitely feel the weight though he still didn't struggle with it. Now he adjusted and took it in a single hand. He grunted loudly finally putting his incredible physique to the test. Greg's monstrous arm was swollen bigger than a volleyball with muscle that looked like it was made of steel just below a thin layer of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's grunts turned to laughter which then became roars of pleasure as he struggled his way through half a dozen reps before dropping the overloaded bar to the ground with a calamitous crash that put cracks in the cement floor. He raised his pumped arm and flexed hardly able to believe that the flesh covered mountain that rose higher and higher was his own. Greg's free hand gripped his 13 and a half inch cock and pumped while he continued to flex his enormous bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was 900 pounds in one hand,\" he told himself. \"And I'll bet I can do 1000. That means I could probably curl a ton in both hands. I must be the most powerful man in the world\" Seconds later his eyes rolled back in his head and his penis erupted a spray of come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the giant mess Greg laughed then grabbed a towel to clean the floor while he thought about his next moves. He decided to return to the magical iPhone and see what other things he could do. Without even trying he had already become superhuman, imagine what he could do after some exploration...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg decided that his new muscles were just to awesome not to share. He couldn\u2019t wait to see the look on Sara\u2019s face when she saw his new dimensions. Also, he realized he could use her help with finding something to wear that would fit over his new physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned the floor looking for the remnants of his torn shorts. When he found them he searched the pockets looking for his cell phone. When he found it he regarded it with minor contempt; not only was it old, but it wasn\u2019t able to perform the miracles that Laura\u2019s could. On the other hand it was the number that Sara knew, so he would need to use it in this case to get her to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Greg punched in a text message that read: \u201cHey baby, u busy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit send and waited for a response. Just as he was about to try curling some of his larger dumbbells his phone buzzed with her return message: \u201cNot really. Just finished my cardio at the gym. I was going to get some food. What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sent: \u201cI was wondering if you could help me. I had some MAJOR gains today and I don\u2019t have any clothes that fit anymore. Could you grab me something really, really big to wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere seconds later he got a reply: \u201cLOL! Whatever you tease! That is HOT though! You know I love your big sexy muscles!! ;)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smile was huge now. He activated the camera on his phone and held it up to the mirror with his left hand while he flexed his right arm. The picture he captured was from the top of his chest up and he made sure his face was visible along with his bicep which was now nearly 10 inches larger now than the last time Sara saw him. He sent the picture with the caption: \u201cI\u2019m serious, baby. I\u2019m way bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly his phone buzzed again, but this time Sara was calling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Greg answered as if nothing out of the ordinary had taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Sara sounded shocked and even a little angry. \u201cThat picture has to be a fake, right? You really shouldn\u2019t mess with me like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely real,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m now 390 pounds of thick.. bulging.. massive.. muscle.\u201d These last for words he drew out knowing that it would drive Sara wild, and he could hear it in her voice. When she spoke again she sounded slightly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou.. that\u2019s not possible. I saw you yesterday. You\u2019re not doing drugs, are you? We talked about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo drugs, I swear. I really don\u2019t know how it works, it seems impossible, but Laura has some crazy app on her phone that can change people\u2019s bodies in any way they want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop messing with me. It\u2019s not funny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby, I don\u2019t understand it, but it\u2019s real. It works. I\u2019m huge. And I want your hands on my muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know....\u201d Greg could tell she still didn\u2019t believe him, but she was close. He decided he would have to convince her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I can prove it. Hang on a second.\u201d He put his phone on speaker and set it on the table next to one of the weight benches. He grabbed Laura\u2019s phone and sat on the bench. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this will work over distance, but I\u2019m going to give it a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wait. And go somewhere private where no one can see you.\u201d Greg was tapping through the Alterations app looking for a way to bring up a different person\u2019s information. Finally he found the search function and put in Sara Auster. A list of matching names appeared with addresses listed so he could pick the right one. This helped convince him that this app would not only work across town, like he now needed, but around the world. He saw Sara Auster\u2019s from as far away as England listed. He chuckled at the thought of some random Brit walking down the street and suddenly growing watermelon sized boobs or something like that. His Sara, though, was listed right at the top since she was the closest in proximity to him. He clicked on her name and was returned to the main screen with her body in place of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg took a moment to take in her beautiful form. While he was tall and buff she was petite and fit. Sara was 5\u2019 4\u201d and walked the line between sexy and adorable perfectly. Her hair was light blond and hung in straight layers down over her shoulders and onto her chest. She had perfect \u201cgirl next door\u201d good looks and a smile that was warm and charming. Her cheekbones were round and rosy, her nose slender with a slight button tip and both were smattered with a field of freckles. Her eyes were a smokey hazel that, when complemented with the right eye makeup, were downright mesmerizing. Her body was slender and toned with a tight tummy and slim waist but still some nice rounded hips. Her breasts were perky B-cups that fit perfectly to her body and her legs were long, in spite of her short stature, and were quite strong from her years on the track team. One of the things that Greg loved most about Sara was her ability to go from cute and cuddly to sexy diva in seconds. Sometimes all it took was a turn of her head or change of expression to take her from the most innocent little girl to the naughtiest woman you ever met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of Sara on the phone screen was wearing her workout clothes: black, skin hugging lycra shorts and a pink tank top with her white tennis shoes. Her golden hair was tied back in a pony tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d Greg said, \u201cI pulled you up. And I can see you\u2019re wearing your black shorts with your pink top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause where Sara considered this. \u201cLucky guess,\u201d she said with uncertainty, \u201cI told you I had just worked out. You know my workout clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine. What would you like me to change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body, I can change anything. Do you want to be taller? Do you want red hair? Bigger butt? I think I can even paint your fingernails for you if you want. Name it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d She paused for a second, allowing herself to give in to the fantasy for just long enough to pick a change she would make. \u201cOkay, give me bigger boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do that. How big? Are you somewhere private where no one will see you growing and freak out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little bigger, a D-cup at most. I don\u2019t want to look like some fake porn star. And I\u2019m in my car, no one will see. Oh, what am I saying, this is all fake anyway. Why are you messing with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trust me, baby.\u201d Greg was tapping away and making adjustments to her body that would allow her to fit an enormous 13 and a half inch penis completely inside her. He figured she wouldn\u2019t mind once she found out. To make up for the secret adjustment he also gave her a gift by doubling the number of nerve endings and increasing their sensitivity throughout her vagina. He then quickly switched over to her chest and tapped on her breasts. A slider appeared that allowed him to increase their size and he slowly moved it upward. The slider was very sensitive and his finger was thicker than he was used to and he had difficulty settling on her desired D-cup. After going too high and too low several times he stopped on a DD-cup setting and hoped she would be understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for this,\u201d Greg said then sent the changes to Sara\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a half second delay and then he could hear Sara gasp in shock and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god,\u201d she breathed and then Greg heard a clomping bang that could only have been the sound of the phone dropping to the floor of the car. In the distance he could hear Sara moaning louder and louder. Then moans gave way to short heavy breaths that starting coming faster and faster. In mere seconds he could hear her screaming as what he could only assume was an intense orgasm brought on by her new sensitivity ripped through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a full minute Sara\u2019s breathing slowed and she began to mumble a bit, \u201cooh, oh god, oh oh, oh greg, i, i, oh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Sara picked up her phone, \u201cOh Greg! They\u2019re incredible. They\u2019re perfect. I love them. That\u2019s felt sooooo gooood. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. And I look amazing. My shirt is so tight around them, and I have cleavage! Not a lot, but just the right amount.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his minds eye Greg could see Sara running her hands over her DD-cup breasts, playing with them, and his monster cock awoke and began to raise to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSara? Do you believe me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d she shouted, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t, it\u2019s just so crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, can you do me that favor and find some clothes for me? Doesn\u2019t have to be classy or anything, just big enough to fit. If they\u2019re too big I can always just grow into them.\u201d This last statement elicited a low growl from Sara.  \u201cCome over soon, my muscles are the only thing that\u2019s grown, you know.\u201d</span></div></div>",

And while you\u2019re at it you should think about other changes you want to make to yourself. You know, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara laughed a breathy laugh that failed to mask the sexual shivers that were no doubt swimming through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Greg added before hanging up, \u201cbe sure to call me when you get here. I\u2019ll be in the weight room and I may not hear you at the front door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara said she would and Greg hung up and put his phone down. He walked to the wall where his full body mirror was. Beside the mirror was a life sized poster of Jay Cutler, Greg\u2019s bodybuilding idol. Greg knew every measurement of Cutler\u2019s by heart and had dreamed that someday he might have the chance to just get close to having a similar build. His 6\u2019 2\u201d height was always greater than Cutler\u2019s 5\u2019 9\u201d, but until today that was the only way in which Greg was larger. Now, however, Greg out weighed his idol by over 100 pounds and possessed dimensions that would make Cutler or any other bodybuilder green with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg grabbed a measuring tape from a nearby table and began to wrap it around his upper arm. Years of measuring his own biceps allowed his hands to move quickly and within moments he was raising his right arm and flexing while the tape expanded, the numbers running up as his mountainous muscle swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty nine inches!\u201d Greg was stunned. He held his arm up to the image of Jay Cutler\u2019s 22\u201d python and couldn\u2019t believe how he dwarfed the Mr. Olympia winner. He continued to measure himself each time shocked by just how much he had outgrown his idol. His chest was just shy of 85 inches around, though his waist measured 36 inches, the disproportion was incredible. Greg\u2019s legs were now 44 inches around, a full 14\u201d bigger than his idol\u2019s, and looked like they could support a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg dropped the tape measure and went to the rack of dumbbells. He instantly went to the largest in his set, a 200 pound giant that he\u2019d never been successful in properly curling. As soon as he picked it up, though, he could tell it was going to be no problem. He cranked out several reps without so much as effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I could curl twice this,\u201d he said to his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if prepared to test this theory he turned to the bench press, which was still racked with weight from his previous workout. The plates with the bar added up to 440 pounds. Instead of lying down on the bench, though he picked the bar up in with both hands from a standing position and brought the weight up to his chest. With both hands he still found it no real challenge, so he adjusted his hands and tried letting go with his left. For the first time he had to put forth real effort, partly from the weight in his hand but also from the strain of trying to balance the long bar in his hand. He found if he moved slow, however, he was able to complete a curl. With increased confidence he moved more rapidly grinding out a set of 15, watching as his enormous arm pumped with blood and flexed with effort. Once done he re-racked the bar. As tough as that was he was certain that, had he not needed to focus on balancing the weight, he likely could have curled more. Maybe even 500 lbs.!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then prepared to test his bench press by adding as much weight as he could though his set was larger than the average bench press kit, it wasn\u2019t quite as big as those found in professional gyms. So far, though, it had served his needs just fine. Now that he loaded all the weight onto the bar that he could he wasn\u2019t sure it would be enough for a real test. A quick count told him that the bar was now loaded with 845 pounds. Greg quickly slid under the bar and with utmost confidence lifted it into the air before slowly bringing the whole load down to his massive chest. He pumped out several reps, and while they weren\u2019t easy they were far from difficult and he was positive that he could easily handle several hundred pounds more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg made his way around his weight room, looking for a challenge but not finding one. Then, before long, his phone was ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked his phone up and answered the call. \u201cHi baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, big boy. I\u2019m here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right up.\u201d He clicked the phone off and made his way upstairs. He unlocked the door and peaked out to see if Laura was anywhere around. He saw that the door to her room was closed and he could hear the faint sound of music playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it was safe he squeezed his body through the basement door and, still entirely naked, made his way across the living room to the front door. Greg opened it and watched as Sara\u2019s mouth dropped open and her eyes bulged out. She\u2019d been holding several bags of clothes which fell to the ground. Her hands then instinctively went up toward his thick pectorals and she took a step forward like someone hypnotized. When her hand finally touched the slab of sinew on his chest Sara gave a little jump as if she expected it to pop like a balloon. Instead she found a wall of solid muscle that felt hard as rock beneath her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god,\u201d she said, her cheeks flushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Greg was taking her her new dimensions. True that she hadn\u2019t been transformed nearly as much as he had, but he was admiring her additional flesh all the same. Apparently while buying him new clothes she had picked out an outfit for herself as well. She was no longer wearing her workout clothes. Instead she had on tight, ripped denim shorts that hugged her hips like a second skin. Her firm, tanned legs flowed endlessly out of the bottom. For a top she now wore a peach-colored, spaghetti strap halter that left her tight tummy bare and sat so low on her bosom that her cleavage nearly spilled over the top. It was instantly obvious to Greg that she was not wearing a bra, but once she started touching his massive pecs he saw her nipples poke out through the fabric proving him right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look really good,\u201d he told her while staring down into the well between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said removing her hands from him and running them over her torso. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind I made a stop for myself as well. People were staring at me crammed into my sports bra, and I was so excited to be able to shop for clothes with my new boobies.\u201d Sara glanced down and saw Greg\u2019s enlarged penis. It was hanging flaccid at the moment and so was an average sized 6 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh,\u201d she said, \u201cit is bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg followed her stare then laughed. \u201cYou aint seen nothing yet. Besides,\u201d he went on holding his straightened arm up before her face so his bicep was just below her nose, \u201ceverything about me is bigger.\u201d He curled his arm and flexed hard causing his muscle to erupt before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s knees grew weak, but she held her footing. Once more her hands reached for his muscle independent of her conscious mind. She gripped his freakish bicep on either side. Her hands, already petite, looked like they belonged to a little girl when placed on his giant arm. Even fully extended she was unable to cover half of the circumference of his arm with both hands. She squeezed and caressed the inflated mass beneath his skin and found no give. She may as well have been squeezing steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, it\u2019s so hard.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrong too,\u201d he added, \u201cBefore you arrived I was curling 440, and I\u2019m pretty sure I could do 500.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiar!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gleeful squeal Sara leapt into the air and wrapped her sexy legs around Greg\u2019s middle. He was about to turn and head for the basement when she stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! The clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg returned to the doorway where she leaned down, without being set down, and reached for the bags. Once in hand they turned once more for the weight room.</span></div></div>",

Taller, more muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More muscle?\"  Gregs voice held a noticeable tone of hesitation as his thumb hovered over the \"apply changes\" button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes more muscle.  You know we've talked about me getting into figure competition so we could train together.  This is my chance to jump start into the scene.\"  Greg was silent for a moment.  Sara HAD talked about that a few times but he had more or less blown her off. Serious weight training was a guy thing, he didn't really like the idea of her being more muscular.  \"Greg, are you still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, yea, I'm still here.  How much muscle are you talking about babe?\"  He finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, how much did you put on today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to add 165 pounds of muscle?\"  Greg blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that how much you added?  Wow... that is so hot.  No I don't want quite that much yet, let's do 80 pounds,\" Saras voice was breathless with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"80 pounds?\"  Greg found the muscle slider on Saras image and started nudging it to the right.  He frowned as her top lost the war with her expanding chest and kept growing.  \"80 pounds is a lot babe.  Are you sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure, and make me taller.  5'8\" sounds good.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg frowned as he made the changes and stared at what Sara's new body would become if he pushed the button.  She had WAY more muscle than he thought was attractive on a chick.  The bigger boobs, that he was good with, taller was fine too.  But the muscles...  He had to try to talk her out of this.  \"Babe, you do not want to do this right now, you're going to grow right of your clothes, why don't you come here first and we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm fine with growing out of my clothes, I'm sort of looking forward to it.\"  Greg took the phone away from his ear and stared at it with slack jawed amazement.  Who was this girl?  \"I just got home, give me a second to get inside,\" Sara chirped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe you should really just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready,\" she squealed, cutting Greg off in mid sentence.  \"I can't wait for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg frowned then hit the \"apply changes\" button, already thinking to himself that he would undo it later after Sara got him some clothes.  He would let her have her fun for now.  A second passed before Saras voice moaned into Gregs ear, \"Here it comes baby... it feels SOOOO good.\"  Faintly the sounds of tearing cloth could be heard over Saras orgasmic panting.  \"Wow... thanks hon, I'll see you soon,\"  Sara hung up abrubtly and Greg scowled at the phone.  That hadn't gone the way he had expected at all.  He looked around the basement and tried to decide what he would do until Sara got here.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't sure how long, it felt like a long time.  \"That phone is mine,\" she muttered under her breath again.  Another wave of nausea swept over her and she grit her teeth, fighting back the urge to vomit.  \"That phone is mine...\" she doubled over, clutching her stomach as everything swirled and spun around her, drifting in and out of double vision.  Her head ached from the impact when Greg had pushed her against the wall.  Despite the fact she wasn't aware of it she was suffereing from a severe concussion.  Laura also hadn't noticed yet that she was bleeding despite the fact the blood was soaking her hair and dripping down her face.  The only thing she was aware of was how angry she was.  The anger shone through the muddled haze of her thoughts like a beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nausea subsided for the moment and Laura forced herself to stand upright.  She leaned heavily against the wall and panted with the effort through clenched teeth.  \"That phone is mine,\" she said again as she stumbled down the hallway.  She had a plan.  She would get her phone back from Greg no matter what it took.  Laura reached the closet at the end of hall and paused to rummage through it.  Finding an old roll of duct tape she decided it might be useful.  For a moment she stared at it with dull comprehension then slid her left hand into it, wearing it like a bracelet.  After another moment she finally saw what the real object of her search had been.  Her white teeth flashed a predatory and dangerous looking smile; a stark contrast againstt her blood streaked face as her hand gripped it tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had run through his dumbells and even the heaviest had been ridiculously light to him.  Now he was trying to load up his bar with everything he had so he could see if he could bench press it.  A noise from the corner of the basement caught his attention and he turned to look over his shoulder.  A long moment dragged by where he saw nothing and the sound wasn't repeated.  He mentally shrugged and turned back to his weight bar when he heard it again.  \"What the hell?\" he hissed, getting up and walking across the room.  He noticed that the small window near the stairs was unlatched and the slight breeze was causing it to strike the wall.  \"Huh,\" he grunted as he closed it and latched it.  He smirked to himself as he remembered how he and Vanessa use to sneak out of the house through that window when they were younger.  He hadn't been able to fit through that window since he first starting lifting weights when he was about 15 or 16.  He turned to face his posing mirror and struck a pose, laughing.  \"Definitely too big for that now.\"  Greg broke off in mid laugh at a flash of movement in the mirror.  \"Laura...\" Greg grunted as Laura brought a baseball bat down on the back of his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT PHONE IS MINE!!!\"  She shrieked as she brought the bat back for another swing.</span></div></div>",

With an agonizing cry Greg let go of the bat and sank to one knee.  Before he could regain his focus she brought the bat crashing down on his forehead with a brutal overhand blow.  Gregs body went limp and he fell over backward.  Laura stepped over him and ran to pick up her phone from the weight bench where Greg had left it.  She looked at him as he groaned and tried to struggle to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disgust me, you asshole,\" Laura hissed as her fingers flew over her iPhone screen.  \"You selfish FUCKING ass.  You're already tall and and good looking and strong, but that isn't fucking enough for you is it?  You make yourself even bigger and then you can't even have the fucking decency to share?  And you fucking hurt me on top of it?  Fuck you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa sis, calm down, this isn't like you.\"  Greg fought his way to his knees and began crawling towards Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it fucking is now.  I'm sick and tired of being the small quiet one.\"  Laura glared down at Greg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to hurt you, I'm sorry,\" Greg stammered.  For the first time in his life he was afraid of his youngest sister.  Her eyes were wild, she looked deranged, and the smeared blood did nothing to detract from his fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a bit late for I'm sorry now, don't you think?\"  Laura stabbed the \"apply changes\" button on her phone and smiled her unsettling, predatory smile.</span></div></div>",

The euphoria he had felt just moments ago was replaced by a feeling sickening fear.  He scrambled over the bench to get to her but she rapped his arm solidly with the bat before he could get a grip.  \"Ouch,\" he yelped.  The feeling of terror got worse when he realized how high pitched and shrill he sounded.  He flung himself bodily over the bench at her and managed to grab onto the bat before she could swing again.  \"I have you now,\" he snarled, wrenching the bat from her grip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura punched him in the mouth and his head rocked back. The bat clattered to the floor as Greg reeled and Laura pushed him, sending him sprawling over the bench.  He struggled to sit up as he heard the familiar rasp of duct tape being unrolled.  \"What the hell are you trying to do to me?\"  He squealed as Laura roughly jerked him over the bench.  He tried to elbow her in the face but she punched him in the mouth again and swept duct tape over his arm, pinning it to the bench.  She quickly wrapped his arm to it.  \"What the hell?\"  Greg was fighting back tears as he clawed at the tape, trying to get his arm free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Greg,\" Laura said in an ice cold voice as she grabbed his free arm and pushed it back against the bar he had moments ago loaded down with nearly a thousand pounds of steel.  He moaned in fear as he realized that she was overpowering him and in moments his other arm was firmly taped down.  Laura stepped back and Greg got a view of himself in his posing mirror.  He opened his mouth to scream but cringed instead as Laura lifted the iPhone up and mirthlessly laughed.  The sound sent chills down his spine.  \"Five foot nothing and eighty five pounds.  That's what you are now if you were wondering.\"  Greg looked down and crossed his legs, trying to hide his nakedness and Laura laughed again.  \"Yea, that huge thing you gave yourself looks a bit ridiculous on you now.

Because you're an asshole that's why.  You wanted it all so now you get nothing.  This is karma Greg.\"  Laura was ignoring him as she concentrated on her iPhone.  You know what I'm doing now Greg?  I'm locking my iPhone so even if you DO get it away from me again you won't be able to use it.  Then I'm going to make you watch me grow, bigger than you just were just because I know it will hurt you to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sara was on top of the world. Her new body was incredible, and she was coming up with more and more ideas for additional changes all the time. She couldn\u2019t wait to see what Laura\u2019s phone could really do for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the front door of Greg\u2019s house with several bags of clothes in her hands. Already she was wearing an outfit she had bought for herself while she\u2019d been shopping for him. Since her additional 4 inches of height had gone almost exclusively to her legs she\u2019d bought a black leather mini skirt and slid into black high heels to properly show them off. And show them off she did. Every step she took she flexed her thighs a little and felt her calves bunch with the help of her shoes. When she\u2019d added the additional muscle she hadn\u2019t fully considered just how much 80 pounds of muscle would affect her 125 pound frame. She\u2019d wanted a jump start into figure competitions; what she\u2019d gotten was a full blown jolt to the top of the Ms. Olympia charts. She was now a 205 pound powerhouse, and the legs she showed off were thick with muscle. She had thighs 29\u201d around and calves that measured 21\u201d. Her new legs were her pride and joy, but the rest of her body was incredible as well. She hadn\u2019t been able to find any tops that fit her well in the women\u2019s section, so she\u2019d purchased a white button down shirt from the men\u2019s department. She wore the shirt with only two buttons clasped across her glorious EE-cup breasts. Above and below the shirt hung open showing off her incredible physique. She\u2019d pulled the sleeves of the shirt off leaving her 21\u201d arms bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in spite of growing much more than she\u2019d intended, she wanted more. The muscle that had been added was incredibly erotic and very dense. She\u2019d found that she was much stronger than she looked, and that feeling of power and strength was intoxicating. And she was going to have more whether Greg liked it or not. If he refused she had every intention of using her.... charms to get her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was just about to knock on the front door when she heard Greg yelp with pain. The she heard Laura\u2019s voice shouting at him and calling him names. Something about the sound of that voice sent a chill through Sara\u2019s body; it was the shrill shriek of someone who was loosing touch with reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Sara tried the front door and found it locked. Playing a hunch she gripped the knob tightly and began pushing down with all of her might. It was mere seconds before the knob surrendered and broke off. Sara shook the lock mechanism loose and pushed the door open. The door to the basement weight room was also locked, but the knob on this door was even weaker than the previous one. She opened the door and began descending the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see Greg and Laura struggling against each other, and neither seemed to have heard Sara breaking in. Sara let out a gasp as Laura moved aside and Sara could see that not only was her boyfriend now chained to a weight bench with duct tape, but his body had been reduced to that of a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive foot nothing and eighty five pounds,\u201d Laura said as if reading Sara\u2019s mind. \u201cThat\u2019s what you are now if you were wondering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara watched as Greg crossed his legs over a member that was far too large for his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Laura laughed, \u201cthat huge thing you gave yourself looks a bit ridiculous on you now. I\u2019ll fix it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara quietly reached the bottom of the stairs and slipped her shoes off. Then she took slow steps toward Laura preying that the young girl wouldn\u2019t turn around or that former big lug wouldn\u2019t give her position away. Laura was deep in her villainous monologue trying to make Greg understand just how much Greg had ruined her life and now she was going to have her revenge - blah, blah, blah. All Sara knew was she had to get that phone away from Laura who was already about to set up a password lock to keep others out of her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m going to make you watch me grow bigger than you just were because I know it will hurt you to see it.\u201c Laura was telling her shriveled brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThen what?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged, \u201dI don\u2019t know, probably whatever I feel like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you think, runt,\u201d Sara said from behind Laura. Before the smaller girl could even turn around Sara\u2019s meaty python arm was wrapped around her chest, pinning her arms to her sides. Sara easily plucked the phone from Laura\u2019s grip and slid it into the waist of her skirt for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the phone was out of her hand again Laura went ballistic. Once more her dream was slipping away. She was screaming, spitting, and biting but Sara\u2019s grip was far too strong. Sara picked Laura up off the ground and carried her under one arm easily. She used her free hand to pick up the duct tape and, biting the end in her mouth, pulled a long strip away from the roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara set Laura on the floor next to her brother and bound her hands to the weight bar next to Greg\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome job, babe.\u201d Greg said in his new higher voice. Seeing his expanded girlfriend with her new muscles still didn\u2019t quite convince him that she should have gone as far as she had, but her increased strength proved more than useful. \u201cNow cut me loose so I can change back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara stood up and pulled Laura\u2019s phone out of her waistband. Perhaps this was the chance she\u2019d been hoping for.</span></div></div>",

The phone was currently in \"Settings\" presumably because Laura had been about to lock it.  While locking the phone sounded like a good idea Sara didn't feel familiar enough with iPhones to find the option and she had other things on her mind anyway.  After a moment she tentatively pushed the \"Home\" button and then started hunting for the app to further modify her body.  \"But first I want to make a FEW more tweaks to myself.  It won't take me long.\"  Sara grinned with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara?\"  Greg sounded incredulous, \"You have to be kidding me.  C'mon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That phone is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Sara looked up to meet Lauras icy cold gaze.  Sara tried to hold eye contact but the unblinking stare and raw, unveiled hate forced her to look away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That phone is mine,\" Laura said again in a flat, inflection-less voice.  \"You didn't ask if you could use it.  I want it back.  I want it back now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked again at Laura, then at Greg, taking in details she hadn't noticed during her chaotic arrival moments ago.  \"Greg, what's wrong with her?\" she finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with her?  Can't you see she's lost her mind?  Let me out of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shook her head, \"That's not what I mean.\"  Sara continued to regard the smaller girl.  She had always liked and gotten along with Laura.  Part of her had always felt a little bad for the ugly duckling of Gregs family.  The girl who was sitting on the floor now, with her hands duct taped to the weight bar above her head, face smeared with blood and the intense unblinking stare WASN'T the Laura she knew.  Sara glanced back and forth between Laura and Greg again, noting the fresh blood around Greg's nose where his lips seemed to be split in a few places, the thin trickle of blood coming from his nose, the bump on his forehead that still seemed to be swelling and bruising.  All obviously recent injuries.  Laura on the other hand...  \"Why does Laura look like she was hurt a long time ago?  Most of the blood on her face and hair is drying.\"  Gregs gaze dropped to the floor and Sara felt a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg hurt me to get what he wanted,\" Laura said, in the same flat tone.  \"He weighed three hundred and ninety pounds and he hurt me.  Nearly a foot taller than me and almost four times my size and he hurt me.\"  Saras mouth opened but nothing came out, she realized she was shaking her head but was terrified that what Laura was telling her was true.  Gregs averted gaze only seemed to confirm it.  \"He hurt me to get what he wanted so I'll hurt him to get what I want.  If you keep helping him I'll hurt you to,\" Laura continued in a manner that was so emotionless it was unnerving.  \"If you give me my phone back right now I promise I will not hurt either of you and you can keep the body Greg gave you.  But if you touch it one more time you'll regret it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shivered involuntarily at Laura's creepy smile but at the same time couldn't help but think, \"What can Laura possibly do to me?\"</span></div></div>",

She couldn't come up with a single one where Laura could possibly be a threat to her.  Finally she shook her head and started scrolling through the apps on Laura's phone, still looking for the one she could use to make herself even better.  She stopped as Laura began to laugh, it was a hollow laugh, devoid of any kind of joy and it made Sara's skin crawl.  She looked up to see Laura standing now, her hands still taped to the weight bar.  Greg was looking back and forth uncertainly between the two girls.  A drop of blood fell from the knuckles Laura had split punching her brother and he squirmed when it struck his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura,\" Sara began softly.  \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder you two get along so well.  You're both so stupid you must be made for each other.  Greg was stupid for stacking so much weight on this old bench and you're stupid for taping me to the weight.\"  Laura grinned and pushed on the bar, towards Greg.  The whole bench groaned and shifted.  Greg's eyes went wide with terror and Sara realized that because Greg was taped to the weight bar AND the bench he had nowhere to go.  The weight would crush him if the bench collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not as big as he was, I don't think you can lift it,\" Laura's matter of fact assessment was exactly what was running through Sara's mind as the bench began to fall over.  Laura laughed again.</span></div></div>",

Her fingers closed around it just as the bench gave way completely and she wasn't ready for the half ton of dead weight.  She grunted as her body twisted with the falling weight, her back twinged painfully and her shoulders ached as they absorbed the shock.  Greg began thrashing with terror, trying to get out from under the falling bar and Sara staggered, trying not to drop it.  \"You're making it worse Greg,\" she panted, trying to lower the weight and NOT crush her boyfriend.  For an instant she was face to face with Laura and she recoiled from Laura's predatory grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duct tape doesn't stick very well to stainless steel and you shouldn't have tied my hands together like you did,\"  Laura held her free hands up then dashed past Sara.  Sara could hear her feet pounding up the basement steps and the door at the top of the stairs slammed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, you bitch, I'll kill you for this!\"  Greg shouted as Sara lowered the weights to the ground with the resounding clash of plate steel on concrete and almost collapsed on top of Greg.  She helped tear the duct tape from his arms and they held each other as they both shook, Sara from the exertion and Greg from the terror induced adrenaline.  He had pissed himself she noted with distaste.  \"She's gone,\" Greg said finally.  \"And she took the phone with her.\"</span></div></div>",

The corner was scuffed where it had hit the floor but she was quickly able to confirm it still worked.   The sound of the weights finally crashing to the floor came from the basement and Laura idly wondered whether or not Sara had managed to save her brother or not.  If she had really thought about it she would have recognized her complete lack of empathy for his well being and been concerned by it.  As it was, she had other things on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Sara hadn't even got the app started again after exiting the \"Settings\" menu.  Laura quickly entered \"Settings\" and set the phone to autolock and picked a four digit code she'd be able to remember easily.  Then she turned the phone off and stuck it in the pocket of her shorts while she tried to think of what she should do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts became fuzzy and unfocused for a moment and she wasn't sure how long she had been standing there.  She probed the haze in her mind, looking for the anger that made everything so clear but for the moment she couldn't find it.  Suddenly a voice broke into her thoughts and she jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, oh my god, what happened to you?  Why is our front door broken?  Where's Greg?  He never made it to the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura opened her eyes to see Vanessa standing in front of her, looking very concerned.  \"Greg is in the basement with Sara.\"  Vanessa recoiled at Laura's unnatural smile and toneless delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, what happened to you?\"  Vanessa asked again.  \"Why are you bleeding?\"  Vanessa took a step towards her sister but Laura backed away, swaying unsteadily on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg hurt me,\" Laura said, cocking her head to one side and regarding Vanessa with her unblinking stare.  Why would Vanessa be so upset to hear the answer to her question?  \"So I hurt him back,\" Laura continued.  \"I might have killed him.  I'm not sure.\"  Vanessa gasped.  Laura grinned and ran past Vanessa while the older girl was still obviously stunned.  Laura ran from her house, leaving the broken front door standing wide open behind her.</span></div></div>",

But now after seeing the extremes of what Greg had dabbled with she picturing something much more significant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move,\" she said tonelessly, shoving past an overweight girl about her own age as she snatched the biggest \"mini\" skirt in black leather she saw.

A large spandex top caught her eye and she grabbed it as she entered the dressing room, shutting the door closed behind her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura ignored another warning about altered thought processes and diminished empathy as she brought up her profile.  The image of a pale skinny girl with oversized clothes hanging from her frame appeared.  What was wrong with her face and hair?  Laura zoomed in and puzzled over the bloody streaks.  Finally she selected her hair and found a \"clean\" option.  The bloody streaks vanished from her virtual image.  \"That was easy,\" she muttered to herself.  While she had her hair selected she changed the color to the darkest purest black she could and added a lusterous shine that shamed most shampoo ads.  Finally she lengthened it, making her hair longer and longer, stopping just above her ass.  She had plans for that ass and she didn't intend to block the view.  Laura quickly moved on to her face, cleaning it like she had her hair, clearing and balancing her complexion and applying the same milky white and silky smooth skin to her whole body.  She widened her mouth slightly, made her lips fuller, her eyes larger and applied dark eyeshadow before moving to the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she wanted to be bigger, much much bigger, her goal was to grow into these oversized clothes and make them look tight and sexy.  Laura alternated making her image taller and wider, zeroing in on the dimensions that would fill out her skirt and bra before she worked on details.  Her height reached nearly seven feet before she was satisfied.  She started on her legs, making them sleek and powerful, muscular and sensous, joining to form a magnificent ass that strained the leather skirt to its limits and revealed just the barest teasing glimpse of the underside or her butt cheeks.  Laura spun her virtual model around and finding no flaw below the waist moved on.  Above the waistline her waist narrowed dramatically into a slender hourglass shape with powerful looking abdominal muscles etched into it.  Then her upper body swelled outward again in virtually every direction imaginable.  Laura had learned today that being big enough and strong enough let you do what you wanted to and allowed you to get away with it.  If you were small and weak you got hurt.  She never intended to be hurt again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the almost impossibly trim waist her torso spread in an awe inspiring v-taper to her broad shoulders.  Her delts stood out prominently, adding to her already impressive width.  Her arms were thick with powerful muscle, here was where the strength was.  Everytime Laura thought she looked big enough and strong enough she remembered how easily Greg had pushed her aside and she added more muscle.  Her arms were massive, the muscles increased to a size where it seemed as though her skin could barely contain them and each fiber seemed to be visible as she moved or flexed in the slightest.  Laura increased the muscularity of her chest and back, trying to balance the symmetry of her upper body with those arms but was largely unsuccesful.  Her proportions weren't catroonish but her arms definitely dominated her physique.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't forget about boobs,\" Laura said with a smile, regarding the shelf of chest muscle her body displayed on the phone screen.  The huge bra filled to overflowing as she pushed the breast slider further and further.  The already stressed seams of the spandex top began to tear and when she finally stopped it looked as though the bra and top would both disintegrate if she took a deep breath.  There was no way she could remove them without shrinking or destroying them.  \"Perfect,\" she whispered.  They even took some attention away from how massive her arms were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely perfect.\"  Laura pushed the \"commit changes\" button and laughed as her real body swelled to match what was on her phone.  In seconds she was too big to continue tracking the changes in the changing room mirror.  She adjusted the skirt as her hips swelled to fill it and ran her hands over her ass as the fabric drew tight like a drumhead over it.  She had to adjust and position her expanding breasts in her new bra and she thrilled at the feel of having actual breasts.   \"Eat your heart out Vanessa,\" she chuckled as her breasts swelled larger and larger.  She pulled her shirt straight as the muscular growth started and every seam in her shirt and bra creaked and groaned as the growth stopped.  Laura flexed a monstorous bicep and grinned at how hard it felt.  \"Now no one will hurt me ever again.  Now I'm the strong one.  Now I'm the sexy one.\"  Laura reached for the changing room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery person in the store turned to what was going on as Laura flung the door open and stepped sideways though the doorway.  Some gasped, some just stared at the immense amazon as she walked purposely towards the exit.  \"Hold on,\" an employee snapped herself out of her trance, \"you need to pay for those!\"  Lauras arm brushed the girl aside and she slid across the floor until she collided with a clothes rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled as everyone scattered out if her way.  No one was ever going to hurt her again.</span></div></div>",

You sound better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, her voice was no longer monotone and she was even smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Laura said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better. Things are finally going my way. This app is truly a miracle, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Vanessa shared a glance; Greg\u2019s expression was one of deep concern. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first I repaired my skull you asshole. I had a concussion and a hairline fracture. You though that just because you were all big and strong you could take whatever you wanted. Well now there\u2019s someone stronger than you, and she\u2019ll do whatever <i>I</i> want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you-?\u201d Greg turned toward Sara as he spoke and stopped when he found her no longer crouching but rather standing with a blank expression on her face. \u201cSara! Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh she\u2019s fine,\u201d Laura said. \u201cSara honey, would you restrain my dear siblings for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s hands shot out faster than her beefy body appeared capable and grabbed Vanessa and Greg by the shoulders and spun them around. She then wrapped her thick arms around their chests and hoisted them each off the ground, holding them both with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this to us?\u201d Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to Sara?\u201d Greg was beating against her muscled forearm to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood and began descending the stairs. She held her phone up, \u201cI told you this thing is amazing. I tweaked Sara\u2019s brain a little so that she is loyal to me. She\u2019ll do anything I ask.\u201d Laura reached the bottom and approached where Sara held her brother and sister aloft. \u201cAs for why I\u2019m doing this. Well, I think it\u2019s important for you to understand just how you two have made me feel. While you\u2019ve been out enjoying the fruits of your physical endowments you\u2019ve both hardly been there for me at all. I\u2019ve been hidden, like your ugly little secret. Well, not any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began tapping away at her iPhone\u2019s screen, an evil grin spreading across her face.</span></div></div>",

Greg stood up slowly, still shaking.  \"We have to find her and stop her before she does something horrible to us,\" Greg said, moving towards the to stairs.  Sara held her arm out, stopping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true?\"  Sara asked when Greg turned to her with a puzzled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is what true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb with me Greg, you're a terrible liar.  Is what Laura said true?  Did you hurt her to get the phone?\"  Greg's eyes darted away from Sara and she groaned.  \"I can't believe this.  When you called me and told me Laura had an app on her cell phone that could change peoples bodies I thought she was LETTING you use it.  But what I walked in on just now?  That was not brother and sister sharing their toys nicely.  What really happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"  Greg paused and took a deep breath.  \"I found the phone in her room and figured out what the app could do.  I guess Laura hadn't used it yet because when she got back and found I had used it she freaked out,\" Greg's voice trailed off to an almost incomprehensible mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freaked out how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we don't have time for this, we have to stop her,\" Greg moved to get past Sara again and this time when her arm shot out her hand closed over his jaw and twisted his head to look him in the eye.  He squirmed painfully in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we settle this first.  She freaked out how?  She attacked you?\"  Greg slowly shook his head and Sara gasped with exasperation.  \"Then what?  How did she freak out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted the phone back so she could use it,\" Greg mumbled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't give it to her?  What happened to her head?  What was with all the blood on her head and face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident,\" Greg whined.  \"I just pushed her out of my way, I didn't mean to hurt her.  I guess her head hit the wall or the door frame or something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara let go of Greg, and slowly backed away, her hand held to her mouth and Laura's words echoing in her mind, \"<i>Greg hurt me to get what he wanted.  He weighed three hundred and ninety pounds and he hurt me. Nearly a foot taller than me and almost four times my size and he hurt me.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shook her head again and sighed, hunching her sore shoulders and staring at the floor.  \"I can't believe you,\" she said finally.  \"Your sister has spent her whole life looking up to you and your sister, always being told that ONE DAY, she'll BLOSSOM and finally be like you take for granted and you do this to her?  I really can't believe it.\"  Sara stepped forward and kissed Greg softly on the lips.  \"Thanks for the good times we had together Greg,\" she kissed him again.  \"And thanks for the new body,\" she stepped back and sighed.  \"But I have to go.  Don't call me,\" she turned on her heel and Greg watched her tight leather clad ass slowly walk away from him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sara watched in terror as the weight bench began to tilt onto her boyfriend's meek body. Laura, completely uncaring about the safety of her brother was still pushing the old bench his direction with a joyful look in her eye. For his part Greg fought against the nearly half ton of weight that was coming his way but his sickly arms and scrawny body were no match for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's first thought was to drop the phone but she panicked at the thought of losing the power it held. Instead she griped it tightly and rushed to Greg's aid. As she moved she could hear Laura's voice in her head, <i>you're not as big as he was, I don't think you can lift it</i>, and tried to push aside the doubt. Perhaps she wouldn't be able to bench press what was on that bar, but she was much stronger than she looked and she should be able to hold it up and keep it from crushing Greg until she could set it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara slid her fingers under the bar taking care to hold the phone such that it didn't get crushed or broken; it was a tenuous hold, but she was desperate not to let Laura get her hands on the phone. Sara steadied her legs and braced the bar just as the bench groaned and buckled. Her entire torso flexed so hard that her shirt split down her back and over her shoulders while the buttons on the front popped off. She sucked in a huge breath and fought against the 900 pounds. For a moment she thought that Laura's assessment was going to be correct and Sara quickly tried to think of a way she could drop the weight without hurting anyone but her arms held and her fear abated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not strong enough, huh?\" Sara boasted. \"This feels good. I'm getting a hell of a pump, don't you think?\" She took a step back and then another so that the bar was no longer hovering over the heads of Greg or Laura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was just about to begin setting the weight down when Laura spoke, \"You're a fucking moron, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked to the girl whose eyes were locked onto the iPhone in her hand. Suddenly Laura shoved her taped hand one way then yanked them back doing her best to send Sara toppling off balance. The big girl did her best to roll with Laura's bucking but it was all too much: she was going to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iPhone slipped from Sara's fingers and Laura's eyes went wide with delight. All she had to do now was free her hands and get the phone. Her joy turned to disbelief, though, as Sara reeled losing control of the bar in her hand and dropped it. The largest plates on one side of the bar landed dead on the phone crushing it beyond repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Laura and Greg let out screams of terror and loss; Laura because she'd lost her chance to be special and Greg because he realized he was now stuck as a 5 foot tall 80 pound weakling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screams died out and Sara, Greg, and Laura sat in silence at a loss over what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seemed like an eternity later a faint crackling sound could be heard. At first they all ignored it but as the sound grew stronger their attention was drawn to the smashed remains of Laura's iPhone. A bright light was slowly seeping out from between the cracks like a liquid. A strange pool of electricity was forming on the floor that had the trio mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laura began bucking her body and scooting closer to the light. Her hands were still bound but she was sliding her legs closer to the mysterious substance. Before Sara could even ask what Laura was doing Greg started to fight for the light as well. Suddenly Sara had to have it, if for no other reason than to make sure no one else got it. The big girl reached out her arm just as Laura and Greg were about to touch the pool of power.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg was overcome with a need to posses the crackling pool of electricity and would do anything to get it. He was able to use the huge weight his hand were tied to to pivot his body around and kick his legs towards it but it was a half a second behind his sister. Laura brought her leg down but missed and only touched the very edge of the strange light. Greg was able to adjust his leg and kick hers away before dropping his own leg right in the center of the light. His body absorbed it all and he let out a scream as he was flooded with electricity. Laura kicked and threw her body around cursing and spitting with blind rage. At every turn Greg took everything from her and she was constantly left with nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg fell silent and lay still. Sara crawled to his side and put her hands on his face. \"Oh baby, are you okay?\" She calmed when she saw he was breathing but still pleaded for some sign that he was alright. A few moments later Greg opened his eyes. Sara let out a gasp of relief. \"There you are, can you say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was looking through Sara, \"I see... I can see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you see, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled. \"Everything. All of it. I can see through all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sara was starting to get worried. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg eyes met hers. \"Stand back, baby. You're going to enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara did as she was told. Before her eyes she saw Greg's body begin to lengthen and regain its mass. Greg tugged his hands apart and ripped through the layers of duct tape like they were paper then he stood and stretched his growing body. Within seconds he was back to his 6' 2\" height and his muscles had regained the size he had built over the last several years but he didn't stop there. His height continued to climb and his muscles continued to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara glanced down and saw that his penis was also growing thicker and longer. It was already bigger than any cock she'd seen in her life when her view of it was obscured by a pair of loose fitting cotton shorts that appeared from nowhere. To her delight Sara found that even though his new shorts were big on his huge body she could still see the outline of Greg's horse cock which ended just where his shorts were hemmed and when he shifted the apple sized head would peek out. Sara let her eyes move away from Greg's enormous tool and up his body. Along with his shorts a black t-shirt had also appeared though this garment was so tight she could make out his extreme vascularity through the fabric though it must have been getting bigger with him because he was still growing but the shirt refused to tear. He flexed arms that were bigger around than her legs which was no small feat considering how pumped up her thighs were and beamed a smile down at her from his new height of 7 feet tall. His body was enormous and overloaded with hyper-dense muscle that looked to be cut from steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Greg's body stopped swelling and he ran his hands over his monstrous pecs and flexed his thighs (which looked so plump and juicy that Sara had to physically restrain herself from launching herself at them and nibbling away at his quads). \"Pretty cool, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of Greg's voice hit Sara like a slap and the bass rattled her bones. The sight and sound of him alone was enough to ignite a fire in her that soaked her panties. There were a million things she wanted to say but all she was able to get out was a single word, \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled. \"Whatever power was in the phone is now in me. I can do whatever I want, and I'm going to. But first...\" His smile turned to a scowl and he turned to face Laura who was still on the ground fighting to free her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg bent down and lifted the 900 pound weight and Laura along with it using one hand. There was no effort required; he may as well have been picking a flower from the soil. He held the bar over his head so that he was face to face with Laura, her feet dangled far off the ground. Her face was contorted with pure rage but she held her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven feet tall, five hundred and fifty pounds. In case you're wondering.\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura screwed up her face and was about to spit some insult at Greg when he interrupted her. \"Hold your tongue, little sister. I haven't forgotten the beating you gave me or the shrimp you turned me into, and I certainly haven't forgotten how you tried to kill me just now. Now that I'm in charge again I suggest you change your attitude and maybe I'll play nice too. In fact, as a peace offering, I'll help you out. You said you wanted to be bigger, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slowly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd probably like some bigger boobs too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura fought past the awkward thought of her brother talking about her breasts and quietly said, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it.\" Greg said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura felt her body begin to change and grow. The feeling was incredible, like a warmth flowing through her. However, her joy turned to terror when she glanced at her arms and saw they weren't becoming more fit but rather swelling with fat. She couldn't see down to the rest of her body but her clothes were becoming very tight across her belly and around her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Laura pleaded. Tears began to well in her eyes and spill into her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm teaching you a lesson. You seem to think you've got it bad, I want to make sure you know things can always be much worse. You should be more grateful for what you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's arms were beginning to hurt from supporting a body that was still getting heavier. Finally the tape holding her hands ripped and Laura fell to the floor in a heap. She was disgusted with what she saw: like Greg her outfit had changed into a tube top and spandex shorts and her blobby belly and cottage cheese thighs were on clear display. And she was still growing fatter and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big should I make you?\" Greg mused to himself. \"You're just over three hundred pounds now, should we shoot for four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop,\" Laura begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to be bigger. And I'm pretty sure your boobs have even outgrown Vanessa's.\" Greg laughed. He stopped when he felt a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg, stop. Look at her.\" Sara was horrified by what she was seeing but she was afraid to make Greg mad lest she suffer the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Greg said then looked back at Laura. \"You're not stuck like this, you know. If you're good then good things will happen for you. I think you just need some perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEAVE ME ALONE!!!\" Laura screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it, kid.\" Greg lowered the 900 pound weight he still held and quickly and easily twisted it into a knot which he dropped at Laura's side with a deafening clang. He then turned and slid his massive arm around Sara's shoulder guiding her towards the staircase. \"Let's go have some fun, baby. I want to take these new powers for a real spin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ascended the stairs (which screamed in protest under their incredible weight) Sara glanced back at Laura and wondered if Greg becoming a god was really a good idea.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sara and Greg left the basement and closed the door behind them. Sara collapsed onto the couch in the living room and let out a huge sigh. She was at a loss over what to do about Greg. On one hand she wanted him so bad and wanted even more to be wanted <i>by</i> him, on the other she could see things getting very bad very fast. She looked up and her heart skipped a beat when she saw Greg was going through a series of poses and admiring himself in a large mirror on the living room wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was that always there?</i> she wondered. The thought vanished when Greg ripped his shirt off and tossed the rags aside then flexed his insane thirty-something inch arms. This time she couldn't resist and flew to his body like a moth to a flame. With Greg's new height Sara's head only reached his chest which was fine by her as she pressed herself tightly against his rock hard pecs and ran her fingers over the detailed bumps that made up his obliques. She hiked her skirt up a little and wrapped a leg around one of his and began grinding her crotch against his quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg responded by sliding a hand under her butt and lifting her up so her face met his. She wrapped her powerful legs around his middle and squeezed for all she was worth but Greg hardly seemed to notice. Instead he planted a kiss on Sara that rocked her head back hard; Sara was even shocked by how strong Greg's tongue was. His power should have worried her but she just found herself becoming more and more overwhelmed by desire and a need to be fucked by her muscle hunk now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg must have felt her burning need because he slid her skirt up even higher and tore her panties off. Sara bit his lower lip and growled wordlessly pleading with Greg to enter her. He responded by slipping a fat finger into her vagina and feeling around. Sara leaned back and howled her approval as a massive orgasm wracked her body. A second later she heard a ripping sound followed by something slapping her lower back hard enough to hurt. When she looked in the mirror to her left she saw that Greg's penis had torn a hole in his shorts and extended to an 20 inch monster as big around as a wine bottle. Greg put his hands on Sara's hips and lifted her up positioning her to take his enormous cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara became worried, \"It's too big, it can't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg grinned. \"Don't worry, baby. It'll fit. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara realized that he must have used his power on her. A voice inside her told her she should be upset, feel violated, but she didn't. She wanted him so bad. For the briefest of moments she considered that maybe he was amping her desire levels as well but then his grapefruit sized penis head was pressing against her sex and she could feel her juices pouring out of her onto him. He pressed into her and she saw stars, then she was actually sliding down his pole and coming nonstop. Sara bottomed out with two-thirds of Greg's penis still below her. Greg lifted her up and slid her down and she could no longer hold back the screams. She was overwhelmed with the most perfect combination of pleasure and pain imaginable. Then Greg pulled the remnants of Sara's already torn shirt off, moved her body close to him and clamped his mouth on one of her cantaloup sized breasts while bucking his hips and pumping his cock into her harder and faster. Sara's animal brain took over and she lost all rational thought. The next hour passed in a blur of primal, savage sex. Greg came over and over again and each time it felt like she had a fire hose inside her. Eventually she became weary and felt herself drifting off to sleep, she felt Greg hug her close then set her down on the couch where she passed out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sara awoke with her head on Greg's stomach, his massive arm was draped down the length of her body. She could tell the television was on but had no interest in what Greg was watching; actually she didn't care about anything but Greg anymore. She could feel her previous responsibilities and commitments being replaced with only Greg. Her job didn't matter, her family was of no consequence anymore all she wanted was the love and approval of her man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's done something to my mind</i>, Sara thought to herself; her earlier suspicions were as good as confirmed. <i>He's changed me into his slave.</i> She looked up and around Greg's mountainous pecs at his face and the concerns about mind control drifted away. <i>So what if he has? This is bliss.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked back to the arm that lay along her chest and stomach and slid her fingers up and down his bicep and forearm tracing the lines of his veins. Greg, realizing she was now awake, slid his hand up her torso and gave her breast a solid squeeze. Sara noticed that he had put her in clothes (some skintight lycra shorts and a bikini top) in case someone came home to find them. But that raised another concern in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby? Shouldn't you be shrinking back down to normal soon?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled. \"Why would I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what if Vanessa or even your parents came home? Wouldn't they freak out to see you this way. For that matter what about Laura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg turned off the TV. \"Let me show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood and ascended the stairs towards the bedrooms. Sara saw that Greg had repaired his own shorts and watched his rear struggle to not rip the seams open. Without even thinking about it she gave his ass a pinch. At the top of the stairs Greg turned right towards his parents room instead of left as he usually would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we going into your parents room?\" Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not theirs anymore, it's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I was 16 and told them I needed the bigger room for my bigger body. That's what I wanted to show you, look.\" Greg led Sara inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the room had changed and was now filled with Greg's things as well as lots of new items. One wall was lined with bodybuilding trophies which were bookended with photos of Greg on stage with the top names of the bodybuilding world and in every case he positively dwarfed them. There was a box on the floor near where Sara stood that was filled with muscle magazines that featured Greg on the cover. In a few cases Greg had his arms wrapped around some bikini clad hardbody but on most he was curling some obscenely large dumbbell or barbell with his pumped up muscles drenched in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" Sara said; this was insane. How long had she napped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all because of my powers. I can even change the past if I want. I fixed things so that I was born with a physical abnormality that made me super muscular.\" Greg pointed to a picture near his bed of a baby with giant muscles. The infant had swollen arms and pecs and even sported six pack abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg continued to lay out his new life story. \"As I got older my body grew all on its own. By the time I was 15 I was as buff as any pro and I'd never set foot in a gym, ever. I entered my first show that year, I got special permission since I was so young but I lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Greg was really enjoying filling Sara in on what he'd created, \"I think the story is more exciting that way. A 6 foot 8 inch 300 pounds natural phenom shows up and loses. Well, I came in fourth. Pretty good considering I wasn't proportioned well and didn't know crap about posing. So I got a trainer, hit the gym and studied all I could. The next year I was back, 2 inches taller, 100 pounds heavier and blew the competition away. I've never lost since. By the time I turned 18 I was the 7 foot, 550 pound beast you see before you and I decided I was big enough. I stopped actively working out, but I'll hit the gym from time to time to maintain my size and definition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara wandered around the room looking closely at all the photos. She couldn't believe how all of recent history had completely changed. She loved his competition pictures because he wore posing briefs and had to try and cram his enormous cock into the tiny garment. In every case she could see his shaft or balls (sometimes both) through the sides or his head peeking over the top. She came to another picture, this one of his whole family. There was Greg towering over everyone else with his giant arms around his mom and dad. Sara also noted that Laura now had her new obese body instead of her thin and plain appearance. Then Sara spotted Vanessa; the girl was still a total knockout, perhaps even more so. She still had her large, firm breasts and round hips but her body now held more muscle than before. Instead of just being fit the new Vanessa was a hardbody that could hold her own against fitness competitors anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to Vanessa?\" Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually nothing. That was an unexpected ripple caused by my changes. Seeing me as muscular and strong as I was and being around so many new musclebound friends inspired her to hit the gym way harder. She's been cleaning up at figure shows like I've been winning the muscle ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it, she looks amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently my very existence at this size has influenced hundreds of thousands of people all over the world to work out and get bigger. Women especially have been more prone to seek more muscular physiques.\" Greg said almost robotically. His mind seemed to be wandering or perhaps he was just exploring the universe he'd created for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked to the closet doors which were huge mirrors (so many new mirrors in this house) and admired her own reflection. \"Am I one of those? Did you change my past so that you inspired me to look this way?\" She stood on her toes and pushed her butt out toward the mirror running her fingers down her glutes and around the front of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sighed. \"Yes, those were easy enough threads to connect. I'll admit, though, I'm still not sure how I feel about you being this big. I told you before girls shouldn't be this buff. Plus you kind of forced me to do it to you, maybe now is a good time to undo it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara couldn't believe what she was hearing, she wanted to cry. \"How can you say that? Look at me, I've never felt so incredible in all my life and I look so sexy.\" She rushed to his side looked into his eyes. \"You wouldn't deny me something I want so badly, would you? You love me don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was silent though Sara could see a hint of compassion in his eyes. Perhaps is mind wasn't completely consumed by his new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" she said planting little kisses on his chest and stomach, \"think of how good I can make you feel now that I'm so much stronger.\" Sara reached into his shorts and pulled his penis out. She still couldn't believe how enormous it was even when soft. She wrapped her fingers around his shaft and squeezed tight using her considerable strength. Greg grunted and his cock instantly began to get hard, inflating rapidly in her hands. She pumped her hands up and down flexing her 21 inch biceps for all they were worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg moaned with pleasure. \"You make a good point. But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" she interrupted, \"not to guilt trip you but I know you've been messing with my brain, I can feel it. You've been filling me with desire for you alone. Don't worry I'm not mad, how could I be? But if you can fix desires couldn't you change your own mind so that you are attracted to girls with muscle? Hardly a big deal, right?\" She clamped her mouth on the head of his penis and sucked hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed, \"Fix my own brain? I'll admit, I hadn't considered that. It's an interesting idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby, I've got all sorts of interesting ideas. I mean, why are you, the most powerful man in the world, still living at home with his parents. I've got ideas that will let us live like royalty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg wanted to push Sara away but they way she was working his tool felt too good. \"You think I couldn't handle that? I was getting there. There are things I have in mind to do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course. But perhaps you could just hear me out, and if you like what I have to say maybe maybe let me keep my muscles? What do you think?\"</span></div></div>",

But he was in charge, his new god-like power already starting to corrupt him, he no longer had to listen to other people if he didnt want to.

Sara's hands keeping contact with his glorious body as long as they can.  Her hands not touching him felt wrong and empty.  And the realization she may never get to touch him again was destroying her.  She knew this terrible feeling was partly of what he had done to her mind and she wanted to just walk away.  But she also realized that it was her true feelings, she didnt want Greg and her to end, they were amplified by the changes Greg had made to her mind.  Looking at his wide massive back walking away the damn had broke.  She ran and grabbed him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was playing with her emotions, he knew it, but he was shocked when she grabbed him from behind so tightly and he could hear her sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hands on hers and started to pull them apart so he could turn to look at her.  He could feel her try to hold tighter, but even her muscled body was no match for his strength and he easily pulled them apart and turned to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at her the tears streaming down her face.  \"Please dont throw me away!\" she cried<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart ached seeing her cry like that  \"I'd never throw you away babe\" he said wiping a tear away from her face.  \"But i love you too much to force you to be something you dont want.  But i also know what i want.\"  He said matter-of-factly.  And he meant it.  He did love her, and didnt want to force a change on her.  He would easily force changes on others, but Sara his high school sweetheart was special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please ill be whatever you want me to be\"  She said almost begging.  He smiled down at her and she melted seeing that smile knowing she had said the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Greg asked with hope in his heart<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara again woke up with Greg's massive arm draped over her, her body nestled  between his arm and his body, resting her head on his meaty pecs like a pillow listening to his deep restful breathing.  She had felt small next to him last time but this time she felt absolutly tiny.  She wanted to get out of bed but as much as she struggled she could barely budge Greg's arm that had pinned her in place.  But she wasnt paniced her was comfortable she felt beyond safe in his arms.  But even if she was able to move Greg's arm she wouldnt be able to get out of bed anyway without Greg's permission.  If she was with Greg she had to ask him permission for the simplest of tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered to him finally able to rouse him enough.  \"Like, Greggy baby, can i get out of bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmmm, sure\" he said groggily, and moved his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of the bed, as she pulled herself away from his body she already felt a need to be back with him.  But she also felt so vulnerable away from him.  As she looked at herself in the mirror it was clear why.  She was now barely over 5 foot tall, and her once impressivle muscles were gone.  Now in their place were soft dainty muscles.  She looked fit but she also knew they contained almost no strength at all, she could barely lift a gallon of milk without two hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only muscles she had that were strong were her back muscles which she needed for the two massive blimps sticking out from her chest.  Greg had wanted two big handfuls for him to play with but with his now huge body that meant almost volleyball sized breasts, and on her tiny 5'1\" frame they looked titanic.  They were prefectly shaped and rounded and perky, anyone could easily think they were fake the looked so perfectly shaped.  But the jiggle everytime she moved let people know they were real, and Greg had made them extra jiggly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down her waist shrunk to a waspy 18 inches which then flared back out into two thick firm thighs and ass cheeks.  She looked as if she had done squats everyday for years.  It stuck out behind her balancing out the massive breasts.  As she stood there her feet and calves began to hurt and she remembered why.  She walked over and grabbed the pair of 6 inch stripper heels and put them on her calves and feet starting to feel better afterwards.  Greg had made it so she had to wear heels all the time that were at least 4 inches.  And the heels forced her ass to pop out even more and with every stepped it popped, and screamed \"smack me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was still hers but it now said \"Bimbo\" Her hair was thick and platinum blonde as it tumbled down her back ending just around her ass.  Her lips were huge, thick, and pouty and almost always in a \"O\" shape as if always wanting a cock between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didnt just look like a pure bimbo, she was pretty sure she was one.  She talked like one now and she was pretty sure Greg had reduced her IQ as well.  She wasnt happy with being a bimbo but she was also just happy to still be with Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to process her new body, \"How is my little Bimbo Barbie?\" Greg said from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around crossed her arms and stomped her foot with a pouty face looking like a petulant child.  \"Like, dont call me that, I totally hate it\"  Greg just smiled and she could have sworn she felt her IQ dropped a few more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" he said chuckling \"To make it up to you, you can blow me\" he said.  Her eyes lit up and she squeeled in happiness as if him letting her blow him was the greatest gift ever.</span></div></div>",

She got out of the bed and quickly dressed herself in a pair of tight sexy leggings and a tight low cut tanktop, both of which are stretched to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she is in the kitchen preparing to make up a breakfast for Greg.  She realizes they dont have any milk, she starts to panic will Greg be mad at her?  She decides to head out to the store real quick to get some milk.  As she is walking to the store she is getting the usual catcalls, and as she passes guys they many are struggling to not smack her ass.  Just down the street from the store there is a small group of sleezy middle aged men.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dollface\" one of the group calls out, she tries to ignore him but the group approch leaving a small path between them.  \"What your name? sweet thang?\"  She continues to ignore him and starts push through them  As Sara passes the one gives her ass a hard smack, and she spins around and slaps him.  But with her weaken muscles her slap feels like a tap to the man.  Usually she could have handled a man but now realzing how weak she is she starts to become afraid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-leave me alone\" she stammers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what, Dollface?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...or ill tell me boyfreind,... Greg\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy smiles \"What a coincedence my name is Greg\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..?\" Sara utters confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, see?\" he says pulling out his drivers license, and showing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her depleted intelligence this confuses her and grasps for some way to explain this.  \"Y-you're my boyfreind?\" she asks confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all look at each other stunned, thinking is this chick serious? But the middle aged sleezy man named Greg laughs and rolls with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh yea, of course i am dont you recognize me you bimbo?\"  he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at him, \"Well your name is Greg and my boyfreind loves to call me a bimbo, so i guess you are\"  she says her simple mind trying to put things together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the house Greg is waking up from a snooze after his blowjob.  He loves Sara's new lips, but he feels bad she didnt get as much pleasure as he did.  He begins to focus changing Sara's lips making them sensative enough to get a mini orgasm from kissing or blowing.  He thinks about the perfect picture of bimboness he has turned her into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder if i should ask her to marry me? or just make her my fiance?' he says as he focuses again 'I wish Sara wanted to be her boyfreind's devoted housewife and mother to his kids, and was engaged to him'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Greg didnt realize was Sara had just met another Greg who had become her new boyfreind because she was too much of a bimbo to realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the street a ring forms around her finger and around the sleezy middle aged Greg's finger.  \"What you doing out here Dollface?\"  Gregory asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I was gonna do some shopping honey, to prove i deserve be your wife\" she says.  He look changes slightly, around her neck is a necklace that in big bubbily letters says \"Dollface\", his pet name for her.  circled above and below her navel is a tattoo that reads \"Daddy's Doll\" and the belly button ring is a dangling 5 pink hearts that reads \"Bimbo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok good, oh wait come here\" he says and grabs the back of her head and hair and pulls her roughly against his body and aggressively kisses her.  As he does her body trembles and shivers as the kiss sends mini-orgasms through her body.  He loves it as his buddies watch in jealousy and lust, he breaks the kiss.  She is lost in euphoria from the kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get going\" he says as he slaps her on the ass to send her on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the fuck did you get so lucky\" his buddy asks astounded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory gives a sleezy smile \"She is just too stupid to realize she can do any better.\"</span></div></div>",

Of fat weighing down her body. She tried to move, but couldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her basement started to change. More workout equipment started to be left around to the point where it was no longer just a few machines, but a full on personal gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried grabbing some, but was cut off by walls coming in. Laura tried screaming, but was closed off from the rest of the basement apart from a little hole in the wall which held the brother that left her earlier come back on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GREG, what are you doing. What sort of sick punishment is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punishment?\" Noted the beefed up entity. \"This is what you asked for, for me to leave you alone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like this, I wanted to be away from YOU, is this another one of your twisted thoughts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear sister, you have idea what you're asking for.

I bet it would feel much more interesting to grow slowly than all at once.  You can even set the initial change on a timer.  Like let's say I wanted you to shrink to the size of a toddler an hour from now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Laura, please.  For the love of...\" Greg trailed off at the sound of Lauras chilling laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can even erase your \"template\" who you really are.  I wonder what that would do to you?  I wonder if I can copy someone elses template over yours?  Maybe that little kid down the block with the pop bottle glasses and the asthma.\"  Greg moaned.  \"Oh I could.  That's good to know.\"  Laura laughed again and Greg had to fight to keep from crying in front of her.  \"Oh relax you big baby.  I'm not going to waste the power of this thing on you anymore.  At least I won't if you don't piss me off anymore.\"  The next fext minutes dragged by in relative silence, punctuated only by Gregs stifled sobs and Lauras occasional exclamations of \"oh that looks really good\" and \"I have to try that.\"  Finally Laura cleared her throat.  \"I guess that's it then, here goes.\"  Greg had intended to ignore her transformation but in reality he couldn't look away as she pushed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura threw her head back and sighed with pleasure.  \"Wow, that feels incredible,\" she murmered.  \"Slow IS the way to go...\"  At first Greg couldn't see any difference but then it became apparent that Lauras denim shorts were slowly inching up her thighs.  Her blouse came untucked from her waistband and the fabric began to visibly cut into her skin as her limbs thickened.  \"Mmmmmm... very nice...\" she purred as she ran her hands over her body.  Her chest was becoming noticeably fuller and the strain was most evident around the buttons between her breasts.  Greg held his breath, trying to look away from her swelling breasts.  \"Oops,\" Laura giggled as the first button on her blouse ripped free.  Suddenly cleavage was visible, cleavage that kept swelling, overflowing the tiny A cup bra Laura was wearing and popping open another button.  Laura groped her new chest, kneading her breasts with both hands and moaning.  \"Haha, I'll be bigger than Vanessa soon,\" she bubbled as the tiny bra finally split open entirely.  Her nipples were poking at the skin tight blouse like thumbs and the sounds of seams ripping loose filled the room.  \"Thar she blows!\"  Laura laughed as the last button on her blouse tore free, revealing her still swelling breasts in all their glory.  A muffled \"pop\" sounded as her toes forced their way through the front of her sneakers and she wiggled them with glee.  \"Hello there little guys.\"  Her widening hips won out against her shorts, destroying the button and tearing the zipper open with a loud rasp.  Laura tensed her developing abs, causing her belt buckle to twist apart.  \"Huh, I would have thought the belt would have broke first wouldn't you?\"  She was so caught up in the transformation she really didn't listen to see if Greg had a reply.  Jealousy stabbed Greg deeper in the heart the bigger her muscles got.  She smirked as she flexed one bicep and then the other, shredding her short sleeves.  As the rest of her shirt began to tear across her spreading back she made sure she turned her back to Greg so he could watch her completely destroy the blouse with a lat spread.  The sight of her completely unclothed chest when she turned back took his breath away.  His eyes roamed over the insane width of her deltoids, the swell of her chest and biceps.  They were only pulled away when the sounds of her shorts tearing around her thighs drew his attention back to her lower body.  She turned slightly away to showcase the tremendous shape of her ass as her jeans shorts finally split entirely and fell to the ground.  Completely naked except for her panties, Lauras muscles continued to grow bigger and bigger until Greg knew she had surpassed even how big he with the phones help.  And despite his rage and his fear he could not bring himself to look away.  After what seemed like an eternity Laura finally sighed and stretched her body out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the best five minutes of my entire life,\" she finally said after striking pose after pose in the mirror.  \"And damn, I look good.\"  She smiled at Greg and he tried to look away again.  What had she done to herself?  Here hair and even her face had changed, subtle tweaks, all for the better.  Thinner nose, sharper chin, higher cheekbones, smooth complexion.  Greg squirmed, trying to hide his erection.  This was his sister for crying out loud.  \"Six feet, eight inches, four hundred and fifteen pounds and G cup breasts.  In case you were wondering.\"  She picked the iPhone up, smirked and walked past Greg as he began to fight against the duct tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, you have to let me out of here.  C'mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to do anything I don't want to little brother.  Ever again.\"  Without looking back Laura climbed the stairs and unlocked the basement door.  The stairs creaked and began to collapse under her weight and she scrambled out just in time.  \"Bye Greg,\" she called back, almost drowned out by the sound of the falling staircase.  The door closed with a sound of finality.   </span></div></div>",

She desperately wanted her phone back, especially now that she could see that the Alterations app really did work. She kicked herself for not trying it out herself first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg got closer Laura moved farther from the doorway. She couldn\u2019t believe his sheer size. All over his body his muscles looked fit to burst right through his skin and his veins were clearly visible pulsing with blood. Each step he took caused his thighs to pump and flex, the motion was hypnotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg glared at Laura as he passed, holding her in place with his eyes, willing her to stay put. He had no doubt he could overpower her with no trouble at all, but he didn\u2019t want to hurt her if he didn\u2019t need to. Once he reached the doorway he realized he no longer fit, his bowling ball sized shoulders were too wide. With a smug grin he turned a little to the side so he could pass between the jamb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Greg was out of the room something inside Laura snapped. There was no way she could just let him go, not when the key to her happiness was right there in his hand. She didn\u2019t care how big he was, she had to at least try to get her phone back. She decided speed was her best asset, so as quietly as she could she hurried down the hall behind Greg. Praying he was too enamored with his own bulging muscles to notice her she waited until the hand holding the phone swung back her way and, as quickly as she could, slipped her phone out of his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg spun around confused but Laura was far too quick and was already disappearing back into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit! Give that back!\u201d Greg shouted but the only reply was the sound of Laura\u2019s door slamming and the lock clicking into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stormed back to her door, his footsteps causing the very walls to vibrate. Behind him several hung photos came crashing to the floor.  He yelled in after her, \u201cOpen this door right now!! Laura, if you don\u2019t think I\u2019m both willing and able of breaking this door down then you really underestimate me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited a moment for a response but when none came his head was filled with an image of Laura using her phone to undo the enhancements he\u2019d made to his body. There was no way he could just let that happen. He brought his huge right arm up and, with no hesitation, sent it crashing down on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slab of wood split at the top, the gash running down the middle to a point 3 feet from the top of the frame. The upper hinge ripped from the doorjamb and the door twisted diagonally both opening his view of the interior and blocking his path at the same time.  But before Greg could even think about getting around the door he saw that Laura\u2019s room was empty and her window was wide open.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was jogging across the sand behind her house toward the small group of shops that made up the boardwalk area. She glanced back over her shoulder from time to time to make sure Greg wasn\u2019t following her. Her hope was to stay in densely populated areas where Greg, if he did decide to pursue her, would be less likely to try and grab her. And there was something else she was looking for too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t believe how that extra bulk had gone straight to Greg\u2019s head and she made a mental note to try and keep herself grounded once she made some alterations of her own. Then she smiled realizing that the body of her dreams was within her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back toward the house one last time she realized that she could use the phone to shrink Greg back down but decided that since he didn\u2019t seem to be following her he may have actually gone down to the weight room as he said. She didn\u2019t want all of his strength to vanish while he was bench pressing some ridiculous amount of weight. He may be a brute, but he was still her brother and she didn\u2019t want him to get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura made it to the boardwalk and immediately spotted the shop she was looking for: The Swimsuit Shack. Seeing the nearly naked Greg had shown Laura that she would need something that fit post alterations. She did her best to conceal her overwhelming giddiness as she browsed through rack after rack of skimpy bikinis imagining all the various ways she could grow and flaunt her body.  She was so close to leaving her current boyish body behind she could taste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing her selections down she settled on a bright red thong with a black swirl patter on it. The top was a large which she intended to fill to its maximum capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paid for her purchase with her credit card (ignoring the clerk\u2019s odd look over her size choice) and made a mad dash for the changing rooms outside.  Once inside she went into a stall, locked the door, and whipped out her phone. The Alterations app was still running when she unlocked her phone and she saw Greg\u2019s enlarged form displayed. She noticed that the \u201cMass\u201d slider had been moved less than a quarter of the way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cif he had gone all the way he be... well, a monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few button presses brought her back to her own image. She steadied her hands and examined her options. She started by tapping on the height button. A menu appeared allowing her to input her desired height down to the fraction of an inch. After a moments consideration she input 5\u2019 11\u201c giving her a inch over her sister Vanessa. The 3D model made the height adjustment and Laura then noticed that she was given an option called \u201dProportion.\u201c By moving the slider she found she could alter the ratio of her leg to torso length. She slowly moved the slider up making her legs grow longer and longer while keeping her height set. She stopped when the readout indicated that her new pins measured a seemingly endless 42 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura saw that the Laura pictured on the screen was having a bit of difficulty with her pants. What once fit perfectly were now constricting and far too short. This gave her an idea. Putting the phone down she stripped her clothes off and her new bikini on. The swimsuit was ridiculously large on her tiny frame, but she didn\u2019t let that get to her; before long it would be plenty tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked the phone up once again and was pleased to see the 3D model of her body was now clad in the new bikini. It also fit loose, but with her added height the image in her mind was beginning to take shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she zoomed in on her hips and waist. She adjusted her hips until they were a wide and curvy 40 inches. She turned the model around and made adjustments to butt sculpting a round and firm behind that looked incredible in the thong. She turned back around and, finding her waist had grown a bit with her extra height, decreased the measurement just a little back to 30 inches. Laura zoomed back out and looked at the entire image with a smile. The adjustments she had just made gave her a nearly cartoonish hourglass figure that was only missing the upper swell to complete. Eager to fix this problem she zoomed in on her upper torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slider marked \u201dBust\u201c appeared and Laura immediately began adjusting. She didn\u2019t have to slide far to get the results she was looking for, in fact a second after she began the computer version of Laura has a bosom so swollen the bikini top\u2019s strings popped and fell away. Laura took her finger off the button and found that just like with Greg\u2019s muscles she had only moved a fraction of the way up the scale. The was an indicator next to the enormous breasts that told showed the simulations cup size was now LL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dInsane,\u201c Laura said. \u201dIf I went all the way on this thing I\u2019d probably fill this whole room up with my boobs.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly slid the selector back down until the bikini repaired itself. Then she adjusted just a little more down to give herself a little bit of room to move. Now her phone told her the pictured breasts were an H-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dPerfect,\u201c she was getting more excited by the second. Her soon to be H-cup breasts would put Vanessa\u2019s DD chest to shame. She zoomed out and admired the incredible figure she\u2019d created from her previous form. But she wasn\u2019t done quite yet. She clicked the muscle button and (careful not to go too far) slid the mass selector just enough to give herself a fitness model\u2019s physique. Her musculature was obvious, but still sleek and, most of all, sexy. She tried adjusting the density slider as well, but no matter how far she pushed it she didn\u2019t see any change. Confused she let go and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura clicked through further options. She desperately wanted to hit the apply button, but she also wanted to make sure she did this right and all the way. And, with every new tweak and adjustment her excitement level grew. She found she could remove her freckles and even her skin tone out. She gave herself a healthy even tan and changed her hair from a dirty brown to jet black. She reshaped her face in slight ways: shrinking her nose and chin a little, filling in her lips and cheekbones. Then she changed her eye color from brown to the most brilliant and blazing shade of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly she clicked on the button leading to the collection of tattoos.  She saw there were options to draw your own or even import designs from imported pictures, but there was also an extensive database of thousands of designs. She scanned through the \u201dButterflies\u201c folder since she currently felt like a caterpillar about to emerge from her cocoon. She found a gorgeous design of a butterfly with bright yellow, blue and green wings and placed it on the template Laura\u2019s right inner forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last she zoomed out on the 3D model and regarded it with lust and excitement. Finally her moment had arrived. Her finger drifted over to the \u201dApply\u201c button and pressed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment her finger touched the screen Laura was overcome by an atomic bomb sized orgasm. Her vision blurred and her legs gave way nearly spilling her onto the floor. She was just able to brace herself on the wall of the changing room, but her quick reflexes were more instinct than conscious thought. Waves of energy were blasting from the core of her body outward and having their way with her very cells and molecules. As her vision began to clear she realized she could feel the wall of the tiny room sliding against her shoulder where she was leaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m growing taller!</i> she thought.<i> It\u2019s working!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her legs under her and steadied herself. She stood up to her full height, which was now about 5\u2019 6\u201c, and looked down to admire her changing body. She saw that her legs were taking the lion\u2019s share of the overall increases in height and were becoming rather long already. Her hips had already expanded and filled in the bikini bottom enough to where it fit, but loosely.  As the seconds passed, though, the strings that ran around her hips were becoming tighter and tighter. The feeling of the nylon straps sliding across her expanding flesh was incredibly erotic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Laura was distracted by her swelling bosom. For years she\u2019d been wishing for any kind of curves to sprout on her flat chest and now her dream was not only coming true, but they had already grown to a respectable C cup and were showing no signs of slowing. She adjusted her top to appropriately cover her breasts, and the feel of the fabric on her nipples caused them to leap to attention. Bolts of pleasure shot back and forth between her expanding globes as the bikini became more and more snug. As her boobs crept beyond the D cup range they began pressing into each other creating a canyon of cleavage. She wrapped her arms around her glorious new assets and hugged them close, mashing the titflesh into her chest causing them to spill over her forearms. By the time they were done expanding her breasts were easily the size of large cantaloupes and were far bigger than Vanessa\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy was fading from Laura\u2019s body and she could tell the overall changes were coming to a stop. She took a deep breath, unlocked the stall door and, noticing the butterfly tattoo on her arm, prepared to leave the cocoon of the changing stall. She abandoned her clothes but remembered her phone and made her way to the full body mirror on the far side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman reflected back at her was a goddess. A 5 foot 11 inch busty hardbody who could drive any man insane with desire. She had luxurious raven hair that spilled over her strong shoulders. Her face was perfect, her eyes dazzling. Her figure was an extreme hourglass that would have been silly had she pushed her measurements any further. Instead her hips and waist said nothing but \u201dsexy\u201c and said it loud. There were grooves across her tight stomach that showed the hints of washboard abdominals just below the surface and her legs were long and strong dancers legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s cheeks hurt from the constant smiling. She glanced at the phone and saw the apply button had changed to \u201dRevert.\u201c Next to it another button had appeared that read \u201dSave Template.\u201c  She clicked that and was given the option to input a name. Below the text field was a message: \u201dYou can save these changes as a template for quick access later.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dA name, huh?\u201c Laura mumbled to herself as she looked back to the mirror. It was her eyes that caught and held her attention. The perfect name leapt into her head and she typed in \u201cJade\u201d and clicked \u201cSave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Jade,\u201d she said to her reflection. \u201cReady to have some fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to put her phone in her pocket then realized she didn\u2019t have any. For a few moments she searched for a place to keep her phone safe then she figured out the perfect place. She slid the device into the deep cleavage between her glorious breasts. The iPhone nearly vanished entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned and walked out into the day. Jade had arrived.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Growing up in the shadow of her sister, Vanessa, Laura was aware of the various ways men would check a woman out while trying not to be noticed. Some would keep their head down while stealing glances up at their target from time to time; others would use their peripheral vision to spy on the object of their attention. The best looks, however, according to Vanessa, were the ones where the guy was so astounded by your beauty their eyes were just locked on you while their jaws hit the ground.  It was this last and best stare that Laura was receiving from every angle once she emerged from the changing room to the boardwalk. Men and even some women were stopped in their tracks watching her as she sauntered by.  She loved the feel of their eyes upon her. She\u2019d wished her entire life to have the sort of body that turned heads, and now her wish had come true beyond her wildest dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura loved the way her enlarged boobs bounced with each step, the feel was exciting and sensual. She swayed her hips as she walked making full use of her insane curves. She passed by a cute guy she\u2019d seen around school and gave him a wink. He jumped with surprise as though the wink physically smacked him, then smiled a large goofy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued on her way scoping out the scene and looking for the sort of guy worthy of a body like hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the sand a ways she spied the beach\u2019s outdoor gym. Much like the Venice beach area further north her town had a descent bodybuilding population, and the outdoor gym was home to the biggest in the area who loved to show off their stunning physiques. Laura saw someone there she recognized doing arm curls with enormous dumbbells. His name was Doug and he\u2019d once been friends with her brother Greg. Doug, however, had outgrown Greg and gone pro over a year ago and the two had had a falling out. At the time Doug outweighed Greg by nearly 30 pounds of muscle despite being 5 inches shorter, and it looked like he\u2019d only gotten bigger since then. Of course Doug had nothing on Greg\u2019s current size, but neither did any other bodybuilder in the world. Laura was enchanted by Doug\u2019s rippling muscles and loved watching the way his arms and bare chest bulged as he continued to curl the huge weight. She really wanted to know what it felt like to have those giant arms wrapped around her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other option was sitting at the boardwalk snack bar. This one was taller than Doug, but no where near as strong. It was her best friend, Jason. Laura and Jason had first met in 3rd grade and had been best friends ever since. The two were social outcasts together and were both giant geeks. They spent their free time playing Magic: The Gathering and reading comic books together. She knew that he\u2019d never had a girlfriend, and never even kissed a girl. She thought it would be great if all the jocks that hung out around here saw the nerd get the girl, today. And perhaps if he could spend the day with her it would give him some confidence and help him in the future. She though she\u2019d even share the body altering app with him. She could think of no one more deserving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth options were great, but at last she decided on....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura decided that Jason was the way to go. Sure Doug was super sexy, but Jason was her best friend and deserved the chance to flaunt a really hot girl on his arm. Besides with the Alterations app she could give anyone a body like Doug\u2019s, or better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was sitting at a table near the snack bar reading. She approached and sat down at a neighboring table. She crossed her long legs enjoying the feel of soft skin on soft skin, then she pulled her phone out from her cleavage and pretended to surf the internet while she waited for Jason to notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he seemed fairly engrossed in his reading she didn\u2019t have to wait long. She could see him watching her from the corner of her eye. Laura glanced over and shot him a smile that would have melted ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances Jason would have buried himself in his book and avoided further eye contact. This time he was caught off guard by her smile and instead just grinned back. Laura brushed her luxurious hair back over her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked panicked for a second. Then, much to his credit, he calmed himself and replied, \u201cHello.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatcha reading?\u201d she asked though she was very familiar with the volume he had. It was a hardback edition of a collection of comic books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... nothing really.\u201d Jason quickly closed the book on the table and placed his hands over it. Surely a girl like her would laugh at him for reading comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura made as if she were examining the title through his latticed fingers then said with excitement, \u201cHey! I know what that is.\u201d Jason turned bright red but she continued, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the Final Crisis series that Grant Morrison wrote?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat straight up. \u201dYou\u2019ve read Grant Morrison?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI LOVE Grant Morrison.\u201d She stood up and moved to his table. Pointing to a chair she asked, \u201cMay I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yeah, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat and leaned forward hovering her huge breasts over the table. Jason\u2019s eyes were pulled toward her huge globes and the deep well between them, but he quickly regained himself and returned his eyes to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pretended not to notice and continued, \u201cDid you read his run on X-Men? The end of \u2018Here Comes Tomorrow\u2019 made me cry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean when the Phoenix sends her influence back through time to push Scott Summers toward moving on with his life?\u201d Jason was getting more excited by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Laura sat back in her chair and smiled warmly at Jason. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name, stud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Jade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJade,\u201d he said, feeling the word on his tongue. His next intention was to complement her on her pretty name. What he said instead was, \u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful.\u201d Once the words were out he turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \u201cWhy thank you. You\u2019re pretty cute yourself.\u201d Then she extended her leg so her foot was brushing the bare skin of his calf, then slid it up toward his knee and the hem of his shorts. Jason let out a small yelp that could have been a laugh or a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say we go for a walk?\u201d Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be awesome.\u201d Jason stood up immediately. He was tall and at 6 feet he was an inch taller than Laura. Despite his height, though he was very thin. He would have been quite handsome had he taken better care of himself and fixed his hair which was wild and a little oily. And if he were to bulk up, even just a little bit, he would be quite the lady killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair went down a set of steps that lead to the sand and began walking side by side. Laura moved close to Jason and took his arm, wrapped it around her waist, and placed his hand on her hip just below the bikini string. Then she placed her own arm around his waist to make sure he didn\u2019t get nervous and run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked like this for some time discussing comics and movies. Jason couldn\u2019t believe his incredible luck. This was easily the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, she was even hotter than Laura\u2019s sister Vanessa, and not only did she like the same things he did, she seemed to really like him as well. As they walked along the sand people all over the place were looking at them, and he loved it. All the guys seemed to want Jade for theirs and looked at Jason with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was truly happy for Jason. He was really enjoying the attention from her as well as the others around them. He\u2019d relaxed quite a bit and was really letting his personality show through. He had even cracked a few jokes that were genuinely funny. She felt his hand on her hip, loose and timid at first, now held her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura saw that their path was leading them toward the volleyball nets where a number of people they knew from school were playing. The group looked to be mostly comprised of football jocks who frequently made Jason\u2019s life a living hell. She could hardly wait until they saw him with his hands all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she suspected the group of guys saw their approach and the volleyball game came to a halt. When they were close enough John Phillips, the all-star quarterback and all around jerk, hollered at them, \u201cHey baby. You should trade that wimp in for a real man. I\u2019ll take real good care of you!\u201d He puffed his muscular chest out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at John and said, \u201cWhile it\u2019s hard to turn down such an amazing offer, I\u2019ve made my choice.\u201d She placed her hand on Jason\u2019s chest and hugged him close making sure he knew she wasn\u2019t about to leave him for a brainless asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever!\u201d John said with dismissal that wasn\u2019t quite convincing, \u201cWhat the hell do you see in a scrawny geek like him, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and turned and when she spoke she made sure that everyone around could hear, \u201cI\u2019m with him because he\u2019s smart, funny, sweet, and because he likes me for more than just my body. But oooooh, does he like my body too.\u201d She ran her hands over the curves of her bosom sending a chill through all those watching. \u201cAnd I\u2019m with him because he has, hands down, the biggest goddamn cock I have ever seen in my life. So don\u2019t tell me about a REAL man. I found one, and he\u2019s more man than you boys will ever know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura put her arm back around Jason\u2019s middle and the two walked on leaving the group of jocks dumfounded and silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had passed out of earshot Jason turned to Laura with a serious look in his eye. \u201cJade, I need to know something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said wondering where he was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know about my... well, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow, baby. Your what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told those guys I had a huge.... whatever. How did you know about that? We just met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was truly stunned. \u201cI made that up,\u201d she said. \u201cI just told them that to shut them up and give you a good reputation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said looking down at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGears were spinning in Laura\u2019s head. She couldn\u2019t believe her best friend would keep something like this from her. Not that she expected him to just come out and announce that he had a big dick, but there should have been some sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hand on his chin and raised his eyes to hers. She gave him a friendly smile to set him at ease. \u201cLook, you don\u2019t have to tell me anything you don\u2019t want to, but you\u2019ve got me curious. How big are we talking about here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s eyes broke away again, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so shy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re really turning me on, look.\u201d She motioned to her breasts where her nipples were very clearly poking through the thin fabric of her top. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about it just say so, but don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know. You never measured?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint grin was visible on Jason\u2019s face at the sight of her nipples, or perhaps it was just from the permission to stare at her beautiful breasts. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, a few years since I measured. I used to be really excited when I was going through puberty and loved that it was getting bigger and bigger. Then I heard that most women can\u2019t take a guy who\u2019s 9 inches and I figured no woman would want me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re 9 inches? That\u2019s mighty big, but nothing I\u2019d be afraid of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was already bigger when I heard that. I\u2019m a freak. No woman could ever have sex with me. I last measured three years ago and I was over 11 inches long and pretty thick too. And I know I\u2019ve gotten even bigger since then.\u201d He turned his back to Laura and crossed his arms over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she understood why he\u2019d kept this a secret from even her. She approached him and wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him close to herself smooshing her breasts into his back. She put her mouth to his ear and whispered to him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A thousand thoughts and feelings hummed through Laura's mind as she held Jason, her lips brushing against his ear.  Feelings of old unrequited puppy love from their childhood.  Memories of feeling rejected by him for not returning any of her earlier signs of affection.  Thoughts of how frustrated she had been, watching the way he ogled her sister when he though Laura wasn't looking.  This new feeling that maybe she had a chance with him anyway.  She wanted to tell him who she really was but the thought of her best friend having a massive cock was quickly becoming the only thing she could think of.  So she found herself purring in his ear, \"it's not polite to tease a girl, let's go to your place so I can take look at you and judge how big is too big for myself, hmm?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding him, Laura could feel the tension in Jason's body as he struggled to decide what to do.  She grinned wickedly and rubbed her breasts against his back as she continued to brush her lips against his ear and neck.  \"Wh-what about going to your place?\"  He finally stammered out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't stud,\" she said softly, continuing to gyrate her body slowly and sensuously against his.  \"I share a place and right now others are home.\"  At least that wasn't a total lie she thought to herself.  Jason began to pull away from her and she relaxed her grip with puzzlement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, my place, I live with my mom but she isn't home right now.\"  His face was burning red and he struggled to hide the fact that he was now obviously turned on by her.  Laura straightened up, holding him at arms length and feeling both incredibly aroused and embarrassed for her friend, though she suddenly doubted that he was exaggerating in any way at all.  He noticed her staring and if anything turned ever more red.  \"Please don't stare.  At least not in public?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\"  Laura held his hand, walking next to him, fighting not pull him faster towards his home. She had to remind herself that \"Jade\" wasn't supposed to know where Jason lived yet.  For his part Jason seemed more relax now that she was walking beside him instead of rubbing herself against him.  Laura noticed Jason sneaking glances at her boobs as they walked and so in the spirit of equality every time she caught him peeking she took a look at his package.  By the time they got to Jason's bedroom both of them were very turned on but once Jason locked his door behind them he seemed to freeze up entirely, simply staring at \"Jades\" outrageous curves.  \"Jason?\"  Laura waved a hand in front of his face, \"Jason, are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded dumbly, making no other move or sound.  Laura frowned in frustration.</span></div></div>",

Fair is fair right?\"  Laura fished her iPhone out of her cleavage and set it aside, then undid her top and let it fall to the floor.  If anything Jason seemed to freeze up worse but Laura sauntered slowly towards him, swaying her hips as she murmured encouragement.  \"Look big guy, I know you're nervous, that's perfectly normal.  I'm nervous to.  It's not everyday I get to meet a stud like you,\" she grinned as she stopped in front of Jason, close enough that her breasts were pushing against his chest.  Reflexively he put his hand to her breast then jerked it away when he realized what he had done.  \"It's OK,\" she purred in a sultry tone.  \"It's fine,\" she gave him a peck on the forehead and guided his hand back to her breast.  He gave a tentative squeeze and she let out a startled moan and involuntarily arched her back.  That felt much better than she had expected it to.  \"That's the way, now are you OK if I take that peek at yours you promised me?\"  She ran her finger down his chest, stopping as it crossed his waistband and hovered expectantly at his zipper as she stared into his eyes.  He swallowed loudly and nodded.  Laura tried to smile as wide as she could to reassure him as she slowly pulled his zipper down and unbuttoned his pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure what she had been expecting but regardless, Jason's member surprised her.  His pants fell away and there it was, straining past the waistband of his boxers larger than she even imagined and throbbing with his excitement.  \"This must be how he felt when he saw my tits,\" Laura thought after realizing that she was staring.  \"You can touch it if you want,\" Jason said, breaking into her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled , \"See, I told you that you weren't the only one who was nervous.\"  Laura reached down and tugged the waistband of his boxers lower, and lower.  Exposing more and more of his mammoth penis.  She laughed uneasily again when her attempt to wrap her hand around it failed, it was just too thick.  Jason sucked in a gulp of air sharply at her touch and the improbably hard member throbbed under her fingers.  She was now equally fascinated and afraid of it.  Now that she had seen it she couldn't stop thinking of what it would be like to have it inside of her but at the same time she doubted it was possible.  She wrapped both hands firmly around it, trying to gauge how thick it really was and Jason's hips bucked.  \"Even if we do fuck he isn't going to last a second anyway, he's too turned on,\" Laura thought to herself.  Taking a cue from Laura that it was now OK to use both hands Jason cupped her other breast in his hand and rubbed his thumb across her nipple, making her body shiver with pleasure.  \"He isn't the only one who's turned on either, I'm not sure I'm willing to just stop now,\" she mused.</span></div></div>",

Jason let out an inarticulate moan of excitement and Laura kept going, working his enormous shaft with both hands while she licked and sucked.  It felt like she was dislocating her jaw to open her mouth wide enough to take it in.  She was trying to work out how to deep throat him when he came in a torrent.  Laura coughed, surprised at how soon it was and the amount of cum.  She had to pull him out so she could breathe, instead she wrapped her breasts around his still erupting shaft and continued to kiss, lick and suck at the head.  Jason was panting as he finished coming and he sank down on the edge of the bed, his legs obviously wobbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he said.  He opened and closed his mouth, trying to think of something else to say.  Instead he settled on \"wow\" again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon stud, you aren't done yet,\" Laura grinned wickedly as she jerked his pants and boxers entirely off, slipped out of her bikini bottom and straddled him.  Jason's eyes went wide with surprise as she grabbed his semi hard cock, guiding the head into herself.  Laura frowned with concentration.  While she hadn't been with anyone yet she had already been fairly active with sex toys and Vanessa had a large vibrator that Laura was fond of.  That had done nothing to prepare her for Jason though and she began to second guess her decision to attempt making love to him as he began to harden again.  Soon she was stretched across him tighter than a drumhead and his slightest motion sent overwhelming waves of pleasure and no small amount of pain cascading through her body.  She tried to move slowly off of him, ready to give up this insanity but as she was lifting herself off of him he reached up and kneaded her breasts, sending jolts of pleasure through her body that weakened her knees, and then she found herslef sinking back down his impossibly long shaft, screaming in pleasure at the sensations within her.  She made one more half hearted attempt to ease herself off of Jasons shaft but gave up and merely rolled over, allowing him to take top since it was too painful to keep trying to bottom out, he was just too long.  Once Jason understood what she was trying to get him to do she wrapped her legs around his waist and lost herself in the overwhelming sensations of his oversized penis plunging in and out of her.  She lost count of how many orgasms she had and was literally seeing stars, flashes of light that obscured her vision at the peak of each body quaking thrust, by the time Jason sprawled across her lush curves, too spent to move anymore. Laura wrapped her arms around him and they both drifted off to sleep borne of exhaustion and sexual satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura slept basking in the warm afternoon sunlight that shined in through the window at her back. As the sun dipped over the ocean and her body cooled she rolled into her back and was startled by a pressing weight on her chest that threatened to force the air out of her lungs. Her hands flew to her chest to see what it could be and she discovered a fleshy mound. She squeezed and felt jolts of pleasure shoot down her spine to her vagina, which felt oddly sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the memories of her new body returned to her and she opened her eyes with a smile on her face. One of her hands kneaded her melon sized boob while the other slid down her trim tummy to her crotch which she began to massage slowly, partially to ease the pain and also because she was still horny thinking about Jason and his monstrous cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura rolled over to find her lover and see if he wanted to help her get herself off, but he was gone. For a moment she assumed he had gone to the bathroom but after a minute she realized she could see out his bedroom door into the empty bathroom. That's when she sat up and noticed her phone was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt out of bed and searched all around but it was no use. Jason and her phone were missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>One hour earlier:</b></u><br>\r\nJason awoke needing to relieve himself. He made his way to the bathroom naked and once he was done admired himself in the mirror. His body was terribly scrawny but for the first time in years he took real pride in his penis. As a freshman he'd accidentally overheard a pair of senior girls from the cheerleading squad talking about well hung boyfriends they'd been with. At first Jason was excited to hear that he was already even larger than the men they were describing until one of them said they could never be with someone who was bigger than nine inches. When the other girl agreed and even said that eight inches could be painful depending on the guys thickness Jason's heart sank. That night he measured himself at just shy of a foot long and basically gave up on ever having sex in his life. When his penis continued to grow and grow over the course of his high school career he became more and more ashamed of his freakish appendage. Until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped his fingers around his enormous cock and squeezed tight finally relishing its girth after so many years. He smiled and gave himself a few solid pumps which sent blood into his unit hardening it into a steel rod nearly a foot and a half long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was startled by a loud banging on the front door downstairs. Jason nearly jumped out of his skin, then collected himself and hurried back across the hall to his room to get dressed. The banging intensified as he made his way down stairs. It sounded like whoever wanted in was using a battering ram to knock the door down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought upon opening the door and seeing his visitor Jason's first thought was, \"why is Laura's brother here?\" his second was \"muscles!\" Truth be told Jason frequently noticed Greg's muscles and wished for a buff body of his own, but Greg was clearly larger. Somehow Greg was now swollen to obscene proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout meaning to Jason took a step back and looked up and down Greg's body. The big man was shirtless with his pecs and abs on proud display. His lower half was clad in black spandex shorts the legs of which were pressed up by his enormous quads into a shape that made it look like he was wearing a speedo instead. Greg's thighs were pulsing with untold power and each was bigger around than Jason's toros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg noticed Jason's admiration of his new body and smiled. \"Pretty cool, right?\" He put his hands on his hips and spread his lats like wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was afraid, though he wasn't sure why. Greg had always been nice enough to him but there was something about his eyes that had changed. Jason steadied himself. \"What's going on, Greg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Laura today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jason said truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg frowned for a moment then his grin returned. \"In that case, have you met anyone new today? Maybe someone really attractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was stunned into silence. What the hell was going on? He was about to lie but then took another look at Greg's giant arms and decided not to. \"Well, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded. \"I thought so. Tell her I want to talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's sleeping. We.. I mean, she's.. she's just resting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Greg let out a deep laugh that shook Jason's bones. \"Alright, stud. That's fine too. Just bring her phone to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hesitated. There was something very strange going on, but before he could try to figure it out Greg became impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" the bodybuilder said, \"you're a smart guy. Last time you saw me was what, a day ago, two? Was I this big?\" Greg curled an arm in Jason's face that hardened into a 28 inch boulder. \"How did that happen? Now if you play along I'll even let you have a body like mine. Can you imagine that? But if you'd rather do this the hard way I'd be happy to just take her phone for myself. And then you get nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason thought for a second then nodded. \"I'll be right back. Wait here.\" He went to close the door and Greg stopped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got two minutes. After that I take it myself. This wouldn't be the first door I've smashed to pieces today.\" He pulled his hand away and let Jason close it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went straight back to his room where he found Jade sleeping. He looked at her naked body and could feel himself getting hard again. Could that really be Laura? Somehow the possibility that this impossibly sexy woman was really his best friend turned him on even more. He spotted her phone next to the bed and took it back downstairs. Apparently this little device was the source of all the craziness. He stood in the living room thinking through his choices. He had a strong desire to protect Jade or Laura or whoever from Greg but giving him the phone could make things worse. Either way he needed to get Greg away from the house. He could use the phone but he needed more time to figure out how to use it. If he made a run for it Greg would follow, but that could end badly. On the other hand he could give it to Greg and try to sick by his side to keep him from getting out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30 seconds!\" Greg's called and Jason knew what he had to do. </span></div></div>",

Greg was beginning to count down from ten when Jason slowly opened the door.  Greg grinned from ear to ear as soon as he saw the phone in Jason's hand.  \"Awesome man, I really was starting to think you would be stupid enough to try to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does this work?\"  Jason asked slowy, still reluctant to give Greg the phone, trying to stall now that the inevitable had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's face clouded over with anger but he shook his head and took a deep breath.  \"How it works doesn't need to concern you.  All you need to know is if you give me the phone right now I will reward you like I promised, buff as me, seriously.  If you don't then I take it from you and it won't be pleasant, especially for you.\"  Greg held his hand out and flexed his other arm hard, the bicep swelling to an ungodly pronounced peak that was both intimidating and awe inspiring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Jason placed the phone in Greg's waiting hand.  Greg grinned and took the phone eagerly.  Jason stood tensely, unsure if Greg was actually going to keep his word or not and knowing that if the giant decided not to that there wasn't anything he could do about it.</span></div></div>",

But as much as he wanted to work on his own body he had promised Jason he was going to reward him for helping him.  And he didn't want Jason pissed off with him.  Greg had known Jason for a long time and was slightly intimidated by his intelligence.  Greg was pretty sure that if he pissed Jason off enough Jason would find a way to outsmart him.  Why give him a reason?  But at the same time he wasn't going to be stupid about this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was in a hurry, his fingers flew across the screen, finding Jason, opening his profile, and increasing Jason's muscle size.  A dialog box opened up asking, \"do you wish to use the previous strength and muscle density settings?\"  Without thinking about what changes had been made to the settings since he used it last Greg clicked yes.  He Jasons size a bit more then looked over the phone at Jason who was fidgeting impatiently.  \"Ready?\"  Without waiting for an answer Greg hit \"apply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hadn't even finished nodding when he could feel an intense rush of heat flowing through his body.  He gasped as he felt his entire body swell, straining against the fabric of his t-shirt.  Before he could even react the feeling was over and he flexed his arm experimentally, giddy at the site of the perfectly formed bicep.  He felt it and was surprised at how rock hard solid it was.  But the giddiness quickly passed when he realized he was nowhere near the size of Greg.  At best he had only gained twenty five or thirty pounds.  Granted it look good on him but it was nothing close to what he had just been promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal,\" Greg said, noticing the parade of emotions and realization on Jason's face.  \"I don't know what you have planned, I don't know if you think you can take me down or fight me for the phone if I grow you as big as me, so I didn't.\"  Jason opened his mouth to protest when Greg cut him off, \"yet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"  Jason asked as Greg went back to messing with the phone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm setting up the rest of the changes for you.  Big as me like I said.\"  Greg selected Jason's mass slider and nudged it until it reached 389, one pound less than Greg.  \"And then I'm going to leave.  Ten minutes from now, as long as I'm sure you aren't following me I hit go on this and we'll probably never see each other again which is exactly how I want this.  Or you follow me or try to fight me for the phone and I take all of this away.  Understand?\"  Greg turned away from Jason and started walking.</span></div></div>",

If he did follow Greg he wouldn't be able to stop him from doing anything, and what if Greg wasn't lying?  What if he really was going to make Jason as big as he was?  Jason flexed his arm again and the feeling of awe that these rock solid muscles were actually his and that they could be even bigger convinced him.  Greg hadn't lied before, he probably wasn't lying this time.  With a sigh of resignation Jason closed his front door and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to take his clothes off, wanting to watch the impending transformation then changed his mind and decided that hulking out and destroying them would be better so he put them back on again.  He lost count of how many times he checked his watch when he suddenly decided that he wanted to be able to see the transformation in the full length bathroom mirror so raced up the stairs.  The fact that the most sexually desirable woman who had ever existed was asleep in his bed across the hall had been completely pushed out of his mind.  He checked his watch yet again, then decided to take it off, he didn't want to wreck the watchband so he'd be able to use it later.  He took a deep breath and the exhale was shaky with nerves and the hammering of his heart in his chest.  Ten minutes finally passed and he tensed his body, holding his breath and waiting for something to happen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jasons heart was pounding in his chest so hard he could feel each pump shiver through his body.   Almost eleven minutes had passed and Jason was beginning to believe that Greg had conned him when he felt another intense bloom of heat washing through his body.  He grunted as he could feel every muscle in his body clench and unclench, each time growing thicker and harder.  He felt like he was going to black out but he forced himself to keep his eyes open and focused on the growth in the mirror.  His t-shirt stretched tight across swelling pectoral muscles and in seconds tears began to form around his shoulders as his delts rounded like cannonballs.  His shirt rose to expose insane abs as his swelling torso continued to pull it in multiple directions.  He flexed his right arm and watched his bicep burst through the sleeve like tissue paper, the fabric peeling around it.  Every seam of the shirt began failing and the shirt quickly became a ragged mess hanging around his neck that he ripped away so he continue watching his already impossibly large muscles continue growing.  Below the belt his jeans were stretching tighter and tighter across his growing thighs until the seams finally burst with an audible pop.  Jason relishing the sound of the thick fabric as it continued to be torn apart by his seemingly never ending growth.  Like his shirt his pants were soon utterly destroyed and Jason cast the tattered fabric aside as his body still continued to swell ever larger.   His monstrous cock was at full attention and for the first time in his life Jason thought it looked like it actually belonged on his body.  Finally the feeling of ever building power subsided and Jason stood naked and gasping as he regarded himself in the mirror.  Never in his wildest imagining did he think he would ever look anything like this and it was like a dream come true.  But there was even more going on with Jason than was currently evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his basement at Greg was trying to adjust his own profile and was perplexed when he received the following error, \"Subjects neurological and biochemical fingerprint has deviated from baseline DNA markers. Subject must be reentered into the Alterations database and DNA markers stabilized.\"  Greg spent a few minutes trying to figure out to do so, clicking on anything that looked like a help or information button until finally he opened a FAQ.  He quickly scrolled through it, found a description of the error he was getting and read the solution.  \"In cases of extreme changes or even multiple changes in a short period of time and is caused by short term change catalysts not exiting the system as designed.  In these extreme case the subjects DNA may drift far from the baseline entry in which case it is required to be reentered in the Alterations application database.  Warning the data must be re-synced as soon as possible.  If left present in a subject, unstabilized change agents may continue to alter the subject in a manner that can not be predicted or corrected by Alterations.  Re-synchronization may be performed by taking linking a picture of the subject with the corresponding profile.  Caution, do not perform manual synchronization to the incorrect profile.  Doing so may lead to instability of the Alterations application.\"  Greg quickly took a selfie and relinked his profile to this picture.  Immediately his profile was flooded with warnings of testosterone levels being too high, aggression levels and temper being significantly altered and more that he didn't understand.  He did understand the \"Auto correct, choose yes or no\" that was below the laundry list of problems with his profile.  He clicked yes and almost instantly felt different.  He realized he was clenching his teeth and he stopped.  He also felt nearly crippling remorse for stealing his sisters phone and treating her like crap about it.  His fingers flew across the screen to open Laura's profile and was confused.  Laura's profile was unchanged.  Laura's profile also showed she was naked and Greg was VERY uncomfortable seeing that.  He quickly verified that her profile wasn't locked then backed out of it.  How could Laura look like Laura?  Jason hadn't sounded like he was lying when he said he hadn't seen Laura, and Jason did have Laura's phone.  What was going on?  Greg shrugged and flipped over to Jason's profile.  Jason had the same DNA stabilizing warning that Greg's profile had displayed.   Greg frowned.  What was he going to do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason left his bathroom feeling slightly woozy.  He walked into his bedroom with the intention of waking up Jade and finding out what was going on with Laura's brother and that phone.  But probably not until after they had sex again.  He was taken aback when instead of the vision of perfection he was expecting to find he instead saw his best Laura passed out across his bed.  What was going on?  Instead of waking her up Jason instead pulled on a pair of sweat shorts (that barely made it past his thighs and were ludicrously tight, leaving no bulge or curve to the imagination) grabbed his backpack, a towel and a bottle of water and left.  Jason may have been interested to know that moments after he left, Laura transformed back into her busty amazon alter ego without waking up or even knowing what she had done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason took an existing tank top and tore the neck and sides wider, and managed to stretch it across his massive frame, barely.  He was surprised at first when he was able to put his gym shoes on but decided while he was lacing them up that it shouldn't have been too surprising, he hadn't seemed to grow any taller, just bigger in pretty much every other way.  He debated whether to head to the beach or the gym and finally settled on the gym.  He was anxious to see how strong he was with this body and couldn't wait to test it out, and maybe show off a little bit.  He jogged towards the gym and was pleased at the effortless pace he set.  He was so intensely focused on seeing how fast he could push himself he almost didn't notice the looks of surprise, envy and lust he was inspiring as he crossed town.  Much faster than he would have expected he arrived at the gym and began second guessing himself but his nerves vanished as soon as he walked in the door and approached the front desk.  It took a moment for the girl behind the front desk to notice him but when she did her double take was impossible to miss.  It seemed equally impossible for her to look away from him once she had seen him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\"  She asked in sultry tone.  Jason was a little bit self conscious but also flattered at the way she was trying to devour him with her eyes without being too obvious about it.  She pushed a sign in clipboard across the desk towards him as she flashed a dazzling smile at him and took in a deep breath that accentuated her cleavage by pulling her top tight across her breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned back and openly checked her out, examining her hair (light blonde, piled up high on top her head with loose wavy curls framing her face), her face, (mid to late twenties, very cute) her bust, (probably a C cup, nice but nothing compared to Jade) and her overall body (very fit and tight, she obviously worked out and took it seriously.)  She was beginning to blush by the time he turned his attention to the clipboard.  He made an illegible scrawl for both the name and membership number (which he of course didn't have) and set the clipboard down.  As he suspected, she didn't even glance at it.  \"See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky,\" she provided without hesitation.  Becky swayed her chest slightly, drawing his attention to a small name tag with the gym logo on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed easily.  \"See you later Becky.\"  Jason moved deeper into the gym, noticing the stares from the other members and beginning to feel self conscious again.  He decided to check out the dumbbell rack and experimentally hefted the largest one there, it didn't seem very heavy so he began curling it.  He had reached fifteen reps without much effort and switched hands before he noticed that the only other guy in there using dumbbells close to the size he was holding was doing presses with them and struggling.  Jason went back to curling the two hundred pound monsters and ended up doing three sets of fifteen reps with each arm.  His arms tingled and he felt full of energy.  He began piling weight onto a bar anxious to find a weight that would challenge him.  He didn't realize that when Greg had used the app on him the increased muscle density settings Laura had used on herself had been applied to Jason.  Laura wasn't even aware that when she had transformed herself the increased muscle density had made her probably the strongest person who had ever lived.  Jason had loaded a bar with weight until it drooped comically from the middle then began curling it.  This was more of a challenge but Jason knew he was capable of curling it.  Moving slowly the bar finally touched his chest and he lowered it smoothly.  He was trying to keep his form good as moved the gargantuan weight again and again, gasping as he finally racked it again with shaking arms.  He struck a double bicep pose, drinking in the sight in the mirror across the room, his arms were even larger than ever and this realization pushed him to keep going.  He was now fixated on becoming bigger and bigger, he didn't think he could ever be big enough and his ensuing work out was so intense and focused that he didn't even notice that a crowd had gathered to watch him until they burst into applause when his chest erupted through his already tortured tank top as he bench pressed almost all the weight in the gym.  He sat up, blinking at the crush of people who had crowded into the gym as word of his insane work out spread across the city.  Finally he flexed again, and the crowd erupted into applause again.  He flexed his whole torso and the final remnants of his tank top fluttered to the floor, he flexed again and again, hitting every pose he could think of and then ones he was pretty sure he made up.  He was riding high on a wave of hormones and the leftover products of the app in his system that were allowing him to pack on muscle on a rate that far beyond anything naturally possible.  He had gained nearly fifteen pounds of muscle in this workout alone and he could sense it, he could sense that he was bigger and that it would be easy to be even bigger yet and he wanted it.  He was also feeling oddly disorientated and unfocussed as he tried to decide what he would do next.  </span></div></div>",

A few people asked him for autographs, assuming he was a pro body builder doing some sort of promotional gimmick and he reflexively signed them as he tried to figure out why he was feeling so wonky.  He was still unaware of the overload of hormones and DNA boosters that his body remained flooded with in the wake of the app modifying his body.  His body was rewiring his brain for two very basic desires, continuously growing his already immense muscles and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I guess we did get to see each other later,\"  Jason looked to see Becky waving at him as he was leaving the gym.  She slung a bag over her shoulder and jogged to catch up, placing a hand on his arm as she leaned in close to him.  \"That was quite a workout, I don't think I've ever seen anything like that before.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could feel his penis stir at her touch and in an instant he wanted sex.  No, he NEEDED sex.  \"I could show you a lot more if you're interested,\" Jason said, trying not to think about how much smaller than him she was, how he could just have her if he wanted and she wouldn't be able to stop him.  And the more he thought about it the more he wanted her.  He tried to ignore the building sense of lust and smiled, trying to keep this conversational.  He was scaring himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, glancing down at his crotch and forcing her eyes up again.  \"What did you have in mind,\" big guy?  She let him put his arm around her shoulders and ran a hand across his muscular back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, me, more sex than either one of us can handle, then maybe go back to the gym and work out some more,\" Jason couldn't believe what he had just said.  He tried to think of some way to salvage this, some way to sound like a creep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky laughed but there was a slight undercurrent of unease to it.  \"That's pretty straightforward,\" she said after a moment, \"but you know what bugs me about you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  The surprise at her having some sort of problem with him helped derail his one track mind for a moment.  \"I thought I was pretty much perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again, this time much more easily.  \"Funny,\" she paused beside a pickup and dug keys out of her bag.  \"What bothers me is you have an incredible body, I mean unbelievably hot, and you're still so insecure that you have to stuff your shorts.  It takes away from everything else, it really does.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Jason laughed.  \"I'm not stuffing anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky paused before turning to unlock the door of her truck, tossed her bag inside then turned back to Jason.  \"Bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you brought it up, totally not fake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit,\" Becky said again, this time with less conviction.  Jason just looked at her with raised eyebrows.  \"Fine, you prove that thing is real and we'll see about having more sex than either of us can handle.  Hop in,\"  Becky started her truck with a roar as Jason climbed into the passenger side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was having a hard time deciding what to do.  Another half an hour had gone by and still no sign of Jason.  Laura did find scraps of what looked jeans and t-shirt thrown into the bathroom trash, what was that about?  She was beginning to feel weird about walking around her friends house naked so she tied her back together and put it on but she began to wish she had something a little more substantial to wear.  For the thousandth time she acknowledged that her phone was completely gone and she wasn't sure what she was going to do about it.</span></div></div>",

Jason reached the door as Greg started counting down from ten and hesitated before opening it.  With a burst of inspiration he popped his own iPhone out of its Batman logo case, swapped the case to Laura's phone and pocketed it.  Greg was at two and already raising his fist like a battering ram when Jason opened the door, his iPhone in hand.  He reflexively flinched backward from Greg's upraised fist and instead of handing over the dupe phone as he originally intended to he spun on his heel and dashed through his house towards the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg hesitated, momentarily shocked at the transition from Jason flinching away to full fledged flight.  \"Come back here you fucking coward, I wasn't going to hit you,\" Greg roared as he gave chase.  Having to slow to squeeze through Jason's front door lost him more time and Jason was out the back and sprinting down the street, already almost out of sight by the time Greg dashed through his house and extricated himself from the back door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a quick glance over his shoulder and was shocked at how far behind Greg was, maybe he would be able to lose him.  He glanced again as he cut through a neighbors yard and cursed, now that Greg was in the open his leg muscles were closing the gap alarmingly fast.  Jason vaulted a fence and changed direction, frantically assessing his options.  Outrunning him wasn't looking hopeful, Greg was probably going to tear him limb from limb if he couldn't outthink him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was already getting winded from running and he doubted very much that Greg was even close to being tired.  Another glance over his shoulder allowed him to watch Greg hurdle the fence without breaking stride.  Genuine fear for his life dumped the last remnants of adrenaline into his system and Jason actually managed to put on one more burst of speed but even at that he knew he wasn't going to outrun the behemoth behind him in the long term.  Jason hurdled a line of his neighbors hedges, the branches scraping at him as he flew over, then cut hard to the right as soon as he landed in a driveway, dashing through a nearby gap between the neighbors house and garage.  Greg crashed loudly through the hedges and cursed, recognizing that he wasn't going to fit easily into the walkway meant for a more normally built person. \"Keep running Jason, you're just going to make it worse for yourself when I catch you,\" he bellowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't waste his breath replying, he shot through the gap and slowed just long enough to smash his elbow through the window on the garage side door, reached through to unlock the door and dashed in to kick his neighbors prized Corvette square in the bumper.  He cursed and kicked it again, this time rocking it hard enough to trigger the car alarm, before dashing back out of the garage again.  Greg was already pounding hard around the far corner of the garage towards him.  \"Shit,\" Jason gasped breathlessly, reversing direction and darting back into the narrow gap between the house and garage again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Greg turned himself sideways and plunged after Jason, skittering crablegged behind him.  \"No way punk, I'm not doing this all day,\" Greg snorted.  Jason's legs were already turning to rubber but he kept pushing himself, he had to stall Greg until the cops showed up, that was the only way out of this right?  Jason squinted in the bright sunlight as he came out in the open again, spinning to knock a garbage can over into Greg's path then continued running down his neighbors driveway towards the street.  He noticed with concern that blood was running down his arm but didn't bother slowing down to inspect how deep the window glass had cut him.  He heard Greg stumble over the garbage can and roar with frustration, Jason glanced over his shoulder just in time to see Greg hurl the garage can towards him.  Even with the heads up Jason wasn't able to dodge,it, the large plastic can hit him in the middle of his back with enough force to knock the air out of his lungs and send him sprawling into the street.  Tires shrieked as a car swerved to avoid running him over.  Jason breathlessly tried to regain his feet as another car shrieked to a stop inches from his head.  Greg was almost on him and Jason rolled away from his flailing arms, trying to put the car between himself and Greg.  For a split second Jason was eye to eye with the driver, a teenage girl who was obviously bewildered by the spectacle.  Jason realized she was about to floor it to get away from this insanity and he was struck by inspiration borne of panic.  Greg swung to grab him again and Jason awkwarkdly dodged away, falling to his side and letting go of his iPhone as he landed heavily.  The iPhone clattered across the ashphalt towards the rear tire of the car.  As Greg roared again the girl had had enough, with a chirp of rubber she swerved through someones lawn and sped away.  Jason winced slightly at seeing his phone was ground into powder but he hoped that would be enough get Greg off his back, if the giant didn't pummel him out of anger anyway.  He lay on his side, too winded to move as Greg clenched his fists at his sides, looking from the shattered phone to Jason and back again, growing angrier by the second.  Suddenly the familiar wail of a police siren sounded in the distance and if Jason could catch his breath he would have sighed with relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot,\" Greg finally growled.  \"You have no idea what you just gave up.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg looked around for the source of the siren and for a moment Jason believed he was going to take off running.  Jason was already picturing himself returning to the smoking hot woman in his bed (who may or may not actually be Laura) and figuring out what was so important about the phone he currently had in his pocket.  Or at the very least having another round of mind blowing sex with her.  Instead the siren faded off into the distance, very obviously having turned in another direction.  Greg reached down and jerked Jason to his feet by his shirt collar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shi..,\" Jasons protest was cut off with a gurgle as Greg bunched up the fabric of Jason's t-shirt with his fists and lifted Jason off the ground, slowy curling Jason towards his leering, angry face.  Greg's unearthly biceps swelled imposingly with the motion, the thick veins running down the center of each peak twitching like they were ready to burst through his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, Jason, Jason.  What am I going to do with you?\"  Greg said softly, then flung Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spun through the air as he flew down the block, frantically trying to tuck himself into a ball and roll with the impact, he narrowly missed landing on someone's gravel driveway, instead overshooting it where he bounced hard on the lawn and crashed into some sort of bush.  He attempted to untangle himself from the bush and winced as pain shot through his side.  If he hadn't cracked a rib he would be very surprised.  By the time he had flopped out of the bush Greg was already overshadowing him.  \"Shit,\" Jason said again, frowning as he realized he could taste blood in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg roughly jerked him to his feet again.  \"I guess I'm stronger than I thought, that was pretty impressive right?  You went what?  Thirty yards?  Something like that,\" Greg said conversationally before casually backhanding Jason across the face.  Jasons felt like a bomb went off inside his head.  His vision whited out, his ears were ringing and he coughed as he feel blood trickling down his throat.  He tried to open his eyes but his left was already swollen shut and what could see with his right was hazy and wavery like he was underwater.  He attempted to spit a gob of blood on Greg in defiance but instead began a coughing fit as he choked on his own blood.  The wracking coughs caused agonizing pain to shoot through his ribs and the only reason he was able to stay upright was because Greg was still holding him up by his shirt.  \"You done?\"  Greg asked when the coughing fit finally subsided.  Without waiting for an answer Greg drove his fist into Jasons stomach, still holding Jason by his shirt.  Jason instantly puked, the contents of his stomach forced out by the impact along with all the air in his lungs.  He gasped, frantically trying to get air back into his lungs but only began another coughing fit.  He fell in a heap at Gregs feet as his shirt collar tore and Greg nudged him with his foot.  \"Get up Jason.  I ain't gonna ask you twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason attempted to stand but collapsed when he tried putting weight on the arm he had cut.  \"Shit,\" he hissed again through clenched teeth.  The ground at Greg's feet was slick with blood and vomit, causing Jason to slip as he tried again to stand. Losing patience, Greg jerked him up by his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at Greg with his barely good eye.  He was sure now that Greg was going to kill him and with that came a grim acceptance.  If he was going to die he wasn't going to give Greg the satisfaction of seeing him squirm more than he had to.  He thought back to laying in bed with the girl he had given his virgintiy to this afternoon ignoring Greg's droning threats and bracing for another blow.  How long ago had he been laying next to that vision of sexual perfection?  Ten minutes ago?  At most.  He grit his teeth and tried not to cough again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you'd be able to survive it if I drop kicked you?  I don't think you could,\" Greg sneered.  \"I'm curious to see how far I could kick you though.  I bet you'd clear the roof of the house across the street.\"  Greg gave Jason a shake and frowned.  Jason looked too out of it to hear him now, or maybe he was dead already.  Greg shook him again and set off another coughing fit.  He grinned.  He had pretty much decided he was going to kill Jason but he wanted him to be conscious enough to see it coming.  \"Hey, wake up.  Get up,\" Greg flicked Jason's nose a few times until his bleary right eye cracked open.  \"Wake up.\"  Greg grinned.  \"Time to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was anything Greg was expecting it wasn't for Jason to begin laughing.   Jason laughed until he was wracked with another coughing fit.  By the time he regained his breath Greg was readying to drop kick him.  \"You cheesy fuck,\" Jason gasped.  \"You don't even realize what movie you're ruining for me right now do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Movie?\"  Greg drew Jason to close to his sneering face again.  \"You think I care about a fucking movie?  You don't even realize how you ruined my life you little faggot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let loose a gurgling laugh again despite Gregs obvious seething rage.  \"Yea, I can see how hard you have it you self centered prick.  Tall, good looking, bigger than any body builder who ever lived.  It must be horrible.  What do you have so damn hard in your life?  Are you packing a tiny dick you can't compensate for no matter what you do?  What?\"  Greg roared with rage and lifted Jason to drop kick him when a siren chirped very nearby.  Jason craned his head and could see a cop car at the curb, two officers looking uncertainly at the scene in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir...\" Before the cop even finished Greg dropped Jason roughly and charged the cop car roaring like an animal.  Before either cop could react Greg had rammed the passenger side door with his shoulder, caving it in.  The police officers frantically tried to leave through the drivers side door and Greg easily lifted his side of the car and flipped it on top of them.  The siren squawked and the light bar shattered with a sickening crunch.  One of the police officers was screaming in pain.  Jason could now hear more sirens rapidly approaching and apparently so could Greg.  This time he turned and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a struggle Jason finally regained his feet and reviewed his options.</span></div></div>",

These were questions he either couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t want to answer. Then he thought of Jade.. Laura, whatever. What if Greg decided to hurt her as well? The desire to protect his busty partner reared up again and Jason knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do any good in a hospital bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fished Laura\u2019s iPhone out of his pocket and examined it with his good eye. There were some notable scratches on the screen but when he clicked on the home button it came to life just fine. He was greeted by a lock screen image of himself and Laura at Comic Con from a year ago posing with a pair of cosplayers dressed as the Joker and Harley Quinn. Jason nodded, that confirmed it, there was no Jade only Laura. He smiled through her betrayal and thought to himself that the first thing she had done upon acquiring a body of a sex goddess was to find him, make sure his tormentors saw them together, then vigorously remove his virginity. \u201cShe could have had anyone but she had me,\u201d he said aloud to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason realized that the sound of sirens was getting very loud now so he turned towards the nearest house and began hobbling towards it. Bright lasers of pain rocketed up his right thigh straight to his jaw. He couldn\u2019t remember hurting his leg, did that happen when he\u2019d landed after his initial flight? Didn\u2019t matter, he just had to get out of sight. A few people had come out of their homes and were trying to help the pair of police officers that were trapped in their car. From what Jason could hear it sounded like one was merely stuck inside while the other was pinned. The small group of people were having far less luck lifting the car than Greg had. With a car on its roof and people yelling no one noticed the bloodied and broken teen slinking off into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason forced himself to press on through the pain toward the path beside the nearest garage that led to the back of the house. He opened an unlocked gate hoping for something or somewhere he could hide in the backyard and said a small prayer when he spotted a large pool with an equipment storage tub on the far side. He limped to the far side of the patio and plopped down between the tub and some bushes. On any other day Jason would have cringed at the thought of sharing such a space with the copious spiders and creepy crawlies that were no doubt back there, but under the circumstances he welcomed the seclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sirens were so loud they were clearly right on the doorstep of the house he was hiding behind. Then they cut off entirely confirming for Jason their arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held Laura\u2019s phone up to his good eye and unlocked it. He was greeted with an image of Laura as she now was: tall, busty, fit, and sexy beyond all reason. The image went blurry and Jason blinked to clear his vision. <i>Now what?</i> he thought. He was hit with a wave of dizziness that informed him that he was probably on the road to unconsciousness so he\u2019d better act fast. <i>Can I fix me? Can I <b>FIND</b> me?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nJason noticed a magnifying glass symbol at the top of the screen and tapped it. He was given a text field and he began to type in his own name. He had to start over four times because he was having difficulty keeping his fingers under control but he finally finished and hit the \u201cSearch\u201d button. As the phone was working on his request Jason was surprised by a sudden blow to the side of his head. Terrified that he\u2019d been discovered by Greg again he was about to leap to his feet. Intense nausea and the realization that whatever had hit him was still next to his head kept him from moving. It was a long moment before Jason figured out that he had fallen over on his side and it was the ground that had hit him, or rather the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision beginning to darken Jason breathed a small sigh of relief when he was able to recognize his own information at the top of the search results. He tapped it and was greeted with a bright yellow warning window. The top was filled with large text that he was able to make out, it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><b>WARNING!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE SELECTED PROFILE IS DAMAGED AND CANNOT RECEIVE ALTERATION UPDATES UNTIL REPAIRS HAVE BEEN MADE.</b></div></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow this was a list of smaller text outlining exactly what Greg had done to Jason. This he couldn\u2019t quite make out but the occasional word was able to slip through the closing fog such as \u201claceration,\u201d \u201cfracture,\u201d \u201chemorrhage,\u201d and \u201cconcussion.\u201d The sheer length of the list made Jason feel much less optimistic than he had moments earlier. At the bottom of the screen was a dialog box that asked \u201cREPAIR DAMAGE?\u201d and two buttons. Now Jason\u2019s vision failed him entirely and while he could remember where the buttons were relative to his thumb he had no idea which was which. As darkness enveloped him and he drifted off into dreamless sleep he forced his thumb to take a guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was breathing, that\u2019s the only thing he was sure of. He counted his breaths, slow and deep. He counted to thirty before he realized that his lungs no longer howled with pain or complained of a fractured rib cage. Jason opened his eyes, both of them, and could see perfectly. He slowly stood waiting for something to hurt or give out but he was fine. He looked down and though his shirt was torn and his pants were covered in blood and a little bit of vomit he was perfectly fine. \u201cNow that\u2019s a healing factor to make Wolverine jealous!\u201d he announced. \u201cThat phone really is a miracle worker. No wonder Greg was so freaked out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Greg made him remember Laura. He needed to get to her and make sure she was alright. Jason pocketed the phone and climbed the nearest fence into a different backyard. He did this four times to make sure he was far enough away from the scene of the crime to not arouse suspicion before returning to the street. There was a buzz of activity around the overturned car as cops marked off the area and began trying to figure out what the heck had happened. Jason turned and sprinted until he was back home where he found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason waited a very long time before considering approaching his house. He kept watching and waiting for Greg to appear huge and angry or for one of his neighbors to act suspiciously. After a while, though, he realized it was just a normal day on his street. With the sun beginning its descent towards the ocean he sprinted to his front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the house he went immediately to a window to see if anyone was approaching, but all was well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason? Is that you?\" Laura called from upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt a shiver through his body that ended in his crotch where his penis began to stiffen. Even her voice is hot, he thought. \"Yeah, it's me.\" he called back and began to go upstairs to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, I woke up looking to get my hands on that huge cock of yours and you and it were gone. I got scared that I wasn't good enough for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed to himself. Now that he knew this was his best friend some of the sexual banter seemed a little strange but he still really liked it. He kind of wanted to keep the illusion up, but there was no way especially not with a super strong Greg running around trying to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the room to find Laura sitting on the edge of the bed with a sheet up to her washboard stomach. One of her legs was sticking out to the side and her shapely thigh was on display. Her huge breasts were bare, her nipples already at attention. When she saw him her gorgeous face lit up in a dazzling smile and she cupped one of her boobs letting out a sultry moan as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my big man,\" she said then casually adding. \"By the way, have you seen my phone?\" Then she furrowed her brow at him. \"And what happened to your shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down noting the ripped collar and blood stains. \"This? This is the work of your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second Laura looked confused, then Jason was pretty sure she was going to try and pretend she didn't know what he was talking about. But she was a smart girl and dropped the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" she said in a serious tone, \"tell me what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason told her everything: Greg appearing at his door, his frightened escape and attempt at rescue, the beating and his recovery. When he got to the part where Greg tried to kill him Laura looked ready to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seemed so different this morning after, you know, he grew,\" she said. \"But I never thought he'd go so far as to really hurt anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, it gets worse.\" Jason continued to tell her about the police arriving then being crushed by their own overturned car. Laura hung her head with shame for her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in silence for a moment before a question occurred to Jason. \"By the way, has Greg ever seen Blade Runner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said. Then he held up Laura's iPhone. \"So, this little thing is what was able to give you those.... um...\" He motioned at her chest then thought better of it. \"All new everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled. It was good to hear after the heavy news Jason had laid on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said then moved her arms inward squeezing her breasts together and creating mind numbing amounts of cleavage. \"Do you like my everythings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Jason's turn to laugh. \"Well, sure. And if you are ok with it I plan to take full advantage of your everythings and everything else too. But first I think we should do something about Greg. Can you use this thing to debuff him or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she said taking her phone back and unlocking it. She made a few taps then frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says it can't lock onto Greg anymore. That his,\" she squinted to read the small type, \"neurological biochemical fingerprint has deviated from what his DNA markers allow. The subject must be reentered into the Alterations database.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so how do we reenter him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says we have to get a photo of him with his profile open to link the two.\" Laura paused for a second the lit up, \"See, I knew Greg wouldn't hurt anyone like that. Somehow his new body has messed with his brain so badly he's not even himself anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded, \"You'll get no argument from me, he's never been my friend but the way he was acting was pretty far outside the norm today. So what do we do in the meantime? Can we pump ourselves up in case he comes looking for us? I don't want to end up on the wrong side of his fists again. Besides, some huge muscles and super strength sound like a lot of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Laura agreed, \"but if Greg sees us like that he'll know right away that the phone isn't broken. We lose our edge. Besides, what if we go crazy with power like he has. Maybe we'd be better off just trying to find the big guy and get his picture. I could probably do it, he doesn't know what I look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair thought it over for a moment then decided to...</span></div></div>",

At last he sat on his bed next to the still nude Laura. \"Look,\" he said trying to be as sincere as possible, \"I understand that part of this is a selfish desire on my part, but I really think we should look at the possibility of beefing ourselves up. Greg did not hesitate to toss me around and I would really like to be able to defend myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled. \"Also you'd like to look like The Incredible Hulk and Thundra had a muscly love child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, partially a selfish desire. But it's easy for you to judge Miss Giant Knockers,\" he gave one of her bulbous breasts a hard squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhhh, harder,\" Laura moaned and pressed forward into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't let go but didn't engage further either. \"When did you become such a nympho?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Laura let out a huge laugh then climbed on Jason's lap squeezing him with her perfect thighs. \"I have always been horny. I just never had an outlet for it.\" She leaned in and began planting tiny kisses on his neck while grinding her crotch against his very obvious erection. \"Of course, if you don't like it I can stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! Please, no need to go,\" Jason locked his arms around Laura's back and squeezed her to him relishing the feel of her soft tits against his chest. \"I love the attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura returned the hug then leaned back. She looked into his eyes and saw worry. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want to get beaten up again. Greg really hurt me and I was pretty sure I was going to die.\" Jason looked down in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura lifted his chin so their eyes met once more. \"Ok,\" she said, \"super strength it is. Let's make sure no one can ever hurt you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and helped herself to one of Jason's shirts from his closet. She picked out an oversized tee with a picture of Master Chief that hung down to her thighs. Then she sat in Jason's computer chair and began tapping away on her phone. \"So, it looks like we can set up transformation triggers so that we can grow big when we want and shrink back so Greg doesn't have to be aware. The question is who should go first? I mean there's always the chance that we'll end up in the same muscle frenzy as Greg, the other person could be in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to get big too?\" Jason asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, can't let you have all the fun. Besides, I need to be able to take a pounding from you at any size, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \"Sounds good, how about...\"</span></div></div>",

See?\" He pointed to his crotch where his pants were tented. \"But, as to your first request, I think I'd like to leave my clothes on. Growing out of them is part of the fantasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, big guy. I think you're going to like this.\" She made one last tap and set the phone down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt a fire in his chest that slowly began to burn brighter and brighter. It began to spread to the rest of his body but remained deep within him as though it was his skeleton itself that was on fire. He began breathing heavily and beads of sweet appeared all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he sputtered. \"That's a lot of power in me. Feels good, really good.\" He said. The power was still deep in his core but it was everywhere about to infuse his entire body with strength and size like no one has ever seen. Then, just before the energy in his body became so intense that his muscles would have no choice but to get bigger the heat vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a moment to catch his breath then looked disappointed at his body. \"Nothing changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I set up a transformation trigger so you can still look like yourself when you need to.\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so what's my trigger. How do I get big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was listed as change at will. Just try, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason focused inward and tried to find the fire that had been building inside his body moments ago. After ten seconds or so of finding nothing he began to get frustrated so he just flexed as hard as he could. Still no luck. Determined to not get angry (but beginning to feel very silly) Jason closed his eyes, focused his energy, then did his best to will himself to grow. Suddenly something clicked and when Jason opened his eyes again his body was rapidly swelling out in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly his shirt exploded off of his torso and his pants split apart around his thighs. With a giant grin on his face Jason held his arms up and flexed ever expanding biceps. The strength that had been growing within him before was now unleashed into every fiber of his being turning him into a super-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis incredible growth suddenly halted only a few seconds after it had begun but in that time Jason had outgrown even Greg's mighty girth. He looked down at Laura, her eyes filled with lust, and realized that he was taller. She'd taken his height from six to seven feet making even more room for slab upon slab of super powered muscle. He put his hands on his hips and flexed his chest causing it to surge out to a full two feet beyond his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" he asked in a voice that was several octaves deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura crossed her legs tightly and absentmindedly began fondling one of her breasts. For several long seconds she couldn't even speak. Finally she managed to dislodge a single word, \"Wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Now Jason flexed his mammoth biceps again. The diamond hard muscles expanded bringing the circumference of his arms to well over 30 inches around. \"Let's see Greg push me around now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you could put the Hulk in a headlock,\" Laura said. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of verbalizing an answer Jason just wrapped his fingers around his enormous cock which was at full attention. He ran his hand up the length of his shaft then gave a confused look. \"Did you make my dick bigger too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushed and shrugged. \"Well, I figured why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason growled with approval as he began pumping his two foot long steel pipe of penis. He slowly approached where Laura sat until he towered over her. He could hardly see her around his enormous pecs so he bent down and lifted her up by her thin waist. She was light as a feather to him and he causally tossed her onto his bed. Then he began crawling across it over her body rubbing his penis on her legs as he went. The bed groaned and protested his giant form but somehow held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, big guy?\" Laura asked trying to hide her nervousness. She was beginning to fear that he was losing himself just as Greg had. \"I don't think that'll fit where you want to put it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just laughed to himself. Then put the head of his cock into the shirt she was wearing. He continued to move up her body until he was sliding in the groove between her breasts. Still he pushed forward further until the head of his penis poked through the collar of the T-shirt. Laura took the hint and began licking the apple sided head while squeezing her breasts together around Jason's shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat astride Laura's stomach taking care not to put his weight on her but pinning her to the bed just the same. She looked up at the muscle god. \"This would be more fun if you let me grow too. Then we can do so much more than just this.\"</span></div></div>",

She, too, was having difficulty keeping her wits about her as the muscle god above her pinned her to the bed and tit-fucked her with with his long, hard cock. She wanted to just give in to her burning desire to have Jason ravage her body, consequences be damned. She wanted his gargantuan arms wrapped around her tight, his powerful lips and tongue on her tits, his monster thighs intertwined with hers, his impossible cock deep within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to just keep her wits about her, though, knowing that losing herself meant a painful end. Instead as she kneaded her breasts around a penis as thick as her forearm she looked deep into Jason\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cThis would be more fun if you let me grow too. Then we can do much more than just this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason only growled an answer back and she saw in his stare a darkness and a lack of consciousness that frightened her. She knew if she didn\u2019t get Jason back right now he\u2019d be lost and so would she. Laura stopped playing with herself  and held still making sure to not add to Jason\u2019s pleasure in any way; she looked him dead in the eyes and spoke sternly. \u201cJason, stay with me. You\u2019re becoming like Greg, remember him? Remember what he did to you? Fight back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped and there was a long moment where Laura was sure he was just going to return to pumping, and even harder than before, instead he closed his eyes tight then backed off the bed. Jason stood and held his hands to his head for a moment then his body began to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later the skinny Jason was back and taking in a few calming breaths. His thin naked body looked even more emaciated now after the behemoth he had just been but when he looked at her she was happy to see clarity that had not been there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d He sat down in a chair opposite the bed. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, I know exactly what happened. I was so powerful I could take whatever I wanted, so that\u2019s what I was doing. I just lost control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t you.\u201d Laura said. \u201cI mean, it was like there was something else inside you. If that\u2019s what Greg is going through we need to help him. Do you think you can control yourself when you\u2019re.... big?\u201d Already her desire to see Jason\u2019s mega muscles was returning while her privates began to feel warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so. I\u2019m aware of the feeling, anyway. I can probably keep it at bay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Now Laura stood and handed him her phone. \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Jason asked. \u201cWhat if you lose control?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg\u2019s my brother, I need to help get him back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could see by the look Laura wore that there was no convincing her to stop. He was a bit curious about why she handed him the phone, though. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to make the changes yourself? Why give this to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Laura to smile. \u201cWell, I took some liberties with you. I thought you might enjoy doing the same for me.\u201d She cupped an enormous breast and pinched her nipple through the shirt while her other hand slid under the lower hem of the shirt and began to massage her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn\u2019t believe how horny Laura had become. \u201cYou\u2019re such a freak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooohhh, I know.\u201d She purred as she lay down on the bed and intensified her kneading. \u201cNow hit me with some power, big guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was leery of Laura, something about her didn\u2019t seem right. At the same time, though, he just figured she was letting out a lot of pent up sexual frustration like she\u2019d said earlier. So, while she pleasured herself on the bed he set to work on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura brought herself to a quick orgasm and then again a few minutes later. By the time she finished a third she sat up and glared at Jason, \u201cStill not done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off my back, I\u2019m looking over all the options. There\u2019s all kinds of crazy stuff in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gave Jason a wild smile and her green eyes flashed. \u201cMMMMmmmmmmm, I love it when you get angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, hot stuff. This ought to knock your socks off.\u201d Jason hit the \u201cApply Changes\u201d button.</span></div></div>",

An intense power at her very core that built and built until it felt her body would have no choice but to grow just to contain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You weren\u2019t kidding about that feeling good! It felt good when I became Jade but wow, this is just a whole different level and I haven\u2019t even Hulked out yet!\u201d Laura struggled to contain herself. The empowerment she felt from Jade\u2019s body, her imminent transformation into an even MORE hypertrophic and powerful being, the lingering memory of Jason\u2019s growth and the lingering pleasure of her masturbation all coalesced into a singular mass of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even need to ask how to trigger her transformation as it began suddenly. She gasped aloud as she felt her body starting to change and grow for the second time that day but while the first time had been enjoyable, this time it was almost overwhelming. The power within her that had just felt as if it was simmering before exploded throughout her body and she could only marvel as every part of her got bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, an orgasm like an atomic bomb hit her \u2013 some part of the comic book loving Laura liked to imagine that this was her gamma bomb, radiation forever altering her DNA and imbuing her with an unspeakably large and powerful alter-ego. That prompted her body to spill over into another orgasm and her transformation to pick up pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jade had been beautiful, it had been in a measured fashion. She was \u201cjust right\u201d \u2013 muscle but not too much, breasts that were large but not too large, she was tall but not overly tall\u2026 an almost perfect sweet spot\u2026 Laura\u2019s form had immediately left that Goldilocks zone and went into glorious excess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she inched higher by the second and her breasts ballooned outward and she started putting on Hulking quantities of muscle \u2013 the part of her not taken up in the intensely, overwhelmingly orgasmic experience idly wondered why she hadn\u2019t just done this to begin with. The power \u2013 even when nascent \u2013 had been intoxicating\u2026 now it was almost  unfathomable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer perspective shifted and everything seemed smaller, more fragile and as she just got bigger and bigger and bigger and it made her already overwhelming orgasms power her tremendous Hulk-out. She had easily passed six feet within the first few seconds and now approached seven, her muscles had quickly surpassed that of a fitness model and gone from body builder to superhero to full on Hulk and her breasts had inflated out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a while to realise that it had stopped and suddenly, Jade paled in comparison to the Hulked out Laura who was easily seven and a half feet tall and several hundred pound of muscle with breasts that even the big Jason would have trouble with.</span></div></div>",

Like a magic trick, Vanessa appeared as Greg stepped aside and Jason walked directly into her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Jason stammered as Vanessa gasped and stumbled backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Vanessa declared after she regained her footing.  \"You just startled me, I should know better  than to walk that close behind the big ox.  If you're looking for Laura she's back in her room.\"  Vanessa held the door open for him and Jason tried very hard not to stare down into her cleavage as he walked past her.  He was mostly sucessful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\"  Jason mumbled as he watched her turn and follow her brother.  \"Why can't Laura have a body like her sister,\" he said under his breath as he finally closed the front door.  He shook his head to clear the thought from his head.  Laura and he had been friends for years and he his intentions had been (mostly) non sexual.  But her older sisters playboy bunny/porn star physique flouncing around had often set his mind running down other avenues of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura?\"  Jason knocked on the room of her door and it swung open at his touch.  \"Laura?\"  He asked again, poking his head in and looking around.  He was about to leave when he realized she wasn't there but the glow of her iPhones screen caught his eye.  Glancing around one more time to confirm Laura wasn't in the room he moved to the corner of her bed and picked up the phone.  \"What the hell...\"  Why was there a 3-D rendered model of her brother on the screen?  Bit by bit Jason began noticing the various sliders and settings on the program.  \"Huh, I didn't realize they had modeling apps for these things.\"  Jason fiddled with the sliders, inflating Greg's already muscular body to cartoonish proportions.  He was impressed with the level of deatil the program had, the tank top Greg was wearing stretched and tore realistically as his muscles grew outlandishly massive.  Jason stopped moving the muscle sliders and his thumb hovered over the \"apply changes\" button.  Instead he flipped his thumb over the button that was labeled \"previous profile\" and would have done a full-on spit take had there been any liquid in his mouth.  A perfectly detailed 3-D model of Laura appeared on the screen and she was completely naked.  \"Whoa,\" he whispered to himself.  \"What is she doing with this thing?\"  The temptation to morph his best friend into a sexual goddess to surpass her own sister was just about overwhelming.  But he also wondered if she had created a profile for him?  She had one for her brother so it wasn't outside the realm of possibilty.  Jason looked over his shoulder again before turning back to the app.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm sure Laura won't mind if I mess with this a little bit,\" Jason told himself as he began exploring the menu options.  One caught his eye, \"Save template?\"  He clicked it.  \"If I fuck up her model she can always go back and fix it,\" he reasoned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't get over how detailed the model was, it was photorealistic now matter how close in he zoomed.  \"I had no idea the iPhone could even handle 3-D graphics like this, the mesh for this model must be INSANE, I can't even see any edges, polyons or aliasing.\"  Finally he began selecting body parts and tweaking.  He kept comparing Laura to her sister and it soon became his goal to make sure this model would outshine Vanessa in every category.  \"Vanessa is tall, so... Laura needs to be taller.\"  Jason nudged the slider and watched the numbers by Lauras height inch higher.  He felt slightly dissapointed that there was no sense of scale to her growth like there had been with Gregs.  Lauras height soon matched his own six feet but he kept going, trying to see if there would be a point where he really felt like the model was getting taller.  He gave up when the height indicator told him Laura was now just over six and a half feet tall.  \"Like it makes a difference anway,\" he muttered to himself moving on to something else.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, let's check out your ass...\"  He twirled her model around and focused on her rear, already knowing it was flat as a board.  \"Why would you create a 3-D model of yourself and NOT tweak it a little bit?\"  He mused out loud as he widened Lauras hips and began rounding her butt.  He grinned as her bottom began taking on a more luscious profile then frowned as it began to sag.  A quick review of the settings showed that the slider for her ass had a muscle/fat slider and the slider was almost all the way to fat.  A quick flick of the slider firmed her ass up into a spectacular display.  \"Wow, the program is incredible,\" Jason murmured as he adjusted his stiffening cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe toyed with Lauras entire body \"fat/muscle\" slider but she was so stick thin it had no noticable effect.  \"I can fix that.\"  He widened her hips some more, keeping her shoulders proportional then began sliding the same muscle slider he had played with on Greg's profile to the right, picturing the sexy fit build Vanessa had.  He let out a low whistle as Lauras body filled out with toned lean muscle equal to and then beyond Vanessas build.  For fun he pushed the slider even farther than he had with Greg but without the clothes ripping effect it wasn't as satisfying so he cranked it back down again.  \"I don't even think she could move if her muscles were that big,\" he mused.  He was surprised how good Laura looked with bodybuilder sized muscles and left that slider sit for now, with Laura currently outclassing any female bodybuilder who had ever lived and probably a sizable number of the men.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just leaves your tits babe,\" Jason grinned.  It was no secret that Laura DESPISED her flat chest and Jason relished slowly moving the slider farther and farther to the right, watching her cup size indicator tick off higher and higher sizes.  Moving the iPhone in his hand actually made her breasts sway and bob and the motion was hypnotic.  He found controls for \"breast firmness\" as well as \"droopy/perky\" and briefly fiddled with them before going back to inflating her bust to ridiculous proportions.  And proportion was key, because of the fact her now massive back was skewing the \"around the chest\" portion of the cup size formula Jason esitmated that even \"D\" cup breasts on Lauras new frame were already bigger than his head.  His grin grew wider and his dick got harder as Lauras cup size passed out of the \"Ds\" and into the \"'Es.\"  He stopped at \"F\" and decided to go no farther for now.  The proportions of Lauras new body really demonstrated how inadequate cup size was as a method of breast measurement.  Jason spun the model around for a 360 view and couldn't find a viewing angle that dissapointed him.  More or less on a whim he gave her hair deep reddish highlights and lengthened it down to nearly her ass, a drastic change from the barely longer than shoulder length she habitually wore, he liked how it looked on her and also decided to throw in some extra body and thickness to her hair.  She looked like a bizarre meld of a 40's era femme fatale pinup, a porn star and a bodybuilder.  And he was pretty sure he liked it.  \"But what do I do with it now?  Can I import this model to a game or something?\"  Jason's thumb hovered over the \"commit changes\" button.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now what can I do with it?\"  Jason frowned and started digging through the menu trees, trying to figure out if this model could be exported to something else so he could use it in a video game or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was almost done with her shower and was in the process of rinsing her hair out when her body was flooded with an overwhelming wave of tension, like a whole body cramp.  It passed as soon as it arrived, leaving her tingling like her entire body had been asleep.  She leaned against the tile wall gasping for breath.  \"What the hell was that?\"  She barely gasped this single frightened statement out before she was overcome again with a feeling of intense pressure building in her body.  It wasn't until she felt her shoulder sliding UP the slick tiling that she realized she was growing taller.  Her mouth opened into a startled but silent \"O\" as she began to comprehend that she wasn't just growing taller.  Her swelling breasts began to push her crossed arms away from her chest as her arms swelled thicker and thicker as well.  Her mind raced, images of her brother and sister flashing before her eyes and remembering the intense feeling of jealousy she had felt this morning.  It was like all her dreams were coming true.  She forced herself to stand upright and try to take in as much of this transformation as she could while it was happening.  She couldn't stop touching her breasts as she grew, feeling them swell outward and grow heavier in her hand was indescribable.  Her other hand roamed across her changing body, feeling her abs turn into rock hard ridges, her bicep growing thicker and thicker, her ass getting rounder and firmer.  When her bangs dropped over her eyes she realized her hair must be growing as well and she shook her head to clear her vision again.   As her shoulders grew broader her body began to push against the glass shower door, before she could shift her weight the glass exploded outward from the frame and she laughed, flexing her muscles and screaming in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! YES! OH MY GOD YES!!!\"  Jason was so startled to hear Laura screaming from down the hallway that he dropped her phone.  What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stuggled to get out of the shower, her body wedged in the door frame and still growing.  She laughed again as it shattered around her and she stepped over the broken glass to regard her still swelling body in the mirror.  \"Oh my God I look SO GOOD!!!\"  She gloated as her reflection struck a double bicep pose that would have made her brother weep and the peak was STILL swelling larger.  She cupped her breasts and playfully lifted them, pushing them against each other, giggling at the massive cleavage she could now create.  \"In your FACE Vanessa,\" she chortled.  \"Awwww,\" she pouted as she could feel the growth stopping.  She stretched her body upward and stood on her tip toes as though that would make it last longer.  Finally she crossed her arms and frowned at her reflection.  \"\"A LITTLE more would have been nice.\"  Her smile brightened again when as she flexed her arm and marvelled at her bicep one more time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!\" She said, realization dawning on her.  \"That app must really work, and that means someone is messing my phone!\"</span></div></div>",

This, incredible buff, busty, huge body. She instinctively reached for a towel to wrap around herself before realizing that there was no way in hell it would be able to cover her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Besides</i>, she thought,<i> this isn\u2019t the sort of figure you cover. It\u2019s the sort you show off.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the bathroom door and, still dripping wet, made her way into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason!\u201d her friend had gone white at the sight of her. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn\u2019t speak. His eyes scanned Laura\u2019s thickly muscled frame from head to toe. In every way she was a perfect copy of the image he had edited on her iPhone. He now realized that with no reference point in the phone, she was even bigger than he had imagined. Being tall he was used to looking down to meet her eyes, but now his eyes were level with her mouth. He tried to say something, anything, but his mouth only flapped like a fish\u2019s.  Her naked body nearly caused him to come right there in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled as Jason attempted to speak. \u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d She slid her hands up her armor plated stomach to her volleyball sized breasts which she cupped and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s knees gave out and he collapsed into a seated position on Laura\u2019s bed. Finally he spoke, \u201cIt works?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m as surprised as you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea, but I love it!\u201d Laura brought her arms up and flexed them watching as the peaks of her incredibly cut biceps soared higher than anything Greg had ever dreamed of. Laura was familiar with many of Greg\u2019s bodybuilder magazines and knew that her arms were on par with some of the largest in the world.  \u201cYou know I can see why Greg spends all his time working out. All these muscles make you feel incredible. You have no idea how strong I feel.\u201d She flexed her giant arms in front of her chest, water droplets leftover from the shower still beaded her skin like tiny diamonds. \u201cI only wish you had kept going and made me even bigger. Even STRONGER!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped as his erection pushed harder against his pants. Laura bent down to him and leaned in close so her mouth was at his ear. \u201cThank you for my new body,\u201d she whispered then took the bottom lobe of his ear into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Jason could stand. His eyes rolled back and he came hard. When Laura stood back up she could see the wet spot soaking through his jeans which caused her to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jason noticed that while she was close she had slid her iPhone out of his grip without him noticing. Now she was focused on it and tapping the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d Jason asked trying to regain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled...</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s check the strength part out first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled up her profile, smiling at her naked muscle bulging image.  She tapped over to options and found a \u201cstrength/density\u201d button.  The menu started at a default of 2, which with a quick check, indicated that her strength would be twice that of what her muscle size was.  Snickering that she was already twice as strong as she looked, she thumbed down to the slider and moved it forward, watching with widening eyes as the numbers moved forward, to 5 to 10 to 20 to 100 to 1000 and beyond!  Finally stopping, she shook her head with near disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should prove interesting.  Greg\u2019s strength will be nothing compared to mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura then shifted back to the fat/muscle and licked her lips.  Pulling up the slider, she slid it forward and marveled as her muscles grew ever larger.  Pausing, she hit a \u201cdetail\u201d button and moved the pointer to her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg always liked to flex up his biceps and point to them to demonstrate his superiority.  Now let\u2019s see who the superior one will be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura expanded her arms to unreal levels, chuckling as she did so.  As with Jason\u2019s issue, she had no point of reference, so was a bit unsure of how big they really were.  She pushed them a bit bigger just to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuffing a strand of her long hair off the side of her face, Laura pegged back to breasts and made a modest adjustment, but then went over toward \u201cbreast firmness\u201d and pushed it far to the right, over toward \u201cperky/droopy\u201d and pushed the perky to the far right too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing it back up to the main menu, the \u201ccommit changes\u201d button flashed.  Laura looked at Jason, who was backed up against her dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready for this Jason?  Are you ready to see me grow even larger, even stronger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped as he steadied himself.  Laura laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was clear you\u2019ve enjoyed the show so far.  Why don\u2019t you at least lose the jeans?  After all, I\u2019m standing here as naked a Jay Bird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, already starting to sport another erection, threw out his normal shyness and quickly complied, stepping out of the jeans.  Laura smiled and nodded as she looked at his green boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded slowly, his entire body nearly shaking in anticipation.  Laura pressed the \u201ccommit changes\u201d button and tossed the phone onto her bed and bit her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like before, the changes began to occur right away, slowly but steadily.  Her shoulders pushed wider, her legs added more muscle, hardening with rippling valleys of female beef, her chest pushed out with thickening pectorals and those wonder boobs rose higher, growing firmer, stronger and harder.  Laura\u2019s arms, hung at her side, grew thicker at a faster rate with her forearms bulging out away from her still comparably small hands and wrists, out back to her narrow elbows and back out into thickening, crackling biceps and triceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on her toes, her calves exploded outward, jutting out to over 30 inches around and rippling with muscle fibers.  Her thighs ballooned outward into four insanely separated quads so thick that her inner thighs touched and then her outer quads blasted outward until each thigh was bigger around than Jason\u2019s chest and then as big as Greg\u2019s chest!  Her naked shaven privates seemed to pulse as Laura was thoroughly enjoying the experience.  Her steel belted abs were now a wall of outrageous muscles on her narrow midsection, etched into at least a 10 pack, deeply separated, with pebble obliques running up the side and sweeping dramatically into her widening, thickening back now pushing toward five ungodly feet wide as she flexed her back.  And through it all, she was growing stronger, her muscles were growing denser and her entire body was growing nearly indestructible.  Laura was now nearly ecstatic as she could feel her strength increasing as her muscles grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES, OH MY GOD, YEAHHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had dropped his boxers and was shamelessly masturbating at the site of Laura growing even bigger, thicker, and more detailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flexed her upper body and her mighty chest plowed forward with two mounds of striated nine inch thick pectorals and two steel hard gravity defying breasts that pushed ahead like twin missiles.  The deep red diamond hard nipples popped outward from her excitement, causing her mighty breasts to jiggle once and then solidifying even further as veins raced around her chest, pulsing ever increasing power into her super powered pecs and boobs of doom!  Her shoulders were rippling footballs and her traps rose a bit behind her.  She looked stunning, as beautiful as Jason could have ever imagined with her dark, thick, shiny red highlighted hair spilling out around her chest, shoulders and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was growing so powerful that the remaining water was heating against her skin and wisping away with a light white mist across her body.  As the growth slowed, Laura slowly brought her arms up and Jason gasped, even after seeing the rest of her body expand into a muscle powerhouse to eclipse any man on earth, Laura\u2019s arms were something out a of a comic book.  She smiled lustfully, with a wicked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Greg thought his arms were so big and bad, wait until he gets a load of MY massive pythons!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven against her full 6 foot 7 inch frame, massive legs, back and chest, her arms looked even bigger, redefining the word massive.  Her biceps bunched angrily, pushing up against her forearm and up and over her thick shoulders.  Her triceps dipped low, shadowing her biceps and pressing into her door frame busting lats.  And as she tensed her fists, muscle fibers condensed, her bullet proof skin pulled taught, veins pulsed impossible strength and power forward and her biceps rose with the intensity of twin volcanoes.  Muscles stacked upon each other and rose up and up and UP!  Never had any man flexed biceps to match those Laura now flexed.  Never had any being held the strength contained in her mountainous biceps!  The peaks pushed up against her fists and then pressed higher!  Veins blasted upward, muscle fibers feathered up the sides and her mighty, massive, awe inspiring peaks pressed over the top of her fists!  Each bicep was now bigger around than Jason\u2019s chest!  Her peak was a canyon etched across the prize winning watermelon sized muscle as the peak quivered and finally solidified with twin rumbles of power to the top of her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow THESE are a set up biceps, eh Jason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had come so hard, he was huffing and puffing, gasping at the site of Laura\u2019s beauty, bulging muscles and flexed, earth conquering biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy gosh Laura.  You.. You\u2019re so.. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura released her mighty flex and snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, pretty cool, huh?  And if you can believe it, I\u2019m much stronger than I look too.  If I was several times the strength setting when we started I\u2019m guessing I\u2019ve blasted passed even the high settings established.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason caught his breath and stared with wonder at the super woman in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-So, Laura.  What do you want to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura beamed.  A lifetime of fantasies awaited.  She smiled and pushed out one hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be honest she hadn't decided yet.  The thought of watching him grow out of his clothes like the Hulk really spoke to her inner comic book geek and old school girl fantasies of being with the Hulk, or any other massively muscled super hero far larger than her was really turning her on.  But then again she hadn't really had a chance yet to enjoy being bigger than everyone else.  Right now the Jason on her iPhone was ALMOST a big as she was, and he was damn good looking.  She giggled and nudged his penis size larger and larger until it began tearing the fabric of the boxers around it.

First he began creeping taller, his shirt pulling out of his pants, exposing his stomach inch by inch while his bare ankles poked further and further from his pant legs.  Laura could see his abs becoming more and more pronounced as his shirt began to mold itself to his swelling torso.  He grunted as his hips broke the button on his jeans and the zipper growled as the teeth began to tear loose from each other.  He was hyperventilating now and his t-shirt began to tear across his mountainous pecs.  Laura looked down as his sneakers disintegrated as his feet outgrew them.  The seams all along his jeans began to tear loose as his thighs grew thicker and thicker.  \"This is awesome,\" Jason finally gasped as he reached the size most championship bodybuilders would be jealous of and seemed to be slowing down.  He happily flexed his immense biceps as the fragments of his shirt fluttered to the ground and the remnants of his jeans finally gave up and tore completely off.  Clearly he thought he was almost done and Laura laughed at the look of surprise he gave her as his growth accelerated again.  His head thumped against the ceiling and Laura laughed again.  His Hulk boxers strained heroically against his swelling cock but it finally split with a loud tear and the improbably long and thick member slapped against his gargantuan thigh.  Jasons height finally topped out and in response his muscles grew faster than ever, wider, and thicker.  His bicep was nearly as thick as Laura.  Jason bent over slightly, to keep his head from hitting the ceiling and he was in the grips of the moment of complete sexual ecstasy Laura had experienced at the climax of her own growth.  \"Oh God, OH GOD!  OH! MY! GOD!!!\"  He roared as he arched backward, not even noticing as his head tore through the drywall.  His penis throbbed, rock hard and spewing cum and Laura giggled as some splashed her.  \"AAAAHHHHHHH!!!\" He roared with the feelings of intoxicating power and sexual release.  With that he sank down onto Lauras bed and it promptly collapsed under his weight.  He looked startled for a moment then shrugged.  He poked at his body, prodding and flexing.  \"I can't believe this.  This is so crazy.  I just can't believe it.\"  He flexed his arm for the millionth time, watching the peak climb higher and higher, then feeling it.   It was like a piece of granite, no give at all.  He turned Laura in surprise as her own hand caressed the enormous muscle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impressive big boy,\" Laura breathed huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"  Jason gulped, suddenly self conscious.  They were both naked... and Laura's new body was SO hot.</span></div></div>",

Laura, who's muscles were already in bodybuilder territory, was growing even bigger right before his eyes, and because of him! She had been flexing her biceps when it began, and the muscles underneath her soft skin bunched and expanded as if they had a mind of their own. \"Ohhh...yesss,\" Laura moaned as Jason watched her continue to swell larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer height increased the fastest, and she leaned forward onto Jason, pressing her swelling breasts into his stomach, engulfing his penis. Jason gasped when he realized the sensation that he was feeling was her sliding UP his crotch, until her nipples raked against his cobblestone abs. \"Just wait til I get up there, Jason. Then the real fun starts,\" Laura said amidst her and Jason's combined moaning and grunting. Jason didn't have to wait long, as her height finally topped out level with his, and she locked eyes with him, then lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Laura's height had reached it's limit, she continued to grow. Her breasts and muscles pulsed, bulged, and swelled in every direction, eventually matching Jason's immense size, and then slightly surpassing it. He found it increasingly difficult to reach all of the way around her, but he never tired of trying. Every time he thought he had already felt and explored a part of her body, there came another bulge, another ripple, more muscle, more size, until finally she stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere they lay for several minutes, two muscle titans lost in each other's embrace. When they finally stopped to breath, they realized that Laura's back had pressed against the ceiling, her breasts pressed against Jason, and they had both become decently stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now,\" Laura said in a bubbly voice, \"It seems we're stuck. Stuck being a relative term, I guess. So Jason, how do you wanna get out of this? We could go the old fashioned way and...break stuff. Or...,\" her voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could just outgrow the house.\"</span></div></div>",

It was gone!  She ripped the cover off the bed, making doubly sure it wasn't there.  Throwing the blanket away she knelt down to look under the bed and then with a snort of frustration she hoisted the bed over her head to look again.  \"Damn it,\" she fumed as she let the bed drop.  Despite being upset about not finding the phone she couldn't help but giggle at how easy it had been to lift the bed, it felt almost weightless.  Her wet hair hung against her face, dripping cold water and she shivered involuntarily.  \"Fuck it, I need to dry off,\" Laura muttered to herself as she flipped her hair over her shoulder and stalked out of her room to find a towel.  Who the hell would have been in her room messing with her phone and who would have done this to her?  She would have to get dried off and find something to wear before she did anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Laura screaming in what sounded like she was in the throes of an orgasm Jason had ran.  He ran because he was embarrassed to be there, why hadn't Vanessa told him Laura had someone ever?  He ran because he was pissed off that Laura had a boyfriend and hadn't told him.  They had never said as much but Jason had always assumed he and Laura were going to end up together.  And when he ran he had taken the phone with him.  He was already out the door and down their front walk before he realized he still had the phone in his hand.  \"Damn it,\" he exclaimed, looking at the phone and trying to think of how to get it back to Laura before she realized he had been in her house.  He was pretty sure the front door had locked behind him when he left and he didn't feel like knocking to be let back in.  He jogged around the side of the house towards Laura's room, he would get her window open and chuck it back in her room he decided.  That was the last coherent thought Jason had because at that moment he looked through the window into Laura's bedroom and his perception of reality was thrown upside down.  Laura was naked in her bedroom, tearing apart her bed.  Not just Laura as he had always known her, this was the Laura he had just created with the iPhone app.  He knew his mouth was hanging open in shock as she lifted the bed clear over her head then let it thump down down again.  Laura looked around then swiped a hand through her dripping wet hair and stomped out of her room and out of sight.  Jason choked as he remembered to start breathing again.  He looked at the phone in his hand and a new perception of reality was dawning.  \"What else can this thing do?\"  He asked himself as he walked away from Laura's house, all thoughts of returning the phone gone for the moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason walked back to his house at a brisk pace, fighting the urge to break into an all out run.  He alternated between taking glances over his shoulder and locking/unlocking Laura's iPhone to look at the insane virtual body of Laura's that somehow had become HER ACTUAL BODY.  He kept expecting Laura to be charging down the street after him, the look of anger that had been evident on her face as she searched fruitlessly for the phone etched in his memory.  The continuous cycle of fear and arousal kept him on his toes and punch drunk with anticipation for doing more experimenting with the phone all the way to the front door of his mothers duplex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason?\"  A feminine voice startled him as he was sneaking yet another peek at virtual Laura (who now apparently had a towel wrapped around her waist) and attempting to unlock the front door.  He fumbled the phone, nearly dropping it as he turned to face the speaker.  His mouth hung open slightly as he was eye to eye with a stunning young woman he knew he recognized.  His mind spun sluggishly, trying to regain traction and move away from thoughts of Laura and her iPhone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" he said finally, throwing out the word like a verbal barrier to allow his brain time to catch up.  He and his mother shared the duplex with an elderly woman, this was her niece or granddaughter or something.  Kaylee?  Caitlan?  Aileen?  Kiersten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, long time no see, you've gotten tall.\"  He felt blinded by her smile, damn she was gorgeous.  Don't stare at her boobs, don't stare at her boobs, he cleared his throat and hoped he hadn't said that out loud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I think it's been what, since last summer?\"  Danielle?  Traci?  She usually came over for a week or two during the summer, he seemed to recall she was a personal trainer or fitness instructor or something.  Her body was solidly curvy, well built, athletic and her C or D cup breasts were all but spilling out of the tight tank top that had been raggedly cut to expose both her toned abs and her generous cleavage.  Jasons mind wandered back a few years ago to when she still in high school and not nearly as athletic, her breasts had been in the F or G range then but even now, in contrast to her tight body they were spectacular.  She swept her long wavy brown hair away from her face with an easy laugh and Jasons eye traced the arc of her noticeable bicep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that, is your mom in?  I broke the paddle to my Kayak,\" she jerked her thumb at the driveway behind her where a small red car had the familiar shape of a kayak strapped to it, \"Your mom said you guys might have one laying around you weren't using, I was hoping to borrow it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason seemed to remember seeing a kayak laying around in the garage somewhere and the paddle was probably lurking about as well but he couldn't remember the last time either had been used.  He shrugged.  \"I'll take a look, if I find it I'll let you know, Donna,\" he tried hard not to make the name sound like a question.  He had never talked to her this much before and had CERTAINLY never been this close to her and definitely never thought she WOULD have a reason to talk to him.  She was older than he was, in her mid 20s he was pretty sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Jason,\" she didn't correct him so he must have remembered right.  She flashed another smile and turned back to her Aunt (grandmas?) half of the duplex.  Jason watched her shapely ass clad in tight spandex micro bike shorts before he remembered the phone in his hand again.  He quickly unlocked the front door, slipped inside and locked it behind himself again with a sigh of relief.  \"Time to see what this baby can do,\" Jason muttered as he unlocked the phone and ogled Laura one more time before dismissing her profile and opening another.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason realized his hands were shaking as he dug through the menus to get to the muscle settings.  He had always been jealous of Lauras older brother Greg.  Knowing that in the abstract there were guys out there that were bigger than you was one thing.  Being face to face with it nearly every day was something else entirely different.  Jason selected his entire muscular system and noted that he had next to no fat on him which was nice.  But he wasn't exactly tipping the scales in the muscle department either.  He bumped his physique up ten pounds of pure lean muscle and hit \"Apply Changes\" just to see how it would look on him.  This time the feeling of building heat was in the center of his chest and spread slowly out across his body.  It felt good but no where near as impressive as the penis upgrade.  He flexed experimentally when the feeling passed and frowned.  Ten pounds was nothing, he couldn't even really see a difference.  He flicked the muscle slider up another twenty pounds and hit it again.  This time the burn was more intense, lasted longer and he could SEE his muscles swelling slightly as the wave coursed through his body again.  This time his bicep flex displayed a nicely formed (though) smallish peak.  According to the app he now weighed just under 200 pounds, which on his six foot one inch frame was probably about what he should weigh.  He had the lean well cut look of a runner or decathlete.  He bumped up his virtual self another fifty pounds and frowned thoughtfully at the image.  This pushing more into bodybuilder territory which he had always envied but maybe that was too much too soon?  Should he take it easy so people who knew him wouldn't freak out when they saw him.  With a guilty grin he thought of what he had done to Laura.  How was she going to explain that to anyone?  His thumb hovered over the \"Apply Changes\" button and he wondered if he should push it or not.</span></div></div>",

As he was doing so he noticed another setting he hadn't messed with yet.  \"Staged Implementation\"  It was a choice wheel and Jason scrolled through units of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks.  It kept going up to a decade.  It looked like it was currently set to thirty seconds.  Jason dialed it up to five minutes and noticed that the fifty pounds of muscle he had selected had changed to the notation \"ten pounds per minute.\"  He shrugged before hitting apply and the iPhone screen flashed \"Applying Changes\" for a few seconds longer before he could feel the now familiar building heat in the core of his body.  This time it wasn't as intense but the sensation strengthened the longer it went on.  He could feel his body swelling larger and larger and he laughed out loud as he flexed over and over again, watching his body swell in the mirror until finally the five minutes were up and he could feel the growth halt.  He could barely recognize himself, he hadn't changed his face or height but he was now tipping the scales at two hundred and fifty pounds and hung like a horse.  He looked at his virtual profile on the iPhone and smiled.  He was about to add even more to his muscularity when the doorbell rang and startled he nearly dropped the phone, he bobbled it a few times before finally regaining control of it.</span></div></div>",

Somehow his fumbling to not drop the phone must have changed something.  He glared as he pulled his t shirt on over his head but then snickered at his reflection.  The shirt was RIDICULOUSLY tight and looked like it would split open if he breathed too hard.  His pants wouldn't go on over the flare of his new thighs, instead he dashed into his room and managed to find a pair of (once baggy) swim trunks that now fit like they were painted on.  He pulled them on and glanced at the phone.  It had finally stopped flashing \"Applying Changes\" and he could see that he was set to grow 2 pounds.  \"That isn't so bad,\" he was about to put the phone back into his pocket when he did a double take and looked again.  \"Two pounds an hour for an entire week?\"  Jason stopped where he was and tried to do the math in his head when the doorbell rang yet AGAIN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm COMING,\" he yelled, shoving the phone into the top drawer of his dresser and dashing down the stairs to throw the front door open for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Jason, I was wondering if you had a chance to look for that paddle yet...\" Donna's voice trailed off as she was obviously taking in Jasons new physique.  Jason struggled for something to say as her brain was visibly working through whether or not he had been this big when she talked to him earlier and trying to gauge just how baggy his hoodie had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet,\" Jason said, more to interrupt her train of thought than anything.  \"I was just getting ready to go to the beach and was going to look in the garage before I left.\"  Jason RARELY went to the beach but he figured Donna wouldn't know that, and how else would he explain the obvious swim trunks.  Donnas eyes had traveled all the way down to his bare feet and were working their way back up.  \"You can come in and help me look if you want,\" Jason offered, stepping back and giving her room to come in if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped in mechanically, shaking her head slightly and looking him back in the eyes again, \"Umm, sure.  Sure.\"  Jason realized again how tall she was, they were eye to eye as she stepped in.  He jerked his eyes away from her cleavage, realizing that his penis was beginning to stir.  He had his doubts about the ability of his swim trunks to contain him if he let that get out of control.  Jason cleared his throat, and walked towards the door that connected to the garage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you work out at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question took Jason by surprise.  \"Work out?\"  He gave Donna a quizzical look as he turned on the light in the garage and stepped in.  It smelled like dust and old motor oil.  He couldn't remember the last time he had been in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna laughed, \"Yea, your muscles, like at a gym?\"  Donna flexed a bicep to demonstrate.  \"You don't get a body like yours without working out.\"  She seemed more at ease talking about something she was familiar with and Jason realized that she was now treating him like had treated her earlier.  Intimidated by her looks, feeling like you wanted something you probably would never have.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat as he looked around the garage, trying to remember where he had seen his dad's old kayak.  Why didn't the old coot come clean his stuff out of here one of these days?  \"You know, the gym.  The one downtown.\"  He felt lame saying it.  He knew there WAS a gym somewhere downtown but couldn't remember exactly where or what it was called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That old place?\"  Donna raised an eyebrow and seemed about to say something but Jason cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the kayak, it's over there behind that stack of old boards and crap.  The paddle should be with it.\"  Jason maneuvered through the mountains of junk and pulled the stack of boards back away from the wall.  \"See if it's back there, I'll keep these from falling over.\"  Donna leaned past Jason, taking what seemed like a very long time to root around behind the boards and definitely brushing her body up against Jason and his crotch more than was necessary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" she said, holding the paddle over her head and standing up straight, facing Jason.  He gently lowered the boards back to where they had been, one of his sleeves splitting open over his bicep with the motion with a pop that seemed louder than it should be.  Jason stood awkwardly, waiting for Donna to move so he could get past her.  He could feel her warm breath on his face as she looked from him to his burst sleeve.  She shook her head slightly and slowly turned to go back the way they had came, obviously wanting to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you taking your kayak out to, the old lighthouse point?\"  Jason was trying to make conversation, trying to force himself to think about something other than how amazing Donna's ass looked in her tiny bike shorts and definitely trying not to get a hard on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shook her head, \"No too many tourists up there this time of year.  One of my friends from college knows a place a few miles from here, decent white water rapids and it's never crowded with morons who don't know what they're doing.\"  They were back in the living room and Jason closed the door to the garage with a sense of relief, glad to be away from the dust and the heat.  Thinking of the dust was making him thirsty and he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want something to drink before you go?\"  Jason was feeling waves of conflicting emotions.  His hormones were churning like mad from the multiple transformations he had put himself through in the last hour or so and he could feel the beginning of the building heat in his chest, signalling that his long slow growth he had accidentally programmed was on its way.  To top it off it was obvious from the looks that Donna was giving him and the distracted glassy haze that kept slipping into that the pheromone setting he had messed with was NOT a myth.  He was pretty sure if he kept her here for a few more minutes she would be throwing herself at him.  But was that really the right thing to do?  He barely knew this woman.  But then he looked at her tight, curvy body and prominent breasts and hesitation seemed like a fools move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I could use a glass of water or something,\" Donna said finally, pulling her eyes from the torn shirt sleeve with effort. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More than anything Jason wanted to rip Donna's clothes to shreds and ram his enormous cock into her. He was pretty sure she would let him too; whether it be from his incredible body or the pheromones he was generating he could have her. But he decided he didn't want to force her. He'd get her some water, spend a few minutes with her, and if she came on to him then so be it.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason led Donna into the kitchen and fished a bottle of water out of the fridge. He twisted the top off but must have underestimated his grip on the bottle because he squeezed nearly a third of the contents all over his hand and wrist. He looked at Donna and laughed sheepishly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" he said, \"I don't know my own strength.\" Which, he thought to himself, was completely true. He returned to the refrigerator and got a second bottle for Donna while he took a long swig off of the one he had accidentally crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet,\" Donna said with just the slightest hint of sarcasm. Her eyes had returned to his torn sleeve. \"So, since you mentioned it, how strong are you? What's your bench?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt a moment of panic. He had no idea what a guy his size should be able to bench press. He wasn't even sure what the ballpark figure should be. Jason didn't think there was anyway he'd be able to pull off this ruse, but then he felt a surge of confidence. All his life he'd been a scrawny nerd, and while he was still a nerd he was nowhere near scrawny anymore. This girl wanted him, it was clear from the look in her eye. He could direct the conversation wherever he wanted.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked Donna in the eye. \"A lot.\" he said. \"But enough about me. How long have you been kayaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long. Maybe a year. I find it's a great arm workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to say you have some great arms.\" Jason winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and felt her own biceps. \"Thank you. That means a lot coming from you. After all, you really know great arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jason's turn to smile. He raised the arm still contained in his short sleeve and flexed. The fabric ripped apart all the way from his bicep to his neck. Jason could see Donna visibly shiver and she reached out with her hand and touched the swell of his 18 inch arm. Jason saw goosebumps run their way up her forearm to her shoulder and she let out a short breath. Jason could see the desire burning in Donna's eyes; she wanted him so bad but he was determined to make her come to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna ran her slender fingers around the bulge of Jason's bicep and squeezed finding no give from the solid sinew below his skin. \"Wow,\" she said, \"I've been a personal trainer for several years and I've never felt such hard muscles. I just really want to-\" She stopped and looked over his shoulder at a clock on the wall. \"Oh, shit! Is that the time? I gotta go!! I'm late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna grabbed the kayak paddle and made a break for the front door. Just before leaving she turned and looked at Jason. \"I'm really sorry to run out on you. I was wondering.. I mean, it would be cool.. if, well, maybe tomorrow night we could hang out, or something. You know, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled. He wasn't used to being on the receiving end of a nervous request for a date, it was a feeling he could get used to. \"Sounds good.\" he said.\u00a0\"Come by here around seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, feeling a little more sure of herself, blew Jason a quick kiss then vanished through the door.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was on top of the world. An incredibly hot girl was all over his incredibly buff body. She wanted him and he could have had her with little to no effort. He ran upstairs and into his room. He decided that he was going to go to the beach after all and wanted to get a new shirt and a towel. He was about to pull his slightly torn shirt off when he decided to try something. Placing his hands on his hips he flexed his pecs, lats, back, and shoulders together. \u00a0His over tight shirt didn't rip so much as explode off of his torso and fall to the floor in rags. Excited by his unorthodox shirt removal Jason curled his arms in and flexed his mighty guns while grunting with satisfaction. He glanced out his bedroom window at the various groups of people on the beach. He could just make out snatches of bikini clad babes wandering to and fro. \"They have no idea what they're in store for.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled on another equally tight shirt (in the hopes that he could perform his little hulk-out maneuver with an audience) then stuffed a towel and sunscreen into a backpack. He was just about to head out when he remembered Laura's phone and his current growth setting. His stomach sank a bit when he thought about just how big he was going to become.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" he said aloud, \"Two pounds an hour for a week. That's 48 pounds a day for seven days. That's.... jeez, nearly 340 pounds. I'll add more muscle than my current body weight. I'm starting at about 250, so that'll bring me to over 580 pounds!!!\" Jason looked down at his arms and chest and tried to imagine himself being more than twice his current size. He was both excited and worried about the possibilities. On the one hand he would be the biggest, strongest man the world had ever seen. On the other he would be a freak and he had no idea how he would go about answering any questions about his size. He pulled Laura's iPhone out of the drawer he'd hidden it in. There were several missed calls from Laura's home phone, she was looking for him. He didn't think he could face her just yet.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason cleared the missed calls and opened the Alterations app. He was greeted with a monstrous image of himself with muscles on top of muscles with extra muscles on top of those. \"Oh my god!! Is that what I'm going to look like in a week?\" The readout above the image's showed his math was pretty close as his projected weight was 585 pounds.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit it was pretty exciting to be slowly turning into a hulking mass of power, but he still wasn't sure he wanted to go that big that fast. Donna was already planning on returning tomorrow; how was he going to explain the extra 50 pounds he was going to gain overnight? At the same time he thought it would be funny to play it off as though she was imagining things, but that could only go so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lot of consideration he decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was way to excited to show off his buff body to worry about what was going to slowly happen over the next week. That could wait until that evening or even the following morning. He stuffed Laura's iPhone back into the drawer and picked up the backpack containing his towel and sunscreen and practically skipped out the back door and onto the sand.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away Jason noticed a difference in the way people looked at him. Women and men eyed him with desire and envy respectively. For his part Jason walked taller than ever before in love with the confidence his bodybuilder physique brought. He walked along the shore pretending not to notice the girls pointing and whispering. As he went he felt a quick feeling of warmth flow through his body and he knew that another hour had passed and another 2 pounds of muscle had been added to his frame. The change wasn't noticeable, but his shirt strained and groaned just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I up to now?</i> he thought to himself, <i>252, 254? By this evening I'll be up over 260!! I should buy some clothes today because I won't have a thing that'll fit me by morning.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked for the better part of an hour, relishing the looks of desire and looking for a girl or two to talk to. He felt like he was walking the aisles of a store shopping for the perfect combination of features. Finally he happened upon a pair of girls that he thought would be perfect. It was time to put his new body to the test.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara Auster was feeling very glad that she'd let her best friend, Anna, convince her to go to the beach today. Sara's original plan was to sit at home with a big tub of ice cream and be miserable. Sara and her boyfriend, Greg, had gotten into a pretty big fight the night before and looked to be on the outs. Anna told Sara to forget about the big ass and have fun; that a day on the sand with guys checking her out would do her some good. Sara wasn't sure at first just how many guys would be looking her way with Anna at her side, the 5 foot 4 inch golden haired hardbody felt a bit overshadowed by her 5 foot 8 inch raven haired \u00fcber-busty friend. And for the most part she was right, about half the guys wandering by were taken with Anna's enormous yet firm G cup breasts which were on display in the skimpiest of bikini tops. To Sara's chagrin Anna's awesome features didn't stop there, either: her curvy friend was equipped with a slender waist and round hips that led to long, long legs. Sara, for her part was petite, but had a dynamite body with obvious power. Her musculature was on par with a fitness competitor, and though her breasts were merely B cups, they suited her frame perfectly. Sara wore a one-piece swimsuit but a large hole was open in the front that displayed her ripped to shreds abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara had been pleasantly surprised, though. Even sitting next to her dark haired bombshell friend she had gotten more than her fair share of glances and smiles. This really gave her confidence level a boost especially after some of the nasty things Greg had said to her last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara was just about to get up and go for a swim when Anna grabbed her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Take a look at that guy.\" Anna said. \u00a0\"I know how you feel about muscles, he's quite a hunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked over to see a 6 foot tall bodybuilder approaching wearing a shirt so tight it looked ready to pop off. Sara watched with fascination as the mystery man approached. The wind was at his back and carried with it a strange scent that was both sweet and musky at the same time. Something about that aroma filled Sara with a warmth that tingled all the way down to her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's pretty big, yeah?\" Anna continued. \"Is he as big as Greg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, this guy has a good 20 pounds on Greg,\" Sara spoke without turning her head, she couldn't pull her eyes from the sexy beast that approached. \"And, holy shit!! This guys package is way bigger! Look at that thing!! That has to be a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna laughed, though she too was being affected by the strange scent that was blowing their way. \"Yeah, don't they say bodybuilders have small dicks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg sure fit into that category. This guy, though... I mean my god. Oh crud! He saw me staring.\" Sara forced herself to look down at the sand around her legs and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what! Don't be shy.\" Anna waved and gave the mystery hunk a wink. \"I don't know what it is,\" she whispered, \"but he is so freaking hot. I almost can't stand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular man stopped about 10 feet from the girls and smiled. \"Hi! Do you mind if I grab a spot here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sara said, \"No for it.\" She groaned quietly to herself. She'd been trying to say \"go for it\" or \"no problem\" and screwed up both. What was it about this guy that made her so goofy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" he said, seeming not to notice her slip, or at least pretending not to. He pulled a beach towel out of his backpack and laid it out on the ground. Then, to Sara's excitement he pulled out a bottle of sunscreen and looked up. \"I hate to be a bother, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even finish talking Anna was on her feet. \"I'd be glad to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara stood as well. \"Hey! He was talking to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beefy teen held his hands up. \"Hang on, girls. There's plenty of real estate for both of you.\" With that he put his hands on his hips and flexed his torso. His shirt seemed to pop like a balloon and ripped apart in several places leaving his gorgeous pecs bare and heaving.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn any other day this sort of obvious show-off move would have made Sara roll her eyes and mercilessly mock the meathead doing it. But instead she went wild, the warmth in her crotch turning into a full blown furnace. She could see the same fire burning in Anna's eyes who was clearly turned on. In fact Sara could see Anna's thimble sized nipples poking out through the thin material of her bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sara and Anna held out their hands greedily as sunscreen was dispensed, then they wen to work all over his back, chest, and arms rubbing, massaging, and groping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" the mystery muscled man said as he watched the girls work, \"my name is Jason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours (and four pounds of added muscle) later the door to Sara's apartment banged open and Jason entered carrying a gorgeous girl in each arm. Things were going even better than he had hoped. Not only were the girls among the hottest he'd ever seen, but they couldn't keep their hands off of him. Not only that, but the blond with the tight muscles was Greg's girlfriend! During their conversation on the beach she had told him all about their fight and he had listened excitedly knowing that he was about to exert the ultimate dominance maneuver. Jason had spent his whole life feeling inferior to guys like Greg, but now he was the one in charge.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason carried the girls down the hall towards the bedroom. He was pleasantly surprised at the ease with which he held them up. Both ladies their legs wrapped around his middle; Sara was sucking on his neck while Anna had removed her bikini top and was holding her melon-sized breasts up as if offering them to Jason.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason made it to Sara's bed where he deposited his new friends and stood over them smiling. He'd been able to keep his monstrous member under control so far, but now allowed it to swell to full erection. It ripped right through his shorts and stood at an insane 18 inches long. Sara and Anna could only stare in amazement for a moment before they both leapt to their knees and began sucking, pumping, and nibbling either side of his penis. Jason threw his head back in ecstasy. He gripped the remaining bits of his shorts and ripped them apart exposing his beefy thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls attacked Jason's giant cock with such verve that it was less than five minutes before his body tensed and he unleashed a torrent of come. Both Sara and Anna were shocked by the volume of fluid that doused them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw!\" Anna said with disappointment, \"We were just getting started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, baby.\" Jason said wrapping his hand around his sagging shaft. \"So am I.\" He gave two slow pumps and his cock came roaring back to life.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna squealed with delight. \"You're a monster!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned. \"You have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio arrived at Sara's apartment in the mid-afternoon. They didn't stop having sex until well past midnight. Jason was an insatiable beast. Sara was able to keep up with him since she was in better shape. Anna fell asleep around 8 and napped for a few hours while Sara got Jason all to herself. When Anna woke up Sara could finally take no more so they switched out and Anna got her solo turn. Sara never fell asleep, though. She simply sat to the side watching and slowly fingering herself. After an hour of rest she felt recharged enough and joined in again. By the time 2AM rolled around all three were laying in each others arms. Jason was still awake, though barely, and he couldn't stop smiling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was the first to wake the following morning, and when he did he felt completely refreshed and energized. The clock on the \u00a0nightstand told him it was just past 10AM. He wondered how big he was now. Would Sara or Anna notice a change? Would they freak out if he was noticeably bigger? That was a question for later, for now he was going to enjoy the feel of, not just one, but two gorgeous girls on either side of him. He squeezed Anna close to his body and reveled in the feel of her soft, warm breasts as they smashed into his side. Anna reacted by hugging Jason tighter and running her hand around the swell of his chest. Jason then turned to Sara and kissed her forehead. She moaned and slid her firm thigh up his bulging legs and ran her calf over Jason's giant member. His penis began to fill with blood and harden tenting the bed sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara opened her eyes and gave Jason a hungry stare. She then reached down and grabbed his erection. \"How in the world is this thing still hungry after last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, usually not good with words around attractive women, was filled with confidence and knew just what to say. \"You're just so hot, I can't get enough.\" Sara appeared to melt and launched herself at Jason, nibbling on his shoulder and sucking on his neck. Between his raging pheromones and his sexy body Jason felt he could do no wrong. Every shot he took was a direct hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two!\" Anna sat up, her incredible breasts bare and riding high on her chest in spite of their size. \"No hanky-panky without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason whipped the sheets off of his legs and revealed his 18 inch cock standing at full attention. Now that the source of the pheromone scent was unveiled Jason saw a look of complete arousal wash over both girls. Their nipples tightened and their faces looked serene, their eyes, though, were hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna leapt on top of Jason straddling his stomach. At the same time Sara turned his head her way and locked her lips onto his. The three of them then launched into an encore performance of he previous nights activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy noon Jason called time. His stomach was rumbling and he realized he hadn't eaten a thing since breakfast the previous day. He stood up and stretched. He heard a pair of gasps from the bed and looked down to astonished faces. It was clear that Sara and Anna had noticed his extra bulk.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked, playing dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you..?\" Sara began then looked to Anna for confirmation. Anna nodded so Sara continued. \u00a0\"Are you bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger? Than what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your muscles. You've grown. You're bigger than you were yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down taking in the sight of himself. He was bigger and he loved it, but he wasn't going to let on. \"I don't know what you're talking about. People don't just grow overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sure of it.\" Sara got out of bed and approached Jason. The difference in their height was dramatic, her head was level with his chest. \"Yesterday I guessed that you outweighed Greg by a good 20 pounds, maybe more. Now you're on a whole other level, I've never seen someone so huge. It's like you went from middleweight bodybuilder to Mr. Olympia overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason raised his arms and flexed. 21 inch biceps swelled where his 18 inch guns had been yesterday. \"Looks the same to me,\" he said. Maybe it was just the light or the fact that I was wearing clothes or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara eyed Jason suspiciously then looked over her shoulder to Anna who could only shrug.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging the subject Jason asked if he could use the shower. Sara led him to the bathroom where he rinsed off. When he had a chance he weighed himself finding that he was now 308 pounds. The girls took turns next in the shower. Once they were done Jason had a slightly awkward question to ask.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any clothes in here that you think would fit me? I ripped all of my stuff to shreds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara laughed, \"Hang on, stud muffin. Greg left some of his stuff here. It mightl fit you, unless you have another growth spurt.\" She pulled sweat shorts and a tank top out of one of her drawers and tossed them his way. Jason pulled them on finding that they fit snug. Not as tight as his own clothes fit yesterday, but getting there. Jason flexed his arms and chest listening to the pops and snaps of the fabric around his massive muscles; he had far outgrown Greg and was still a long way from being done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to just leave and never come back, are you?\" Anna asked. She had put her clothes back on and looked stunning in an emerald green halter top and black shorts. Sara was clad in only her blue panties and a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason regarded the beauties before him and decided he couldn't possibly let them go. As far as he was concerned these girls were his now. \"Oh no. You ladies are way too much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when can we see you again?\" Sara asked. She felt strange including Anna in her plans for a date, but she didn't want this to turn into a fight over Jason, not yet anyway. \"Tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head. \"Not tonight. I have plans. Tomorrow maybe. If you're free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna crossed her arms and pouted. \"Aw shit, I work tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm free!!\" Sara actually had plans with Greg the following day, but after their fight and the incredible night she'd just had she didn't think she'd ever see Greg again. And the fact that she could have Jason all to herself? She jumped at the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fair!\" Anna shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Jason said, \"I'll fuck your brains out next chance I get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Sara's turn to feel the sting of jealousy, but she didn't let it show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason said his goodbyes and left. On his walk home he stopped and picked up some new, bigger clothes. He got a few for his current size as well as some to grow into. Then he grabbed enough fast food to feed a family and went home to get ready for Donna. He thought he might actually take her out on a date unlike Sara and Anna with whom he just had sex all night. Or maybe he'd just do the same with Donna and see how long he could make her go. He was feeling more and more like a new man with each passing minute. He could have any girl, anytime, anyway he wanted. They were his to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home Jason pulled out Laura's iPhone and checked his own profile. He tapped a few options to see if he could stop his gradual growth.</span></div></div>",

He looked at the image of where his projected growth was going to end and he frowned.  \"I don't think there's anyway I can pass that off as natural.  As cool as it would be it's just too much too fast.\"  Jason brought up the now familiar muscle settings and dialed them back, settling on a still extreme but more believable four hundred pounds.  The iphone chirped and an error message displayed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*error - in progress changes cannot be altered until fully applied*  As though to punctuate the error message Jason could feel another surge of warmth bloom in his chest, heralding the arrival of another two pounds muscle.  He was about to give up and put the phone down when another idea occured to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can alter something else to balance out the muscle growth.\"  Jason tried increasing muscle density, to maintain the same weight but at least appear smaller, he was greeted by the same error.  He frowned and tried another tactic.  Being taller would spread the weight out more and give the illusion of more realistic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason switched over to his height settings and added a foot, then another.  At seven foot one inch his body still looked absurdly thick with muscle.  At eight feet one inch the proportions were almost believable, but eight feet tall?  Being that tall would cause its own problems wouldn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason set up a growth plan to add height over the next six days, to match his muscle growth and hit apply changes.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't surprised to see it was Laura yet again.  He closed the drawer with finality.  \"C'mon Laura, you can't be too upset about losing the phone, that body I gave you is PERFECT.\"  He thought about the new Laura and quickly had to change his train of thought as his penis began to stir.  \"Maybe I'll see you next week Laura.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason stripped out of the clothes he was wearing, wincing slightly when despite his best efforts seams tore and cloth ripped.  \"Huh,\" he grunted, \"two pounds of muscle doesn't seem like much but it sure adds up quick.\"  He grinned at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, and not being able to resist flexed and posed for a moment before getting in the shower.  \"You look marvelous,\" he told his reflection with a deliberately cheesy grin and two thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe showered, shaved, (posed a bit more in the mirror) and then dressed for his date in a black button up silk shirt that he could barely button over his pecs.  He frowned at the buttons that were strained to the breaking point then undid a couple, revealing the cut slabs of muscle to the world.  \"I like staring at chicks cleavage, this is pretty much the same thing for them right?\"  That was the rationale he was going with he decided, flexing again and grinning at how the peaks of his unreal biceps strained at the cloth.  He was sure he could split the fabric if he put some effort into it but as much fun as it was to burst out of his clothes a remaining center of conservative thought reminded him that it would be prohibitively expensive to wreck ALL of his clothes.  He settled for mussing up his hair with some styling gel and liberally applying aftershave and body spray.  A rush of warmth through his body and the feeling of his shirt hugging his skin just slightly tighter prompted him to check his watch.   It was just before five, it would be over two hours before Donna showed up for their date.  If she showed up.  Jason quickly dismissed the sudden stab of doubt, remembering the mind blowing night he had just spent with not one but two girls who weren't able to get enough of him.  \"She'll be here,\" he reassured his reflection, flexing a bicep hard enough to pop loose just a couple stitches.  \"She'll be here,\" he repeated.  He wandered out of the bathroom and back into his bedroom, telling himself that he was going to read some of his comics or watch a movie to pass the time but moving instead to his dresser where he pulled out Laura's iPhone yet again and powered up the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what else this thing can do,\" he mumbled softly to himself, thinking back to the moments where he had unknowingly crafted Laura into an unbelievable Amazonian sex goddess.  With his subconscious mind firmly in control (or perhaps his OTHER head, he thought absently as his cock stiffened) he began searching for \"Donna\" to see what would come up, telling himself he only wanted to see what she wearing for their date but knowing that his motivations weren't that innocuous.  He initially worried that not knowing her last name would pose a problem but the app must search by proximity because the first profile that popped up was definitely the tall hardbody he had met yesterday.  She must be in the shower he thought to himself because at the moment she was stark naked and his member struggled against the boxers and slacks he was wearing to stand at attention.  Jason zoomed in and rotated Donna, drinking in every detail of every angle.  Her height, muscularity and generous bust struck Jason as being nearly the ideal blend of Sara and Anna and Jason had to look away and do multiplication tables in his head until his cock stopped threatening to destroy fabric.  He exhaled and returned his attention to Donna, who was now wearing a panty and bra set that was an arousing combination of black lace and sheer mesh.  Jason looked away and willed his member to settle down again before thumbing through the other tabs of the app that he hadn't taken the time to look at for either himself or Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFascinating things like \"turn ons\", \"attractors\", \"favorites\" flashed past as he skimmed over them.  \"Silk,\" he grinned to see that listed high on her turn ons, right under \"muscularity.\"  Favorites actually had a lot of food listed.  Was she a chef?  A gourmet?  Jason reached the \"history\" tab and would have done a spit take if he had been taking a drink.  Instead of just the current model of Donna being displayed there were five or her, each displaying a year under them, counting backward.  Just four years ago Donna had been a pudgy girl with ENORMOUS breasts and suddenly Jason remembered her with shocking clarity.  SHE had been the big boobed girl who he saw a few times every summer.  No wonder he could barely remember her name yesterday, she was almost unrecognizable.  Jason selected the Donna from four years ago and let out a low whistle, she had been a hefty girl but she had been rocking almost G cup breasts.  He backed out to the history tab again and marveled at how much hard work Donna must have put into molding her body in the last few years.  He flicked over another tab labeled \"body image\" and was startled to see three models.  One was very much the way Donna had been four years ago, one was similar to the way Donna looked now and one labeled \"ideal\" was taller, much more muscular and stacked with G cup breasts like the \"old\" Donna.  Jason grimaced as he heard the fabric around his zipper begin to tear as he was apparently more than a little excited at the ideal Donna.  He looked away and concentrated on math again until he thought he was under control.  He checked his watch and frowned, still nearly an hour before Donna would be over.  He really should put this phone down and not give in to the temptation to screw with things further.  After all he was going to have a hard enough time explaining to Donna how he had packed on nearly a hundred pounds of muscle since she had last seen him.  He could still see Sara and Anna looking awkwardly at him and hearing the question \"Are you... bigger?\"  He looked at \"ideal\" Donna and tried telling himself that he had to leave well enough alone.  Donna was plenty hot as she was already.  Wasn't she?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason couldn't resist, once the thought was in his head he couldn't not try to turn the tall lean hardbody in the other half of the duplex into a taller, buffer, bustier version of herself.  Jason selected Donna's \"ideal\" model and quickly scanned through the features, repeatedly distracted by his \"other head\" which seemed to be displaying a mind of its own while he skimmed through the available options until he came to one marked \"apply template to current model.\"  Jason paused to unzip his pants and adjust his boxers before his stiffening member wrecked the clothes he was wearing and he returned to the app.  \"Yes apply,\" he hissed under his breath as he stabbed the button.  He gave up any illusion that his rational brain was in control at all any more, this was all his other head and he was happy to let it take charge.  An array of choices appeared and Jason read through them impatiently, trying to find the fastest way to transform his imminent date into a busty amazon.  Suddenly he forced himself to slow down and read \"transformation triggers.\"  His mind was whirring as he selected this one and read through the options.  Yes, this would be MUCH hotter if he could see her transform.  If he changed her now he wouldn't see it, hell he might even scare her so badly she wouldn't show up for the date.  He scrolled through the available triggers and grinned as one jumped out at him.  \"Semen ingestion.\"  He selected it and quickly verified his suspicion, he could select a specific mans semen as the trigger.  He entered his name and verified his data appeared before applying the changes.  \"There,\" he said triumphantly as he watched the progress bar slowly crawl across the bottom of the screen to 100% applied.   \"This way she'll transform when I can see it and it will be in a controlled environment.\"  He pictured them making love in his bed and her body growing under his exploring hands.  He had to shake the image from his head and force himself to relax enough to zip up his pants.  Donna's model showed that she was now dressed in a strapless black dress that showed off her cleavage and muscular arms to full effect and it was short and tight enough to leave very little to the imagination.  He glanced at his watch just as the doorbell rang.  7:01.  Jason stashed the phone in his drawer, zipped up his pants and raced to the front door.  \"I need to be confident,\" he told himself before he opened the door, fighting down an another unexpected onset of the jitters.  \"She'll be blown away when she sees me, this will be easy.\"  Jason threw the door open with a breezy, \"Hey there,\" and suppressed a smirk at Donna's sharp intake of breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hey,\" she stammered back,\" suddenly hesitant and obviously self conscious.  She caught herself staring directly at the muscular cleavage Jason had on display and quickly looked away with her cheeks reddening.  Jason silently applauded himself for his wardrobe choice.  He put his arms around her, pulling her in close enough to give her a peck on the forehead but also to make sure he rubbed the silk of his shirt against her bare skin wherever possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you, I was worried you were going to stand me up,\" Jason wasn't even sure why he said that, he smiled to cover up how awkward he suddenly felt but Donna blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm really excited to...\" she hesitated and started again, \"I mean I've been looking forward to...,\" she stopped again as Jason chuckled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, me too.\"  He kissed her forehead again and stepped back, holding her at arms length.  \"You look great, and I'm starved,\" both of these statements were true, \"let's go somewhere nice and get some food.\"  Donna smiled warmly and allowed Jason to steer her down the front walk towards the shared driveway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, who's driving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't actually have a car,\" Jason said, faltering for the first time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no problem, we can take mine,\"  Donna dug her keys out of her purse and Jason held her door open for her.  Whatever worries he had during his momentary fumble vanished in the light of her thousand watt smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe evening flew by.  Jason and Donna chatted easily once they got settled in at the restaurant and surprisingly (or maybe not since they seemed to have grown up int the same area) they had a lot in common.  Donna's conversation did seem to drift back often to food, including offering commentary on the food they were eating and her enthusiasm wasn't just centered on eating, it seemed that she had interest in becoming a chef one day.  Jason was genuinely enjoying her company and he was glad he hadn't just taken her to his bed to have sex.  Though the longer the night went on the more he was looking forward to that part as well.  It wasn't even a question of \"if,\" he knew from the looks she had been giving him as well as her body language that she could barely wait to have sex with him.  And the last bloom of warmth in his chest had put the top button of his shirt at such a strain that shortly before the waiter dropped the check off it had popped off, pinging across Donna's plate.  She had looked at him with nearly unbridled lust in her eyes and blushed.  Jason smiled at her before turning to the check, putting money in the small folder with the receipt, calculating the tip and adding that as well before snapping it shut and pushing it across the table.  He did a double take.  Where had Donna gone?  The ladies room probably.  He had just convinced himself that this must be where she had vanished to when  he felt hands fumbling with the zipper to his pants and he gasped as his penis was suddenly released from the confines of his clothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...\" Donna's voice hissed from under the table, \"I don't normally do something like this but I can't seem to help myself, just relax.\"  Jason's mind churned with the realization of what was about to happen as Donna put her lips over the tip of his cock and stroked him deftly with her tongue.  He shuddered, trying to figure out how to talk her out of this, knowing as soon as she swallowed his sperm things were going to quickly become very different.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, I think we should probably wait to do that..,\" he gasped as he felt her remove her lips from his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, don't make a scene, I want you to enjoy this,\" his knuckles turned white as he clenched the end of the table in reaction to her wrapping her mouth around his shaft again.  Jason was frozen in fear, trying as hard as he could to hold back the increasing tide of his arousal.  He smiled awkwardly when the waiter came to take the check and tried to avoid eye contact when the server cleared the table while Jason nursed his ice water.  Everytime he thought he would be able to distract himself enough not to cum Donna upped the ante, eventually settling on a buzzing hum that arose from deep in her throat as she managed to get almost his entire shaft down her throat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, I don't think this is a good idea,\" he muttered, startled when a piece of the table snapped off in his hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-one can see me, the tablecloth is too low to the ground, now RELAX,\" Donna hissed.  Jason arched his back as Donna renewed her humming, sucking and tonguing.  Finally it was too much for him to handle and he let go, all caution gone, washed away by the overwhelming waves of orgasm.  Donna sputtered momentarily but managed to swallow the copious amounts of ejaculate.  Jason slowly forced himself to relax and assume a more normal posture as Donna tucked him back into his pants and zipped him up.  Maybe everything would be ok.  Maybe his horny dabblings with the app wouldn't work the way he though.  He allowed himself to think this for maybe two seconds before Donna let out an audible moan and the sounds of ripping cloth became audible from under the table.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Donna?\" Jason called out. It had been a good thirty seconds since Donna's moaning had subsided. She'd gotten fairly loud at one point, so much so that people at other tables has started to look his way. Jason had tried to play it off and look around as if he too didn't know the source of the mysterious moaning, but people seemed to just know. \"Donna, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" came her response. Jason noticed right away that her voice was a bit deeper and more sultry; his penis twitched at the mere sound and he had to make sure to remain focused to keep it from hardening again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" he asked, playing dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" she said again. \"I can't believe it. I just had the most insane orgasm of my life. And, well, I've... changed. Hang on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could hear her moving, then the table popped up about a foot. \"Oops!\" Donna said. \"Not much room under here.\" This was followed by the table jerking again and nearly falling over. All eyes in the restaurant were on Jason again. He just smiled and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Donna emerged and got to her feet. The sight of her caused Jason to lose his meager control over his erection which leapt to attention and began attempting to rip through his pants. It was a quick, absentminded adjustment that saved Jason from exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she noticed that all eyes were on her Donna became very self conscious. Her cheeks went red and she had a sheepish smile on her face. She gave Jason a look that clearly pleaded with him to stand so they could leave. Jason, however, was a bit checked out at the moment. Before him stood a gorgeous goddess of strength and sexuality and it was taking his mind some time to recalibrate. Donna's increase in height had pulled her dress apart into three sections. The top section was a thin strip that wrapped around her bust and did very little to hide her breasts, but did cover her nipples. Jason realized with a sense of amazement that Donna hadn't been wearing a bra. The center section was around her middle and wrapped so tight that it may as well have been see through. There were tears in various places that exposed her tanned skin below, but nowhere was skin more on display than just above and just below this section of dress where the undersides of her breasts were on display and her abs, stomach and obliques were bare. The bottom section of her dress was around her hips and looked like a micro mini skirt. Shockingly Donna's privates remained covered, though barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired of waiting for Jason to stand and escort her out she loudly cleared her throat. Jason snapped back to reality and leapt to his feet. He put his arm around her middle and lead her out of the restaurant. The whole room was silent as the two giants made their way between tables to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got into Donna's car and she drove them back to the duplex in silence. Jason kept wanting to say something, but he could never figure out what. His penis's base desires had gotten the better of him and now this innocent girl had paid the price, she'd been mortified. He simply stared out the window and refused to allow himself glimpses of her new spectacular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last they pulled into the driveway of the duplex that Jason's family shared with Donna's. Jason was about to just apologize and be on his way, he'd even opened his mouth to speak, when he was interrupted by the sound of laughter. At first it was a light chuckle but it quickly rolled into fits of uncontrolled howling laughter. Jason looked at Donna who had one hand on her cheek and tears running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she turned to Jason. \"Oh my god, right?\" She looked down at her own body, then tensed her arms watching newly expanded biceps swell with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't help but smile, even laugh along with Donna. The whole experience was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Donna continued leveling her finger in Jason's face, \"you have a lot of explaining to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to play innocent. \"Me? I don't know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!\" Donna was serious, but still grinning from ear to ear. \"I may have had my doubts about what's been happening to you but this certainly confirms my suspicions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What suspicions are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb, I know how smart you are. And I'm not an idiot either. Your muscles. Every time I see you you're bigger. And not just a little, you went from large to massive overnight. I had doubts because it didn't seem possible and, well, when I'm around you I feel... you make me..\" She drifted off overwhelmed for a moment by Jason's powerful pheromone scent. Then she forced herself out of her drunken state. \"Besides, you haven't asked me once about how I seem to have turned into She Hulk over here. Any normal person would have lost their mind, which tells me you know something about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was going to deny her accusations when he felt a familiar warmth spread through his chest and onto the rest of his body. It was as if his own body was betraying him and signaling out to Donna that she was right because while two pounds of extra bulk didn't sound like much, it must have been the straw that broke the camel's back when it came to his shirt. For a split second he could feel his sleeves cinch up around his arms then the fabric simply let go and splits formed around the peak of his biceps opening up towards his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna laughed. \"See, you can't help yourself. You're growing right here in front of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled the front of his shirt open snapping the buttons off. Since he had no plans of ever wearing this shirt again he didn't care about ruining it. He tried to slide his arms out of the sleeves but found maneuvering in Donna's car far too cumbersome and instead just began ripping whole chunks of fabric off until his torso was bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not mad,\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad? Of course not! Look at me!\" Donna squeezed her teardrop shaped breasts causing soft flesh to ooze between her fingers. \"I look incredible! And I've always wanted to beef up my body, but I've never had the time to really dedicate myself to bodybuilding.\" She bent her arm upward and flexed her bicep. Her arm swelled until it was a solid 18 inches around. \"Oh, wow! Kayaking would never build arms like this, not in a million years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna opened her car door and stood up. She raised her hands to the sky and stretched her whole body. Jason watched with fascination as the muscles across her whole body came alive and danced under her skin. Jason got out of the car as well and the pair met in front. No longer in shock Jason was able to really notice just how tall Donna was. Before she'd grown she could look him in the eye with little trouble. She was probably 6 feet to his 6 feet 1 inch. Now, Jason was 6 foot 2 inches (on his way to 7 feet tall) and he had to look up to meet her eyes. Jason guessed she was now 6 foot 5, maybe taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna bent over so she could look around her huge boobs and examined the rest of her body. Noticing the way her dress had torn apart she removed the center section making it look like she was wearing a very oddly shaped bikini. She tossed the scraps of her dress to the ground and then sat on the hood of her car, guiding Jason in between her thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going to spill the beans on how you got so big? I'm sure I could figure out some sort of payment for your information.\" Donna tensed her chest and back causing the thin strip of fabric that remained across her bust to tighten. Her breasts began to spread around the top and bottom of the rags, but then they popped off leaving her topless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched Donna's gorgeous G cup breasts sway and jiggle slightly with her breath. Moments later his fully erect, 18 inch penis tore through his pants and underwear as an answer to Donna's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took his enormous member into her hands and guided it toward her lips, but paused when it was half an inch away. Jason could feel her hot breath on the head of his cock and knew he was going to tell her something. He just wasn't sure if he should be truthful or not. Perhaps it would be best to make something up, but what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason almost told her about the app, he opened his mouth intending to, but how would she react if he did?  Would she want to use it on herself more?  Use it on him?  Anyone else?  Jason knew first hand how compelling it was to want to change things once you knew you had the ability.  So instead of the truth he said, \"I've been taking experimental growth supplements.  Took all of them actually,\" he specified, cutting Donna off before she asked the obvious question about whether or not he still had any.  \"I wasn't supposed to, so I'm not 100% sure how it's going to end.\"  This statement was at least partially true.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was obvious skepticism in Donna's eyes but he realized it wasn\u2019t about his story as soon as she opened her mouth again.  \u201cSo you don\u2019t have ANY of this experimental supplement left at all?  Not even a tiny bit?\u201d  She flicked her tongue across the sensitive tip of his manhood to punctuate the question.  Jason\u2019s body shivered at the feeling but he firmly shook his head.  Donna pouted momentarily then grinned mischievously.  \u201cWhat happens if I drink some more straight from the source then?\u201d  She ran her tongue around the tip, the feathery soft touch sending sparks of tingling sensation throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Jason answered honestly.  He had linked her achieving the physical embodiment of her mental ideal self to ingesting his sperm.  If that ideal model changed in her mind and she sucked him off again what would happen?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I would love,\u201d she paused to wrap her lips around the tip and pulled her mouth away with an audible pop, \u201cto grow,\u201d she did it again, punctuating her speech with repeated sucking motions, \u201ceven bigger,\u201d another slurp and pop made Jason\u2019s knees wobble, \u201cand bigger,\u201d slurp, pop, \u201cand bigger\u2026\u201d  Jason put his hands on her shoulders and gently pushed her away.  The car groaned as her shifting body rested more weight on it.  He was distracted by the string of saliva and pre cum still connecting her mouth to his unit and her uninhibited wide eyed smile of lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonna,\u201d he began, distracted this time by a car driving by that obviously realized there were two mostly naked giants in some stage of sexual activity.  The car swerved, brakes and tires squealing as it almost hit a mailbox then the tires screeched again at it took off into the night.  \u201cDonna,\u201d he repeated, after he looked back at her, \u201cI think we should continue this conversation inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough seemingly impossible Donna\u2019s grin grew even wider.  \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d she leaned down to pick up the torn remnants of her dress off the driveway then all but skipped towards Jason\u2019s front door.  \u201cC\u2019mon stud, my aunt\u2019s place isn\u2019t an option, I share a bedroom wall with her and she\u2019s a light sleeper.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leaned in to unlock the front door (he didn\u2019t see his mom\u2019s car so he assumed she was out) and Donna wrapped her arms around him, rubbing her body against his.  The feeling of her breasts rubbing against his chest was distracting enough, her hands running over his crotch and along his thighs made it almost impossible to concentrate enough to turn the key in the lock.  Finally the door swung open and they all but fell into the house.  Donna giggled as Jason turned to close the door, before he realized what she was doing she had peeled his pants from his body like a banana peel, the cloth shredding almost effortlessly.  She grabbed his shoulders and spun him back to face her before she proceeded to vigorously kiss him.  Jason\u2019s heart hammered in his chest, and not just from arousal, there was a brief thrill of fear where he wondered if Donna might actually be stronger than him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies were wrapped tightly around each other as each of their hands roamed aggressively.  Following her lead Jason tore the remnants of her dress away from her crotch along with her panties with one motion.  She broke off their kiss long enough to gasp with pleasure as his finger rubbed across the lips of her already wet pussy.  He was trying to maneuver their wild groping towards his bedroom as she wrapped a leg around his waist, pulling him close to her as she ground herself against his raging erection.  They bumped into the counter by the kitchen entrance as they passed it and something fell to the floor with a bang.  Whatever it was was ignored.  A picture frame crashed to the floor as they attempted to climb the stairs.  For a moment forward progress ceased when Donna fell on the stairs and Jason hovered over her, ready to give up trying to get to the bedroom and just go at it here but as though reading his mind she grabbed his member and adjusted its aim.  \u201cNuh-uh,\u201d she breathed, \u201cno rug burns tonight thank you very much.\u201d  Without a word Jason scooped her up and bodily carried Donna the rest of the way, she squealed as he tossed her down onto his bed.  He was so turned on he could barely think but for some reason he thought it would be a good idea to excuse himself momentarily to use the app.  Why did that seem like a good idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna lay down, arching her back and undulating her hips while she grinned up at him.  \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the moment their bodies touched all thought left them. They were a tangle of hands and lips and tongues and the soft friction of skin on skin. It wasn't romantic; it wasn't even sex. It was just pure feral desire. Jason's massive cock throbbed as she ground against it, slathering her in precum, yet every time he tried to thrust into her that lithe body squirmed sexily against him and made him miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's lust for Donna may have consumed his better judgment, but Donna's lust for power overcame her lust for the Adonis before her. With her tall, strong body, she suddenly flipped them over and pinned Jason under her. With a thrill of excitement she realized that she was holding down Jason's arms: she was stronger than him! Keeping his wrists pinned, Donna slid her long body down his, her massive breasts and hard nipples caressing every inch of his muscular frame. Finally she wrapped her lips around Jason's dick and began to suck. She released his arms to hold his hips as she licked and sucked for all she was worth. This was not for his pleasure; it was for hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo overwhelmed by the sensation to do anything more, Jason tangled his fingers in her long hair and moaned his approval as she sucked him. He could already feel his orgasm approaching, but by the time the signals reached his brain he was already over the edge. Jason couldn't even scream, just rasp helplessly as an unbelievably massive flood of cum rushed from him. Donna cooed softly between swallows, making sure that she got every last drop. She crawled back up his body and held him close in a loving embrace, staring into his eyes. Then her body began to quiver and stretch...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm not waiting for anything,\" Jason said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had been briefly worried that after losing his virginity to not one but two girls that making love to just one would be boring.  The concern was very brief.  Donna was anything but boring in the sack.  Her imagination, creativity and drive to perform were unbelievable.  It felt like they were made for each other and as the two made love LONG into the night he momentarily had the curious thought, \u201cI wonder if this is how it felt for Sara and Anna when they fucked me?\u201d  He didn\u2019t have to hold back at all for fear of hurting her, it was as though she was his equal in nearly ever way, stamina, strength, again he wondered if she might be stronger than him but he reasoned that by the time he was done growing he\u2019d completely eclipse her.  For now he couldn\u2019t get enough of running his hands over her prominent muscles and caressing her spectacular breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled over on his back and Donna rose up over him, straddling his cock and gasping with pleasure at every twitch of his hips.  It blew his mind that he was able to bottom out his somewhat oversized penis in her.  As much fun as it had been with Sara and Anna last night he hadn\u2019t let himself go this deep in either of them for fear of hurting them.  If Donna was feeling any pain she was ignoring it, her own hips rocked with a need and intensity that made it hard to believe that she had already had more orgasms tonight than she could keep track of.  Hours had passed since they started and Jason still could not get enough of touching her magnificent body, running his hands over it, squeezing her mammoth breasts, tweaking her thumb sized nipples.  She was screaming his name, in the throes of another intense orgasm and Jason leaned back and closed his eyes, letting himself go again.  If he had stopped to think about it he would have realized that he had no idea how many orgasms he had had either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lay there panting, opening his eyes when he felt Donna getting up off his shaft.  She lowered herself back down, straddling his thighs as her hands ran slowly up and down his shaft which was once again rising to the occasion.  \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d she said after a minute.  \u201cI have never even HEARD of anyone like you before.\u201d  Jason lay his head back on his pillow, looking at the ceiling and enjoying the slow pleasurable stroking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can say the same thing,\u201d he said finally.  Donna responded with a snicker.  \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019m serious, ever since I saw you the other day I thought you were amazing.  Heck, I think I\u2019ve had a crush on you since I was in junior high.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna outright laughed this time.  \u201cNo you did not.  I was so fat back then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously,\u201d Jason put his arm behind his head so he could look at Donna again.  \u201cThere was always something about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was always \u201cthese\u201d about me,\u201d Donna said, stopping her stroking to heft her breasts.  \u201cI think they might actually be bigger now than they were back then,\u201d she said after a moment.  She let them drop and Jason happily watched them bob and sway as Donna went back to feeling up his manhood.  \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I LIKED, having big boobs, but I hated being fat.  It took me forever to lose all that weight, I had to give up eating so much food I loved.  And I hated how much smaller my boobs got, but I liked being in shape you know?\u201d  She looked down at Jason and laughed again.  \u201cOf course you know.\u201d  She flexed an arm and marveled at the peak.  \u201cThis is pretty unbelievable, I mean this is pretty much the body I always dreamed of having.  Is it weird that now I want to be even bigger?\u201d  Jason mumbled something non-committal, he felt like he was about to fall asleep.  \u201cI guess that\u2019s just human nature though, you get what you wanted and decide it\u2019s not enough so you want even more.  She hefted her breasts again, then paused for a moment to look around Jasons room.  \u201cThere it is, I thought I saw this earlier.\u201d  Jason was half asleep now but he watched as she leaned over towards his dresser and came back holding a bottle of hand lotion.  She squirted a handful into her hands and began spreading it across her breasts.  Jason thought he knew where this was going and he approved whole heartedly.  \u201cI mean can you imagine how I would look if I were even more muscular?\u201d  Donna continued as she slid Jasons cock between her breasts and squeezed them together with her hands.  \u201cI can and it turns me on, you\u2019re so lucky.\u201d  Jason moaned softly at the sensation of her slick breasts clamped around his dick.  She began to raise and lower her breasts and he bucked his hips slowly in the same rhythm.  \u201cI mean you\u2019re still growing aren\u2019t you?\u201d  As though on cue Jason could feel the now familiar slow bloom of warmth pulse through his body.  Donna obviously felt it, \u201csee?\u201d  She laughed and Jason sleepily joined in.  A few moments passed in relative silence as Jason could feel an impending orgasm forming deep in his loins.  \u201cI really hope this works,\u201d Donna said finally.  Jason forced his eye to open as he felt Donna lips wrap around the head of his penis.  She was sucking for all she worth while her tongue aggressively massaged as far as it could reach.  It was like opening the floodgates, the slow and seemingly endless build up to orgasm was gone and suddenly he was coming, probably harder than ever had in his life up to this point.  Even if he had wanted to stop Donna from drinking his cum it was already past the point of no return.  When it was over he was gasping for breath and looking at Donna with a feeling of impending doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was why I wanted to stop and use the app,\u201d he suddenly thought.  \u201cSo I could remove all doubt regarding what would happen if Donna sucks me off again.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hours of love making or not, the fact that he had just come YET AGAIN or not, he was SO turned on by the fact that was growing in his hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna writhed in ecstasy as she ran her hands over her growing body.  Eventually the growth slowed to a stop and Jason had no idea how big she now was, probably close to four hundred pounds.  \"Seventh inning stretch is over big guy,\" Donna eased herself back down onto his shaft.  \"Let's see if we can take this into extra innings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night and into the morning passed in a blur of sex.  Jason was sure that he now understood how Sara and Anna had felt the other night, not being able to keep with him.  He thought for a bit that he would be able to keep with her new strength and stamina but eventually he found himself slowing down, something that she was showing no signs of doing.  He literally passed out at one point and he knew Donna had continued her frenzied lovemaking.  He finally fell asleep sprawled across her massive body, cupping one of her huge boobs in hand.  She was still grinning widely at him, she hadn\u2019t stopped grinning since she had started her second growth spurt.  \u201cThis has been the best date EVER!\u201d  Was the last thing he heard her say as he drifted into slumber.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up to his phone ringing, a clock that told him it was almost noon and a lipstick note on his bedroom mirror that said , \"I gotta run, we'll have to do this again soon.\"  The note was punctuated with kiss mark and a line of Xs and Os.  He finally answered the phone.  \"Hey you, ready for that day together that you promised me?\" He had to look at the phone to see who was calling.  Sara Auster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea stud, so how \u2018bout it?  Want to meet me on the beach?  We don\u2019t have to stay there long if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said in a low playful tone that clearly spelled out she would be perfectly happy if they went back to her place and proceeded to fuck her brains out the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat up and stretched.

He was feeling fairly sore from his adventures with the ever growing Donna the night before and he was seriously considering a calm night at home. Then he pictured Sara in his mind, her tight little body alive with well defined muscles, the way she was surprisingly strong for her size and used her power to please him in every way she could think of, and the fact that she was ditching her boyfriend to be with him. Jason had been jealous of Greg for years and suddenly becoming the more desirable man felt better than he would have imagined. Jason caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and marveled over his sheer mass. A man with a body like his didn't need to rest, he could easily power through the soreness and run a marathon if he felt like it. In the end, though, it was the fact that Jason was a gentleman that kept him from putting his date off, he had told Sara he would spend time with her and that was exactly what he was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm up for it. How could I ever say no to spending time with a sexy woman like yourself.\" Jason said. He felt better already and wondered if his body was capable of healing faster or his improvement was all in his head. \"I'll admit, though, I just woke up and I have a few things to do, but they shouldn't take long. I can meet you at the beach around two, by tower 15?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to wait?\" Sara mock complained. \"I hope you have something in mind to make up for it. You should never keep a lady waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially a lady as gorgeous as yourself, but I have about ten things in mind that'll make you forget your own name much less that you had to wait for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long moment before Sara responded and Jason could practically feel her excitement over the phone. \"Okay, super stud. Two o'clock. Don't be late or I'll have to punish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason said his goodbyes and hung up his phone. He leapt into the air to celebrate his good fortune but regretted it when he landed and the floor audibly groaned beneath his feet. Jason nervously laughed and tried to imagine himself crashing through the floor to the first level. He knew he wasn't heavy enough to have to worry about that yet, but what about when he reached his max weight of nearly 600 hundred pounds that would be a real possibility. He reminded himself he needed to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about his current weight Jason went to the bathroom and stepped on the scale. It reported his weight at 358 pounds. Jason was about to step down when he felt a dull warmth flow from his chest to the rest of his body. The scale clicked up to an even 360 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at himself in the mirror. \"Fucking incredible.\" He put his hands on his hips and flexed his pecs and lats. A wall of sinew spread out in all directions and Jason's reflection filled the mirror from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've still got another 220 pounds coming my way,\" he told his beefy reflection. \"That's like adding another fairly large man's mass to what I've already got. This is going to be insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went back to his room and found some of the clothes he'd bought the day before. He found one of the larger sets and pulled on shorts and a tank top. He only had one set bigger, and he would likely outgrow those by the following afternoon. He made a mental note to get more soon then went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told Sara he had a few things to do, bin that wasn't entirely the truth. Jason just knew he wanted to take a little time to let his body recover from the insane night he'd had with Donna, and already much of the soreness was fading or gone. He rounded the corner into the kitchen and spotted his mother sitting at the table eating a sandwich. He didn't feel like explaining the extra 200 pounds of muscle he now wore so he about faced and headed for the garage calling a greeting back over his shoulder who responded with a \"good morning\" of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the garage Jason locked the door and rummaged around looking for his dad's old weight bench. He was unable to find it buried under all the junk that was piled high, but he did find several 50 pound plates. He was pleased to note that whereas a few days ago he would have struggled to lift even one of those plates today he was able to hold a stack of four of them with little trouble. He shifted them to one hand and held them like a servers tray in his palm. He still found little trouble hefting them so discarded them. He looked around for something else to test his strength but found nothing. So instead he dropped to the floor and began doing push-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could probably count the number of push-ups he'd done in the last several years on one hand, but today he could pump them out like they were nothing. He started slow then went faster once he felt sure of his form and power. Then he slowed again to revel in the fact that they were so easy. He didn't really have a goal, he just figured he would keep going until he was tired. However, Jason quickly reached 500 push-ups and felt no strain so he began using one hand. A hundred later he switched to the other hand then back again a hundred later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason counted his push-ups all the way to 5,000 before he decided to stop. Amazingly he still wasn't feeling even a bit of strain, if anything he felt more energized and all the soreness from the night before was gone. He felt incredible, invincible even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glanced at the clock on the wall and saw that it was past one o'clock. He'd been doing nothing but push-ups for about an hour. He made his way upstairs (taking care to avoid being spotted by his mother) and went into the bathroom to shower before meeting with Sara. He peeled off his shirt and caught his reflection in the mirror. His upper body had received a significant pump from his exercise and now his pectorals were completely engorged and shredded while the veins in his arms and all risen to the surface and formed a roadmap beneath the surface of his skin. He flexed his biceps and his arms swelled to 25 inches around with a thick, snakelike vein running across the top of the peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head with disbelief then squeezed into the shower. He quickly realized that he would probably need to find an alternate solution to bathing very soon, but for now he was just able to manage to clean himself off. After the shower Jason redressed and lay on his bed. He still had more than half an hour before he was meeting Sara and his eyes quickly returned to the dresser where he'd hidden Laura's iPhone. He pulled it out and opened the Alterations app to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was tempted to open Sara\u2019s profile and check her out, but then he remembered the way his brain had been overruled by his penis with Donna and while things had ended up pretty spectacular they had also gotten out of hand and could have been much worse. But he was till bored and was determined to search through the app to kill time so he played it safe and opened his own profile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe skipped through the menus designed to change his physical body (since he was not only satisfied with himself but his current changes were locked in) and brought up his mental profile. He toured around the different pages and found some pretty strange ones. There was one that showed his current emotions in a large bar graph that kept changing in real time. His joy and excitement levels were high to begin with, and once on the menu his surprise level shot way up. Then it shot up again. Jason noted that every reading was positive and he was practically devoid of any negative emotions. This was not news to him, but it was still neat to receive confirmation and this chart could be interesting when viewing others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tapped on a button with a picture of a brain on it and was greeted with a 3D model of a brain with various areas lit up in different colors. The activity was constantly changing and colors sparked through different areas of the brain like lightning riding through predetermined conduits. There were various stats and figures, but Jason didn\u2019t know what most of them meant. They seemed to be communicating brain activity similar to the colors, but Jason couldn\u2019t be sure. There was one number he recognized, though, his IQ was posted at the top. He smiled when he noticed it was 122, which placed him pretty well above average. There were arrows on either side of the reading that allowed him to adjust his IQ, and he tapped himself up to 130. Then he shrugged and added another 10 IQ points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo harm in upping the old brain power, right?\u201d Jason said aloud. He saw that now at 140 IQ the colors on the brain model were brighter, larger, and shot around the interior of the brain with greater activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled and scrolled down. He came across a list of the five senses with slides next to each. All of his setting were right in the middle except for his eyesight which was a bit below the rest. He adjusted this slider up to give himself superior eyesight. Jason scrolled down again and found a listing that made his eyes go wide. It read \u201cExtra Sensory Perception\u201d and there were several sliders underneath that listed off several abilities like \u201ctelekinesis,\u201d \u201chyper intuition,\u201d and \u201cmind reading.\u201d All of these slider were set at zero and a line beneath each read \u201cno latent ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s mouth was dry. He knew that if he were to switch back to the emotions graph that his excitement and nervous levels would probably be off the chart. Could he really expand his mind to include superpowers? It was too incredible, he had to try at least one of the abilities listed. Slowly he placed his finger on the \u201cmind reading\u201d slider. He moved it up a third of the way. The phone processed for a moment then the \u201cno latent ability\u201d line changed to \u201cable to pick up some images and words.\u201d Jason pushed the slider further until it read \u201cable to pick up complete thoughts/feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded, that would be good enough for now. He sucked in a deep breath and tapped the \u201capply\u201d button. Very quickly he could feel a searing heat build in his head as though he had a very sudden and very serious fever. The heat was very real and quite painful and Jason could feel sweat materialize on his brow almost instantly. His hands shot to his temples as though he needed to hold in brains in and keep them from exploding, but just when he thought he wasn\u2019t going to be able to stand another second the heat vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat up on his bed and tried to catch his breath. Instantly he could tell that his eyesight was much improved and he could read the tiny print on a movie poster clear across his room. His thoughts also felt clearer and more focused as though his mind had been categorized in a more efficient way and could process more information faster. Jason was happy for these things, but it was his new power he really wanted to test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment his mother was still in the house so Jason tried to reach out and find her mind with his. He tried for several minutes before he decided that he must be too far away. Perhaps with the ability slider all the way at the top he would be able to hear her, but not with his power as it was. He got up and made his way downstairs. He found his mother sitting in the living room watching TV. Before he even realized what he was doing he heard her singing a song, but her lips were perfectly still. That was when he realized that he had done it, he was reading her mind! He stood still and listened with another set of ears that he didn\u2019t even know he had and found he was able to make out complete thoughts in her head. She was thinking about some shopping she had to do later in the day as well as cursing herself for the song stuck in her head. Jason then noticed that her mood shifted a bit when her soap opera came back on and his mother was filled with both envy of the girls on screen and lust for the men. As soon as his mother began imagining the leading actor nude Jason withdrew his mind from hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve got to be careful, Jason thought to himself, you never really know what you\u2019re going to find in people\u2019s minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned and headed for the back door that led to the beach. He called a farewell to his mother and let her know he\u2019d be back later on. Then he practically skipped his way across the sand towards lifeguard tower number 15 where he had arranged to meet Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time Jason had been for a walk on the beach he\u2019d turned heads and garnered stares from all over. That had been two days ago. He was now two inches taller and carried more than a hundred extra pounds of muscle. This time he didn\u2019t just turn heads he stopped people dead in their tracks. As he went he would occasionally take a quick peak into some of his spectators\u2019 minds. A few people were turned off by his size, but most of the women (and one or two of the men) wanted to jump him and feel his rock hard muscles and enormous cock. Everyone, however, was in complete awe of Jason\u2019s impossible mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jason spotted his destination and the blond haired beauty that was his date was awaiting his arrival.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason pulled up Sara\u2019s profile without even having a clear idea of what he intended to alter.  He smiled when he saw that she was now wearing a much more revealing two piece swimsuit than the last time he saw her.  Instead of the one piece that artfully exposed her shredded abs she was wearing a tiny thong and string bikini combo that exposed\u2026 well it exposed damn near everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason knew that one of the first things he would have to do would be to somehow explain to Sara how he had gained another fifty pounds of muscle or so since the last time he saw her, he could still vividly remember her suspicion the last time.  That train of thought led him to remember his lie about growth supplements he had told Donna which led him to remember Donna\u2019s growth spurts last night which led to him getting another raging erection.  The love making last night had been incredible, if he wanted to get an experience like that out of Sara there would have to be some changes.  But how?  Just making her change out of the blue would be disorientating for her and probably lead to questions he didn\u2019t want to answer.  Making his sperm a growth serum again had its appeal but that would be another hard sell, she and Anna had both sucked him off the other day with no consequence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped over to Donna\u2019s profile while he was thinking.  He raised his eyebrows when he saw that Donna was currently six foot eight and nearly three hundred and ninety pounds of solid muscle and feminine curves.  He flicked over to her mental image tab and would have done a spit take if he had liquid in his mouth.  Donna\u2019s next \u201cideal\u201d image was pushing twelve feet tall and weighed half a ton.  \u201cTime to nip that in that bud before it gets out of control,\u201d Jason said, clearing the transformation triggers from Donna\u2019s profile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going back to Sara\u2019s profile he went back to his own and selected his unit.  He was beginning to get frustrated with always being on the verge of destroying his underwear, shorts and pants.  There had to be something he could do to make that more manageable.  Shrinking it wasn\u2019t really an option, Sara was already intimately familiar with his prodigious size, he would have to find another solution\u2026  After a moment he selected \u201carousal\u201d and was unsurprised to find it set on \u201cauto.\u201d   He flicked it to \u201cmanual\u201d and chose \u201cmental\u201d over \u201cphysical\u201d assuming it meant that he would now be able to control his wardrobe wrecking wang with his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to Sara he decided the first thing he needed to be able to change was her ability to take his manhood.  Not having to hold back for fear of hurting her was of the highlights of his evening with Donna.  So were the boobs he thought after a moment, remembering the epic tit-fuck he had received.  He boosted Sara\u2019s breasts larger, not as big as Donna, or even Anna, but big enough where he would be able to reenact what may have been the highlight of last nights fun.  Jason spent a moment considering Sara\u2019s body and in all reality there wasn\u2019t anything else he wanted to change. Her lean, tight body was already incredible; boosting her muscle size would make her too much like Donna and he firmly believed that variety was the spice of life.  Jason scrolled through more options, now focusing on changing things other than her physical appearance.  He boosted her strength, stamina to more closely match his own, and then on a whim he increased her flexibility to nearly the top of the scale.  The question now was what to use as the transformation trigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glanced at the time, twenty to two, is he wanted to get to the beach to meet her in time he was going to have to wrap this up quickly.  Thinking back again to his growth supplement lie he raided the medicine cabinet in the bathroom for one of his mothers daily multivitamins and ground it up with a handful of sugary candy hard candy.  He selected \u201cspecific substance\u201d for the transformation trigger and took a picture of the mixed powders in a plastic baggie.  Reviewing what he had done it appeared like this would work.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before putting on the Speedo he tested his mental control over his penis, quickly willing it to full attention then willing it soft again.  He breathed a sigh of relief; there was no way he was going to put on this diminutive Speedo if he was going to be in constant danger of popping out of it.  He pulled a pair of cut off jean shorts on over the Speedo, tugged a snug fitting tank top over his head, grabbed a beach towel, bottle of sunscreen, shoved the baggie of powders vitamins and into the pocket of his shorts along with his own cell phone and slipped out the back door of his house to avoid his mom.  Verifying the coast was clear he jogged quickly towards where he was supposed to meet Sara, hesitating as he passed Donnas\u2019, hoping for a glimpse of the buffed up Amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara glanced at her watch for what seemed like the millionth time and adjusted herself in the string bikini.  She had never worn one of these before and now that she was she wasn\u2019t very happy with it.  It always felt like it was on the verge of popping off or that she was slipping out of it.  She supposed that was part of the appeal.  She checked her watch again, still five minutes to two.  Sara was riding a virtual roller coaster of hormones and emotion and she desperately hoped Jason wasn\u2019t going to stand her up.  She wasn\u2019t normally even this nervous on first dates, this was a second, she should be past the jitters by now, but nagging doubt kept eating at her.  What if Jason just wasn\u2019t interested enough to come back?  She had no doubt that he could be with any girl he wanted, why would he come back for her?  The fact that she and Greg had argued viciously earlier that morning certainly hadn\u2019t helped.  He had called, trying to apologize for their earlier spat and she had rebuffed him.  He had become predictably nasty and even though she had been expecting it some of the things he said had still injured her pride.  \u201cYour tits are lousy anyway,\u201d said as he was hanging up may have actually been the one that bothered her the most.  She adjusted her top yet again and sighed.  She had always thought that even if they weren\u2019t very large they were at least nicely shaped.  She looked at her watch again and scanned the beach.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason had seen the shadow of someone who could only be Donna pass by one of the back windows of the duplex but he turned away and continued to job towards the beach.  As he approached tower 15 he saw Sara before she noticed him.  She was lounging on a large towel, looking toward the far end of the beach while shading her eyes with her hand.  He paused a few yards away to soak in the finely sculpted body on display, he noticed that he wasn\u2019t the only one; a lot of the guys in the area were sneaking glances in her direction now that she wasn\u2019t looking.  It even appeared that one was working up the courage to go talk to her.  Jason grinned and closed the distance to the edge of her towel before she finally saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reaction was multi-staged, at first she obviously didn\u2019t recognize him but was intrigued, and then she obviously recognized him followed by complete incredulity and even some fear.  \u201cWhoa, how\u2026\u201d Sara sputtered, sitting up stiffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh,\u201d Jason cut Sara off and kneeled down to get eye level with her.  \u201cI\u2019ll explain later, not here though,\u201d he tried what he hoped would be a disarming grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes roved over his body with equal parts lust and curiosity shining in her eyes.  \u201cOk, but it had better be a damn good explanation.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it will be, I think you\u2019ll be pretty satisfied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara finally focused on his eyes, holding him in a stare before finally saying, \u201cI better be.\u201d  She stretched, which Jason enjoyed watching, before nodding her head towards the water.  \u201cWant to swim while we\u2019re here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but first I\u2019d really like it if you ran your hands over every inch of my body for a few minutes first,\u201d he offered her the bottle of sunscreen then stripped down to his Speedo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s eyes homed in on his impossibly large bulge.  \u201cIt would be my pleasure, but there are a few inches I think I\u2019ll leave alone until we\u2019re back at my place.  You also have to promise to take care of me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Jason said with a grin.  The pair spent a few moments rubbing each other down, Sara was obviously very aroused and Jason enjoyed teasing her by allowing his manhood to stiffen just enough to begin peaking out beyond the confines of the Speedo.  By the time they entered the water together she was unsubtly grinding against him, Jason caught the lifeguard at the nearest tower giving them very close scrutiny, either because he was checking out Sara or because he was waiting for the inevitable public indecency bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey swam together for about an hour, even if much of the time was spent with Sara either climbing all over him or him lifting her through the air and/or water like she was weightless while she shrieked with delight Jason still counted it as swimming.  Finally she wrapped herself around him, arms around his neck, legs around his waist, her crotch grinding against his shaft which he allowed to stand near full attention since he was beyond waist deep in the water.  Her lips nibbled his ear and he could barely make out her panted words, \u201cIf you don\u2019t take me home and fuck me RIGHT now, I\u2019m going to go out of my mind.\u201d  Jason carefully untangled her from his body and set her down in the water even as the attentive lifeguard was about to blow his whistle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell when you ask me so nicely how can I say no?\u201d  Jason grinned, \u201cRace you to our stuff?\u201d  Sara was racing through the surf towards her towel before he even finished talking and he laughed, lunging after her.  He could have won, easily, but he liked watching her butt move so he followed at her heels.  They scooped up their clothes and towels in record time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara grabbed his hand and squeezed, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came today, I was worried you weren\u2019t going to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do everything I can to keep my word my lady,\u201d Jason said seriously.  Then he scooped her up in his arms and began to jog towards her apartment.  \u201cYou seem to be in a hurry and this is faster so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara grinned and rested her head against his chest as he ran.  She had the keys to her front door out and ready when they arrived, Jason leaned forward so she could unlock it.  He set her down as they stepped in.  \u201cClose the door and lock the deadbolt please,\u201d Sara asked sweetly.  In the time it took Jason to turn around and do so and turn back Sara had tugged the strings apart that held her swimsuit together and stood there naked.  Maybe she liked this thing more than she thought she did.  She jerked his Speedo down and he obligingly stepped out of it and dropped their things on the floor as Sara\u2019s hands and mouth went to his member, which he let swell to full size as soon as the Speedo was gone.  They hadn\u2019t even made it three whole steps into Sara\u2019s apartment before she was bent over, holding onto the countertop leading to her kitchen with his hands wrapped around her slim, powerful waist while he fucked her as carefully as he could.  He grimaced, holding back to keep from hurting her and failing to get himself balls deep like he desperately wanted.  It wasn\u2019t very long before she came, and she came hard and loud.  Jason grinned as she sighed with pleasure.  \u201cOh my God, that felt even better than I remember it,\u201d Sara disengaged herself and turned to face Jason, lounging back over the counter and letting her eyes drift up and down his body.  \u201cNow, before we have any more fun you owe me an explanation,\u201d Sara said with a wicked grin.  \u201cYou look like you gained at least fifty more pounds of pure, solid, muscle\u2026\u201d Sara was savoring the words, saying them slowly and suggestively as she let her body sway and writhe seductively.  \u201cHeck, you look like you even grew taller.  So tell me how you did it,\u201d her tongue flicked across her lips and she grinned.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Things didn\u2019t quite go the way they were supposed to and I ended up taking way more than I was supposed to, I\u2019ve been growing ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s eyes were wide with awe.  \u201cHow much bigger are you going to get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged his wide shoulders.  \u201cI\u2019m not totally sure, but I think a lot bigger still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara\u2019s eyes hadn\u2019t left the bag of multicolored powder since Jason had produced it.  \u201cHow does it work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean do you eat it?  Mix it into a liquid, shoot it up like heroin?  How does it do its thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I ate it, and washed it down with water,\u201d Jason improvised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou brought this for me to use right?\u201d  There was equal parts desire and hesitation in her voice.\u201d  Her heart hammered in her chest and she wasn\u2019t entirely sure she was ready to mess with something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you want to,\u201d Jason said, still holding the baggie out where Sara could take it if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow fast does it work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged, \u201cPretty quick for smaller doses, longer for large doses, I\u2019ve been growing for a few days now but I took a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this will make me taller and more muscular?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the effects are totally predictable,\u201d Jason said finally, remembering that he hadn\u2019t designed it to make Sara taller or more muscular, mainly stronger, more flexible, bustier and more accommodating to his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara slowly reached out and took the baggie, she padded on bare feet to her kitchen sink where she poured herself a glass of water and turned to look Jason who had followed her as far as the kitchen doorway.  \u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d she smiled and emptied the contents of the baggie into her mouth before swallowing the water.  \u201cBleh, it\u2019s bitter, but part of it tastes like pure sugar, what the hell is it?\u201d  Jason shrugged again.  \u201cHow long does it take\u2026 oh\u2026 I can feel it working\u2026\u201d  Jason stepped forward and took Sara in his arms, thrilled to feel her breasts growing against him.  \u201cMy boobs!\u201d  She exclaimed, pushing Jason away to watch her breasts grow.  After a few minutes she looked at herself and then looked at Jason.  \u201cI didn\u2019t get any bigger, just my tits,\u201d she didn\u2019t sound disappointed, but she did sound confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you feel any different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, I feel a lot different, it\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re stronger,\u201d Jason offered, \u201cit can boost strength along with size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shrugged and went right to the heaviest piece of furniture in the kitchen, the fridge and squealed with surprise when she almost knocked it over trying to lift it.  \u201cHoly crap, it\u2019s light as a feather.  I am stronger.\u201d  She looked down at her body like she had never seen it before, pausing to knead her now E cup breasts.  \u201cAnd these look fantastic,\u201d Sara looked up at Jason with a wide grin on her face.  \u201cI guess now we can get back to the fun like I promised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promised you\u2019d be satisfied, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet, I haven\u2019t test driven this new body yet,\u201d she said as she moved towards Jason, twitching and swaying her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds Jason had Sara laid across the kitchen table, his hands on her hips and feet firmly on the floor as he pounded her for all he was worth, finally able to go as deep as he wanted.  It wasn\u2019t long before she had another very vocal orgasm and Jason was right behind her.  She lay there panting for a moment while Jason stood there, savoring the feeling of being completely inside her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, I\u2019m satisfied,\u201d she said finally.  \u201cThough there are a few more rooms in my apartment we haven\u2019t screwed in yet.  Are you up for it big guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Jason said with a grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sara\u2019s new strength and flexibility allowed for some positions Jason would never had imagined, but finally Sara looked at the clock and groaned.  \u201cIs it seriously that late already?\u201d  Sara cursed.  \u201cI have to be to work hellishly early tomorrow morning.  I really hate to do this but we have to call it a night,\u201d she rolled over and kissed Jason before getting out of bed and heading for the shower.  \u201cOh my GOD, my place smells like sex,\u201d Sara said with a laugh.  \u201cI\u2019d ask you to join me but I don\u2019t think my shower is big enough for the two of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Jason said, gathering his clothes together.  \u201cI\u2019ll take one when I get home.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to leave when he heard the water start running but Sara popped her head out of the bathroom and called out to him before he did.  \u201cHey, I\u2019m booked pretty much all day tomorrow but we\u2019ll do this again when we have time right?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Jason said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara returned the smile, she ran to Jason and gave him a kiss before running back to the bathroom, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have to cut this short,\u201d she said again before she closed the door behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\u201d Jason said.  He waited a couple minutes then left.  He jogged across the beach and tried to decide what he was going to do with the rest of his night.  He was approaching his own backyard still without making a decision when a voice called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there you are, where have you been off to all day?\u201d  Donna was lounging on the stairs leading up to the deck behind Jasons house.  Despite having seen her body up close and personal the night before and again on Laura\u2019s iPhone this afternoon he was still amazed by the size of her muscles, breasts and the unbelievably attractive curves.  She was wearing a t-shirt that barely stretched across her torso despite it having had the sleeves cut out and a generous cleavage revealing slit made in the front.  A pair of denim shorts that had been cut to more closely approximate a thong were clinging to her hips like they were painted on despite being unbuttoned and unzipped nearly to the point of being totally revealing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a date,\u201d Jason answered truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA date,\u201d Donna looked slightly nonplussed.  \u201cDid you let them\u2026\u201d Donna pointed at Jasons crotch and formed a question by raising her eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t have the same effect, I think you sucked me dry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyebrow rose even higher.  \u201cReally?  Would you care to test that theory out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned, \u201cI would love to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were limited places the two of them could privately enjoy each others company, his mom appeared to be home and Donna insisted that the inside of her Aunt\u2019s place was off limits, so Jason found himself in Donna\u2019s Aunt\u2019s garage, sitting on the edge of a picnic table while Donna expertly sucked him off.  He gasped with pleasure as his hips bucked and Donna eagerly swallowed every drop.  Donna stood up and flexed her body with anticipation.  After a moment went by with obviously no result Donna frowned.  \u201cDamn it, I was hoping that would work again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you were,\u201d Jason thought, glad he had checked Donna\u2019s profile to see what would have happened if it had worked again.  He didn\u2019t think the world was ready for a twelve foot tall, half ton Amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll have to find another way to pay me back then,\u201d Donna said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d  Jason watched as Donna stripped out of her shorts and lay across the table, spreading her legs.  Jason stepped forward, eager to make love yet again when Donna clamped her legs shut and made the universal \u201cNuh-uh,\u201d of disapproval.  \u201cYou got your oral, hot-shot, my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jason said, kneeling down, Donna responded to his tentative start by wrapping her powerful thighs around his head and bucking her hips with pleasure.  He thrashed his tongue energetically and fought to get his nose clear enough to breath.  Donna clearly enjoyed what he was doing and groaned encouragement as she built to an orgasm.  Jason was afraid that she was going to twist his head off his neck as her legs flexed and clamped when she finally came.  Jason continued licking and sucking, startled at the surprisingly tangy flavor of Donna\u2019s feminine juices.  He had licked Sara earlier today and she tasted nothing like this, in fact it felt like it was beginning to burn his tongue.  Donna moaned with pleasure and as soon as she relaxed her legs Jason stood up, suddenly feeling lightheaded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d Donna asked, noticing the odd expression on Jason\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Jason said, suddenly wishing he had taken a closer look at exactly what else Donna\u2019s new and improved body was capable off.  His tank top began to tear away from his chest and he could feel the seams of his shorts giving away around his expanding legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, now that is not fair,\u201d Donna said as they both realized that Jason was growing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna had, at one point, envisioned her ideal as a busty, muscled up version of herself. Then she had achieved that goal with Jason's assistance which made her want more. But she didn't just want bigger boobs and more muscles she wanted what Jason had: the ability for her sexual secretions to bestow the gift of size, strength and hyper-sexuality. This desire was hardly a conscious one, though, and the dangerous thing about unconscious desires was their lack of calibration, discrimination, or restraint. Her ideal was to take someone normal and grow them to her own size, but her subconscious hadn't considered someone of Jason's already immense size partaking in her magical juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had been steadily growing all day, as he had been for several days now, and had reached a weight of 380 pounds by the time he had met up with Donna. His 6 foot 2 inch frame was still half a foot shorter than her 6 foot 8 inches, but he was only 10 pounds lighter than she which, at their girth, was pretty negligible. Now, though, he had already swelled visibly larger than Donna and was approaching her height as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could tell right away that this growth was different than what he was used to. The growth he'd experienced over the past few days had felt like a dull warmth. This was an intense, and fairly painful, burning. His face must have given away his discomfort because Donna pressed him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok? You don't look so great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. yeah,\" Jason said. \"I'm fine.\" His voice gave him away, though. His pain was evident and it almost sounded like he was talking through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey! Look at you, your veins.\" Donna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason held his arms out and saw what Donna was talking about. His forearms, thick as canned hams and still growing, were covered in a spiderweb of pencil-thick veins that stood out so starkly it was as though they were trying to escape from his body. He followed the lines of his circulatory system up his arms, across his shoulders and down his chest and everywhere it was the same. He was a living, moving diagram of veins and arteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boiling heat inside his muscles continued to grow from a raging furnace to something akin to molten rock. He could actually hear his sinew spreading and pressing against itself creating a sound similar to stretching leather. Then there was a white hot burst of pain and his entire body surged outward in all directions as he added 60 or 70 pounds of muscle in one quick shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA modicum of relief swept over him as the heat mostly subsided, but seconds later it was returning. He was still growing slowly while building towards another burst. Jason found himself breathing heavily in sharp snorts like an angered bull. He began to moan deeply as his blood boiled and a volcano erupted within him. Then he exploded in another expansive wave of muscle growth adding well over 100 pounds in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was any relief from the pain this time it was minimal and the pressure started building right back almost immediately. Jason's teeth were clenched tight and he was moaning loudly. Donna, frightened by what she'd caused, was backed up against the wall of the garage watching Jason go through his agonizing transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sucked in deep breaths and growled them back out again; slowly at first then faster as the fire inside him grew from volcanic to nuclear. It was unbearable and Jason pulled in one last great volume of air and roared. As he did his physique expanded for all it was worth. Slab after slab of muscle packed onto his body adding an additional 200 pounds to his already impossible frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood still with his eyes closed doing his best to slow his breathing. The burning sensation had faded, but there was some new feeling he couldn't quite place. It was familiar, in a way, but more intense than anything he'd ever felt before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jason took a relaxing, cleansing breath and opened his eyes. The first thing he noticed was that his pectoral muscles extended out a good two feet beyond his chin, perhaps more. He reached up and took hold of these giant muscles finding them to be denser and more solid than he would have imagined. It was as if massive steel plates had been attached to his chest. Then he raised his arms further and was greeted with boulder sized biceps. Jason's eyes went wide at the sight of his arms and they only got bigger when he clenched his fist and curled his forearm in. The bulging round muscle split into two distinctly defined halves with a peak that stood tall pushing his outrageous arms to nearly 50 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled as he began to realize what the new feeling was that was surging through his body: power. He could feel raw, superhuman power coursing through his body to a degree that was exponentially greater than before. He pumped his arm a few more times and could practically feel the power crackle within the very cells of his muscles. His smile grew wider until he burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you look at me?\" Jason spoke in a deep and powerful voice that vibrated the walls. \"I'm a giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna tentatively stepped forward. \"So, you're feeling ok, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok? I'm way better than ok. Look at me. \" Jason put his hands on his hips and puffed his chest out while flaring his lats like a pair of sinewy wings.  At the same time he flexed his thighs and calves each of which ballooned to Hulk-like proportions. Donna's eyes bugged out when she spotted cracks forming in the garage's concrete slab around Jason's feet from the force of his calf flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A smug grin spread across Jason's face. He loved the intimidation his vast strength caused in someone as powerful as Donna. \"Wanna give me a feel?\" he said curling his arm in front of his chest. \"Come see what superhuman muscle feels like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had a bad feeling in the pit of her stomach. Something had changed about Jason and she didn't like it. Despite her concerns, however, she found herself slowly moving towards him as if her feet weren't under her own control. She slid her fingers over the enormous swell of his bicep and shuddered with a mix of envy, lust, and fear at how impossibly hard it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's smug grin widened when he realized that while moments ago he'd been looking up to Donna's 6 foot 8 inch height now he was looking down from, what he guessed, was his new 7 foot 3 inch vantage point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, right?\" Jason asked slowly pumping his arm causing Donna's hand to rise and fall like a ship in stormy sea waters. \"Your juices really did a number on me. Maybe I'll help myself to another dose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna removed her hand from Jason's arm and took a step back. \"I don't think that's such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled. \"As if you could stop me.\" To prove his point he placed his hand on her shoulder and pressed down driving her to her knees. Earlier Donna had likely been the strongest person in the world, and now Jason handled her with striking ease so that Donna found herself face to face with Jason's penis. It was clear that this had grown as well since it hung a good 15 inches even though it was still flaccid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" Jason continued, \"I don't even have to touch you to make you do what I want.\" He released a tiny bit of a new super potent pheromone and Donna's eyes instantly rolled back in her head while her mouth hung open, a tiny drop of saliva dripping from her lip. She could feel her rational mind shoved to the background while animalistic urges overwhelmed her consciousness. She was so turned on that her crotch was instantly flooded with power-bestowing super juices that dripped down her leg. And as much as she wanted to get up and run away to keep Jason from becoming even stronger Donna found herself running her hands up his ridiculously beefed up thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason saw the puddle forming below her and laughed. \"See, there's nothing you can do against me. But don't worry, I'm sure I'll take more power from you later, but for now why don't you just suck my monster cock.\" Jason gave a quick flex and made his penis go from soft to fully erect so fast that had Donna been in the way she would have been knocked unconscious from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that it stood at its full, steel hard, length Jason's penis measured two feet long from base to tip and was nearly as thick as his upper arm had been before he'd begun adding muscle to his body. At his command Donna dove at his member and began sucking, licking and biting it like a woman possessed. She moved her hands up and down his shaft pumping with all of her might working her own muscled arms into pumped up cannons 26 inches around. She continued furiously working to please Jason for 20 minutes before the huge man let out a satisfied moan, tensed his whole enormous body, and blasted a hot load of cum that knocked Donna onto her back. Jason continued to douse her in about a bucket's load of come before he was finished at which point he found his tattered clothes and fished Laura's iPhone out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down at Donna. \"I'll come back for you, but in the meantime you're not to mention this to anyone else or share your... well, your juice with anyone else. Perhaps it would be best if you just head up to your room and wait for me. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, still under the paralyzing effects of Jason's super potent pheromone nodded blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. Now I'm off to pay someone else a visit.\" Jason turned and ripped the garage door off the hinges with one hand, dropping it to a pile on the floor. He stepped out into the cool night air, still completely naked though not concerned about it at all. He was practically a god at this point, if someone wanted to hassle him about clothing he'd toss them into the next state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned and began walking down the sidewalk towards his destination. There was someone he wanted to see.</span></div></div>",

Then it occurred to him that he didn't really have to wonder, he now had the one thing he was always afraid to ask for.  Her phone number.  He unlocked Laura's iPhone and pulled up her contacts.  Of course Vanessa was in there.  He pushed the call button and held the phone up to his ear, almost laughing at how comically tiny the phone now felt.  The phone only rang twice before Vanessa answered.  \"Oh my God, Lulu, are you OK?\" It wasn't really the greeting he was expecting to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Vanessa sounded momentarily taken aback by the fact she wasn't speaking to her sister but she quickly recovered.  \"Jason?  Is that you?  Is Laura with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura?  No.  Why?\"  Jason nodded at a woman who had stopped her jogging to stare at him with open mouthed shock.  He passed her without her moving or acknowledging him so he shrugged and focused again on the conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  No one has seen her for days, it's like she vanished, how did you get her phone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found it at my place, she must have forget it the last time she was over,\" Jason really was shocked at how easy it was to lie shamelessly now that he had started.  The truth was far more complicated anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed.  \"I really was hoping this was her finally getting in touch with someone but I guess that explains why she hasn't been answering her phone.\"  Vanessa trailed off and Jason sensed an awkward silence beginning.  He wasn't particularly surprised Laura had vanished.  With the new body he had given her she could be hanging out at the beach next to Vanessa and her sister probably wouldn't recognize her.  Jason found himself fantasizing about Vanessa's body and broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... do you want me to stop by and drop her phone off?  Are you home right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, sure, I'm home,\" Vanessa sounded distracted when she finally answered and Jason wasn't sure whether or not to say anything else.  Finally he decided to forge ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Vanessa, I...\" Jason was ready to pour out his heart to her, to express the deep seated crush/lust he had been harboring for years but just as he started she abruptly said good-bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you in a few Jason, I have to go,\" Vanessa hung up without saying anything else or giving Jason the chance to say anything.  He continued walking and pondered the phone that was all but dwarfed by his immense hand.  Belatedly he realized that if he gave Vanessa the phone he would no longer be able to alter anything.  As though to punctuate this epiphany he felt another bloom of warmth in his chest.  This one was more intense than he had become used to and he was certain when it was over that he had grown more than the typical two pounds.  What else had Donna's unexpected ability done to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unlocked the phone again and considered it before...</span></div></div>",

Of course the thought of shrinking himself down to a more realistic size never entered his mind.  Instead he brought up his profile and scrolled through the menus until he found his semen and fiddled with various settings.  Eventually he was pretty sure he had what he was looking for.

He handed one to Donna and let her take a few swallows before he lifted his own and flexed his arm hard as he did so.  Her eyes nearly bugged out of her head as Jasons other shirt sleeve shredded around the peak of his bicep.  She choked on her water and spilled enough on her white tank top to clearly show she was NOT wearing a bra.  \"I'm sorry,\" she stammered as Jason took the glass from her and handed her a towel to dry off with, he purposefully allowed his fingers to wrap around hers as she reached for it and they stood still staring into each others eyes as her heart hammered in her chest.  \"I should go,\" she said finally, pulling the towel towards her chest to wipe at it.  Jason let his hand be pulled with the towel and he rested the back of his hand against the swell of her breast, moving it just enough to chafe at her nipple and bring it swelling to attention through the thin, wet fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go?\"  He asked quietly, leaning closer towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked twice very slowly and for a moment Jason thought he had pushed her too far too fast.  Finally in a voice so soft he almost couldn't hear she answered, \"no,' and leaned in to kiss him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss was like setting off firestorm of passion in both of them.  Donna ground her body fiercely against Jason as their tongues probed deep into each others mouths.  Jason purposefully bunched up the muscles of his chest, flexing them and his shirt slowly split away from his body.  Donna nearly swooned and Jason caught her, wrapping his hands around her magnificent ass cheeks and lifting her on to the kitchen counter.  As soon as her bottom touched the counter top she wrapped her legs around him and bucked her hips, rubbing herself against his stiffening member and gasping as she realized how big it already was and how much bigger it was still getting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is like, this is like a fantasy,\" she gasped as Jason grabbed her shirt with both hands and peeled it off of her body in a symphony of tearing cloth.  He leaned in, stroking and licking her breasts and nipples.  She didn't even bother shrugging out of the tattered halves of the tank top, that would have meant letting go of him and she would have none of that.  Just as he had suspected, the swim trunks couldn't contain his fully erect member and it came free as the seams tore out along his leg.  Donna's hand was on it in an instant, stroking it, flicking her thumb across the tip, teasing it by grinding herself against it.  \"I'm not sure I'll be able to take this,\" Donna whispered in his ear, an undercurrent of fear in her voice causing Jason to stop.  \"No, no, don't stop.  I want to at least try, I'll tell you if I need you to stop.\"  Without another word Donna pulled the crotch of her shorts to the side, exposing herself.  It was evident that wearing panties weren't really her thing either.  Jason felt her body quivering as he slowly eased himself into her and she gasped, \"keep going,\" her fingernails dug into the skin behind his neck.  \"Don't stop.\"  Her legs clenched tight around him as he came closer and closer to bottoming out, finally she arched her back and screamed, forcing herself the rest of the way onto his shaft.  Jason felt like his heart was going to stop.  He had only thought that the orgasm he gave himself earlier was worth having.  What was building inside of him now would make it seem like nothing and he moaned softly as Donna clenched her self around him, spasming and grinding her hips.  \"It feels so good...\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason clenched his teeth and pumped his hips, slowly at first but gradually picking up speed.  Donna gasped at each thrust, he was filling her as perfectly as she could imagine, she was stretched painfully tight but she could feel an orgasm rapidly building that was making her forget about any type of discomfort.  The counter shook and dishes rattled in the cupboards as Jason thrust into her again and again.  Donna felt herself on the cusp of the orgasm and time seemed to stand still as she waited for the next thrust, knowing it was going to be the one that would send her over the edge.  \"OH... MY... GOD...\" She shouted as she came.  She came so hard her body felt limp, she was clinging to Jason like she was drowning and he was a life preserver, and every thrust was making the orgasm that much better, it was like surfing, catching that perfect wave that never seemed to end but just got better and better.  Finally Jason came with her, his body shuddering.  He grunted and lifted her up off the counter, curling her bodyweight easily, up and down his shaft before setting her gently on her feet and holding her at arms length.  Her legs shook and she had trouble catching her breath.  \"That was amazing,\" she said finally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could answer...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason regarded his image on the phone for a moment then said a silent goodbye to being weak, scrawny, and ignored. The first change was an easy one to decide upon: he flooded his avatar with muscle quickly dragging the slider up into the bodybuilder territory. Seeing his physique on par with Greg's and imagining the feel of such mass on his own frame brought his penis to attention. He frowned, though, when the beefed up Jason also got an erection and it appeared tiny by comparison to the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be easy enough to fix,\" Jason said and quickly navigated to the proper menu. He found he was able to adjust both his hanging and erect size separately so he set his flaccid penis length to 7 inches long and as thick as a garden hose. Then he adjusted his erection so that it would double in length when he got hard and made it so thick that he would be able to get friction on a coffee mug. \"Now we're talking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to commit the changes he'd made but paused with his finger over the button. Something didn't feel right; he held in his hand something with power beyond measure and he was simply going to settle for bodybuilder sized muscles and a big dick. It wasn't enough, not even close. He began making additional changes and drilled through the various menus and selecting abilities that sounded appealing. He increased his muscle mass more and more going beyond mere bodybuilder and into the realm of fantasy, he found ways to augment his sex appeal through pheromones, he discovered that he could make his body invulnerable to damage while also increasing his physical strength beyond his wildest dreams. He selected so many changes he couldn't even remember half of them. Finally he finished off his alteration frenzy by adjusting his height from 6 feet to 7 feet 6 inches. With trembling hands Jason tapped the \"Apply Changes\" button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched his reflection in the bathroom mirror for a long moment waiting for something to happen. When nothing did he let out a disappointed sigh and put his hands on the counter and let out a sigh. He was about to say something to his reflection about believing in such fantasy nonsense but before he could a bomb exploded inside his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Jason's physique surged effectively doubling his weight and pushing his mass beyond Greg's in the blink of an eye. He let out a painful scream while a series of smaller explosion pumped his muscles larger and larger. Jason's every cell was on fire but his muscles burned brightest of all. It was as if molten lava flowed in his veins. Little by little the pain diminished, though the heat did not, and Jason wondered if his invulnerability was kicking in. Sweat ran down his body in rivulets and his veins and arteries looked like they were trying to rip through his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was no longer suffering Jason could begin to appreciate what was happening to him. He cautiously flexed his arms and chest which were already massive and still growing; the explosions from earlier had been downgraded to a rhythmic pulsing that continued to add muscle mass slowly fine tuning him to match what he had programmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Jason noticed that everything around him seemed to be steadily falling downward and the sensation made him feel dizzy even when he realized that it was due to his height increasing. He tried to enjoy the sensation but quickly felt nauseous and had to close his eyes. He could feel his spine and legs lengthening at what felt like a shocking pace, and considering they were doing in seconds what tended to take years it was no wonder he felt this way. Jason simply stood and took long, deep breaths while he basked in the incredible sensation of his transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last he felt the alterations come to a halt and the heat that had been raging within him subsided. Jason took one last deep breath and opened his eyes. Now that his perspective had shifted a foot and a half upward he noticed that everything around him appeared so small, as if he had wandered into a scale model version of his bathroom. This illusion was further enhanced by the fact that his view was partially blocked by enormous slabs of muscle in the form of his pecs and shoulders. Jason was saddened that he couldn't see any more of his colossal body around the swell of his engorged chest so he turned his attention to the mirror once more. Unfortunately due to his increased height Jason wasn't able to see as much of his reflection as he had minutes ago. From his current angle he could see his stomach and the top half of his thighs which were then obscured by the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he wished he had a larger field of view he was beyond impressed by what he did see. He ran his hands down the iron bricks that made up his abdominals then back up the tightly packed obliques that lined his sides. Jason's attention was quickly pulled to his impossibly large cock which he gripped with both hands and squeezed. Though his shaft was super strong and refused to yield to the pressure from his fingers lightning bolts of pure pleasure rocketed through his body down his legs to his toes and up his spine. Jason's eyes rolled back in his head and he moaned with ecstasy. His thoughts were blurred by the sensations flowing from his dick but he somehow remembered that he had enhanced the nerve endings in his penis. Since he also remembered that he had increased the volume of his ejaculate by a pretty hefty margin he decided he'd better be careful lest he make quite a mess. It took a lot of will power but he released his penis and tested another ability that he had just remembered. With a simple thought his cock relaxed and went soft, then a moment later Jason made himself hard again. As long as he kept his mind on it he should be able to keep his monster unit from ripping holes in whatever he should be wearing. He relaxed again then flexed his soft penis while making it go erect again to see just how fast he could make it grow. Jason didn't realize how close he was to the counter, though, and the head of his dick smacked into the counter top while hardening and punched right through the slab of formica on its way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" Jason said. \"I didn't realize just how strong I made my cock.\" His voice was deep and seemed to vibrate the walls with its power. Jason loved it and began speaking phrases just to her what they sounded like when he vocalized them. He had just finished quoting Conan the Barbarian's \"what is best in life\" speech when he heard voices coming up the stairs. It didn't take long to realize that it was his sister, Jasmine, likely with some of her friends. Jason and Jasmine were twins but their birthdate was the only trait they shared. While Jason was skinny, weak, nerdy and unpopular his sister was beautiful, strong, curvy and one of the most popular girls at school. Not only that but Jasmine had used her well developed muscles to torture Jason for years now. Though he had been several inches taller Jasmine's athletic body more than made up for any advantage his height may have granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's first reaction was to hide. Not only was he naked but his body was radically changed and he worried that he would have to explain just how he'd grown so insanely large. However a moment later he decided that he didn't care who saw him like this: huge and nude. He was a veritable god now, superhuman in more ways than one. So what if she or her friends saw him without his clothes? He didn't have anything that would fit anyway and besides, this was the sort of body that deserved to be shown off. What did it matter if she demanded to know how he'd grown enormous muscles? It's not like she or anyone else could make him explain. Hell, he welcomed whatever attention his new body brought from Jasmine and any girls that may be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jazz,\" he called. \"Come here, I want to show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear Jasmine speaking to her friends. \"Wait here a sec, I've got to see what dweebus wants.\" A moment later she appeared in the doorway to the bathroom. She must have just come from the gym because she was wearing tight lycra shorts and a sports bra that didn't seem fully able to restrain her ample bosom. Her hair was tied back in a messy ponytail and her body looked both sweaty and pumped. Jason had always been impressed with her physique, she was among the most muscular girls he'd ever seen in person. Now he would impress her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Jason asked as he raised his arms in a monstrous double biceps pose. He'd forgotten just how much bigger his overall frame was now and his elbow hit the wall to his left punching through the drywall like it was paper. He didn't care, though, and just squeezed his fists tighter feeling the untold power crackle in his mountainous biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason eagerly awaited Jasmine's reaction.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jasmine shrieked as she stared up at Jason and the biggest biceps she had ever seen!  And she had never had to look up that high before to see his face!  Jasmine\u2019s frightened reaction caused Jason to smirk while she reached for the doorframe to balance her weakening knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, how, what happened?  This can\u2019t be possible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled at her confused and nearly terrified expression as she backed up a step to try and take it all in.  She loved flexing her biceps for him and if she had him cornered, forcing him to flex his to compare.  Jasmine\u2019s arms were bulging and curvy with biceps larger than baseballs.  Just a few days ago she measured hers at over 14 inches, while his languished at around 10.  But now!  He remembered wanting a 4X increase!  He could sense, he knew, that his biceps were formed into 40+ inches of raw power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind how!  Just take in a set of REAL biceps, bitch!  These monsters are 41 inches of he-man muscle!  Your puny 14 inch puppies are quite pathetic now, aren\u2019t they?  In fact all of your muscles are puny compared to those of a REAL man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was breathing hard, her entire world crumbling around her as she surveyed the rest of his bodybuilder busting, naked physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how?  You, you\u2019re\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed as he released his mighty flex and pulled his arms down to flex his huge pecs with a dance of power.  Slabs of muscles 7 inches thick rippled and pulsed with precision.  Jasmine had gained enough muscle to pop her tits with her thick pectorals and had been enjoying teasing Jason with her muscle trick for weeks.  But now!  This was everything he could have wanted!  To call his sister a bitch and not have to worry about any consequences, to make her sweat with fear and jealousy, to flex his huge chest and bounce his pecs bigger and harder!  He reveled as he responded with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuge, massive, gigantic.  Yeah, you\u2019d be right on all counts.  And strong too, Jasmine.  Super strong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo quickly prove his point he reached over and easily snapped off a piece of the already damaged counter and crushed the Formica in his hand with loud crunches and snaps.  He wiggled his fingers to allow the broken pieces and dust to drop to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was now nearly shaking as her eyes kept looking Jason up and down, repeating her dumbfounded questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026.but how?  How did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed again.  This was so awesome!  He knew he was going to enjoy all of the power at his disposal, but being able to lord over his sister first was everything he could have imagined.  Taking a step toward her, he quickly pulled his massive penis erect for the sole purpose of intimidating her further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind how, Jasmine, just get used to who is going to be in charge around here from now on.  In charge of anything and anyone I want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine\u2019s frightened eyes moved toward the lengthening, erect penis that was nearing 18 inches in length and inches in girth.  She had seen Jason\u2019s penis before, even grabbing it and squeezing it whenever she wanted to make sure he knew who was boss.  But now it was clear he was making his own point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Jasmine.  No more average little cock for your scrawny twin brother.  This monster is all about sex, power\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason quickly moved forward, causing Jasmine to squeal again as the head of his steel hard penis bumped into her chest with the force of a hammer, knocking her backwards.  She stumbled and fell onto her behind with a painful grunt as Jason grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd intimidation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped and looked down at Jasmine, who sat up and clutched her bruised chest with her right hand.  Tears welled up in her eyes and she gasped for breath.  Jason sent his penis back to placid, placed his hands on his hips and struck an intimidating superhero pose, flexing his legs with huge slabs of pulsing thighs and calf muscles, pulling his thick abs into a monstrous 8 pack and pushing his lats out into a set of muscular wings, casting a shadow over his shaking and nearly crying sister.  His entire body was a throbbing mass of rippling muscles that only seemed to flex larger the longer he tensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten how things were Jazz.  You\u2019re going to getting plenty of my attention!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his right arm back up and flexed down again, watching his mighty bicep rise into the biggest, strongest ball of muscle ever flexed, consolidated to over 40 inches around!  As Jasmine sobbed beneath him, he pulsed his muscle, feeling the power flow as his bicep added inch after inch of muscle, showcasing the expansion ability he gave himself.  And he thought it was around 25%!  This was the greatest moment in his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have fun measuring and comparing bicep!  Just look at what happens when I flex harder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine gulped as Jason\u2019s bicep expanded beyond 48 impossible inches around, with the peak pushing up toward his wrist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the dweeb now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leaned forward, reached down with his other arm, and grabbed a fist full of her top, making sure to paw her breasts roughly.  Jasmine defensively pulled her hands around his huge forearm, but let out a desperate squeak, as his muscles were stone hard.  With a smirk Jason pulled her up off the ground until her feet dangled high above the floor.  Bringing her petrified face closer, he stared her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked you a question bitch.  Do I need to repeat myself or do I need to get physical?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears dripped down Jasmine\u2019s face as he was purposely reversing the comments she would make to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe\u2026I\u2019m the dweeb!  Please don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed.  That never stopped her.  Pulling her even higher, her muscular, 5 foot 6 inch curvy body that once seemed so powerful and was used to lord over him, now was nowhere near his class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest day ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to hurt you\u2026\u2026.\u201d  He let the words hang for a moment, before he pushed her back to the ground and released his grip, sending Jasmine crashing back to the floor with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much anyway!  But probably a bit more than you used to hurt me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jasmine painfully sat up again, hoping to escape somehow, the phone chimed.  Releasing his monumental bicep flex, he turned to look at the phone and then glanced at Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go now, bitch.  But don\u2019t leave the house.  I want to meet your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded solemnly as she tried to control her sobbing and near hyperventilation.  Jason picked up the phone and tapped the message bar from the magical Ap.  His eyes widened as he read\u2026. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was crossing the hall from the bathroom to his bedroom while checking Laura's phone. The message he saw made him stop, though:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHEREDITY ADJUSTMENTS CALCULATED. <br>\r\n\tCOMENSING HISTORICAL ALTERATIONS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even begin to wonder what that meant Jason's vision became blurry. He put his hands out to steady himself on the hallway wall but even the material of the house around him felt like it was in flux. He tried to focus on what was in front of him which was a family portrait from two years ago. If he stopped and stared really hard he could make out his mom and dad standing just behind him and his sister who sat on step stools. Another wave of haziness washed over his eyes and Jason blinked several times trying to keep the photo on the wall in focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sight cleared slightly but something was different. It took him longer than it should have to realize that the family pictured were now all bodybuilders. And not just any bodybuilders, all four people were far and away the largest and most muscular people Jason had ever seen. Jason's will power fled from his body and he collapsed into unconsciousness but just before he fell he noticed that it was still a family portrait: him, his sister and his parents were the bodybuilders pictured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason slept shockwaves emanated out around the world and back through time as Laura's magical phone rewrote Jason's family history to account for his new size and strength. Going back dozens of generations on his father's side genetic codes were altered and enhanced to include a predisposition to muscle density and size that was borderline superhuman while his mother's lineage was composed of super athletes with perfectly sculpted physiques and uncanny abilities. Jason was now a descendant of gold medal Olympians and circus freaks, monsters and champions. In the distant past on his father's side of the family was a man so large he was though to have been the basis of the Paul Bunyan myth while on his mother's was a prima ballerina so powerful and adept that she had pulled off combinations of moves previously thought impossible, moves that had never been replicated now nearly a century later; and she had done it all with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around Jason was changing to account for what he had done to himself. His parents were now quite famous; his father was an action movie star who had hit the scene riding the coattails of actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone but who had surpassed both in terms of box office gross as well as physical size and strength. In fact Jason's father now, at the age of 44, was larger than Arnold had ever been. Jason's mother had grown up competing in numerous sports and excelling at each. When she was 16 she won 6 gold medals at the Summer Olympics in track and field events, then won 11 gold when she was 20. She soon turned to modeling then opened a network of gyms across the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house Jason now slept in reflected this new level of fame and wealth; no longer merely a house it was now an estate that sprawled across the hills overlooking his old neighborhood as well as the ocean. His bedroom was now a bit larger than the living room of his former home and overlooked the property behind the family mansion which consisted of a sprawling garden and topiary, an enormous pool with a fountain in the center, tennis and basketball courts, and, of course, a state of the art gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was the world that Jason awoke into minutes later. He rolled out of his king sized bed and stood. Though his surroundings had drastically a floor-to-ceiling mirror on the far wall which reflected his naked body and showed him that his monstrous physique remained. Unable to resist the urge Jason flexed a few more times practicing triggering his expansion ability and giving his muscles that extra 25% swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure of exactly what had occurred Jason began exploring his new surroundings. Beside the mirror was a door that led to an oversized bathroom. The walls and fixtures were made of solid marble and also seemed to have been made a bit larger or higher to compensate for his abnormal size. Inside the bathroom was another door that led to a huge walk-in closet filled with outfits for any occasion all matched to his current size. Jason dressed himself in some red cotton shorts and a blue t-shirt with the Superman \"S\" across the chest. It seemed an appropriate outfit and though it was definitely his size the shorts were still tight at the hem over his thighs and the shirt felt snug across his chest and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his bedroom Jason opened another door. This one led to a rumpus room with giant couches and easy chairs, a projector aimed at a huge screen with several gaming consoles nearby. There was a pool table and a bar and on the far end large glass doors opened on a balcony that overlooked the ocean. Jason stepped in and found the walls were lined with framed posters of himself from what were likely magazine shoots. In each his oiled body was pumped to insane size and almost all of the images had him being groped or embraced by one or more gorgeous women. The poster directly to his right caught his attention. In it he was dressed up as Wolverine, the Hugh Jackman version, with denim pants that somehow fit his massive legs (though just barely) and a dirty white tank top that was torn in various places. His fist was raised in front of his body and Wolverine's trademark claws extended from Jason's knuckles. What really caught Jason's eye, though, was the girl that was clinging to his body. She was a drop dead sexy redhead who was dressed as Jean Grey in her Phoenix costume: green bodysuit with the gold phoenix symbol, gold thigh-high boots and a matching sash around the waist. The girl was tall, and the boots added a good 4 inches to her height but the top of her head still only came up to the upper half of Jason's chest, and though her body was completely covered the suit was tight enough for Jason to see that this girl was busty and buff. Packed into the suit she had large D-cup breasts atop a shelf of thick pecs and surrounded by broad shoulders and thick arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around the room one last time he realized that the sexy redhead showed up in several of the posters, there was even one that featured her by herself. In that one she sat in a red leather chair and wore black lingerie. Her wild red hair spilled down over one shoulder while her eyes smoldered with sex. Now that Jason could see her exposed flesh he saw just how incredibly developed her muscles were. The girl was shredded; washboard abs, vascular arms, and defined quads that fought to split her black stockings open. Why did this girl appear in so many photos? Was she a friend? Perhaps just someone Jason worked with often. Either way he hoped he'd get to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t know what that phone did but I like it!\" Jason said. The phone! Was it still around? Jason rushed back to his bed and began searching for Laura's magical iPhone. Suddenly a chime caught his attention from the far side of the bed. He looked up and spotted an iPhone on the night stand. Rushing around to pick it up he discovered it was\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason rushed around to the other side of the bed and picked up the phone. His heart sank when the model and wallpaper revealed it was merely his own. The screen displayed a calendar message: \"GYM TIME!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out through the giant picture window in his room at the family gym on the far side of the garden. \"I guess I shouldn't be too upset that Laura's phone is gone. My life is looking pretty awesome as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one last door that Jason hadn't opened yet and as he suspected it led to the hallway. He navigated the enormous house eventually finding his way down a large stairway in the foyer then going through the back out to the patio. Along the way he passed a photo of his parents and saw the new versions of them for the first time. This particular picture was taken at the beach on the pier. Jason's father was shirtless and clad only in tight swim trunks. His body was massive and pumped while his mother, rather a voluptuous and buff version of her, clung to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, you guys!\" Jason said aloud to the picture. His brain was beginning to connect the pieces and suddenly the strange message he'd received about a \"heredity feature\" was making a lot more sense. The idea that a simple phone could alter history on such a crazy scale was incredible but he had no choice but to believe since the evidence was everywhere around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the gym Jason was surprised by how sparse things were. There were only a select few stations and even they were like no gym equipment Jason had ever seen before. Everything was very minimalist and seemed to be stripped down to its bare essence. Seats and benches were crafted from huge slabs of steel or some other metal that seemed to form out of the floor. There were no weights at all and instead all the equipment was attached to super thick cables that ran into holes in the floor. They didn't even have any free weights but instead had a pair of bars off to the side with similar cables vanishing into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were large HD screens all around the room, several on each wall so that where ever you were you had a clear view of one. These screens lit up with the words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E.M.M.A. Online<br>\r\nPlease verify ID\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time a sultry female voice spoke from speakers all around the room. \"Welcome. Please log in to verify identification.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glanced around but didn't see any terminal for him to log in at. Instead he looked closely at one of the screens. \"Emma?\" he read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disembodied woman spoke again. \"Voice ident confirmed. Welcome back, Jason. You're looking bigger than ever.\" Letters flew around the screen so that \"EMMA\" now lined the left side of the screen going down. Each letter completed with a word so that Jason now saw:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnhanced<br>\r\nMuscle<br>\r\nManagement<br>\r\nAssistant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext a computer generated woman appeared in the space on the right side of the screen. She was a long, limber blonde that looked modeled after a Barbie doll except with copious amounts of muscle added in for good measure. The virtual workout assistant was clad in a pink halter top that showed off copious cleavage and matching workout shorts that extended maybe an inch or two beyond her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks\u2026 um.. Emma.\" Jason couldn't help but wonder who in the world cold have programmed this sort of vixen as an assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, of course. How about we pump you up even more?\" Emma placed a hand on top of a cantaloupe sized breast. Was she actually excited at the idea of Jason getting bigger? Maybe this was all a part of a motivation routine. If so it was working; even though she wasn't real Jason wanted to show off for his new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled. \"Sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is chest and shoulders. Maybe if we have time we can give your arms a good pump too. Ready? How about we start with the bench press?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason made his way to the station that most approximated a bench and lay down on the metal slab. There was a gel covering for added comfort but not much. Fortunately his invulnerable body didn't mind. He slid up under a bar that, like all the others, was attached to cables that went directly into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just start with a warm up. I've got you set to 6,500 pounds. How about you give me 10 good reps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm warming up with more than three and a half tons? That's insane! Jason gripped the bar and pushed. To his amazement he was able to press the weight with relative ease. Emma counted out a rhythm for Jason to follow to keep him from pounding out the reps too fast and then he re-racked the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, but now let's try something more challenging. How about another set at 5 tons? Think you're man enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt like he could bench press a mountain. \"Bring it on!\" Jason heard a whirring of gears below him as whatever mechanism was hidden beneath the floor increased the resistance to 10,000 pounds. He sucked in a deep breath and began working. This set was much tougher but still manageable. Emma worked him through set after set constantly increasing the weight to work Jason to maximum effect. It was quickly clear to Jason that Emma was programmed to work his body with maximum efficiency; she knew exactly what he needed even more so than he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, big guy. Think you're ready to set a new personal best? Let's do one last set to fail with 15,000 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's my previous best?\" Jason asked between gasping breaths. He was really sweating and he could feel his pumped up chest ready to rip his shirt apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's face filled the various monitors around the room. \"Getting forgetful are we? Or are you just stalling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't believe the personality Emma had. \"How about forgetful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she look skeptical? Whoever programmed her must have been a genius. \"Okay, stud. Your previous best is 7 tons. We're going to tack half a ton onto that, deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lay back and took hold of the bar once more. \"Sure, if you'd stop your gabbing for one minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shook her head. \"You're lucky you're so sexy; otherwise I'd be mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason made it to 3 reps quickly but felt fatigue set in immediately after. His arms were shaking as he forced himself through the 4th rep. As he began the 5th his muscle expansion ability triggered on its own causing his chest and arms to swell ripping through his shirt as if it were paper. The feel of his muscles growing gave him the energy needed to power through another 2 presses, but he was sure that was all he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Emma was yelling all around him. \"You can do it, one more. You're a fucking beast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about hearing a computer swear gave him the encouragement he needed to complete 8 before racking the bar one last time. Jason stood and approached the nearest mirror. His chest was a heaving, quivering mass of muscle. He pulled the remnants of his shirt off of his torso and ran his hand over his engorged pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you even bother to wear a shirt.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wear shirts so I can burst out of them.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma moaned with approval. \"Alright then. Take a quick rest then I'm really going to work that body of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next 3 hours flew by in a blur of sweat, grunts, and thousands of pounds lifted. In the end Jason felt both more powerful than he'd ever felt in his life and also like he wanted to melt into a puddle on the floor. He toweled the sweat from his body and thanked Emma for the workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure, of course,\" she purred. \"I've taken the liberty of synching our next appointment to your phone. In the meantime I've notified the chef that you're ready to eat. Will you take your meal in the grotto, as usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's stomach grumbled at the mention of food. He hadn't realized just how hungry he was. But where was the grotto? Perhaps he should shoot for someplace he'd actually be able to find lest his meal never be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. actually I was thinking about eating poolside today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma raised an eyebrow. \"Ooooh! Thinking of taking a dip? Remember to wait after eating. You wouldn't want to get a cramp, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you could join me,\" Jason said, truthfully. He was beginning to miss the company of a real person and decided that after he ate he would head out into the real world, perhaps he could even find Laura. Or the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Emma said, \"but I guess-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virtual woman stopped as the door to the gym opened and someone else entered. Jason looked and saw it was Jasmine. Just like the rest of his family in this new reality she had also received quite a boost to her physical appearance. She took after their mother and then some and came complete with radical curves and a bosom even more ample than she'd had before. G-cup breasts were smooshed into a black sports bra and she wore black lycra pants over insanely thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason still had the height advantage by a foot but that now put his sister at a statuesque 6' 6\" in height. Her build was bordering on bodybuilder but despite her height and broad shoulders there was a sleekness about her that made him think of a swimmer or a gymnast. He realized that if he weren\u2019t so tall he probably would have a different impression of her but he loved that he was still the physically superior sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you still doing here?\" Jasmine practically spat at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like?\" Jason said. He was still feeling the high from dominating her earlier as well as from his workout. How dare she question him. \"I'm building my awesome manly muscles even bigger. You're not jealous are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hit a double biceps pose and expanded his 41 inch arms to their full 52 inch glory. \"Don't you wish you could pump up muscle like this, you runt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's face turned bright red.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve had just about enough of your condescending tough guy attitude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason scoffed, pumping his biceps a few times for effect.  \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?  Puny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine tossed her gym bag down and stared up at Jason.  \u201cMom always told me to hold back, to give you a chance to shine.  Seeing as we stayed out of each other\u2019s way I was fine with that.  But no longer.  I don\u2019t need to hold back anymore.  Nor do I care what our parents have to say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine flexed her biceps and twin cannons popped up into view, easily reaching up to 28 inches around.  \u201cEmma, get back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma flashed back into view.  \u201cOh, hello Jasmine.  You\u2019re early today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine sniffed.  \u201cYou\u2019re right.  I am early.  No wonder you still had Jason here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smiled.  \u201cYes.  Jason was just heading off for lunch by the pool.  I can set up your weights for you.  The new, modified material worked out nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine held her steely stare at Jason with both of them still flexing up their biceps.  \u201cIn a moment.  I want to you to first tell me how big Jason\u2019s biceps are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma turned her gaze to Jason.  \u201cMmmmmm.  52 inches around.  That is a new record for Jason.\u201d  Jason smiled and grunted as he pumped his mighty biceps again to drive in more hardness and vascularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine snorted.  \u201cAnd how big are mine right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma turned to Jasmine.  \u201cYour biceps are 28 inches around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spat.  \u201cHa!  Runt size!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine fumed.  \u201cOh really?  Oh REALLY!  Emma, try and keep up with my expansion would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded.  \u201cCertainly Jasmine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jasmine\u2019s biceps slowly expanded and Emma dutifully called out the increases.  At 36 inches around, Jason calculated that Jasmine had hit her limit.  He leaned in until their flexed biceps were inches apart and he flexed his biceps again to showcase the size difference.  His mighty bicep was seven inches taller and clearly wider.  He still buried her best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, very nice bicep.  For a girl!  But we all know that\u2019s your limit.  My mighty bi\u2019s clearly eclipse those female muscles by about 16 inches.  Now why don\u2019t you just admit defeat and you can do yoga or whatever you women do in the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine held her flex and growled, ignoring his last comment.  \u201cYeah, that does hold.  Your expansion ability is 25% or so, and so is mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine paused as her eyes narrowed and her tone deepened.  \u201cOr so is WAS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine let out a breath and smirked menacingly at Jason who still looked unimpressed.  \u201cTurns out that since I recently switched up my training to hardcore lifting, I\u2019ve unlocked something previously hidden.  Something only Mom knows about.  But even she doesn\u2019t know where I\u2019ve driven myself to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, full up with the testosterone from his workout only leaned in further until their biceps were touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then bring it on.  I am sooooo scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine grit her teeth and pulled her forearms back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you will be loser.  You will be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine brought her forearms back up and tensed hard, causing her large biceps to literally explode upward and outward with terrifying results!  Her biceps pushed to 40 inches, then 45 inches, then 50 inches in moments!  Low, eerie rumblings emanated from her biceps, transferring down into the ground, causing Jason to not such see and hear her expansion, but FEEL it as well.  Jason was starting to look nervous and was about to release his flex when Jasmine halted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare release your puny flex, Jason.  You apparently need a hard lesson on just who the biggest, strongest bitch is in this family.  To say I\u2019ve unlocked my potential doesn\u2019t really give my ultra body justice.  I\u2019ve grown in strength by leaps and bounds.  One might even say my abilities are, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026 Super?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that Jasmine growled like an angry tigress and flexed down even harder!  The rumblings intensified and the sound of metal rubbing against metal caused Jason to pull in a frightened breath.  Her peaks pushed up to the top of her fist, then above the tops of her fists, then to her eye level as her ripped to shreds mega biceps pushed up to 54 inches around, then 64 impossible inches around, quickly expanding larger than his mighty limbs!  Her man crushing bicep peak pulsed up several inches above his incredible muscle, completely eclipsing his once dominating muscles.  It was like Jason was staring at a comic book version of his sister, nearly causing him to shake with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not only was her bicep larger, but her incredible muscle was defined beyond belief!  Every muscle fiber pulsed and rippled with imposing hardness as muscles built upon muscles.  Several thick, nasty veins wrapped around the mountain of she muscle, pumping victory and strength into her logic defying mega muscles.  Jason stared with wide eyes at the largest bicep ever flexed by anyone ever, his confidence shattered.  Jasmine sniffed at his change of expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Jason, I can flex my biceps bigger than yours.  Harder than yours.  Ssssstronger than yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine glanced up over and up at her imposing bicep peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you know what Jason?  I\u2019m not nearly done!  You\u2019re about to see what some REAL biceps look and FEEL like, because the strength in these muscles is going to make you faint like a little girl!  You really ARE feeling the power of my flex Jason.  Just imagine how much strength is contained in these girl muscles.  How much overwhelming might!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped as he stared at her impossible biceps, thinking her muscle could grow no more.  But he was dead wrong, as Jasmine pulled her forearms back slightly and then forward until her muscles collided and she tensed her fist hard at the apex, blasting her already world beating bicep larger!  And harder, and wider and thicker and stronger and denser and more vascular and more detailed!  The sound of Emma announcing the numbers only made Jason feel more terrified as Jasmine\u2019s biceps expanded noisily to 72 inches and 6 feet around, vibrating the ground below him as he watched her bicep completely overshadow his!  Emma laughed as the rumbling picked up in amplitude, shaking the room around them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha-ha!  Now this, THIS is a bicep twerp!  Just imagine how much strength these muscles contain, how much raw power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason\u2019s breath continued to pick up pace from mounting fear, Jasmine\u2019s biceps continued to expand beyond all belief!  Her peak pushed up over the top of her head as her girth reached 78 inches around and continued on to 85 inches around, over 30 inches larger that his muscle and now a good foot taller!  His bones rattled with the rumbling, which was now cracking the foundation at her bare feet!  Jasmine smirked at the terrified look of her sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Jason, my current expansion ability is way over 300%!  Give me a few work-outs and I\u2019ll be at 400%!  Can you just imagine me pumping up my biceps to triple digits!  Ha-ha-ha!  And not only can I expand my muscles beyond human capabilities, but I can hold any level I want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine released her bicep flex, but held her biceps dimensions at 50 inches around and reached her arms down to flex up a devastating crab flex that shredded her top and let loose another room shaking BOOM that caused Jason to jump.  Her large tits melded with her pecs to become a set of super duper muscle boobs!  The power radiating from her upper body flex pushed Jason back as he finally released his flex and placed one foot behind him to keep his balance!  Her traps, shoulders and back all expanded until her muscles filled up around her smiling face in an orgy of mega muscle expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took another step back and Jasmine laughed cruelly before releasing her flex and standing back upright, now clothed in nothing but her workout shorts that were ripped up the sides of the largest set of thighs Jason had ever seen.  Placing her fists on her hips in a power stance to trump all others, Jasmine sneered at her perplexed sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy body is a symphony of mega muscled might Jason.  And these muscles aren\u2019t just for show.\u201d  Turning toward the bar at the bench press area, Jasmine strode quickly to the bar and stood in front.  \u201cEmma, what is Jason\u2019s best bench?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma calm smooth voice was no longer soothing for Jason.  \u201c15,000 pounds.  He performed 8 reps and burst out of his shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor anyone else jaws would have dropped from shock.  But the snicker from Jasmine was chilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSet the weight for 20,000 pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whirring and churning below soon followed by a loud \u2018CHUNK\u2019 to indicate the weight was ready.  Jasmine then reached out and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She released the weight with one hand but kept holding it up with the other, their was a slight shift of balance, but otherwise she barely seemed to notice shifting over 20,000 pounds to ONE HAND.<br>\r\n\"Hah! Oh, well, so much for triple digits, I'm sure I'm well past that now\" she sneered \"Imagine if I actually were doing a little lifting\".<br>\r\nThe gym went completely silent.  There was a slight thump as one person fainted.<br>\r\nSmiling dangerously, Jasmine  thought out loud. \"Well, maybe I'll actually feel it if I do it like this\".<br>\r\nShe proceeded to stick her arm straight out to one side, and with an explosive movement throw the massive weight up, catch it in the other, lower it slowly, and then throw it up again.  <br>\r\nMuscles and veins erupted all over her body as she repeated the move, faster and faster.  She snickered \"How do you actually get a pump from these weights?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight shift in movement, she started actually juggling the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't weightlifting, but I have to admit after a while it makes good cardio\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now her muscles had expanded beyond outrageous to a point that seemed to almost defy physics .  The blank, stunned look on people faces seemed to satisfy her, as did the stretched pants and wet crotches all around - Jasmine had managed to shut down the brains of virtually everyone within sight distance and reduce them into drooling lustful animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was no exception.  A minute ago she would have thought \"What have I done\"  but now all she could do was rub her thighs together and drool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had actually started dribbling blood from both his nose and his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust casually juggling over 20 thousand pounds, Jasmine's body looked like some kind of monstrous stone golem, rocky mounds of muscles with mass more comparable to  kitchen appliances than individual muscle groups bulged everywhere as puffy, angry veins almost seemed to caress every stony striation like liquid metal rivers flowing through the crags of some lunatic alien rock formation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, maybe I should clarify a little something I told you earlier, just so you can get an idea of just how tiny your big manly muscles actually are, how puny and ridiculous just watching you flex seems to me......Mr. Most Muscular Man in the World\"!  Smacking her lips and shimmying her shoulders in a sassy sarcastic fashion that just drained even more of the blood from peoples heads into their nether regions.  By now there was almost a rhythmic beat in the gym as people passed out and dropped to the ground - for some the shock had rendered their vision hazy, seeing Jasmine as almost just a silhouette.<br>\r\nWhen I said I can get well over a 300 percent expansion when I flex - and I have now doubt even this little cardio has gotten me over 400 - I didn't clarify one little detail:  I've been holding back so much, I never told you how big my relaxed state was . . . . . . In fact, I've been holding back so long I'm not even sure how big my relaxed state is\".<br>\r\n  \"Emma - what's the highest weight possible to put on this bar?\"<br>\r\n\"Our system is capable of generating almost 1 million tons of pressure\".<br>\r\n\"Hah, did you hear that Jason?  ONE MILLION - that not only blows your puny 20,000 out of that water, but it does it in TONS instead of pouinds - I might feel that enough I won't be able to hold back.  You want to see real biceps - huh?  Real female megamuscle bulging up so big the definition of muscle goes out the window?  Emma - put that weight on two sets of benches, I'm going to do curls.\"<br>\r\nThe system whirred and groaned as the bars actually sagged to accommodate the insane weight.  Grabbing one made her grunt  \"OH YEAH, THAT'S IT\"<br>\r\nJasmine picked up the first one, and actually staggered a bit as she walked over to grab the second.  The muscles on her neck and shoulders were red and bulging with veins as they swelled out to engulf her head, the veins on her biceps and forearms as thick as industrial pipes.  Her fingers turned white as she slowly raised her arms straight out, muscles squealing like saran wrap as striations seemed to swallow skin until she was a vacuum packed mass of insane, well mass.  She was huffing as she reached a perfect cross pose, eyes wide with lust and strain simultaneously as muscles squirmed under her skin other like thousands of knotted annacondas slithering around each other.  Before she even started to curl her arms, her biceps looked like a pair of balance balls made of concrete towering over her throbbing shoulders - her arms were well over 250 inches around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah baby, OH FUCKING'  YES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar, she threw her arms up once, twice, three times, then four before she started to turn red, sweat drenching her body, and finally, slowly, legs stomping up and down and cracking the cement floors she screamed.<br>\r\n\"FIVE\" as the weights crashed through the floor and Emma's soothing voice started saying \"Malfunction, unable to connect system.  Weights in quadrant A5 will be temporarily shut down for repair.<br>\r\nJasmine was a sweatslicked tan mountain of muscle whose wet dishevelled hair dangled over her pecs, her eyes barely visible peering between all the she-beef. As she took deep ragged gasps her muscles throbbed and pulsed and slowly, ever so slowly stabilized.<br>\r\n\"There - I tore my biceps and for any normal person they would need sleep, protein, and time to heal\".<br>\r\nSmiling with an unnerving glee as she stood up straighter<br>\r\n\"In my case, they are completely healed right now.  So THIS is what my muscles look like relaxed.\"<br>\r\nShe raised her arms, and bent them slightly as the swollen masses raised up easily ten above her head, more than half way to the warehouse roof of the gym.<br>\r\nHer biceps alone were not only bigger than Jason's entire body, but taller than the tallest man who ever lived.<br>\r\nWith one last thump, everyone was out cold but Laura and Jason.<br>\r\n\"\"Perfect, just the audience I wanted - I bet I can get way more than 400 percent expansion now .  Should I flex my muscles and test, or do I have to give these muscles a real workout first to make my point?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jasmine muscle breasts thrust easily five feet from her body; her clothing having long surrendered to her engorged musculature.<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, baby, and I thought you just liked this because of how much it hurt that little boy over there....\" her left pec twitched, covering her entire upper body and lifting itself several feet above her head.<br>\r\n\"And Jason, honey, you ARE Sooo little...\" she gasped sensually as her two massive pecs started switching back and forth as body eclipsing masses.<br>\r\n\"Soooo little...\"<br>\r\nSuddenly her Boobs flared with veins and situations, and her nipples erupted with muscles, as if they were deep red corn cobs fired up by the heat of lust and popping popcorn all the way along their surface.<br>\r\nHer nipples throbbed as muscles piled up on top of muscles, until they became twin grotesquely bulging clusters of beef, like gigantic raspberries the size of dumpsters.  <br>\r\n\"Oh, mmmmmmm - ah, my nnnippples\" - she popped that \"p\" and moaned so sensually that everyone in the gym - conscious or unconscious - sputtered and thrashed with orgasm. <br>\r\n\"My sweet girly nipples - Oh just one nip! Has more sweet bulging muscle than your entire manly body\". Jason rolled of the weight bench, crotch thrusting in the air frantically, as if it were the only part of his body thrashing desperately for life. <br>\r\nLaura however was masturbating like a demon, eyes freakishly wide and fixed on Jasmines arms.<br>\r\n\" Oh that puny little man can't even handle one nipple - but oh baby YOU.....\"<br>\r\nJasmine curled her hands into a fist and veins as thick and hard as railroad tracks spread over already massive veins as her forearms bloated and twisted - screeching and crackling - to the size of vans as her biceps pushed her head and arms away, thumping into the warehouse roof thirty feet up with a rain of plaster and spider web cracks that circled her insane biceps like a halo of destruction.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, yes! Ah, DESERVE to see muh, muh my....\"<br>\r\nHer fists pushed in, and her biceps tensed, the fibers lifted and pinched together, and jumped up with a rocky grinding noise, then muscles erupted from her muscles with the noise of a bowl of Rice Krispies amplified a thousand fold. The ceiling blasted up in a plume of powder that looked like the dusty aftermath of an erupting volcano as her peak groaned as skin started to find its limit another thirty feet above the remains of the gyms decimated ceiling.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmussssles\"!<br>\r\nJust when Laura thought no more mass could possibly hit that bicep, Jasmine rotated her fist, lifting her rear bicep high over that mass like Godzilla rising out of the ocean, casting a shadow over her own gargantuan muscle as her bicep towered ludicrously. Jasmine monstrous dark red nipples actually started curling up, like the sheet muscle lust powering them was trying to point at the insane biceps looming in the sky.<br>\r\n\"FLEXXXED\".<br>\r\nLaura came so hard the blast lifted her of the ground and tore the nails from her fingers. The shockwave of Jasmines flex lifted everyone and everything of the ground and blasted it away from the epicenter of her sexiness. Rings of cloud and heat waves made that bicep look like a mirage as it blasted up to double its size. Her muscle tits were flexing and bouncing out of control like a pair of  jumbo jets strapped to the wrists of a flailing hulk, and her nipples actually did point BACK, so swollen themselves with mutant muscle they begged for the hundred - no THOUSAND mouths it would take to suck them. Emma merely said \"signing off\" as the gym was decimated. Laura landed with a \"thunk\" on rubble almost twenty feet away. Despite cracked ribs, she looked up, and instantly threw her head back and thrashed out a massive toe curling orgasm at the sight of Jasmines bicep blotting out the sun. She screamed as orgasm ripped into orgasm at the comprehension that that bicep was a perfectly pumped, exquisitely sculpted, sweat sheened mass with the texture of a haystack and the gleam of polished mahogany HUNDREDS OF FEET TALL!<br>\r\nAnd with a tearing sound, then the thunder and rumbling of a volcano, it popped its final peak on top of the twisted mass dripping with sweat and so twisted with nasty veins it looked like a knot of crashed freight trains. <br>\r\nWithout a doubt she just hit a thousand - and Laura passed out into a bloody mix of pain and pleasure.</span></div></div>",

The aps has recognized Jasmine as the twin of Jason.  Calculated changes to Jasmine show a stronger base.  The percentage increases for Jason will be applied to Jasmine resulting in some cross effects moving the resultant percentages even higher.  For more information, select Jasmine.  Note that all changes are now locked due to twin protocols.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his eyes away from the phone and stared at Jasmine, who was now standing on wobbly legs, looking to get out of the room as quickly as she could.  But just when she was ready to turn and make her escape, she felt a strange sensation that suddenly turned into a detonation inside her body.  Jasmine yelled out painfully and nearly fell over as her entire body exploded with massive, bulging muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could only stare and gasp at what he knew was coming.  Or at least he thought he did.  If her muscle size and strength were much greater than his from the start, he was not looking forward to what was coming.  Especially after what he had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine however was still at a loss as to what was going on as her clothes were quickly shredded against her surging physique with loud rips and tears.  Pain racked her body, but was slowly dulled and her shrieks stopped even as her hard breathing continued and the rags of her clothes fell to the floor around her.  Jasmine grunted as her veins throbbed with incredible intensity and she flexed her muscles for the first time, feeling strength and power flood her system while sweat dripped into the grooves of newly formed muscles, highlighting shocking definition.  She coughed and through glassy eyes looked at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026. did you do all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could stammer out a response, Jasmine pulled in another breath as she shook her head from a slightly dizzy experience, as it appeared that Jason\u2019s massive form was moving down.  Letting out another hard breath she soon realized that the entire room was moving down, or more likely, that she was growing taller.  Blinking her eyes, she looked down and gasped, as she couldn\u2019t see passed the largest chest she had ever seen!  Larger than Jason\u2019s!  Her eyes were greeted with a wall of pectoral power and what she quickly ascertained were muscle tits and her breasts pushed out away from nine inch thick pecs another six inches and appeared hard and strong!  Jasmine flexed her pecs and she could feel the strength and power pound pleasurably into her mighty pectorals and those muscle breasts as her upper body hardened and expanded several more inches!  Nipples the size of twin bullets thickened and grew longer with a mere thought, sending immense pleasure tingling throughout her body.  Catching her breath, Jasmine finally laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing that whatever the hell happened to you, just happened to me!  And that little pectoral dance you did to intimidate me seems kind of pathetic NOW, doesn\u2019t it!  I mean, check out a REAL super big, massive chest dweeb!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much more practice than Jason and with seemingly instantaneous understanding and control of a body she just inherited, Jasmine tensed her right pec and then her left, bulling forth more muscle and pushing her massive chest up and down harder and higher than Jason!  Her mighty chest was now over twice as thick as Jason\u2019s and Jasmine moaned with pleasure as her nipples thickened and lengthened more as she flexed her mighty chest up and down and left and right with piston precision as if her entire chest was filled with liquid steel and she could control every drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped as he surmised that the enhancements to his cock were translated into her chest and nipples!  He imagined Jazz with steel hard muscle breasts and diamond hard nipples!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason stared on slack jawed, Jasmine shook her head to snap herself out of the immense pleasure she was starting to experience.  She had business to attend to first!  Smiling as she stopped her pec dance, Jasmine tilted her head down to stare at her lower body.  She snickered as she made out gigantic, shredded thighs that completed towered over her small knees.  Jasmine reached out to rub her hands along deeply separated blocks of abdominal muscles along her narrow midsection before she pulled her head back up to compare her muscle size to Jason and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo whatever you did to yourself is having a MUCH greater affect on me!  If you started out as the wimpy little loser and you got that big, then imagine what just happened to this girl who started out with a big, hard, strong, muscular body, curvy, killer body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped as he dropped the phone and Jasmine\u2019s eyes followed the phone down before smiling wickedly back at Jason.  Jason started to breathe hard as he stared at the wall of female muscle that Jasmine had become.  He didn\u2019t have to imagine as he could see that every muscle group he had designed for himself was now surpassed by his twin sister!  And while the percentage height increase put her at around 6 foot 10, the shorter height only made her gigantic muscles appear even larger across her feminine frame!  Her shoulders pushed out broader, her lats were even wider, her hulking chest eclipsed his, her thunder thighs were shredded masses of inhuman muscle bigger than his, her midsection was narrower, but sported more deeply etched muscles, and her arms hung at her side like twin pink bags stuffed with boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason scanned the inhuman body of his twin sister, Jasmine followed his stare, narrowed her eyes and let out a lusty sigh as her voice took on a sexy, animalistic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right nerd boy!  I\u2019m bigger!  I\u2019m harder!  I\u2019m stronger! And I\u2019m way more muscular than you!  I\u2019m a fucking Supergirl now!  If you thought you were tough knocking me around just now, your about to see what happens when I\u2019m pissed off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a step back and bumped into his desk, knocking over the lamp and snapping the wood frame against his bulky muscles.  Jazz laughed cruelly as Jason squirmed.  Just like he always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut before we begin, what was that about being huge, massive and gigantic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine slowly pulled up her arms into a double bicep pose and squeezing her fists at the apex, blasted her biceps with more muscle than Jason would have thought possible!  Inch after super inch of mega muscle pushed forward, outward and upward in an orgy of impossible muscle growth!  Twin mountains of shredded she-muscle bulged up to the top of her fists as the peaks pounded with growing power!  Jason\u2019s quick thinking math ability was now his bane as he realized that 4X a 14 inch bicep would mean that her biceps would bulge up to 56 impossible inches around!  Much bigger than he had managed with the expansion ability!  As Jason gasped, Jasmine growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this is huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine grit her teeth and squeezed harder, sending even more muscle into her overloaded biceps as her expansion ability was unlocked!  Muscles grew on top of muscles as the peaks eclipsed the top of her fists, adding another 7 inches to her biceps, blasting them up to 63 inches around and the shape of mountains!  Jason let out a hard, shocked breath, as he couldn\u2019t imagine her biceps growing any bigger.  But Jasmine quickly pulled her forearms back slightly and flexing again, yelled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd THIS is massive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine reveled in her power as she squeezed again, sending shock waves of additional muscle into her biceps, pushing her mighty peaks up to her eyes level as each bicep now bulged to 70 inches around, reaching what Jason believed would be the maximum girth!  My god, he thought, how can anyone flex muscles that big?  But as his jaw dropped open, his brain was about to short circuit as Jasmine roared with the force of several lions, shaking the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd THIS dweebus, this is GIGANTIC!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine pulled her forearms back quickly, slammed them into her biceps with twin, hard TWACKS and tensed her fists at the apex, causing a shockwave of power to emanate from her biceps as muscles exploded on top of muscles in frenzy of super human muscle growth!  Jasmine\u2019s bicep peaks surged with impossible growth until the peaks of her gigantic, shredded biceps pushed up over the top of her head and glowed with super power!  Jason leaned back against the desk, cracking the wood further as stared at a pair of biceps he estimated to be over 90 monolithic inches around and nearly 3 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine breathed heavily, the incredible power forced into her muscles causing her ears to buzz as she turned to stare up at her right bicep.  With a wicked grin she released her aneurism inducing flex and her expansion ability pulled her muscles back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Jason.  Where were we?\u201d</span></div></div>",

If she was big and strong and controlling before, now that she was boosted like this, his mind reeled at the thoughts of what she would do!  All of his incredible changes amplified into his sister was more than he could handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine narrowed her eyes, her recent humiliation and fear induced by her twin coming into focus.  With a sneer, Jasmine took two steps forward and reaching out, grabbed Jason by his neck and with incredible ease, pulled him high, crashing his head into the ceiling, causing plaster to rain down around his partially encased head.  She pulled him down just enough so the top of his head brushed the ceiling.  He gripped her forearm with both hands for balance and squeezed for all he was worth in hopes of getting her to back off, but even though his grip could crush steel, he wasn\u2019t even making a slight dent in girl muscles now much harder than diamonds!  He bucked his body, but her arm was like a statue!  She could never do anything like this before!  Just how much stronger than him was she?  Meanwhile his squirming and choking sounds only made Jasmine laugh harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha!  You can\u2019t even press into my mighty muscles now can you Jason?  Not even a little.  Not with all of your so-called super strength!  Good grief!  I was stronger than you before, but never THIS much stronger!  I\u2019m a fucking BEAST!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jason\u2019s face turning red from her casually applied chokehold, Jasmine sniffed and released her grip, causing him to drop to the ground and then onto his ass.  She casually walked over toward his bed and picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed to be very interested in the phone right before I changed.  Is this somehow the cause of all of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gasped and rubbed his soar neck a bit, but remained silent.  Jasmine narrowed her eyes and she plucked in his code and smiled as she saw the same warning left from when her changes began.  Looking back at Jason, she pressed the line that said select Jasmine and saw her stats pull up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you did all of this with an Ap?  Holy crap, Jason!  What kind of power is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat there silently, looking around the room, hoping for an escape.  Jasmine continued to scroll through the Ap to see what she was capable of and her mouth opened up with surprise at just how powerful she had become.  She then flipped around to Jason for a comparison and laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jason!  You really have no idea what you did, do you?  Everything you did for yourself is amplified in me!  But even more than that, you increased your ability to grow bigger and stronger to superhuman levels.  However, your base ability was quite pathetic, so you had to really crank that up high.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine paused as she tossed the phone back on the bed and stalked toward Jason who was getting up and slowly moving his way toward the back wall in hopes of being able to grab the phone off the bed and making a break for it.  But those thought were slowly being dashed as Jasmine continued her assessment of her powers.  Her dominating smile was already making him sweat and her naked, glistening super pumped body was causing him to fight a hard-on he so desperately did not want to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think happened to me?  Someone who already had a very high ability to grow larger, stronger muscles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped and stuttered nervously.  \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smirked again and seemingly acknowledging his fears, reached down to grab his dick and pump up her chest into twin massive spheres of muscle and super tits larger than basketballs.  Jason moaned with unwanted pleasure as due to the Ap, his dick was pleasure zone like no other and her initial attempt at dominance was turning him on instead.  Jasmine was only interested in intimidation and didn\u2019t pay attention to the slowly hardening dick in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, dweeb!  With the twin protocol, you gave me such a ramped up ability to grow bigger and stronger that the ap couldn\u2019t even give a number to represent my ability.  It simply flashed at 100% and in bold capital letters had Beyond Human Capabilities.  And seeing how much I love to work out, you\u2019re going to get to watch this girl grow into the biggest, strongest, toughest being to ever draw a breath on this planet!  All of those stupid comic book heroes of yours will look like pathetic wimps next to me!  And you\u2019ll be the most pathetic wimp of all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine leaned closer as against his will, her hand on his penis caused him to go hard until his dick grew larger, thicker and stronger than the monster he had grown to knock Jasmine down just minutes ago.  And before he could even try and fight it back down, Jasmine smirked and squeezed down hard, causing immense pain and pleasure.  And to make things worse, she slowly lifted him off the ground with one arm!  He leaned forward a bit as she angled the head of his penis down with his massive body hanging in the air as if he were nothing but a stuffed animal!  And to Jasmine, even that analogy was underestimated, which was not lost on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha!  Your dick really is hard and really big!  Lifting you up by your oversized dick is fun, Jason.  What happens when I squeeze down harder?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason yelped as her small hands compressed into the hardest dick in the world like it was a sponge.  But along with the pain, Jason lost all control, groaned as he leaned his head back and began to ejaculate on the ground!  He let out a grunt as his semen blasted onto the floor like a fire hose, spattering up.  Jasmine let out a quick Pffffff, and turned his dick away toward the corner of the room before squeezing down harder and causing Jason to scream out in pain and stop the flow.  Jasmine tossed him against the wall, cracking the drywall and sending him back on his ass with a loud thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Jason, that\u2019s quite an ability you gave yourself there!  Kind of gross, but also kind of makes me wonder just how that ability translates to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a painful sigh as his bruised dick thankfully went placid even as all of her statements were causing him to shake with growing fear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think you turned yourself into a porn star busting super stud so you could intimidate me and I\u2019m guessing impress the girls, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to calm his breath, but his mind could only reel with what his changes had done to Jasmine.  He still hadn\u2019t gotten passed her comment about her ability to grow even more powerful beyond human capabilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine however, was currently thinking about other things as she stepped closer to him again and flexing up her mighty pecs, bulged her muscle tits so large he started to lose vision with her face!  Her rippling, pumped up wall of pectoral power was already 18 inches thick and her nipples now punched out three inches long and an inch thick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell guess what Jason?  I really had you beat in every physical ability before you improved us!  All of your percentage increases have turned ME into a super human porn star destroying ultra mega muscle girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine continued to flex her mighty pecs and more and more muscle pounded forth until the twin spheres of power were casting a shadow over his trembling body and he could see her now 5 inch long nipples were starting to drip, causing his eyes to widen as Jasmine started to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, nerd boy!  This, this is what sexual intimidation is all about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine pulsed her gigantic muscle tits and to Jason\u2019s continued horror, twin cannons of muscle milk blasted from her erect nipples so hard that the noise was nearly deafening and the sheer power was overwhelming!  Twin jets erupted forward, exploding into and then quickly through the wall like white hot laser beams!  Jasmine moved her chest down and around, forming twin J\u2019s into the wall before she let out a sigh and stopped the impossible flow of milk.  The last release sprayed a bit on Jason and he wiped the excess off his face and chest.  Jasmine smirked and peered out the holes she created, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, Jason, looks like my muscle milk not only punched through your walls, but tore up the neighbor\u2019s car across the street!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine\u2019s demeanor changed again as allowed her pumped up chest to recede so she could stare down at the nearly shaking mega muscled body of her twin brother.  She pulled her arms down to her side and flexed up her body into a wall of intimidation, pulsing her massive frame even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd speaking of tearing things up, dear brother.  Now that I have a taste of my power and know what you\u2019re capable of, we\u2019re really going to have some fun.  If you thought our little games of domination were rough before, you had better grab that big dick of yours, because you have no idea what I\u2019m going to dishing out now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason whimpered and stared up at Jasmine with growing dread as Jasmine laughed cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause now that I\u2019m fucking Supergirl, nothing can stop me now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine leaned forward as Jason\u2019s breath quickened and\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only attitude she'd ever really displayed toward him was a hostile one, but now that he was seven and a half feet tall and weighed in at well over a quarter ton he knew that Jasmine's hostility was probably  going to fade very fast. In a way, though, he hoped it wouldn't since it would afford him the chance to let her see that his new muscles weren't just for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moments between when Jason called to his sister and she appeared he tried to imagine how she was going to react. Surprise? Well sure, that was easy to guess. Anger? Perhaps, after all she just lost her favorite punching bag and was downgraded to being merely the second most physically developed person in their family. What Jason really hoped for, though, was fear. He'd lived so long in fear of his twin sister that he thought it was only fair. What he hoped would happen was she would look at his impossibly massive physique and realize that the terror she has wrecked upon him over the last decade was about to be returned to her a hundred times over. He wanted her to see her own doom in his giant muscles and grovel at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't expect, and what actually happened, was she rolled her eyes and let out a big sigh in a clear display of annoyance. Here he was, minutes ago a scrawny nerd and now the most physically impressive human to ever live and she couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to stammer some half formed question about why she wasn't cowering before him but Jasmine cut him off. \"Do we really need to do this every other day? I swear, at least three times a week you've got to tell me all about how you added two inches to this or ten pounds to that or broke this lifting record over here. It never ends! I get it, you're big. You think another inch on your arms means anything anymore? I'm over it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence while Jason's already addled brain worked quickly to figure out what was going on. He was disappointed that Jasmine wasn't scared or even surprised as he'd expected but he pushed those feelings aside, there'd be time for that later. Fortunately Jason was a smart guy and he was rapidly sifting through the situation for answers. The question he needed to figure out was why wasn't she surprised? Once he allowed for any possibility the answer was simple: she wasn't surprised because to her this was normal. He guessed that when he was rushing to select powers and abilities in Laura's phone he must have selected an option that adjusts history to match his changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another thing,\" Jasmine continued, \"you put yet another hole in the wall. If you're going to be this giant oaf at least learn how to steer that chunk of meat you call a body. It's really irritating to feel like I live in some condemned shack. I'm seriously afraid that one of these days you're going to bring this whole thing down on our heads. I mean it Jason, you were always such a fucking dweeb but in the three years since you started turning into this, this, whatever you are you've only gotten worse. The only thing more pathetic than a skinny dork is a buff one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to say something in his defense, after all at his size he shouldn't have to take any verbal abuse from his sister anymore. He had to admit, though, her words no longer carried the same sting since he was no longer in danger of being physically dominated by her. He really did feel like she was a fly to his elephant. Before he could speak he was distracted by the sounds of giggling coming from the hall. Clearly Jasmine's friends were getting a kick out of their leader giving him a tongue lashing. The sounds of their laughter triggered something inside Jason. He felt it begin in his pelvis and quickly move out through he penis. It was a quick pulsing sensation that vanished as quickly as it appeared. Two seconds later his penis pulsed again. Then again two seconds after that. The feeling continued in a perfect rhythm. The best comparison Jason could make was to that of a sonar ping. This turned out to be a perfectly apt juxtaposition because suddenly Jason was able to see the girls in the hallway even though they were still behind a wall. Well, see wasn't exactly the right word, rather he could sense them. He couldn't make out every detail about them, but they appeared in his mind's eye as perfectly formed silhouettes which gave him a very good idea of their dimensions and measurements. In fact he found that the effect worked on everything around him. He was receiving information about his sister, the room around him and the hallway for about 20 feet in both directions. It's just it was the unseen girls that he was most interested in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My penis is now equipped with radar? This is insane. What else did I do to myself?</i> Jason wondered. Momentarily ignoring his sister Jason instead explored this new power and tried to get as much information about the girls in the hall as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three of them and they varied in height from 5' 11\" all the way down to 4' 10\" with the third girl landing somewhere in between. Their body types, too, were incredibly varied: the tall one was slender and long while the second tallest was broad shouldered and densely muscled like his sister. The shortest was also the curviest by far and he could sense that she had breasts that put those of his long time crush, Vanessa, to shame as well as a very large, round behind. At the moment they were each simply shapes in his mind and he could hardly wait to see them in the flesh and fill in the remaining details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this information loaded into Jason's mind in an instant. He had basically forgotten all about his sister by this point and instead began to lust after her friends. Testosterone surged through his giant body igniting urges that he desperately wanted to satisfy. He became momentarily distracted by his penis. It was still steadily pulsing with whatever radar or sonar signal it was sending and Jason wondered if it was visibly twitching. He turned away from Jasmine to look at his own reflection. He watched for a few pulses and couldn't see his cock move. <i>I sure can feel it, though</i>, he though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister became enraged. \"That's your solution, you're just going to ignore me? What would happen if you went more than thirty seconds without looking at yourself in the mirror? Would you die? Would your muscles finally deflate from lack of attention? And why the fuck can't you have the common decency to wear some clothes? I have friends over and it's embarrassing; no one wants to see my freak of a brother walking around naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove her wrong three heads appeared around the door frame lined up like the Three Stooges. Her friends hadn't realized that Jason was nude but now that they knew they had the chance to glimpse his godlike physique in the buff they had to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glanced past his sister at the onlookers. Each was beautiful and looked all over his body with hungry eyes. The tall one was staring at his cock and biting her lower lip. He grinned and winked at them.  At long last he spoke for the first time since inviting his sister to view his new body, \"You sure about that, Jazz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to her friends. \"TRAITORS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the girls instead of simply sensing them seemed to activate yet another ability. The skin across the entire surface area of his body warmed and he could feel something flowing off of him and into the air. He knew right away that his body was calling to Jasmine's friends with pheromones ensuring that they were wild with desire for him. Already he could tell by the looks on their faces that it was working, they were no longer hungry for him but ravenous. Jason found that he could control the concentration of chemical and he took his secretion from a trickle to a flood. Each girl moaned gently then began climbing over each other to get into the bathroom so they could throw themselves at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Jasmine swayed where she stood and her face contorted into a look of great discomfort. He put a hand on her stomach and grunted. \"Well, you twerp, you finally did it. Your freakishly deformed body has made me sick to my stomach. I'm going to go lay down.\" She waved a dismissive hand at her friends without even noticing that they were still bickering amongst each other. \"Why don't you guys go home, I'll call you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just smiled as Jasmine left. Obviously the aroma that was driving his potential sexual mates wild was also useful for repelling non-potential mates like his biological sister. Now that she was out of the way it was time to really have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls,\" he said sternly, his powerful voice commanded his prey into silence, their arguing ended abruptly. \"You heard Jasmine, she asked you to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them looked like they were about to cry. The average heighted one with the amazing physique looked like she was about to say something but Jason held up his hand to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless, that is, you wanted to spend some time with me instead.\" Now they all lit up with excitement and began to charge towards where he stood. This time he held up both hands. \"Not here. You three head across the hall to my room and I'll be in there in a second.\" While his new friends attempted to squeeze through his bedroom door all at once Jason leaned forward, peering around his giant pecs to see if he could gather up his clothes and, of course, Laura's phone. However the changes the Alterations app had made to the universe must have extended to his activities prior to his growth as well because his clothes were gone...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No!\" Jason's heart sank when he realized that the magical phone that had granted him so much power was gone. Despite all he'd already given himself there was always that feeling of wanting more, keeping control, exploring further. Sadly he had changed the past so much that the phone had never come into his possession. If the clues he'd gleaned from Jasmine were accurate he'd been increasing in size for several years, in fact she has specifically said three years. Was there some specific incident that caused him to get bigger? Perhaps he'd always been naturally strong and only began working out three years ago. What about his height? Did his height increase as his mass did or was he naturally tall before three years ago? Lots of questions for sure but no matter what it meant that he'd been on this journey for some time meaning that he would have had no reason to come into possession of Laura's phone. Jason wondered if they were even still friends. He hoped that they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding to be sure that the phone was gone Jason hunkered down on all fours and searched the floor as well as his bulk would allow. \"When I buy my own house  I'm going to make sure the bathroom is much, much bigger than this one,\" he grumbled. He wondered if he'd used his size or strength to make money yet. Was he famous? So many questions. At the very least there was a trio of ladies in the next room that knew who he was. Jason abandoned his search for the phone but took solace in the impending loss of his virginity. <i>Am I a virgin in this reality?</i> he wondered. He stood and caught the reflection of his long, thick penis hanging down between his thighs. <i>Probably not.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jason entered his bedroom (ducking and twisting sideways to fit through the door) he found several new changes. His full sized bed had been replaced with a king sized mattress which lay directly on the floor since he probably would break any bedframe that was placed under him. There were giant dumbbells in the corner that appeared to hold hundreds of pounds of weight on them, but they were also collecting dust from lack of use; Jason assumed his strength had surpassed the challenge of those weights long ago. The wall on the far side of the room had been covered from floor to ceiling and wall to wall with a mirror which allowed Jason to finally get a full view of his new body. He was enormous. His head looked far too small to be placed atop such a mighty chest and between his mountainous shoulders. His body was shockingly vascular; veins spread across his titanic thighs like the root system of an ancient tree while his arms appeared to be fed by a hose-like vein that ran across the swell of his bicep leaving tributaries behind it wherever it went. He wanted to stand before the mirror and start testing his muscles with various flexes and poses but that would have to wait. He had company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis guests were scattered around the room, the tall one leaned against his dresser to his right wile the other two were closer to his bed to his left. His eyes drifted over their bodies reminding his cock that he was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome,\" he said attempting to put even more sex appeal behind his already powerful voice. \"Before we move on to\u2026 play time, I thought we should introduce ourselves. My name is Jason, I'm seven and a half feet tall, I weigh more than the three of you plus Jasmine combined, and I'm pretty much a demi god.\" He put his hands on his hips and flexed his chest, shoulders, back and legs in unison. His body swelled out in all directions more than Jason expected or thought possible, though his muscles still looked hard as diamond. Then, for good measure, Jason gave off a quick but very potent burst of his pheromone. Again he could actually watch the effect he had on all three girls at once as they looked like they could just melt into the floor right where they stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to regain her composure was the very fit one. She took a couple of steps towards Jason and made sure to swing her hips seductively. Based on their clothes Jason figured that they, like his sister, had all recently come from the gym. This girl was clad in yoga pants that extended down over her extremely well developed thighs and ended right at her shapely calf muscles. Her upper body was covered only by a rather skimpy black sports bra that showed off a deeply chiseled physique that looked like it had been carved from stone. Jason could tell that she wasn't as thick or bulky as Jasmine who valued size and power above all else but this girl was more defined for sure. Her abs especially were impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason fought to pull his eyes away from her body for a moment so he could take a look at her face. She was smiling broadly with an air of smug confidence and Jason spotted a thin, gold ring bisecting her lower lip. Her hair was an unnatural shade of bright red and was cut short in a bob that curved under her jaw, but when she moved her ears would peek out and he could just make out a multitude of piercings running up her earlobe. Her bangs covered her entire forehead and ended just above her eyes. Everything about this girls body said jock but her face told the story of a rockabilly girl. Jason wondered what she would have been wearing had she not just come from the gym, and the oddly exotic idea of a musclebound pin up girl got him excited. It was a combination he'd never really thought about which made it all the more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she said, \"I'm Chloe. Obviously my muscles are nowhere near as big as yours but I think what I have is pretty sexy. I especially love working my legs and getting them bigger and bigger. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe cocked her hip to the side and flexed her thighs while raising onto her toes slightly to accentuate her calves. Despite her yoga pants covering her legs Jason could make out the striated details of her quads through her stressed tights. While her upper body may not match up with Jasmine's this girl's legs were definitely the more muscular of the two which was no small feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to compliment Chloe on her hard work when he heard a huff from his right. He turned to find the tall blonde sauntering his way. She wore a loose fitting white button up shirt and tiny powder blue terry cloth shorts. The girl's body was very thin and her legs were very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If legs are what you're after there's no one around that can compete with these.\" She went up on her toes and spun a pirouette giving Jason a brief 360 degree view of her lovely pins. \"Would you believe they're 40 inches long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came right up to Jason and slid her lithe body right into the crook of his arm nuzzling herself up against his enormous chest. \"I'm Alex, by the way. I can't tell you how amazing it is to find a man that's so much taller than me. I'm not used to actually feeling short. I kind of like it.\" As tall as she was the top of her head didn't even reach Jason's shoulder but since her face was pretty much right in line with the massive swell of his bicep Alex didn't mind one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wrapped his beefy arm around Alex's narrow shoulders; the limb was just about as thick as her torso. This time it was Chloe's turn to huff and she quickly slotted herself beneath his left arm and started planting tiny kisses on his meaty chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at the third girl who was waiting patiently for her turn to introduce herself. \"And who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Jason's gaze was upon her she stood up straight puffing her chest out to highlight her very large bosom. \"I'm Mina,\" she said. Mina was petite in stature, a mere 4' 10\" tall, but her build was very curvy with round hips and large breasts. Her jet black hair and facial features informed Jason that she was of Asian descent, her face was round, her eyes almond shaped, but her skin tone was more brown leading him to believe she was mixed, perhaps with Latino blood. Like her friends she wore gym attire, her outfit consisted of tiny black lycra shorts that left her firm and juicy thighs on display as well as a white tank top over a pink sport bra that did nothing to hide her prodigious chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mina,\" Jason said, \"what do you bring to this party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina grinned and turned her back to Jason. Her hair was very long and hung down beyond the small of her back to the top of her behind was big and round. She pulled her hair over her shoulder so that it didn't get in the way of his view then she began sliding her tiny shorts down around her huge ass and let them drop to the floor. Beneath the shorts she wore a black thong that bisected the firm hemispheres of her behind. She glanced back over her shoulder and grabbed her butt with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got more ass than most guys know what to do with,\" she said. \"And the tits to go with it.\" She turned back around and gave her boobs a squeeze. Her flesh oozed up over the top of her sports bra. \"And all this comes with a nice little waist for the perfect hourglass figure.\" Now she lifted the bottom of her tank top to show off her surprisingly slender stomach. Jason could even make out the faint outline of her abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her introduction out of the way Mina quickly approached the buff giant. Chloe and Alex had stepped up their efforts and were now really beginning to rub their bodies all over Jason's. Chloe had removed her top and was on her knees sucking on Jason's meaty quads while grabbing handfuls of the steely muscles. Not to be outdone Alex was completely nude and grinding her pussy on his hip while running her fingers through the grooves of the abs on his stomach and sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina stood before Jason and craned her neck taking in the sight of the biggest man she'd ever seen. Their height difference was so extreme that her head only just lined up with his stomach, but as far as Mina was concerned that was perfect because just below his stomach was what she was really after.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mina reached out and greedily wrapped her hands around Jason's cock. Jason allowed his penis to fill with blood and harden in her hands. The tiny girl was stunned by how the member swelled larger and larger by the moment, spreading her fingers apart and stopping only when it reached 14 inches long and bigger around than her arm. Breathing heavily she pressed the head of Jason's cock against her stomach then up under the hem of her sports bra. She tried to slide his cock between her tits but it was just too big while her bra was confining her. In a flurry she whipped her shirt and bra off and spread her huge boobs apart then smooshed them around Jason's magnificent penis. She pressed her chest forward sliding his cock between her tits and moving the enormous head closer to her face. Her lips parted and she tried to get her mouth around Jason penis but it was the size of a fairly large orange so instead she began sucking hard on what bits of flesh she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason moaned with delight. He glanced over to the mirror he'd spotted earlier. As excited as he'd been to see himself a musclebound monster he was even more excited to see the reflection of himself being pleasured by three gorgeous girls at the same time. This was a life he hoped he never got used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid a hand under Alex's ass and easily lifted her up. The blonde girl wrapped her long legs around Jason's stomach while he turned to kiss her roughly, his tongue explored her mouth while she sucked on his lower lip so hard he thought she may rip it off. Thank goodness for my invulnerability, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ladies hold on down there,\" he said to Chloe and Mina who were still concentrating on his lower body. Chloe held tight to his thigh while Mina wrapped her arms around his cock. Jason flexed his penis gently lifting Mina off the floor and walked, with Chloe attached to his leg, to his bed where he gingerly laid down. With his body now in prone position the girls redoubled their efforts in pleasuring Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina and Chloe quickly removed their bottoms and each straddled one of Jason's thighs while they each attacked Jason's cock from both sides. They were pawing, pumping, sucking, licking, biting, and caressing his huge penis all while they both ground their vaginas against his quads. From time to time Jason would flex his thighs and each time the girls would scream in pleasure, the sensation of his muscles growing and hardening was more than enough to trigger orgasms in them both. Right about the time he figured they had recovered and caught their breath he would flex again and laugh to himself as they cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had clamored onto his chest but Jason had an idea for her. He had never performed oral sex (no received it before now) and wanted to give it a shot. It was only fair considering how the girls were taking care of him. So he picked up Alex by her waist and deposited her atop his mouth. The moment his super powered tongue entered Alex's pussy she became a writhing, thrashing animal. In a panic he lifted her higher and pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Alex yelled. \"No, please don't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to oblige Jason began again and though he felt she was trying to contain herself somewhat Alex began squirming again, but this time he sensed she was pressing herself harder onto his mouth. Jason responded by licking and sucking harder; he sensed she was shifting and moving to get him to hit specific places inside her so he did his best to comply and the results were obvious. Alex started screaming, her body wracked with constant waves of orgasmic pleasure. Jason managed to keep this up for a solid ten minutes (and could have continued indefinitely) before Alex asked him to stop. He set her down only just now considering that he'd been holding a 100+ pound person over his own head for a long time and never felt any strain at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex collapsed to his side panting and feeling spent so Jason invited each of the remaining girls in turn to have the same experience. Mina didn't last quite as long as Alex, she spent her turn mashing her giant boobs and tweaking her nipples then cried uncle after about seven minutes. As Jason suspected Chloe was the toughest and possessed the greatest willpower. She went more than twice as long as Alex had, the entire time pumping her substantial muscles until she was a pulsing, sweaty mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Chloe was done Jason set her aside then got up and stood before the mirror. He went through several poses watching the way his superhuman muscles bulged to impossible sizes making him feel more powerful than anyone in history. Behind him in his reflection he saw a trio of exhausted women coming down from a high greater than any they'd ever known, and that brought with it a different feeling of power. As amazing as that felt, though, Jason was still hungry. He figured he could spend a few minutes exploring his new reality, researching his new history, while his new friends recovered or he could go out and find more women to satisfy his hunger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Breathing a sigh of relief, he picked it up and moved into the bedroom where all three girls were on his king size bed.  Looking around his room he smiled.  The house he lived in was bigger now.  Was it always bigger in this new reality?  He also smiled as he had a full sized mirror on one wall and a full sized poster of himself flexing up a double bicep wearing a bodybuilding posing bikini bottom with Mr. Olympia written on the bottom.  Was he really the Mr. Olympia champion?  And he saw a huge barbell sitting at the foot of the poster with what appeared to be a ton of weight on either end!  While he loved all the changes, the history change was a bit disconcerting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there would be time to sort it all out soon enough.  Right now he had three gorgeous girls sitting on his bed and a modified penis aching for release. Three girls who in his previous life had no interest in him and treated him with the same disdain as Jasmine, flaunting their superior attitude in his direction and even pushing him around at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were under his control, the problem he had was that even though in this new world he must have become a stud, his current brain was still that of a nerdy virgin.  Three girls, even with all of his new equipment were more than he wanted. At least to start.  He was sure he\u2019d move there quickly, but for now he figured one would give him a chance to become familiar with the new body.  Smiling at the three girls lying on his bed he walked toward the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK girls.  One of you can be the lucky person who can stay.  The other two will have to go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expressions on their faces were like children who had their ice cream snatched from their hands.  They then all sat up and screamed out to pick them.  Jason held his hand out and spoke with the same deeper authoritative voice he had given himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have an arm wrestling contest?  The winner can stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all suddenly turned competitive and Jason watched with fascination as they quickly complied.  The girls moved into position and the first two girls soon were grasping hands.  Jason sat down to watch and looked at the phone.  One thing he thought about was the fact that with a penis this large it would be difficult to have any type of normal sex.  A cock this big would a painful fit or not a fit at all.  So with a shrug of his massive shoulders, Jason pulled up the profiles of each girl, the Ap somehow locking into whoever was close by.  As he headed to the main screen he noticed he could copy attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up he could see that one girl was already out and the winner of this match would get to stay.  The first loser was already crying.  So as he watched the final match unfold, he was a bit surprised that it was the shortest of the three that won.  Pulling up her profile he wondered if he could copy a male profile into a female.  With a couple of quick swipes, the ap popped up a comment that some changes were modified from male to female.  The other girl was now crying, so Jason asked the two losers to leave as he was starting to feel bad about the situation.  They walked out slowly and the winner was beaming with delight as she sat on the edge of the bed.  Jason smiled back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job, uh\u2026\u201d  Damn, he didn\u2019t even know her name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlicia.  I\u2019m so happy I won!  You, you\u2019re so incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked her over.  At only 4 foot 11, there was no way his monster cock was ever going to fit into a girl so small.  He was impressed with her physique however.  She was pretty built considering her short statue, looking like a jacked up gymnast.  She had on work-out clothes, having come from the gym with Jasmine and the others and her long blonde hair was a bit messy from the workout, but her blue eyes sparkled with excitement and he could see impressive arm muscles bulge as she gripped the sides of his bed.  As he stepped forward he heard the phone ping and he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChanges to Alicia set.  Warning!  Body type modifications applied to Alicia have varying results.\u201d  A See More button came up, along with the Apply button.  Jason paused and was about to hit the See More button when Alicia stood up and pulled off her top, leaving her in her sports bra.  Tossing the top to the side, she quickly pulled off the sports bra, leaving her topless and excited.  Her quick strip had a similar effect on Jason and his penis rose to attention with a thought as his jaw dropped slightly.  As Alicia kicked off her shoes, leaving her barefoot, and reached for the waistband of her athletic shorts, she stared nervously and lustfully at Jason\u2019s giant cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Jason.  I had heard how big your penis was\u2026. But wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled down her shorts and shimmied to have them fall to the floor, she kept her gaze on the biggest, thickest penis she had ever seen and then glanced way up into Jason\u2019s impressed eyes.  Alicia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled you find me attractive.  I\u2019ve heard you like your girls with some muscle.  I was a national level gymnast, but gave it up recently.  I put on a few pounds and joined the local gym.  That\u2019s where I met Jazz.  She got me into heavy lifting and I seem to put on muscle just by looking at the weights.  See!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia cocked out one hip and hit the sexiest double bicep pose he had ever seen.  He remembers Alicia from before.  She had smugly shoved him against the wall, holding him there with one strong arm while Jasmine and the other girls laughed.  But things have certainly changed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stared down at very large and hard looking twin softball sized biceps with nice splits, indicating a high level of musculature.  Her pecs were thick and the small, nearly flat tits rode high on the muscular shelf.  Alicia pulled in her stomach, flexing a hard six pack that would be the envy of most fitness and bodybuilding women!  Her thighs were bulging and meaty as well.  And the longer he stared the bigger and thicker his cock grew.  Alicia\u2019s eyes moved back to the monster as she continued to pulse her lusty muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god Jason!  How big can you get?  This is going be an interesting ride!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled in a breath, controlling his erection for a moment and realizing that he was only making true sex less attainable.  Wanting nothing more than to ride Alicia hard, he glanced back at the phone and hit Apply changes.  He quickly pulled his gaze back to Alicia as his heart pounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sighed, waiting to see what would happen the room took on a fuzzy appearance as if his vision were blurred.  He grunted lightly at the realization that he had made his changes historical, so the same would happen to Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as expected, Alicia began to add muscle and grow taller, only a bit slower than he would have expected considering he seemed to grow larger quickly in real time for him.  But perhaps that was just his assessment.  He wasn\u2019t sure, but as he watched Alicia\u2019s body continue to pump up larger and taller he started to remember a few things he had programmed.  Many of the improvements were percentage increases.  He swallowed hard and his heart began to race.  If his biceps were non-existent before and were now the biggest ever flexed, what is going to happen to Alicia and her already large biceps?  He was about to find out as Alicia\u2019s muscles pounded larger and larger across her growing frame.  Jason stared as she reached a height of 6 foot 1, her final height as he did the quick math in his head.  And her muscles, while very large, were proportional to her growth, so her flexed biceps didn\u2019t even appear to be 20 inches around!  Jason smiled.  Perhaps the ap made adjustments for females, scaling back her muscle size and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as let out a sigh of relief, those same muscles\u2026.all of her muscles began to surge forward at an alarming rate!  Jason gasped as muscles stacked upon muscles across her frame until they had all seemingly doubled in size!  Her muscle size was now near his, but on her smaller frame already looked bigger!  And as the fuzziness cleared and Alicia\u2019s frozen form slowly moved, she pulled her forearms back a bit and then forward again, bulling more muscle into her biceps and he gasped as he watched her arms inflate into twin towers of gigantic power, larger than he could have ever imagined were possible on anyone!  And it wasn\u2019t just her biceps that had surged larger, although they appeared disproportionally huge, but every muscle on her frame was male bodybuilder busting large!  And as Alicia brought her forearms up and squeezed her fists with a full flex, Jason\u2019s jaw dropped as her biceps expanded even more as each peak was up over her fists at her eye level!  And, and growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the new reality took hold, Alicia was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the thought of modifying himself certainly came to mind, Jason couldn't help but keep thinking of Donna. It'd been such a long time since he'd seen her. Long enough for her to become a stunning, muscular beauty. That smile alone... He had to admit; seeing the smooth definition of her toned bicep, as well as her firm rear, drove his libido into action. So much so that Jason pulled up her profile on the app, which displayed her 3D model wearing the same revealing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's try Donna then.\" Jason eventually decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers glided over the screen, picking the physical menu first, which presented him with numerous options for him to use. Jason remembered how he had altered Laura, using that knowledge to morph Donna in a similar way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first; muscles. If there was one thing he couldn't get enough off, then it was a woman with big muscles, which was one of the reasons why he had made his best friend bigger than her bodybuilder-sized brother. Donna needed to be as big as her. His thumb slowly slid the slider upwards, as he watched while the girl's body inflated with what had to be pounds upon pounds of solid muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't stop when she reached female bodybuilder standards, but neither did he when she reached those of most male bodybuilders. Instead, he stopped roughly at Laura' size. To make sure that the proportions were correct, he made Donna taller; around 6'6\" or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded to himself in satisfaction. This Donna was no longer a fitness instructor, but a bodybuilding marvel with over 200 pounds of muscle mass. Her biceps were an amazing 20 inches, while her thighs were 34 inches. But he wasn't just quite done yet. After all, what was a girl without some nice curves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app worked to accommodate to his preferences as he expanded Donna's breasts and ass. Because of the added muscle, her glutes were already a work of art, but the most recent alterations made her butt stand out even more; a true muscle booty the size of inflated footballs. Similarly, Jason increased the size of her bust. It was a shame that Donna had lost a cupsize or two because of her workouts. In order to rectify this, he made sure they were bigger again; a mouthwatering G-cup. Her hips widened, her waist became a bit more narrow, and even her muscles somehow contributed to her perfect hourglass figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's libido was almost going crazy at this point. The 3D model displayed by the app was the perfect mix of a curvaceous yet amazonian woman, and he loved it. To top it off, the teenage boy improved her looks a bit, using the natural beauty slider that also belonged to the physical section of the app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that gives me an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the physical changes saved, Jason switched over to the mental section. His first attempt at using the app had only taught him how the device could change a person's body. However, the app could do so much more, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hummed as he scrolled through the various options on display. Apparently, the app could make someone more aggressive, more sympathetic, more prone to suggestions, etc. There were so many possibilities! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really got this attention, however, was the apparent love interest function. Jason's eyes widened in excitement. This was it! Turning Donna into a perfect woman was already great, but making her fall in love with him? That was the icing on the cake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't hesitate to fill in his own name, and then increase the amount of love Donna held for him. A notification appeared, stating that he was now the number one person she cared about -- more than herself or anyone else. A victorious smile formed on his face. Just to be safe, he slid the loyalty bar upwards until it maxed out. Best to make sure he was the only man for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he was going a bit too far, turning someone into his personal love slave, but he'd already come this far so why back down now? Besides, didn't he deserve some happiness for once? No one could say that he had the best of lives in this place. His sister was a jerk, he was a social outcast at school, and muscleheads like Greg constantly pushed him around. It was his turn to be selfish! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't as if his own parents had had a solid relationship. He lived with only his mother because his asshole of a dad had filed a divorce, preferring a younger woman and practically abandoning his own son. Needless to say, Jason was quite paranoid when it came to relationships; Donna had to be loyal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping that in mind, and reassuring himself that this was a perfect move, Jason finished his modifications and saved them. Before he actually carried them out, he spotted a few more options; these ones asking how the change will be implemented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was immediate or historical. Jason raised an eyebrow in curiosity. He didn't remember which one he'd used last time, so he simply picked historical and hoped for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hit the apply changes button and watched as the app did its work. Well, kind off; the app was no doubt altering reality, but he'd need to see Donna to be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason put the phone away and chose to grab himself something to drink first. The weather was hot as usual, plus in his haste to escape Laura's possible wrath for changing her and taking the phone without her permission, he'd ran all the way back here. That was enough to make him thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds he'd filled a glass of water, and his body relaxed as soon as the cool liquid went down his throat. Jason let out an audible sigh of relief, enjoying the refreshing sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKNOCK, KNOCK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze turned to the front door. Jason approached it tentatively, wondering who it was. A part of him hoped it was Donna, who would then profess her immense love and undying loyalty to him. The other half dreaded it was Laura, angered and vindictive because of his theft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a deep breath and opened the door. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the door opened, Jason expected the sun to be shining into his eyes. After all, he was a pretty tall guy and not used to being shorter than others; only smaller muscle-wise. But that was not the case this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow fell over his body as he looked up at a verifiable amazon, whose massive frame was almost as wide as the front door of his house! Jason blinked several times in rapid succession to see if he wasn't hallucinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetie. Mind if I come inside?\" A somewhat deep, but sensual and definitely feminine voice caressed his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mind finally caught up with reality, and he nodded dumbly, \"Uh, yeah, sure thing. Make yourself at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe over six feet tall, professional bodybuilding, beautiful version of Donna sauntered inside the house, but not without quickly giving him a peck on the cheek. Heat rushed to his face in response. He could already feel his hormones surging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that the app had done a magnificent job would be a severe understatement. Similarly to Laura, Donna was a combination of insane curves and muscle mass. Her massive thighs rubbed against each other with each step, while her calves bulged like hard rocks, displaying a definition that had Jason's heart beating faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's clothing hadn't changed a lot; the tight, spandex shorts from earlier were the same, but the top was now nothing more than a bikini top. The former clung tightly to her round butt, hugging those perfect glutes and her wide hips, whereas the latter struggled to contain her huge breasts. What was even better was that Donna possessed a muscle cleavage. Those firm tits were sat on top of bloated, meaty pectorals of which a deep crevice ran in between, which showed just how well-developed her chest was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I, ah, get you anything? A drink, maybe?\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's so sweet of you. But don't worry; I know my way around.\" Donna smiled at him as she passed around the corner. From the side, he was treated to a view of her jackhammer-like arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer size of her naked bicep caused his dick to stiffen. Fat, angry veins covered that ball of muscle like little snakes. Meanwhile, her triceps represented thick cables, being so amazingly defined. Jason followed closely from behind, keeping his eyes on that arm. Even her forearm was thick and filled with sinews. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And before I forget, I've dropped off my kayak in the garage. You don't mind, right?\" Donna said as she filled herself a glass of water. She was leaning on the kitchen counter; the thick tendons in her striated back tensing, and her sculpted ass pushed into the air. Those thighs were incredibly wide, \"There's no room left in my apartment, so I really appreciate you looking after my stuff. But what else to expect from my amazing boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amazon of a woman giggled to herself, but Jason didn't -- he was too surprised. For a moment he wondered what Donna was talking about, before a flood of new memories hit him. His eyes widened in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app had created a new reality because of the historical changes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this timeline, Donna had taken a liking to her aunt's young neighbor. So much so that the older woman had begun lifting iron after finding out that Jason was a sucker for muscular girls. Years passed by, and the gains became greater and greater. This was followed closely by her developing figure and natural looks, making her one of the most popular and desired girls in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was currently a very known figure among the local bodybuilding community, and even had an online fanbase. A lot of bodybuilding contest trophies had her name on them. But that wasn't all. Due to her online presence, Donna was supported by many companies, who frequently asked her to promote their wares in exchange for money and other rewards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with her savings and the money she made through her job at the local gym, Donna had bought herself a modest apartment in town; just to be close to Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered Donna asking him out one day, ignoring the small but still noticeable age gap between them, and then elevating herself to girlfriend status. A lot of people -- both men and women -- gave him jealous looks whenever they were out in public, though none of them ever stood a chance with Donna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, the app had made sure that he was her only love, creating a bond of loyalty and affection that bound her to Jason. This gorgeous, muscular woman was all his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Jason? Are you alright?\" Jason was shaken out of his thoughts, focusing on his new girlfriend who was waving her hand in front of him. Naturally, the muscular arm flexed in all the right places, showing off her definition and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that. Just thinking about stuff.\" He apologized quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled coyly, coming close enough to the point that he could almost feel her breath, before placing her hands on his shoulders, \"Any chance you were thinking about me? Because I've certainly been thinking about you today. How I want to pick you up in my arms, carry you around and lift some weights while you admire my muscles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat... would be <i>awesome</i>. Jason's throat felt incredibly dry at the moment. His eyes automatically trailed towards her arms, gazing at her tight triceps and the various lumps of solid muscle. Underneath her large bust, he saw abs the size of cobblestones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're teasing me on purpose.\" He growled playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged!\" Donna giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beauty of a girl backed off and quickly downed the rest of her water. However, the teasing wasn't over just yet; Donna's eyes sparkled with mischief. The brunette dramatically popped her full lips and sighed, drawing attention as her tongue slowly caressed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched with rapid attention. He was practically rooted to his spot, unwavering as his focus was on Donna only. The tall amazon continued to play with her lips, and raised her right hand almost innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she clenched it <i>hard</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various muscle fibers under her skin squirmed, tensing and flexing as the definition of her arm was highlighted. Deep crevices in between the muscle groups became even deeper. Donna released the pressure, allowing the sinews to relax, but continued to flex mildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like a dance; one of strength, beauty and sensual teasing. Her bicep would slowly expand, hinting at its true size before suddenly stopping when those veins writhed, and then deflate back to its starting point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jason kept on looking, no longer caring that his girlfriend was technically teasing him. A girlfriend who was older, taller and far more muscular than him. Actually, things weren't so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stopped eventually, chuckling at his expression as she leaned in to kiss him on the lips. It was too short to be passionate or anything, but Jason's heart still felt like it was about to explode. Donna's lips were so soft, like velvet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to see that even after a few years of being together, I'm still the best at getting you excited.\" Donna said lovingly, \"Now, we have the entire afternoon to ourselves. It's a sunny day and the beach sounds lovely. Or would you rather do something else?\"</span></div></div>",

Just let me grab some stuff and we'll be off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left shortly after, choosing to walk to the beach instead of using Donna's car. After all, the house was located fairly close to the beach. Their trip was going to take ten minutes tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were walking through the neighborhood, Jason became aware of the numerous gazes pointed at his new girlfriend. People openly stared at Donna's massive frame with mixed emotions. Some seemed disgusted that a girl had so much muscle on her, whereas others were more open to the idea, and were either impressed or aroused instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contrast between himself and her was also very noticeable; him being only a bit shorter, but much less muscular than the girl at his side. She had to have at least a hundred pounds more than him. Still, Jason didn't feel intimidated at all. Donna would never hurt him because he had made sure of it. She didn't hover over him because she felt the need to dominate him or anything, but rather protect him from any danger; his personal amazon bodyguard/lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if it couldn't get any better, after changing into their beach clothes, Jason was treated to a sight that he would never forget; Donna in a skimpy, black bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA two-piece one, with the top being triangles that didn't completely conceal her massive mammaries and left a lot of boobflesh exposed. He had to regularly stop himself from starting too much at the underboob, sideboob -- there was a lot of boob involved! Similarly, her bikini bottom was rather revealing. The thin material seemed to be undergoing torture as it hugged her large glutes. Only part of her ass was covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, needless to say, Donna was an absolute bombshell whose outfit was getting a <i>lot </i>of attention. Combined with her tanned skin, beautiful features and herculean body, she was possibly the hottest girl in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they arrived at the beach without hassle. The amount of people present was about average. Being a local, Jason knew that tourists would be arriving in a week or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visitors that were already here were early ones, and he could see a lot of college students from out of town lounging around. In other words, he had to prepare himself for the muscleheads showing off, the hot cheerleaders seducing and taking advantage of others, and many other risks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, were it not for the cash that these tourists brought with them, they would be a total plague for the town. But he didn't need to worry about any of that. This was supposed to be a fun moment between him and Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I see a free spot up ahead. Let's claim it before anyone else does.\" His girlfriend proposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, there was a perfect spot just below one of the dunes, but relatively close to the nearby vendors. There were no chairs though. Donna noticed, so she slung her bag over her T-shaped back, and then grabbed two nearby chairs with each hand. The way she carried all that weight around made it seem effortless, but Jason knew a lot of people would struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the next few minutes setting their gear up; towels, the chairs, a parasol and other necessities. Donna even got them a few sandwiches, which she had prepared beforehand, being the thoughtful person she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw various people milling around. Some locals that he recognized, but also a lot of tourists; most of them being college students. There was even a small group having a party up ahead. He also saw others playing volleyball. All in all, the beach wasn't empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This never gets old.\" She hummed pleasantly, lying down on one of the towels. The muscular gal was soaking up some sun, working on her already perfect tan, \"Jason? Would you be a dear and rub some lotion over my back? I don't want to get a sunburn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Just a moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it! He grabbed the small bottle inside their bag, though his eyes widened considerably as he saw a pair of heavy dumbbells lying inside. Jason's breath hitched when he saw the printed number sixty on the side. Had Donna being carrying these the entire time? Just how strong was she?! Also, how the hell could a bag support that much weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wisely decided to not pay any attention; instead focusing on the lotion. Jason walked over to his amazon girlfriend, admiring how her back was a maze of muscle fibers. After opening the bottle, he put a decent amount of lotion on his hands before rubbing them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here we go.\" He warned her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna let out a pleased sigh as his hands made contact with her skin. It was surprisingly soft, as if she took real good care of herself, but underneath the velvety layer was nothing but dense muscle. Jason was in awe. He kept rubbing in the lotion, but in the meantime he explored her backside, prodding and groping her muscles. They were incredibly hard, hinting at their strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands trailed over to her bulging traps, kneading the large muscles and marveling at their density. Jason allowed his  fingers to explore the splits in between her muscles. There were many crevices to discover, and the definition of muscularity that Donna seemed to possess was even more impressive now than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hold on a second.\" Donna spoke up all of a sudden. The older woman reached out to her back where her bikini was bound her chest, and pulled at the knot to undo it. He gulped audibly when the top slid off of her body. Now he could not only see her perfect, sculpted backside, but also her huge breasts spilling out on the towel, \"There; that should make things easier for you. Oh, and Jason? I don't mind if you do my chest too ~~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teasing undertone was enough for his already prominent boner to twitch. Damn! Had Donna always been this flirtatious, or was it because of her love for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't going to complain. Jason chuckled as he allowed his hands to roam freely, inspecting her powerful body and enjoying it to the fullest. He let his fingers slide over the blocky muscles of her obliques, before heading southwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he arrived at her marvelous glutes. Jason had to suppress a groan when he placed both of his hands on those meaty balls of muscle. Donna's ass was perfect; her cheeks felt so firm and solid, but at the same time they were the tiniest bit of squishy. He was going to need more lotion for this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna moaned softly during his ministrations, \"God, you're a natural at this, babe. Makes me happy that I dedicate so much time to the squat rack. If I had known that you were so good, I would have worked out my butt even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he was done, her butt was shining with a hefty amount of lotion applied to it. Jason gave it a light slap for good measure, eliciting a giggle out of the woman that was head over heels with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came her legs, and dear lord, weren't they just magnificent. Jason smeared the lotion all over her tree trunk thighs, poking the cable-like hamstrings, which had insane definition to them. Donna seemed to take notice of his fascination with her legs; she tensed them and allowed him to get a good look. Those thighs were verifiable killing weapons -- no doubt. Maybe they should try and crush some fruit in between them sometime? He had to admit that the idea of Donna squeezing the life out of watermelons, juices running down the splits of her muscles, would be an interesting sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, he spent time on her lovely calves. They were as big as the rest of her, not to mention hard and strong. Donna's calves were so large, in fact, that they jutted out the side somewhat, meaning that you could see them perfectly from the front due to their girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! All finished.\" Jason announced proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend's backside, which was immensely muscular and striated, was now glistening in the sunlight. The tanned expanse of her back looked all the more appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sweetie.\" Donna smirked as she suddenly leaned and gave him another kiss. Somehow she tasted like vanilla; a taste that he couldn't get enough of, \"I'm truly blessed to have such a good boyfriend. Keep this up, and we'll be back home in our bedroom. Or maybe you're feeling adventurous and you'll take me right here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks quickly turned as red as a tomato, \"Donna! There are people here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tease simply giggled in response, thinking his reaction was cute. Jason rolled his eyes and sat back in his chair, desperately trying to hide his erection -- his body was a damn traitor -- as also he enjoyed the sun.</span></div></div>",

But she was still amazing.  Tall, curvacious and with almost impossibly large breasts for her frame \"Middle Laura\" was probably just as sexy as \"Ultra\" in her own way.

Some were as confusing as \"subconscious desire,\" \"external stimuli (select at least one)\", or as straightforward as \"angry.\"  After hesitation he decided to key the first transformation to \"arousal level.\"  If he understood the settings the more aroused Laura got the more complete the transformation would become.  He set it to complete the transformation a bit before \"intercourse\" on the arousal scale.  He saved and moved on to the next trigger.  Middle Laura to Ultra Laura, hmm.  It seemed appropriate that the next trigger would be \"orgasm.\"  Easy enough.  He noticed a setting \"previous stage prerequisite for current stage?\"  He made sure the box was checked.  Then the Hulk stage.  On the sliding scale of sexuality he had been working with the fourth stage didn't quite make as much sense.  After a bit of thought he shrugged, unchecked the \"previous stage prerequisite\" box and just selected \"extreme rage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuration was the last menu.  Permanent didn't seem like much fun so he selected temporary on all of the stages.  Since stage two was directly keyed to arousal he didn't think he needed a reversion trigger.

As Laura turned back to the TV she did a double take.  Had Jason been working out lately?  Usually he wore baggy oversized shirts but this one was pulled tight over a chest that looked to be in surprisingly good shape.  She tried to think back to the last time she saw him with his shirt off and it was at least last summer.  He knew she hated going to the beach and it had never seemed to be in his nature to want to flaunt his physique either, but maybe that was changing?  Laura silently cursed herself for being even lazier than the poster boy for geekdom who apparently could at least find the time to work out.  She found her gaze drawn back to him and her eyes widened when she realized he even had a noticeable bicep as he fidgeted in his seat.  When did that happen and why hadn't she ever noticed?  Her eyes widened further as she realized he was fidgeting because he apparently had a hard on and it was much larger than she would have guessed.  It was her turn to blush as she returned her gaze firmly to the TV.  She didn't ever check out her friends package she chastised herself.  He didn't think about her that way anyway.  A few seconds of watching Vash the Stampede make a fool of himself on TV made her rationalize that Jason BETTER think of her that way because he certainly shouldn't be getting hard watching this...  Her mind churned a thousand miles an hour as she tried to decide what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason fidgeted again, this time with worry as Laura stared straight ahead at the TV with an unreadable stone face.  She had caught him staring at her and he wasn't sure how she was reacting.  His mind waffled away from how awesome it would be to watch Laura turn into a busty sex goddess to how horrible it would be if she got mad at him and it destroyed their friendship.  He would have to tell her what he did with the iPhone app before things went any further.</span></div></div>",

A small hole appeared in her tank top between her breasts.  It grew larger with short harsh tearing sounds until Laura hooked her index fingers into the hole and pulled, tearing open the front of her shirt and letting her breasts spill out.

But then he looked at Laura again and became excited over the possibility of watching her legs get longer, her muscles swell and, above all else, her boobs burst out of her top.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically it was the thought of arousing and transforming her that drove Jason to elect his other option since the mental image of his best friend growing breasts bigger than her head awoke his oversized penis which was now hardening despite the fact that there was clearly no room to grow.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood up while turning away from Laura so she wouldn't see the giant bulge in his pants. \"I'm going to run to the bathroom. Be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kept her eyes locked on the TV and excused him with a wave. Jason walked slowly toward the bathroom, then made a last second swerve for the stairs that lead to the upper floor and Laura's room. He crept along slowly so she wouldn't hear him and scanned the floor for the missing iPhone. He entered her room and continued his slow search. Finally he spotted the phone just sticking out of Laura's half-opened closet door. He picked it up and made his way across the hall to the upstairs bathroom. Where he closed and locked the door behind him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was still heavy with moisture from Laura's shower but the mirror was free of condensation and Jason was able to get a look at himself for the first time since using the app. He set the phone down on the counter and pulled his shirt off. What he saw brought a smile to his face; gone was the skinny frame he was used to and in was a new and improved physique. He couldn't really call himself buff just yet, but he had the lean, muscular build of a track and field athlete. Had he been average in size before and not painfully skinny the added 30 pounds of muscle would have been more substantial, but instead it hung tight on his body and made him look cut to pieces.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he undid his fly and freed his throbbing member from its tight confines. At long last he laid eyes on his new tool and was utterly shocked by what he saw. He hadn't realized that he'd been setting the length and girth for his penis in its flaccid state and now the giant head of his penis hung down two-thirds of the way to his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped the thick shaft and lifted his 13 inch member. \"God, it's so heavy.\" He gave it a squeeze and felt a pleasurable jolt shoot up his spine. His penis awoke and sprang to life, filling with blood and hardening in Jason's hand. He watched with increasing amazement as his manhood swelled and lengthened growing well beyond the size he had intended and quickly putting any and all porn stars to utter shame. By the time his cock was fully erect it was 25 inches long from the base to the head and bigger around than a soda can. Jason wrapped both hands around his enormous penis and held it against his body. The apple sized head stretched beyond the length of his stomach and touched the base of his pectoral muscles.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \"I guess I need to be more careful with that app, there is definitely no way in hell any woman on earth could or would do anything at all with a dick this big.\" His eyes were drawn back to his reflection. He had to admit his horse cock looked amazing. If only the rest of his body was as spectacular. Then he looked back to Laura's phone. \"Well, why can't I have a body to match my schlong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unlocked the phone and found the app still running. In fact it still had his profile open. Jason immediately selected the muscle mass slider and began quickly ramping up his avatar's size. He continued to add muscle until the display at the top of the screen told him that his enhanced body weighed in at 550 pounds. The screen showed a Jason that was bursting with muscle; he had arms that, unflexed, dwarfed his head and legs that were bigger around than his chest was currently, heck, they were probably twice as big around as his chest. \u00a0Now the giant cock hanging down toward his knees looked much more at home. It seemed much more natural for a giant like that to have a giant sized dick. Finally, for good measure, Jason found the strength slider and pushed it far to the right until it read 1000x. He was about to adjust the density slider as well, like he had for Laura, but decided that there was no need to be greedy. He'd already be giving himself more strength than any human being had ever possessed. The thought of superhuman strength caused his two foot long cock to throb with excitement.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to hit the \"Apply Changes\" button when he decided that he wanted to have the ability to transform like he'd given to Laura. He quickly tapped through the options and set up a transformation profile and set his trigger to allow him to change into his hulking alter ego and back again at will. This also allowed him to go back to his standard form and readjust his penis size to something more manageable; a measly 7 inches when relaxed which he hoped would make him at least 11 or 12 inches long when hard. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hit the \"Apply Changes\" and felt a strange warmth flow over his body. He was a little saddened to see his enormous cock shrink down a bit, but also quite happy when he saw his fully erect member settle on a rather sizable 11 inches. He laughed to himself, \"I guess simply huge will have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason closed the app, locked the phone, and slid it into his back pocket. He then stuffed his penis back into his pants and put his shirt back on. He took one last glance at his reflection. He desperately wanted to trigger his transformation and expand into his monstrously muscular form, but he fought the urge knowing that his clothes wouldn't survive and he'd have nothing to wear after changing back. Instead he exited the bathroom and gently tossed Laura's iPhone back into her room before going downstairs and rejoining her on the couch.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell took you so long?\" she asked keeping her eyes on the television.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" he said nervously. \"Must have been something I ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched TV together for another hour or so, all the while Jason's desire to trigger his transformation grew stronger. Finally he couldn't stand it any longer, he had to give it a try and he desperately hoped his buff body would turn Laura on so that she could begin her transformation as well.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood up and stretched. \"I'm hungry. You want to go get some food somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored her question and instead decided he couldn't wait any longer to hulk out. \"Do you believe in superpowers?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat do you mean by superpowers?\u201d Laura asked. She was a bit confounded by his random question, but Jason was always asking nerdy sorts of things from out of the blue so she took it in stride. \u201cDo you mean do I believe that people could have heightened abilities that border on superhuman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d He stood up next to her and looked down into her eyes so she would know he was serious. \u201cI mean do you believe that a person could spontaneously grow giant, super humanly strong muscles? You know, like The Incredible Hulk only, uh.. not all green and angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe that sort of thing could happen. I wish it could so I could finally put Greg in his place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ignored her desires to one-up her brother; he was too excited to show off his own bulging muscles and trigger her super sexy transformation. He took Laura by the hands and moved her back to the couch. \u201cHere, sit down. I have a secret to show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Laura was seated Jason began stripping off his clothes. When he dropped his pants Laura began to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Have you lost your mind?\u201d She stopped when her eyes caught sight of the large bulge in his briefs. \u201cOh.. heh... is that your secret? That you\u2019ve got a big dick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason kicked his clothes aside and stood before Laura clad only in his underwear. He grinned wide when he saw that Laura\u2019s nipples were hard and pressing against her tank top. In fact he could clearly see that her breasts were now beginning to swell. She was becoming aroused already. She leaned forward and Jason watched as her brown hair lightened very slightly and lengthened down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s big?\u201d he said. \u201cJust you wait.\u201d And with that he lifted his arms and triggered his transformation. He was instantly glad he\u2019d removed his clothes as his body exploded out in all directions manifesting massive muscle from nowhere. Jason\u2019s chest surged forward with abandon while his shoulders widened and his arms erupted like volcanos. He bent his arms inward to a double biceps pose and Laura\u2019s eyes widened as her friends once skinny arms flooded with sinew. Already Jason\u2019s biceps looked to be about the size of soft balls, and they were still rapidly growing. He relaxed his arms and curled them in again, this time matching Greg\u2019s 20 inch guns. He relaxed and flexed again and his swelling pipes outgrew anything ever flexed by anyone in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn\u2019t see beyond his engorged chest, but he could feel his underwear ripping apart from the strain of his hardening cock. He glanced down and saw that Laura\u2019s eyes were wide and had been running all over his metamorphosing body, but now that his dick had broken free and now stood tall at 18 inches and growing her gaze was solely aimed at his crotch. Jason laughed to himself when he saw that Laura was bitting down on her lower lip and crossing her legs. Her hair was even more golden now and her breasts were easily a C cup, though she was so engrossed in his transformation that she hadn\u2019t yet noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could feel his entire body growing not only in size but power. It was as though he had been hooked up to a nuclear reactor and every fiber of his being was flooded with energy. He felt like he could juggle busses, toss tanks and demolish buildings. He became distracted from his amassing strength by the feel of his thigh muscles becoming so huge that they were pressing into each other. He had to readjust his stance to give them each more room to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his growth slowed to a stop and Jason stood with his hands on his hips, puffing out his immense chest. \u201cSo,\u201d he spoke in a voice deeper than he\u2019d expected, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d Jason flexed his thighs which hungrily surged out widening into pillars of power as thick as tree trunks and strong enough to squat a locomotive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Laura spoke softly standing up from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, pretty cool, huh?\u201d Jason flexed his right arm showcasing a bowling ball sized bicep and an arm that measured 35 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Laura repeated a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m, like, way, way stronger than I look. Like off the scale strong.\u201d Jason curled his arms together in a mind blowing crab flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI CAN\u2019T BELIEVE.. YOU!!!\u201d Laura yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was knocked out of his muscle fueled reverie and actually saw Laura for the first time in several minutes. She looked different, but not how he had expected. She was clearly taller, probably nearing 5 feet 10 inches tall, and her musculature was expanding beyond what he had set up as \u201cMiddle Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow cold you do this to me?\u201d Laura was clearly seething. \u201cI\u2019m stuck here with the busty beauty queen and the muscle head wishing I could have even a smidgen of what they have but taking solace in the fact that at least there\u2019s one person in the world who understands me, who is like me, only to find out that I\u2019m so wrong. Apparently he\u2019s FUCKING SUPERHUMAN!?! HE\u2019S MY BEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD AND HE KEPT A SECRET LIKE THAT FROM ME!!! I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO THAT!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, hang on, I can explain. Calm down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! I\u2019M NOT GOING TO CALM DOWN!! I\u2019M ANGRY!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to Jason before she even said it that she was pissed. It was as clear that her body was transforming into the Hulk stage. Already she was passing his height at 6 feet and was still growing. Her body was a match for her brother\u2019s in muscle size, but was rapidly expanding. Her tank top was pulled taut across her enormous chest and her shorts were snapping at the seams from the strain of her exploding glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason decided to sit back and enjoy the show. He figured that the would laugh about this in a few minutes when she calmed down and realized that she had the body of her dreams. He knew that Laura was going to be much taller and much, much bigger than he was, but he was confident that the setting he\u2019d given himself regarding his strength levels would be plenty to keep himself save.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later Laura\u2019s body surged beyond Jason\u2019s size and kept right on growing. Her shirt split down the center and she absentmindedly pulled the strips of fabric from her glistening, pulsating body. Her shorts and underwear followed suit moments later leaving her completely naked and still growing lager. The top of her head reached the 8 foot mark and Laura took in a deep breath, flexed every muscle in her enormous body, and let out a roar of epic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had to cover his ears and he could feel the sound waves pounding his chest. All the windows in Laura\u2019s house exploded out from the sheer volume of her monstrous bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked down on Jason, her heavy breathing caused her 3 foot thick wall of diamond hard sinew to rise and fall. Laura clenched her fists causing her massive arms to swell larger around that her chest had been moments ago. Her titanic arms were over 50 inches around and hung from shoulders that were set 4 feet wide. Laura flexed her monumental thighs which pulsed and grew to such proportions that Jason doubted that he\u2019d be able to reach his arms even halfway around either of their circumferences. As she flexed her thighs and calves Jason could hear Laura\u2019s bare feet digging into the floorboards causing the wood below to creak and snap from the viselike force of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI NEVER REALIZED THAT ANGER COULD FEEL SO GOOD.\u201d Laura said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, are you ready to listen now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S NOT NICE TO PATRONIZE A GIANT, LITTLE MAN.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried not to laugh out loud. He was pretty confident that he was still the stronger of the two. He just hoped he could get Laura to listen to reason so she could enjoy her new body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cImagine what it must be like to make out with our super bodies\u201d Jason commented at the sight of Laura\u2019s new immense body, silently hoping his sentence would hint to her to give him the ultimate blowjob of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Laura had other plans now as she gave him a sinister smile. In her mind, she was thinking of things, many dark and evil things\u2026 ways to use her new gigantic form to punish everyone who had taunted her over the last few years. First she had to test out her strength, which she was confident had increased tremendously with these huge muscles she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll make out with you\u201d she said bluntly. Jason, not noticing the mischievous grin on Laura\u2019s face, watched as she stomped her huge body forwards \u2013 at a solid 8 feet tall, the top of her head almost touched the ceiling while she stood dwarfing Jason whose eyelevel barely reached the bottom of her huge breasts. And despite having hulked out to massive proportions, Jason still stood tiny next to Laura who had quadruple his bulk and muscle. \u201cActually, let\u2019s just cut to the chase and play rodeo\u2026 I\u2019ll be the massively muscular cowgirl and you can be my puny subservient slave stud\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick shove, she easily pushed him to the ground and straddled him with her 1800 lbs body, which was still manageable by his heightened levels of strength, but barely so as he had to exert near the limits of his strength to support her. Immediately, Laura mounted his shaft and began to ride him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, not so rough!\u201d Jason cautioned as she started to recklessly slam her weight up and down while her muscled pussy slurped in and thrust out his huge penis repeatedly. But Laura didn\u2019t appear to hear him as she pressed down on his muscular chest with her hands and rode him like a horse, breathing in a labored manner with her eyes closed and without stopping. \u201cLAURA! ARE YOU LISTENING?!\u201d he spoke louder but it became apparent with her ignorance who was in charge here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could barely move an iota as Laura exhibited full control over his body pinned under hers. She quickly reached her first orgasm which was the most intense she had ever felt, millions of times better now compared to any she had experienced with her underweight body, and then another, and another. It seemed not only did her large muscles increase her strength, they also amplified the intensity of her orgasms, boosted her arousal levels and heightened her sex drive and ability to insane levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Ahh!!\u201d Jason wailed as each orgasm made Laura squeeze his lower body between her bulky thighs with mounting pressure. But at the same time, Jason couldn\u2019t cum since Laura clamped her muscular vagina down on his dick each time she sensed he was about to ejaculate, making him feel pain and delaying him from pumping his load into her. \u201cSTOP! I\u2019m serious! Stop! It hurts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Laura just heedlessly and ceaselessly slammed her body down on him and his dick again and again, driven by her simultaneous anger and arousal. It wasn\u2019t long before squishing and cracking sounds were heard from Jason\u2019s body from the constant impact from her body and thighs that squeezed together tighter than a hydraulic press. Laura\u2019s riding finally slowed down as she came to a stop and got off her perch on Jason\u2019s body, leaving him breathing hard in pain and exhaustion while she looked perfectly calm as though that workout had barely fazed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood astride Jason, looking a mile tall from his viewpoint, before she unleashed a final glob of juices from her dripping snatch onto his face. \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\u201d Laura released a moan whose low frequency rumbled the house while she stretched her limbs; she wasn\u2019t very sure if it was Jason\u2019s fantastic cock or the pleasure of tearing his leg muscles and fracturing his thighs that made her this aroused, but one thing was for sure: this little warm-up barely pushed her body to the limit and she now knew she had an unimaginable amount of strength just waiting to be tested and used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards Jason and squatted beside him, placing her hand around his erection and lazily shifting her hand up and down the shaft. \u201cHere\u2019s a reward for being such a good boy\u201d she drove him to ejaculation and made him shoot out a thick wad of cum that sprayed with a lot of pressure onto the ceiling. Laura then stood up and, without a word, headed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Where are you going?\u201d Jason called out. This was horrible and definitely not what he had bargained for. Just wait till he got his hands on the phone and reverted her changes\u2026 then he would ravish her far worse than she had just done to him. But wait\u2026 Jason placed his arms on the floor behind his back and tried to get up to his feet, but all he felt was a searing amount of pain in his thighs which forced him to fall back onto the floor. His legs hurt so much, and he was sure Laura had broken several things, that he couldn\u2019t get up. Jason\u2019s attention was distracted from his legs as he heard a deafening crash come from the garage, though it wasn\u2019t nearly as loud as Laura\u2019s moans and roar he had heard earlier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile to further test her strength, Laura had pounded her gigantic boulder-like fists into the front of her parents\u2019 car with such force, it flattened the front of the car and engine block completely while propelling the rear of the Ford upwards into the garage ceiling from the impact to the front. Jason heard Laura laugh menacingly, evidently drunk with the power that coursed through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked right into the garage door and crashed right through it as if it was as soft as aluminum foil as she headed out. As she walked, she contemplated who she wanted to torment first\u2026 Tara, the tall 6 foot 6 star volleyball player, and also school bully who constantly played pranks on her and called her a scrawny bitch\u2026 or Henry, the football jock who had tried to force himself on her before. Then she made up her mind to first teach a lesson to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had went to the same high school where Tara was the prized volleyball player year after year since starting high school; she had also been the school\u2019s biggest bully, literally and figuratively, for about the same amount of time. Back in the early days, Tara was already 5\u20198\u201d tall and very athletic; she could outrun and outwrestle everyone, including boys, without even blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went through several small growth spurts over the years which brought her up to 6 feet by her 18th birthday. But something unexpected happened during the summer before college started when she went through another growth spurt which was far more tremendous than any other increase she had experienced before. Over the course of several weeks while vacationing, Tara grew 6 inches and put on dozens of pounds in weight, most of it being muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing since for that span of time, she looked like a new person every time she stepped out of her beach house onto the soft sand; each time she was taller and ever slightly curvier and more muscular. Consequently, her hunger was insatiable and every night, she would literally empty out her fridge and could probably beat most guys in an eating contest\u2026 yet by some genetic wonder, her body would never put on an ounce of fat and all that food somehow went to building her stature. Her beach house neighbors, the other rich college kids who spent their days lazing by the sea and working their tan every day, were lucky enough to witness her transform from a 6 foot, 145 lbs supermodel-like beauty into a full on 6 foot 6, 200 lbs drool-worthy amazon who dwarfed most of them over the matter of a few weeks. She had already been recruited for her college team but would give the coaches a surprise with her new height, and strength, which would blow away the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara continued to savor the massage when suddenly she heard people screaming and the ground begin to tremble violently. Before she could even put on her sunglasses and get up, she noticed a huge shadow had now cast itself over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost fainted from shock as she looked up to the sight of a writhing mass of muscle, an 8 foot tall muscle goddess with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRecognize me? Look at who\u2019s the scrawny bitch now\u201d Laura smiled evilly as she tentatively ground one hand balled into a fist into her other hand, flexing her enormous arms lined with super-dense, extremely ripped muscles. Laura pounded one fist into the beach chair that Tara had been lying on and hoisted it into the air before compressing the metal frame into a tiny clump the size of a tennis ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed Tara and stuffed her head between her humongous thighs which were armored with massive bunches of muscles that could pop a man\u2019s head as easily as a grape. \u201cI\u2019ll give you two choices\u2026\u201d Laura announced as she flexed her legs, compressing Tara\u2019s head between them \u201cServe me like a slave\u2026 or I could splat your head\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tara had always been bigger and stronger than anyone around, but somehow she had packed on nearly 50 pounds of solid muscle and, even more impossibly, grown half a foot taller seemingly overnight. The truth that no one but Tara knew was that it would have been impossible if not for a strange iPhone app that she had found called Alterations. She had used the app to increase her height and beef up her body. She'd even given herself super strength beyond what her size would normally allow. Alterations had allowed her to give herself the body of her dreams and she would spend every night before the mirror flexing her 18 inch biceps and curling 500 pound dumbbells to get herself excited, then she would collapse on her bed and begin rubbing her vagina and clit until she orgasmed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer superior strength was meaningless now, though, since Laura had somehow grown into a straight up behemoth.

Finally she gave up even trying.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, YOU BITCH?!? DO YOU SUBMIT TO YOUR GODDESS??!!\" Laura's voice vibrated through her body so that even though Tara's ears were smothered by slabs of sinew the words reached her loud and clear.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pride was great and the last thing she wanted to do was give in, even if she was horribly outgunned. However she knew that if she could get to her phone she could turn the tables on the overgrown freak. For the time being she put her ego aside and relented.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give, I give, please let me go! I'll do anything!\" Tara yelled, preying Laura could hear her.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S A START. BUT YOU NEED TO SHOW THE PROPER RESPECT. CALL ME YOUR MUSCLE GODDESS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara must have hesitated too long because the vise on her head tightened. \"OK OK OK!!!! Please release me, Muscle Goddess so I can worship you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura released her hold on Tara who spilled backward onto the sand.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD. NOW KISS THE FEET OF YOUR GODDESS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara crawled forward and placed her lips on Laura's feet. \u00a0She swore to herself in that moment that she would have her revenge for this humiliation.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- -\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at Laura's house Jason was crawling pulling himself into Laura's room where the her phone still lay. His legs had been destroyed, but his upper body was plenty strong enough to get him where he needed to go. Once he had the phone it was a quick matter of repairing his legs. Next he turned his attention to fixing the mess he'd made.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- -\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was growing bored with her new servant. She'd been hoping Tara would put up more of a fight, but breaking her had been far too easy. She decided that perhaps it would be more fun to wreak havoc elsewhere. Perhaps the jocks and bodybuilders at the beachside workout area would like to see what real muscle could do.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura reached down and picked Tara up, holding her so the two were eye to eye. \"I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW TO SWIM, IT'S TIME TO PUT THOSE LITTLE MUSCLES TO WORK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura then threw Tara's body out over the ocean. She flew through the air and landed head first in the water over a half mile from the shore. Tara was saved by her super strength which she then put to use swimming back to shore. The whole way back she was fuming; she'd make Laura pay.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Not wanting Laura to find out he had been messing with her phone, he decided best to return to Gregs profile.  Jason played around with the phone while listening to the shower running in the other room waiting to flee when Laura was done.  Jason swelled Greg's 3D model back to the cartoonish size and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Haha, Wow I think that would be too big for even Greg.\" Jason said as he looked down at the absolutely massive size of the image.  It was overflowing with so much muscle that it looked as if the arms would barely be able to bend, and Greg's patented tank top was stretched to its limits.  \"Lets make it a little more realistic.\"  Jason said as he swiped his finger across the screen, the 3D model reducing in size until it returned to what Jason beleive was the Greg's normal size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Man what i would give to look like that\" Jason said reveling at the image.  What Jason did realize was that even Greg would love to look like what the image was showing.  Greg had always been a lifter but after he was done playing high school football he didnt want to stop lifting, so he started getting serious about bodybuilding.  The first few years Greg's body had made leaps and bounds quickly growing in size.  But soon he hit a plateau not growing any bigger like he wanted, He was always jealous of other lifters.  At 6'2\" Greg is far from short but was always felt if he was taller his body could hold even more muscle.  Greg had always wanted to prove you could get just as big naturally as you could with other means.  But it started looking more and more that the only way to keep getting bigger was to move onto steroids or growth hormones, which he refused to do because he didnt want to risk the very average package he had in his shorts.  Greg resigned himself to not being massive but still being the best at his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jason had returned the image to what he beleived Greg looked like.  Jason had always been jealous of Greg's size and in his mind Greg was larger than he truely is.  The 3D image was was packed with muscle, even larger than some steroid using bodybuilders.  ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/38723895@N02/4720019290/sizes/l/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/38723895@N0...</a> ).  Jason saw a slider for 'Muscle Density', he messed with the slider but its didnt seem to change anything so he just settled on 'x2'.  What changed was barely noticeable but it was there, the unflexed muscle on the body looked almost as hard as the flexed muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then heard what he thought was Laura getting out of the shower, \"Shit! I gotta fix this now.  How tall is Greg?\"   he asked himself not realizing he had never changed the height but he thought Greg was taller than 6'2\".  So he quickly hit 6'8\", the image seemed to grow larger, the muscle staying proportionally as large on the taller body as on the shorter body.  He moved on to sexual characteristics, in his panic he just quickly hit a button, increasing Greg's average 7\" hard, to an insane 9\" flaccid monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jason hit apply when he got a strange warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***WARNING***<br>\r\nThis choice has<br>\r\nbeen assessed and<br>\r\na HIGH probability<br>\r\nof paradox exists if <br>\r\nit is committed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jason just hit ok like most people do when they see a user agreement.  And soon he felt a strange lightheaded feeling and caught himself when he thought he was going to fall.  And the phone was gone \"Shit! where is the phone!\" he paniked thinking he dropped it.  He also didnt hear the shower running anymore, and decided to just get out of the room before Laura came into the room half naked, and freaked.  He went downstairs and waited but Laura never came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Jason tired of waiting desides to leave and come back later.  What he doesnt notice are the changes around the house.  Family portraits now contain a massive Greg towering over his family especially tiny Laura.  Who is looking up at him in adoration in many pictures.  There are also a few magazines which are framed and hanging about the house, each one with Greg on the cover.  An older magazine showing what looks like a 14 or 15 year old Greg with a body alot like the one before Jason had enhanced him unknowingly.  \"Boy Wonder: Middle Schooler Competes in Adult Competitions.\"  \"Youngest Winner in Mr. Olympia History!\"  and the newest one \"7: The Streak Continues!\".  \"The Next Step in Male Evolution? Women Can Only Hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After Jason leaves the house it is quiet; The phone is gone and Laura never comes downstairs, Why?  because she is no longer there.  Laura is now at the beach with Greg and Vanessa.  Greg was an amazing physical specimen ever since Laura was a little girl, and growing up she adored him but as she got older it continued to develop into a major brother complex.  She would do whatever she could for him and whatever he asked of her, as his fame skyrockted, eventually she basically became his Personal Assistant.  Before when Greg had asked Laura if she wanted to go to the beach she declined.  But in this reality Greg had TOLD her they were going to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Thus the paradox was created, If Laura wasnt at the house her phone wouldnt be their for Jason to mess with, so none of these changes would have happened but if these changes didnt happen then the phone would have been their for Jason to mess with...... aaah the wonders of a paradox.  So to keep this paradox from ripping the realities asunder the phone had to do something.  It was forced to get rid of one reality completely or lose both.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason walked slowly in the direction of his house while he pondered the iPhone app he'd been playing with. He desperately wished it could be real, that he could add muscle to his body with the tap of a button. The image was so real that he could hardly believe it was a phone that was able to render it. Jason thought about different ways he could ask Laura about it without her knowing he'd been playing with it. Before he knew it he arrived at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed. He didn't really want to waste a beautiful day indoors, but he didn't know what else to do. He didn't like going to the beach, the comic shop was closed on Sundays, Laura had somehow ditched him and he didn't have any other friends. He walked around the side of the house and sat on a deck chair overlooking the beach. Off in the distance to his right he could see a large group of people gathered as if there was a party or something going on. He again began to lament his sickly physique, if he were in better shape he wouldn't mind joining the crowd down there but as it was he was embarrassed and felt like an outsider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt his phone buzz in his pocket and pulled it out assuming it was a text from Laura. He discovered it was one from Vanessa instead. He squinted at his phone, \"Since when did she have my number? For that matter since when did I get hers?\" Jason had always harbored a fair sized crush on Laura's buxom older sister, but they'd never been close enough to swap messages. This text, though, seemed very informal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watcha' doing?\" it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused for a moment unsure of how to respond. His heart was racing; could he really strike up a friendship with Vanessa? He didn't want to blow it so he just responded truthfully, \"Nothing really. Just relaxing on the back porch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later Vanessa's response came back: \"Cool. Don't move, I'll be right there! :D\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stared at his phone, his brain was going a mile a minute trying to put the pieces together. Why in the world would Vanessa come to his place? When did he even get her phone number entered into his phone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later Vanessa came walking around the side of the house to join Jason on the patio. Immediately Jason noticed something was different about Vanessa, actually several things were different. He had never seen her in glasses before but now she wore a thick rimmed pair. She also wore no makeup and had her hair pulled back in a simple pony tail. She wore a Star Wars t-shirt (another first for Jason) that fit snug over her gorgeous DD breasts and a pair of denim shorts that showed off her lovely, long legs. However, the more Jason looked the more he saw that even her body was different. She was no where near fat, but her formerly tight and toned physique had softened; her stomach showed the hint of a pooch whereas she formerly had fairly sculpted abs and Jason was pretty sure her butt was a bit bigger. Regardless she was still among the most beautiful women Jason had ever seen and his mouth went dry when she sat down in an adjoining seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at the group gathered in the distance that Jason had spotted before. \"Looks like the swarm is in full force today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jason had no idea what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you read that Swamp Thing trade I let you borrow yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's confusion grew. \"You didn't lend that to me, Laura did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa furrowed her brow behind her glasses. \"Why in the world would Laura lend out my comics? She never even reads them since she spends all her time with Captain Chunkhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was at a loss. \"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Vanessa looked concerned. \"What do you mean 'who?' Major Musclehead. Lunk Rockhard? Greg? My brother? The muscle phenom and Gods gift to bodybuilders everywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat in silence for a moment while Jason tried to wrap his head around what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling ok?\" Vanessa asked placing her hand in Jason's knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. Ever since I found....\" Jason trailed off. Ever since he'd found and played with Laura's phone. He'd made Greg really big and now Vanessa was calling him a muscular prodigy. What if he really had changed things? Maybe things had changed enough to where Laura hung out with Greg and Vanessa was somehow the nerd of the family. Did that make sense? Was it possible? Here she was looking the part and talking about comics, should he wait and see what he could find out? Maybe he should just come clean about Laura's phone and see if Vanessa had any answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found what?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason knew what he wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason decided he would do his best to roll with the changes he was finding. Now that he had a better understanding, or at least a theory, about what was going on he could go along and see where things lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found what?\" Vanessa asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head and put on his best smile. \"I'm sorry, i didn't sleep well last night and my head is all funny. It's nothing. Yes, to answer your question, I DID read the Swamp Thing trade you lent me. I liked it a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked questioningly at Jason for a moment before she seemed to let his odd actions go. \"Cool, so do you think you'd want to get caught up on the current issues? The Rotworld crossover with Animal Man is pretty awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'd love to take a look.\" Then, without meaning to, his eyes glanced down at Vanessa's large breasts and back up to her face. For years he'd been able to do this without getting caught since she never paid him any attention, but this time she was looking right at him. He was caught dead to rights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason expected her to be offended or put off but instead a sly, sexy grin spread across her lips. \"Is there anything else you'd like to take a look at?\" She placed a hand under one of her luscious boobs and lifted it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had, to this point, thought he could go along with anything, but now he was at a loss all over again. \"I.. I.. uh, well.. I..\" He stopped and swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa threw her head back and laughed. \"I love that after all we've been through together, after all these years, I can still break your brain with a squeeze of my boob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you blame me?\" Jason asked doing his best to resume playing along, \"They are extremely big boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better believe it!\" Now Vanessa stood and approached Jason's chair. She climbed up on his lap and straddled his middle with her perfect thighs. \"You know what else is extremely big and makes me lose my mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could answer Vanessa slid her hand to his crotch where his very generous erection was tenting his pants. She squeezed his shaft and moaned loudly. \"Let's find some privacy. I want to you talk nerdy to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the challenges he was having figuring out how he got into this situation Jason leapt at the chance to bed the girl he'd been ogling for years. He stood and led her to the living room and pulled the shades. His mother was out of town for the weekend so he knew they would be alone. Vanessa attacked him and within seconds had removed all of his clothes. Jason's initial reaction was shame and he half expected Vanessa to lose interest in him now that his less than desirable body was exposed. Instead she shoved him into a seated position on the couch then stood over him. She put her foot up on the cushion next to him so that he could untie her shoe for her. Jason obliged but made sure to savor the opportunity to slide his hands all over her leg in the process. Her skin was even more perfect than he had imagined. Once he had pulled her shoe and sock off she put her other foot up and Jason did the same again. Next Vanessa pulled her Star Wars shirt up and over her head revealing her gorgeous DD cup breasts packed into a bright red and blue bra that immediately made Jason think of Supergirl. When Vanessa slid her tight shorts off and Jason could see she was wearing matching Supergirl panties complete with the \"S\" emblem on them his heart skipped a beat. When she slid out of her panties and bra and climbed onto Jason's lap his heart nearly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa gripped Jason's 9 inch shaft and guided it into her as she sat down on him. She lowered herself slowly enveloping every bit of his penis and letting out a loud moan. \"Ooooooohhhhh god,\" she yelled, \"I will never get used to how fucking big you are!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa bottomed out with more than an inch of Jason's tool still exposed, but he didn't notice or care. He was now face to face with Vanessa's bare breasts and his hands flew to them. He mashed them together hard and Vanessa let out a sharp squeal. Afraid he had hurt her Jason removed his hands but Vanessa gave him a look that was almost angry and mashed his hands into her bosom with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harder!!\" She ordered. \"Squeeze me, suck me, tweak me, and do it harder!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason immediately complied. He buried his face in her cleavage and licked while pinching her nipples. Then he sucked on one huge tit while squeezing the other. Basically he ran through every fantasy he had ever imagined about Vanessa's boobs one by one. While he did that Vanessa begun gyrating her hips with Jason's massive member deep inside her. Jason tried to ignore the building pressure in his balls, but there was no denying that he was moments away from blowing his load. He did his best to control his breathing and keep himself from coming, but Vanessa switched from gyrating to bouncing and a minute or so was all Jason could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a moan that dripped of both satisfaction and sorrow Jason unleashed his first ever orgasm by intercourse. Vanessa smiled down on his while he caught his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.. Sorry I came so quick.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Vanessa said warmly. \"I know my body drives you crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled. \"You may think you know, but you really don't have any idea.\" Jason had stopped caring about what had caused this new reality or his place within it. All he knew was that he was never going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stood and turned to gather her clothes. When her back was to him Jason noticed that her love of comics had led her to get a pair of tattoos, one on each shoulder blade. Both were pin-up images of female comic characters; on her left shoulder blade was Rogue in her classic green and yellow skintight suit while on her right was Power Girl proudly displaying her famous \"boob window.\" Each character was in a classic pin-up pose and had been amped for maximum sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began to realize more and more that this Vanessa was the most incredible woman he could even conceive of. He had made oher be this way completely by accident, but it was the best accident he could have ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa tossed her shorts and shirt onto a nearby chair and put her Supergirl bra and panties back on. She curled up next to Jason on the couch and clicked on the TV. Jason sat with the gorgeous, half naked girl in his arms while she channel surfed for a long time without ever looking at the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa hopped from one show to the next looking for something interesting and finding nothing. She landed on one station and rolled her eyes. \"Oh goddamnit!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat up and looked at the TV. \"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get away from that guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason saw that they were watching some sports news coverage called \"The Road to the Olympia\" and the headline across the bottom of the screen read \"Can Anything Stop Greg Friedman?\" The images of Greg were both astounding and completely familiar. This was the exact person Jason had constructed on the mysterious iPhone app. Greg was a 6 foot 8 inch monster covered in piles upon piles of muscle. The images flashed through a montage of workout footage with Greg curling, squatting, pumping, and lifting more weight than any human being in history. The montage finished with Greg curling enormous weights in each hand with big yellow numbers on the side reading \"1200\" to let everyone know just how strong he was. He powered through ten tough reps then racked the weights and hit an insane double biceps pose showing off his monstrous 34 inch arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show cut to an interview with Greg where the interviewer asked him if he had any plans to retire or at least pull out of the Mr. Olympia show for this year. Greg laughed the responded in a deep, booming voice, \"I've been wining Olympias since I was 16, and there's no way in the world I'm going to stop now. I hear lots of cries about how unfair that is and others have even tried to buy me out to get me to stop showing up. The fact is I'm not doing it for the money, I could care less about the cash. I'm doing it to prove my undeniable dominance and I'm not going to even consider stopping until I have 30 of those trophies lining the walls of my home. Anyone who doesn't like it can kiss my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa let out an annoyed sigh, \"They should just rename ESPN the Greg Friedman channel, he pretty much all they talk about these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mind reached back to his earlier conversation with Vanessa. \"Captain Chunkhead,\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa scoffed. \"To say the least. As his body got bigger his brain got smaller. I'm shocked he can still form complete sentences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave a half hearted laugh but the fact was he was mesmerized by the shots of Greg on stage at last years Olympia competition. He stood a head taller than almost every other competitor and carried about twice the mass. Not to mention his tiny posing briefs were failing to conceal his enormous member. Greg was, in every way imaginable, the \u00fcber-male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shut the TV off and tossed the remote aside. \"I've got to get home and get ready for work. Can I see you when I get off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if that means I can get off too.\" Jason said now finding himself totally comfortable with the idea that Vanessa was his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled and gave him a deep kiss while she cupped his groin and squeezed his penis. \"I think that could be arranged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and put her clothes and shoes on. Then she said her goodbyes and left. Jason found himself alone in an unfamiliar world desperately wanting to find out more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a little while Jason simply remained on the couch, not moving. A part of him was simply basking in the afterglow of his first ever sexual encounter, one with his dream girl no less, while another part was afraid that if he began examining this life too much the bubble might burst and he'd find himself back where he'd started as if waking from a dream. Finally he reached forward and picked up the remote and turned the TV back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nESPN was still covering the upcoming Olympia. They had moved on to other competitors but even so all anyone seemed to talk about was Greg. They talked about how Greg Friedman would dominate the competition no matter what; how he had changed the landscape of bodybuilding forcing others to go to great lengths to get as big as possible, how his celebrity status had legitimized bodybuilding in the eyes of the world making huge muscles more mainstream among men and women, about how muscles were the new trend and sex symbol, how even Hollywood had been affected causing studios to demand that their stars bulk up bigger than ever before. This last talking point was accompanied by various still shots of movie stars in the gym pumping iron and looking like fully fledged bodybuilders. Hugh Jackman, Mark Wahlberg, Chris Hemsworth, even Chris Pratt were all pictured with bodies formally considered to be too big for an actor. Pratt looked especially huge especially when the screen split to show his formally doughy body side by side with his new super buff one. The muscular version of Pratt was grinning widely and flexing a huge bicep and an onscreen graphic listed his arm as 21 inches around. The person narrating the story mentioned that female stars were getting into the act as well including Scarlett Johansson who had apparently packed on an insane 60 pounds of muscle onto her 125 pound frame at only 5' 3\" tall. She was gearing up for a stand alone Black Widow movie and producers finally had to demand that she stop bulking up since she kept ripping out of any costume they put her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could only shake his head. \"I made one adjustment to one guy and the whole world has transformed. I don't know how Laura got that crazy app on her phone but it's no joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and looked around catching his reflection in a decorative mirror on the far side of the room. Jason flexed his arm and frowned when his greeted by his stick-thin limb. \"It would have been nice to have picked up a little muscle as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Laura's phone still had the app on it. If only he knew where to find her. That was the trouble, really, he didn't know much about this reality and how he fit in. Obviously he and Vanessa were\u2026 well, what were they? Was she his girlfriend? Were they friends with benefits? He and Laura had been pals for their entire lives and had never even gotten close to having sex, so what was different about this new relationship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to do some research. Jason vaulted up the stairs to his bedroom and plopped down in front of his computer. While he waited for it to come out of sleep mode he glanced around his room. Most everything was the same as it had been before but there were a few, minor differences. Things were definitely neater and more organized. He also spotted a Star Trek poster on the wall near his bed which was odd since he'd never really been a Star Trek fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that how this works? Greg gets huge muscles and suddenly I love Star Trek?\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe logged into his computer and put his browser straight to Facebook. He dug into his own profile and began searching through his photos and posts. With a smile he found that Vanessa featured very heavily into his life going back as far as his profile did. He hadn't set a relationship status so that mystery would remain for the time being. It looked as though his life was even more active with Vanessa than he ever had been before. There were shots of him at concerts, carnivals, parks, coffee shops, out on the street, and at the beach. He lingered on the beach ones since they very frequently featured Vanessa in a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dug around further and found an entire photo album devoted to the comic book conventions they'd been to together. Jason's mouth nearly hit the floor when he discovered that at every event they went to Vanessa had dressed up in expert level cosplay. Jason tore through the photos devouring them ravenously and feeling his erection tent his pants. He found images of her dressed up as Supergirl, Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Black Widow, Black Cat, She Hulk, Wonder Woman, Sailor Moon, Power Girl, Princess Leia, Lara Croft, and lots and lots of Star Trek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finding so many Trek costumes Jason glanced back to the poster on his wall. \"So Vanessa is the fan, I get it.\" Then when his gaze returned to the screen and he spotted Vanessa dressed as a Vulcan in a tight officers outfit with a short skirt, black nylons and thigh high leather boots with her blonde hair hidden under a black bob wig Jason decided that he was definitely a fan of Star Trek as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim he clicked on Vanessa's profile and began digging through her photos instead. He found she had her albums arranged by character and he scrolled through finding not only pictures of herself at events but also constructing the outfits. She was quite the tailor and had an amazing eye for detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to check out further profile details for Vanessa but spotted a photo album labeled \"Sexy Muscle Hunks.\" When he clicked on it he found tons of pictures of Vanessa at bodybuilding shows posing with various muscle giants. Jason assumed that if Greg was competing Vanessa could also tag along and perhaps she was even friends with many of them. Still, Jason felt a pang of jealousy seeing how she was drooling over the incredibly muscled men. In many cases she was pointing to their huge, flexed biceps or feeling their thick chests and chiseled abs. In nearly all of the pictures the big men had an arm around Vanessa's waist holding her close to their own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason closed the window and sat back in his chair grumbling to himself. There was no question that the Vanessa in his own reality was attracted to muscular guys, all of her boyfriends had been at minimum buff and frequently well beyond that, but he had hoped that this nerdier version were more into guys like him. He allowed himself to remember that less than an hour ago Vanessa had been grinding away on his lap and seemed to be perfectly satisfied with him as a lover, but self doubt was a natural state for Jason and he couldn't help but feel that he could lose Vanessa instantly should a so called \"sexy muscle hunk\" come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he had Laura's phone. Or even just the app. Could he find it himself? Or should he see if he could find Laura and see if her phone still held the same magic in this reality? He looked out the window across the sand to the giant gathering of people in the distance. Vanessa had indicated that the crowd could have been for Greg and she definitely had said that Laura was constantly by Greg's side. Maybe he could take a stroll and see what he could find.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sighing, Jason got up and decided that if he was ever going to fix things he needed to track down Laura.  Looking toward the door, he knew that it would be easy to find her.  Heading out the back of the house, Jason walked toward the beach and all of the lights.  Jason eventually reached the back of the crowd that was still watching Greg lift enormous weights and flex for the reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning his neck, he saw Laura off to the side watching Greg.  It even appeared she had her phone with her.  So with a nod of his head to pull up his courage, he walked around to get close to her.  She appeared as thin as always, but was dressed much nicer than he remembered seeing her in the previous reality.  Her brown hair was pulled back into a tight bun and she had some makeup on.  She had on some designer shorts and a nice powder blue collared shirt with an emblem that matched those he saw on the banners, Team Greg.  Taking the final step forward, Jason forced a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up from her phone and gave a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi Jason.  What are you doing here?  You know Vanessa wouldn\u2019t approve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded.  \u201cI know, but she\u2019s at work.  It was a nice day and the lights told me what was going on.  I just figured to stop by and say hello.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gave him a curious glance.  \u201cOK.  But I need to keep track of Greg when he\u2019s lifting and flexing, so I really don\u2019t have time to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura started to turn back toward Greg, when Jason cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, forgot my phone and need to give Vanessa a quick text.  Can I borrow yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to give Jason a blank stare and was about to dismiss him, but Jason returned her stare with a pleading look and she rolled her eyes and put her arm to hand him her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK fine.  Two minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took the phone.  \u201cThanks, I\u2019ll be quick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned and walked away from the crowd, quickly looking for the Ap.  He nearly panicked when he couldn\u2019t find it.  In this reality, did she ever have it?  How could any of this have happened if she didn\u2019t?  But then to his shock, he noticed that an Ap was being loaded to her phone.  Had Laura started this before she gave him the phone?  It loaded quickly and to his shock, it was the Alternations Ap!  How could that have happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned quickly to glance back at Laura, but thankfully she was watching Greg and talking to someone else on his team.  Turning back, Jason opened the Ap and was greeted with a short text.  \u201cWelcome Jason.  The current program is running.  Greg\u2019s profile is currently locked due to Paradox protocol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grit his teeth.  Paradox protocol?  What the hell was that?  Knowing he had limited time he went to his profile but was blocked again as a warning came up.  \u201cCreator of paradox currently blocked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason bit his lower lip.  Currently?  Does that mean he could still change himself at some point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith limited options apparently available, he pulled up Vanessa next and no warning came up.  He could alter her, but to what end?  Maybe he should alter Laura?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to see Laura glance at him.  Damn!  What could he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason saw a button he didn\u2019t remember seeing before.  Copy settings.  Figuring he didn\u2019t have time for a detailed change to Vanessa, he hit that button and was surprised when the image of Vanessa popped up with mounds of muscles, yet keeping wild female curves.  What would this do?  Was this worth the risk? Two more buttons popped up.  All or fine tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gave him another glance and Jason turned so she couldn\u2019t see the image floating above her phone.  Figuring he had no more time to alter anything, he hit All and a slider appeared with numbers above 100 to one side and below to the other.  Figuring it meant she would be more or less what Greg was, he stared at the slider for a moment.  She was none too pleased with him for some reason and figured that maybe making her more powerful would help the situation.  Nearly at a panic, he slid it higher and Vanessa grew larger.  Lost in thought, he jumped when Laura spoke up and his finger jerked to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason, I need my phone back now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout paying attention to the image or where his slider percentage increase wound up, Jason finally did panic and hit Apply.  Another Warning box popped up, but figuring he had no time left, he hit Ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly fell over as the entire beach took a spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking as the images cleared, he cursed as he once again found himself without the phone, but was equally surprised to see Laura near him with a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason, what are doing drifting over here?  You know Vanessa wants you watching her at all times when her and Greg are in their routine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head.  \u201cUh, she does?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing, Laura grabbed his arm and pulled him back toward the lights and crowd.  Jason quickly noticed that he was now donning the same outfit Laura had, but the logo now said Team Friedman.  He also noticed that Laura\u2019s grip was very strong and that those thin arms looked much more toned.  He sighed nervously.  What had he done?  As Laura tugged him toward the crowd she turned to him and leaned in to talk into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.  I used to think Greg was demanding.  Not that I ever minded, seeing he was my hero.  But when Vanessa started lifting after that day Greg picked her up, set her on his right arm and bounced her on his 34 inch guns, nothing has been the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason simply nodded, hoping that Laura would continue as they grew closer to the lights, but she released her grip and stood next to him as they were both greeted with the most powerful sibling tandem on earth.  Greg looked larger than ever, and at 6 foot 8 was a literal giant of a man, shirtless and sporting black shorts that were loose, but still allowed everyone to see the outline of his oversized member.  But when he turned his head to witness Vanessa, his jaw dropped open.  She was taller than before, probably around 6 foot 3, but appeared to sport as much muscle as Greg!  She had on black workout shorts that were a bit shorter and tighter than Greg\u2019s and a tight, thick black sports bra, cut to expose her bountiful muscle cleavage.  Her long blonde hair was in a ponytail behind her and face lit up, looking more beautiful than ever!  His attention pulled back to Greg as he held his muscular right arm up to calm the crowd.  Greg and Vanessa had on wireless headphones and as he reached down to pick up the weight he talked with his booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo to finish off our workout tonight I thought we\u2019d curl some world record busting weights and flex up some world record busting biceps.  How does that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered loudly, including Laura.  Jason could see that the weights had 1300 pounds clearly marked on them, which made his head spin at the thought of what he was about to do.  Without hesitation, Greg reached down, picked up both weights, stood up and began curling each mass with grunts of exertion.  He got to 8 reps and paused as his strength began to fail him.  The crowd cheered louder and with a smile, he was able to do two more reps before dropping the weights to the sand with twin thuds.  Smiling and shaking his arms, Vanessa walked up with a wide tape measurer and smiling broadly, allowed Greg to pull up his bicep and flex his massive arm.  She quickly rapped the tape around his flexed muscle and looking at the number, announced the result with her silky, sexy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell folks, it looks like Greg was right about busting some world records.  My big brother is sporting 35 inch biceps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd yelled louder as Greg flexed his other bicep and the same 35 inch measurement was announced by Vanessa.  Smiling at Greg, Vanessa handed Greg the tape and he took a step back as Vanessa approached the same weights.  Jason noticed Greg\u2019s expression turned curious for a short moment and he turned to see Laura bite her lip.  Jason noticed that there was another set of weights off to the side labeled 1000 pounds.  Was she supposed to lift those?  Vanessa reached down and with a light grunt, picked up the weights Greg had just used for the stunned crowd.  The cheers momentarily stopped as the crowd buzzed.  Vanessa smiled at the reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo seeing as Greg was kind enough to let me finish the show, I thought I would give everyone a treat.  My workouts have been extra effective recently and I wanted to show everyone my gains.  Greg\u2019s not the only one who can handle these weights!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Vanessa pulled up the weight with her right arm, staring down and smiling at the world record busting feat.  The crowd started cheering once again; apparently excited to witness something even they weren\u2019t prepared for.  Vanessa was soon pumping the iron with brutal efficiency and the crowd counted each rep as she reached 10, before pausing for a moment.  Jason could see Greg was gritting his teeth, apparently hiding his anger, but still sporting the showmanship smile.  Vanessa\u2019s smile broadened as she cranked out two more reps to stop at 12 and Jason was sure she could have done many more.  Dropping the weights, she stood upright and brought her right arm up.  Greg walked up and as Vanessa flexed her mighty muscles, he wrapped the tape around her arm and paused as he read the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThirty\u2026..thirty four inches.\u201d  He paused for a moment to gather himself and then allowed himself to continue.  \u201cThat\u2019s right folks, my little sister has just DESTROYED the female bicep record and every other man on earth except yours truly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Greg was about to remove the tape and measure her other arm, Vanessa spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a moment Greg.  I think I can pull out a little more muscle yet.  Let me flex a bit harder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gasped as Vanessa tensed her fist and the already large arm solidified with granite hardness and the tape pulled tighter and slid through Greg\u2019s fingers.  Jason could tell Greg was none too happy, but he still dutifully read off the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, wow folks, looks like those record books are need of a rewrite, Vanessa is flexing up 35,\u201d Vanessa smiled even broader as she squeezed harder and the tape moved again, \u201cMake that 36 inches around!  A new all around record!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg quickly pulled the tape off and Vanessa smirked.  Was she capable of flexing an even bigger bicep?  Pulling up her left arm, she quickly flexed hard and Greg read off another 36 inch measurement and pulled the tape off.  He backed up, his mind apparently still reeling from what just happened.  Vanessa stepped in quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK folks, that\u2019s the show for tonight!  Team Friedman will be back with another show after the Olympia!  Look for Greg to crush the competition next week and then look for me at the Ms. Olympia next month!  Thanks everyone and Good Night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg regained his composure and waved to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!  Thanks all and see you soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason knew it, there was a flurry of activity as the lights were dimmed and people started tearing down the set.  Laura walked up toward Greg and Vanessa and Jason followed.  Greg had yanked his headset off and tossed it the ground, while Vanessa had pulled hers off and handed it to a technician.  Greg stepped angrily toward Vanessa who remained calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?  How did you get so fucking strong and so fucking jacked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked up at Greg and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame as always Greggie, hard work.  You should try it some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s face turned beat red and his huge muscles all tensed into mounds of intimidation.  Laura stepped in between the two and placed her hands on Greg\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa there Greg.  We can settle this later.  We\u2019ve got to get things back in the trucks and you need to remember that you\u2019ve got the Olympia this week-end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg let out a grunt, but relaxed slightly, turned away from Vanessa and stormed away.  Laura let out a relieved sigh and turned toward Vanessa and Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd really.  What was that all about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason returned an \u201cI have no idea\u201d stare and Vanessa giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, the fact that I\u2019m stronger and more muscular than Greg or the fact that I did it in front of a large crowd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a frustrated sigh.  \u201cWell both obviously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled.  \u201cWell maybe if you gave me as half as much attention as you give Greg you\u2019d have an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned.  \u201cThat\u2019s Jason\u2019s job.  Now let\u2019s get things packed so we can get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa chuckled as Laura turned to run after some men using a forklift to bring weights into a semi.  Jason had to wonder; he knew that he had programmed her to be more powerful than Greg, but why was this the first time it came out?  Pulling up a grin, Jason turned toward Vanessa and shook his head as he had to look up at the slightly taller, but much wider super woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah, I\u2019d better help Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa gave him a sexy grin and nodded her head.  \u201cYeah, sounds good.  Then we can all head\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But now that he had caused another mess he could only speculate where this was headed.  So walking back toward Laura, he stood next to her as she directed some other men pulling the electronic equipment apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Laura, what do you need me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gave him an unhappy side-glance.  \u201cYou usually take care of the electronics and speakers.  Any reason to do something different?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head.  At least he was proficient at that anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no.  I\u2019ve got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stormed away giving Jason a quick view of a pair of large calf muscles bulging on those formerly thin legs.  Sighing at the idea of Laura sporting fitness sized muscles, Jason turned toward the crew unplugging devices.  He had hoped to get some more time with Laura to help unravel his current mystery, but that would have to wait until they got home.  So for the moment he dove into his task and an hour later he was walking toward the cars and found Vanessa standing next to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there stud, ready to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out another breath.  Like SHE wasn\u2019t the real stud.  My god was she a beautiful muscle monster.  He apparently was very turned on by that in this reality, but was still nervous that other body building men would replace him.  He reached into his pocket and found the keys, smiled as he walked up to Vanessa and she reached out and pulled him close.  Jason gasped at the strength and hardness of her massive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t mad at me too.  I was getting tired of playing off as the female version of Greg and allowing him to lift more than me.  Especially seeing as how quickly my density is accelerating right now.  I just can\u2019t seem to grow stronger fast enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggled at the last comment and Jason masked his fear and nervousness with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could I ever be mad at you?  You\u2019re a muscle goddess.  You\u2019d crush me like a grape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s smile dropped and she pulled her arms back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on.  You know I would never hurt you.\u201d  Looking over toward another car parked nearby, she snorted.  \u201cGreg, however, is another story.\u201d  Looking back at Jason, her eyes softened.  \u201cBut never you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blinked nervously and gave her a crooked smile.  \u201cI was just kidding.  You know I\u2019d never want to hurt you either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s happy expression returned and she reached out to grab the door handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better not!\u201d  Vanessa laughed and Jason hustled to the driver\u2019s side and unlocked the doors.  They both got in and before he knew it they were pulling into Vanessa\u2019s driveway, filling the short drive with idle chit chat that frustrated Jason as he didn\u2019t pry anything useful out of her.  Looking ahead, Jason notice that the house appeared to be remodeled, but was still familiar enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out, they walked to the front door just as Greg and Laura pulled up.  Walking in, the front area looked a bit different with a large sectional couch and a huge big screen TV against the wall.  The stairs to the bedrooms were still there and he had to wonder what happened to their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa reached over to turn on the TV and Jason saw a laptop on the table.  He hoped that was his so he could scope out this reality.  As he headed toward the couch with Vanessa, the door opened again and Greg stormed in with Laura hot on his heels.  Jason glanced to see that Laura had her phone and knew that was what he really wanted.  But right now there was apparently going to be a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright you muscle bound bitch!  Care to explain what the hell you were trying to do out there tonight?  I can flex up bigger biceps and lift a little more too, but we had an agreement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa narrowed her eyes and walked toward Greg pumping her massive chest up and down, showcasing a set of tits that seemingly melded flawlessly with her pecs to present an upper body larger than Greg\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, YOU had an agreement.  And besides, I held up to the general idea not to ever show how strong or big we really are.  I still held back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg moved closer and their chests were soon inches away from each other as it was clear that Vanessa was not about to be intimidated.  Greg was still taller and stared down with furious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit!  There is no way you could lift more than that, much less flex a muscle any bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked up and grinned.  \u201cOh yeah?  Are you challenging me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura jumped in between them again.  \u201cLook, why don\u2019t you two cool off and take a shower.  If you want to challenge each other we can do that in the morning at the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth held their stares on each other, but Greg finally caved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.  I\u2019ve got some company coming over anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa didn\u2019t move as Greg turned and headed up the stairs.  Laura backed up, made sure Greg made it into his room and turned toward Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow would you mind telling me what is going on?  I mean I know you\u2019ve had some gains, but damn girl, you\u2019re more than a beast now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed softly.  \u201cYou really don\u2019t know the half of it, but tomorrow I\u2019ll be happy to show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she turned to wink at Jason and headed around the corner to what was their parent\u2019s bathroom.  Was that Vanessa\u2019s now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, Laura turned back toward Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you going to tell me anything?\u201d  Jason kept his confused look as Laura took a step toward him and rolled up her short sleeve toward her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I could twist the information out of you.  I may not be as big and strong as those two, but I still share their density.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura flexed up her bicep and a hard, powerful looking football shaped bicep bulged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn fact, I do believe my density is even greater than either one of them.  My bicep here is fifteen inches around last I checked and I can curl over 700 pounds with each arm.  I just started working out seriously and I\u2019m growing really strong, really fast.  And my body is simply piling on muscles so fast I can barely keep up.  Give me a few months and I\u2019ll be tossing both of those two around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped at the prospect of getting manhandled by Laura and she smiled at his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you better be worried.  Because I hate not knowing what\u2019s going on with Vanessa.  And you\u2019re hiding something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura released her flex and took an intimidating step toward Jason who took a step back out of fear.  Jason was about to try and run away when the doorbell rang.  Laura turned and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaved by the bell Jason.  I guess we\u2019ll have to pick this up later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura bound toward the door and opening it up allowed four people to pile in.  Jason stared as two bodybuilding men and two very fit girls headed up the stairs with Laura right behind.  She smacked the behind of the guy in front of her and he nearly fell over the railing, causing Laura to laugh loudly.  They were quickly out of site and Jason was alone.  He really wanted to get Laura\u2019s phone, but he didn\u2019t dare head upstairs at this point.  Sighing, he sat down and opened up the computer, powering up the device.  A thumb pad had been installed and smiling he placed his thumb down to allow entrance.  He noticed that it was a Friedman company computer and that everyone\u2019s phone was tethered through wi-fi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could access Laura\u2019s phone!  Sliding the curser toward the selections he tapped on Laura\u2019s phone.  He then noticed that.. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Alterations Ap began to download and Jason\u2019s pulse raced.  Was it also happening on her phone?  Would Laura notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ap now appeared on the computer and Jason quickly opened it up.  Once again, text popped up.  \u201cWelcome Jason.  The current program is running.  Warning:  Changes to Vanessa are still in progress due to high level superhuman changes.  Paradox bubbles very likely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s racing pulse picked up.  Paradox bubbles?  What the heck was that?  Clicking on the Information button, more text popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParadox bubbles are dramatic, often instant changes to current reality.  These are the result of a major change being incorporated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  \u201cGreat,\u201d he thought, \u201cinstead of making things better I\u2019ve only pulled things further from my starting point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, he cleared out that text and went back to see Vanessa\u2019s stats.  Another text pop came up.  \u201cVanessa is currently locked due to paradox protocol and final incorporation of changes.\u201d  He clicked on her to find out what was in store and even that was blocked with a text.  \u201cParadox protocol in effect, Vanessa profile not currently available.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again.  Currently?  What exactly had he done to her?  She was already as big and as strong as Greg.  Likely bigger and stronger.  Just how big and strong was she going to get?  Moving on, he went to his profile and grumbled that he was still \u201ccurrently\u201d locked out.  He then moved to Laura and yet another box popped up.  \u201cLaura\u2019s profile tied to Vanessa\u2019s.  Limited changes available.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused as the final commercial was blaring on the TV for some protein supplement and his eyes opened when he saw the celebrity pitch woman was Taylor Swift sporting short shorts and a bikini top.  And she was jacked!  Striding forward, her once long, thin legs were still long, but they were packed with muscles!  Taylor\u2019s abs were a crisp 6 pack and her upper body had enough muscle to win a physique contest, or at least one in his original reality.  She smiled as she stopped and picked up a container with Vanessa Max in bold letters and a picture of Vanessa flexing up a massive bicep on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi muscle lovers!  As a formerly thin 130-pound singer, I barely had any muscle across my 5 foot 10 inch frame and struggled to lift even the simplest things.  But then I started using Vanessa Max Gain protein mix with my workouts and my muscle and strength gains were soon off the charts!  Now those dance routines are a breeze and my concerts last for hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled up her right arm and large, cut bicep bulged forward.  \u201cAnd with my 15 inch guns at the ready, I can take on the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason\u2019s vision blurred and the computer screen went red with the text, \u2018Paradox Bubble\u2019 blinking.  Everything went dark for Jason and his stomach took a flip before his vision returned.  He blinked his eyes as he stared at the TV.  As the picture cleared, his jaw dropped.  Taylor Swift was still on the screen holding a Vanessa Max container, but those fitness level muscles were now bodybuilder busting large and her bicep muscle looked to have doubled in size!  Broad shoulders and incredibly wide lats curved down to an iron plated 8 pack on her narrow midsection, producing a mind numbing T shape.  Her chest was a wonderment of pectorals flesh that was barely covered by the same bikini top, providing a clear view of striations, shimmering muscle fibers and mounds of rock hard muscles easily six inches thick.  Her long legs contained 18 inch wide super quads split and riddled with cross striations to shame most any man.  Jason could only stare with wonderment at the superstar who in his initial reality would be the biggest, most powerful person on earth!  Her voice was less bubbly and more commanding as she now continued with a different theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks to Vanessa Friedman\u2019s workout routines and Vanessa Max Gain protein mix I\u2019m out lifting and out flexing every man at the gym.  Nothing is more satisfying than crushing your boyfriend\u2019s best lifts and flexing muscles so much bigger that he drops his head in shame, even if he is the current Mr. California!  So if you\u2019ve caught up to the men at the gym and want to blow passed them, just like me, nothing beats the power packed in Vanessa Max Gain protein mix.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to smile at her mighty cantaloupe sized bicep that peaked half way up her wide, strapping forearm with a deep bicep split and crystalizing peak.  With a purr, Taylor flexed harder and the camera zoomed in as the muscle expanded further, pushing mini striations to the surface of her thin skin and a graphic with the number 30 inches popped up around her bicep.  She flexed harder and the bicep continued to grow larger and the number slowly turned to 31 inches and incredibly, the muscle continued to expand and the graphic flicked to 32 inches and blinked brightly.  The camera pulled back with Taylor showcasing a superior smirk on her beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the size and power of a female bicep that can curl over half a ton for reps!  I\u2019m the biggest, baddest beast in the gym!  My workouts are longer, harder and more intense.  Superman\u2019s got nothing on me!  So if you want rock hard gigantic muscles of a goddess and the strength to lift the back end of an SUV, you\u2019ve got to yourself some Vanessa Max Gain protein mix!  Take it from me, Taylor Swift!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera moved back as Taylor released her bicep flex and pointed at the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Greg Friedman!  I\u2019m coming for you next!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother commercial for insurance followed and Jason\u2019s attention went back to the computer.  Could he pull up something from the Ap to give him a clue as to what was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by loud yells and banging from upstairs.  He sighed as one voice was definitely Laura.  Not really wanting to hear his once friend have rough sex with two men, he was still curious when after a while the thumping and banging grew louder and a boom shook the ceiling above him.  He then heard the door open and shut and soon one of the bodybuilders came nearly tumbling down the stairs and reaching the bottom, he looked desperately at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude!  That girl is crazy!  I knew she was strong, but damn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis guy had to be 6 feet tall and over 300 pounds of massive muscles that had several welts on them.  He was also naked.  Jason stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy looked around, full of fear.  \u201cYou gotta hide me!  I mean I like rough sex, but Laura is insane!  She\u2019s gonna kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud yell echoed from upstairs, followed by a crash and a loud thud.  The sound of the door opening was quickly followed by booming footsteps and the vision of a naked Laura running down the stairs.  The naked man yelped as Laura stalked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where do you think your going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified man took a quick step back and tripping on the throw rug, crashed to the ground.  As Jason stared wide-eyed, Laura took a step forward and then looked over at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVanessa still in the shower?  Shouldn\u2019t you be in there to help wash her back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled wickedly and pulled up her right arm.  \u201cOr were you hoping to get a ride on my massive muscles for a change of pace!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura still stood at only 5 foot 4, which was completely off-putting considering the amount of muscle that she possessed.  And that strong, fit 15 inch bicep was gone. Instead a literal mountain of muscle consolidated, filled up all of the available space on her arm and ground upward into the biggest bicep Jason had ever seen!  Bigger than Taylor\u2019s, bigger than Greg\u2019s, hell it was bigger than what Vanessa had flexed!  Jason\u2019s face went flush and his member leapt to attention.  Good grief, he had never had such a reaction before, but now it seemed only natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Jason, your staff should snap to attention.  You\u2019re looking at a 38 inch bicep on an arm that can curl a ton with ease!  These muscles just keep growing larger and stronger.  And my sexual desire keeps growing as well.  Isn\u2019t that right Brad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy on the ground, who Jason now knew was Brad, looked up and whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, please, my body can only take so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura released her bicep flex and placed her hands on her hips, pushing out her upper body into a wall of muscle!  Laura always had small breasts, but they were replaced with pectorals a foot thick and lats over three feet wide along with football sized shoulders and a surprisingly narrow waist sporting a rippling 8 pack!  Laura laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura took a step toward the terrified Brad, a voice from the top of the stairs boomed across the family room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough Laura!  You\u2019re going to hurt Brad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped, turned and looked up at Greg, who was naked as well and appeared to be even larger than before!  Good grief, thought Jason, did anyone wear clothes in the house?  And was everyone bigger but him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph.  Like you used to toss around your girlfriends?  What do you care?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg came down the stairs, his large member partially stiff, bobbing up and down before he reached the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s part of my team.  And because I\u2019m still stronger than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grit her teeth.  \u201cWow,\u201d thought Jason, \u201cif Greg was stronger than Laura, just how strong was Vanessa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg then pulled up his arm and Jason\u2019s eyes widened.  \u201cNow do these 41 inch guns need to show you whose boss or are you going to let Brad go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura said nothing as she fumed and Brad slowly got up and started walking toward the stairs, giving Laura a wide berth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as Greg was about to release his flex\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason gave Greg a curious glance as he held his flex, but his eyes moved over toward the back hallway.  As everyone froze and did the same, Jason followed their stare and saw that Vanessa had stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on out here?  Can\u2019t a girl get ready for bed in this house without a ruckus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg started to release his flex and let out an annoyed grunt, Laura simply looked at the ground, while Jason\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out of his head!  Vanessa was massively muscled before, but now she was nothing short of a rippling goddess of muscle.  Just like everyone else, Vanessa was naked, save for a towel around her head and her gigantic muscles glistened with the remaining water droplets, highlighting the biggest, hardest, strongest muscles Jason thought could ever exist!  Glancing down, Jason pulled in a breath as he surveyed Vanessa\u2019s Amazonian form as his member grew harder and thicker!  Gulping at the sight, Jason noticed that her feet and ankles remained deceptively petite, which further highlighted the insane curves out to volleyball sized, bulging calf muscles.  Her thighs were huge cuts of ripped beef the size garbage cans, flexing up over two feet thick and so wide that her quads touched in the middle and spread out like tree trunks.  The curves to her narrow midsection off of her quads was all but impossible and those 8 pack abs were cut ridiculously deep and were surrounded by more muscles than Jason knew existed.  And if the curves from her thighs to her abs were severe, the curves from her abs to her lats rewrote the possibilities of the human physique.  Her back seemingly stretched out forever as her gigantic arms hung to the sides, so full of muscle that even stretched out and relaxed they bulged outward as if her biceps and triceps were two soccer balls and her forearms were ham hocks!  And as Vanessa pulled in a breath, Jason nearly choked at the sheer mass of her pecs and breasts, which has somehow remained as one melded, gigantic mass of inhuman muscle over two feet thick and twice as wide!  By the time Jason\u2019s gaze caught Vanessa\u2019s model shaming face, she was staring at Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd were you trying to intimidate everyone with that flex?  Wasn\u2019t my demonstration tonight enough to give you pause as to who REALLY has the muscles and strength around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg grumbled.  \u201cI was there.\u201d  Greg paused and his eyes widened as he finally gave Vanessa his own, long stare.  \u201cYou, you look\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sniffed.  \u201cBigger?  Outlandishly muscular?  Damn straight!  I told you I was holding back at our event.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg pulled his hand to his forehead, clearly perplexed and more than just a little nervous.  Vanessa giggled as she pulled the towel off her head, winked at Jason and tossed it to him.  Jason\u2019s stunned expression remained and his erect member twitched as Vanessa pulled her fingers through her thick blonde hair and stepped toward Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about control.  If I concentrate I can hold my size down.  But when I relax, my natural, full size blooms forth.  And when I want to\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped a foot in front of Greg who remained as stunned as everyone else in the room.  Laura and Brad were like statues, almost afraid to move while Jason was nearly panting with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can destroy any concept you ever had of muscle and strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa kept her stare on the perplexed Greg, brought her face into a confident, casual smile and pulled up her right arm, causing those soccer ball sized muscles to bulge and pound forward so large they just couldn\u2019t be real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still think those 42 inch guns of yours are big?  You thought you were perturbed when I flexed up a 43 inch bicep to best you at our show?  Ha!  That was child\u2019s play!  Just like curling those puny 1 ton weights with each arm was just for show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blinked as the paradox bubble had changed the most recent events.  Laura was a beast, Greg was even bigger and stronger and Vanessa was on her way toward\u2026.  Well he wasn\u2019t sure, but he figured he was about to find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s jaw, along with everyone else staring on, dropped open as Vanessa\u2019s casual flex turned harder and everyone could actually HEAR the muscles expand!  The mighty peak of the shredded bicep was already up to the top of her fist and was expanding in every direction!  Vanessa twittered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d surmise my bicep is at least 50 inches right now!  So much bigger than your bicep now Greg, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg leaned forward, somehow not convinced the muscle was real.  Vanessa turned sexily to give her gigantic bicep a stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d definitely say 52 inches.  Of course I was flexing up my bicep to 52 inches nearly a week ago.  That was a fun day with Jason.  He nearly passed out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shot Jason a side-glance, who was feeling woozy once again, and she chuckled before staring into Greg\u2019s widening eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you have to wonder just how big I can flex my bicep, hmmmm?  Just how strong I really am right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa released her flex and Jason felt a bit disappointed, but Greg looked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike Laura said earlier, we can settle this tomorrow in the gym.  You all better get some sleep now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa placed her hands on her hips and Greg, Laura and Brad all slowly turned toward the stairs and headed up, looking nervous and confused.  Jason, however, was still standing by the couch with his penis at full attention.  Vanessa giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s get you into the bedroom before you get off without me.  Again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took a step forward quickly and reached out to Jason, who stiffened defensively before Vanessa grabbed him and tossed him over her shoulder and marched toward the bedroom.  Jason glanced at the TV and the special about Vanessa and Greg was just starting.  Sighing that he\u2019d miss the history lesson, he stared down at the hardest ass he had ever seen and smiled at his upcoming fate.  Within moments Jason found himself plopped onto the king size bed and Vanessa climbed on next to him with a rye smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Jason, are you going to remain the only one clothed or do I have to take matters into my own hands?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s eyes widened and he quickly stripped, tossing the clothes off the bed and before he knew it Vanessa was kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jason, the next half hour was the most erotic and often frightening experience of his life.  Vanessa was now so much bigger and stronger than him that he was often worried she really would crush him like a grape.  But she possessed amazing control and he reveled in rubbing his hands along her powerful body and pumping her as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they lay next to each other panting a bit, Jason turned to see that Vanessa had fallen to sleep and within minutes he joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s eyes fluttered open and he slowly turned to see that Vanessa was still asleep and as massive as ever.  He looked down and saw he was as average as ever, well maybe a little above average.  But he was still in the strange world he had created.  Reaching over to find his phone, he was glad it still had a charge and finding a waiting outlet, plugged it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked the day and found that a mid morning meeting at the gym was titled \u201cMeet and Greet\u201d.  Looking at the clock he had some time for some recognizance and could only wonder when the next paradox bubble would occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused as he had a few options before Vanessa and the team woke up, if they weren\u2019t already awake.  He could take a shower and allow the events to move toward the gym, finding out more about the meet and greet.  Or he could sneak out to the computer and do some more history searching to try and catch up to the current events.  Or watch TV to do so.  He only hoped another paradox bubble didn't occur before he could get his bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking thing over, he laid back down for a moment and decided to<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vanessa is different somewhat chubby but still pretty, cute and voluptuous. She is also acting as if this is normal and that Jason and her are freinds.  He has a feeling that the phone might have something to do with it but he cant go running around yelling that a phone changed reality.  That wouldnt help anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite knowing much about this different Vanessa.  Jason isnt sure how close they are and how much she might beleive him.  Jason decides he needs to play it cool and feel things out in this new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found what?\" Vanessa asks again a little irritated Jason having gotten lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Since i found.. uh this weird app on your sisters phone\" Jason says deciding to slowly introduce the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow my sister let you touch her phone, and it wasnt hogged by Greg?\"  she says laughing to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just needed to check something the other day.\" he says and starts to think to himself.  'Crap, Greg uses Lauras phone all the time?  I gotta find the phone before he finds that app.'  Not knowing that the phone was no longer back in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *******************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown at the beach Greg's hulking form is walking through the throng of people on the beach, once again it didnt take long for people to find out where he was heading and gathering there.  He acted as if it was a hassle, but he loved the attention.  He basked in it, which is why he loved going to the beach, it was a way for him to show off his incredible body with out looking like he was trying to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up! I want to relax sometime today!\"  Greg yelled.  Behind him a soft struggling voice can be heard.  \"Sorry, im coming.\"  Laura is far behind struggling to carry the chairs, umbrella, bag and pull the cooler behind her.  Greg could easily help her but he is so full of himself, that menial work is below him, he has fans to entertain.  And he loves to entertain them and show off for them.  And they love him for it.  He signs autographs, flexes and poses for people and pictures.  But why shouldnt he be full of himself, with a body and strength like his, why not?  Men respect and fear him all at once, and women adore and lust after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struts through the crowd, a few women reach out and touch his arm to feel his power, and he winks at them making them blush and their nipples harden.  A few men work up the courage to do the same, and Greg quickly glares at them causeing them to shake with fear and embarrassing them in front of their girlfreinds or wives.  He starts to shoo his fans away so he can relax alittle, and they comply with out much arguement fearing the Adonis of a man, who has won almost as many World's Strongest Man competitions as he has Mr Olympia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finally catches up to Greg, she is stumbling and struggling and out of breath.  \"Finally!\"  Greg scolds \"Now get it set up fast, or I wont be letting you apply my suntan lotion.\"  Hearing this Laura gasps and her eyes open wide in fear.  She drops the items and quickly runs around setting up the umbrella a chair with little to no regard for her own safety.  When she was finally done she looked over at her brother.  But he was standing there with a very attractive MILF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Laura had been setting up Greg had walked over to a woman in her 40s who had been relaxing on a nearby chair, she hadnt been one of the masses surrounding him earlier, which he took as a challenge.  And Greg has always had a thing for MILF's.  She was sitting reading a book as her kids played nearby with her husband.  She was a woman who looked in control of everything in her life, even her body.  She obviously spent at least a few hours a day working out to keep in shape.  For her age her body was in amazing shape, which most women his age would die for, especially his waif of a sister.  He looked back over at his sister frantically struggling to set up the umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe MILF wore a sexy yet conservative bikini and covered with a sirong.  She crossed and uncrossed her long coltish legs, and Greg knew he had his target.  He walked over, his larger shadow blocking her sun until she looked up.  She was slightly taken aback by him unclose \"Can I help you?\" she asked.  \"Your lucky, your gonna apply my suntan lotion\"  he said confidently and before she could say anything he took her hand and pulled her up from the chair.  She was too shocked and thrown off guard by his sudden action and confidence.  She looked over at her husband her eyes bewildered, wondering what he would say.  Greg easily stared the husband down and the wife quietly went with Greg to apply his lotion for him and be his beach bunny for the day.  He even had her change into a sexier bikini for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was crushed when she looked up and saw she had been to slow and lost out on the chance to apply her beloved brother's suntan lotion.  But she just sat by quietly brooding to herself.</span></div></div>",

And she cycles through and sees the \"Tramp\" that is lotioning up her brother.  On the display reads all of her stats but Laura stops on one; *44years old*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This old bitch isnt 44\" says Laura spitefully and she slides her finger across the display.

The many worlds theory uses Quantum mechanics to interperate that certain observations cannot be predicted absolutely.  There is a range of possible observations, each with a different probability.  Each of these possible observations corresponds to a different universe.  If a choice made has 6 possibilites each corresponds to a quantum mechanics observable.  All 6 possible ways corresonds to its own universe. These is only a single universe but after the split into many worlds these cannot in general interact....... Im sorry this is getting technical and confusing, lets try a common analogy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine reality as a well, with a change it sends out a ripple.  When that ripple hits the sides of the well it bounces back in and starts to hit itself and cause more ripples upon ripples.  So the question is, with each change made, is that truely the only change that occurs? No their are always unintended consquences.  And when a person has something of incredible power, the often dont think about the unintended changes.  What if someone doesnt even know they are really making these changes? How truely messed up would the world become before they realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould the phone really be a blessing or a curse?  But for now let us return to story....Oh who am I? No one you need to worry about but I'll be... around.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa and Jason are hanging out after their \"fun time\" watching \"Event Horizon\", for the umpteenth time.  But to Jason it is the first time he has watched it with Vanessa.  He is enjoying it but it is kinda hard to pay attention especially when he is continually distracted by the movement underneath the distorted images of \"Star Wars\" characters on her shirt, pudgy but still cute as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason is attempting to watch the movie, when he gets a strange chill up his spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n *ripple*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could never quite get over how truely incredible Vanessa's body was when he hung out with Laura.  As far as he could tell she never worked out but her body was always in incredible shape.  And she always dressed to show it off too, and here she was actually hanging out with him wearing a skimpy cocktail dress (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/1782b8256010131\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imagebam.com/image/1782b82560...</a>) yet at the same time talking nerdy with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ripple*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa is watching one of her favorite old sci-fi movies with her oldest freind Jason.  She has always been a nerd and her and Jason always used to watch old sci-fi movies.  They are trying to keep it going.  But lately she has been starting to get alittle annoyed with Jason's \"hidden\" stares.  Lately she had taken to sitting as far away from him as possible to avoid anything he might try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has always been close to Jason but only as a freind, these days a secret freind.  When she began developing she began hiding the fact she was a nerd, and slowly stopped hanging out with Jason as much.  By the time she became the knockout she is now, she completely hid her nerdy side and only hung out with Jason in secret for their \"Cheezy Movie Nights\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ripple*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat their watching the movie Jason also trying to hide his erection.  When the movie was intterupted \"FACE DOWN ASS UP THATs THE WAY WE LIKE TO FUCK!\"  Jason knew what that was.  Vanessa's ringtone for her cocky, jock asshole of a boyfriend; Brad.  He was about to say something when Vanessa gave him a nasty glare and picked up her phone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiii Brady-kins!\" she squealed into the phone.  As Jason sat and listened he began to tune out the cutesy talk she was making with Brad.  She dressed in skimpy clothes and heels all the time, like Brad wanted.  She had died her beautiful golden blonde, an almost white platinum blonde, like Brad wanted.  She looked like a bimbo, just like Brad wanted.  But did she really have to act like one too? Jason seethed he hated Brad.  Whenever Jason says anything to Vanessa it's always \"Its what Brad wants\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while back, Jason had found out Brad had been cheating on Vanessa with other girls, he had confronted him.  Needless to say Brad didnt take it well, him and his \"boys\" beat Jason pretty badly.  When Vanessa found out about the beating she eventually found out about the cheating too, she was crushed.  When Jason told Greg how his little sister had been cheating on and used like that he was ready to kill Brad.  Sadly for Jason by the time him and Greg got to Brad, Vanessa and him had made up.  Brad had turned it around and actually had Vanessa apologizing to him and begging him to keep her as his girlfreind.  Vanessa wouldnt let Greg do anything to Brad but Greg did give him quite a scare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** **************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember what I was saying about those unintended consequences and changes? *wink*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Ripple*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had it tough, he was freinds with Vanessa and wanted to remain that way.  But he hated her boyfreind Brad, but their wasnt much he could do about it.  When he found out Brad had been cheating on Vanessa, he quickly told the one person he knew would be pissed about it, and thought could handle Brad; Greg.  But Jason was soon disappointed when Brad quickly and easily dispatched Greg.  Even the Boy Wonder/Mr Olympia Greg was no match for the titan that is Brad.  As Brad stood over Greg he grabbed Jason in a headlock<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/38723895@N02/4719370479/sizes/l/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/38723895@N0...</a> ).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time you put your nose where it doesnt belong\" Brad threatened as he squeezed Jason's head \"I'm gonna have to put it back in place,\" as he held his fist pulled back ready to punch.  Jason struggled in Brads arm, he pushed with his hand on Brad's rock hard abs.  With all the struggling he didnt manage to even move Brad at all let alone break free.  Jason knew that if that fist with the massive arm is was connected to punched him he would probably be killed, literally.  Jason wet himself.  His fear and embarrassment was also his saving grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHA you pathetic little bitch\" Brad laughed as he casually pushed Jason away, sending Jason flying and tumbling across the ground.  \"But you need some punishment.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jason had not realized before confronting brad with Greg, was that Brad could have beaten Greg in the Mr.Olympia over the years, but Brad had focused on sports instead.  \"Thats where the money is.\" he had said.  Many critics had said Brad had too much muscle and wouldnt beable to be as quick, flexible, or have as much stamina as other atheletes.  But Brad quickly put an end to those critics when he became argueably the best player at Baseball, and Football in the whole country.  In high school he hit over 100 homeruns in his career, would have been more but soon every opposing team began intentionally walking him since they new everytime he hit the ball it would be a home run.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince, in baseball, teams could avoid his dominance he decided football would be better.  In football he stopped the rumors about his stamina by playing ironman; He played both sides, offense and defense.  He dominated as a linebacker on defense easily crashing through the line when he wanted to sack the quarterback.  Or easily tackling anyone with the ball; most players avoiding him at all cost if they could.  On offense he could have easily dominated as a running back easily plowing through tacklers with his incredible size and strength.  But he chose Quarterback, more money, fame and prestige.  He quickly became the number one high school quarterback in the country.  Breaking every record for passing and rushing yards.  His size and strength meant that if people did get to him it would take alot of them to bring him down, so he never had a recorded sack.  Becoming the number one sought after player by colleges and already the number one projected draft pick when he finally enters the NFL draft in a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punishment Brad had in mind was telling Vanessa to get a restraining order against Jason.  Which she initiallly question but quickly did after Brad convinced her.  Brad knew that Jason and her were best freinds and used breaking that up as punishment.  It was the cruelest of punishments.  Jason missed talking and hanging out with Vanessa on the rare occasions.  Vanessa never asked Brad if she could lift the restraining order, but Jason did a few times.  One of the times Brad actually called Vanessa up infront of Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe I wanted to ask you.  Do you miss hanging out with your buddy Jason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but its what you want\" she said. \"Can I lift it?\" she asked hopefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Your right.  It's what I want so keep it\" He said as he sneered at Jason who looked crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost a year Brad walked up to Jason one day.  Over that time Jason had gotten depressed and began doing almost nothing, letting his grades slip and drowning his sorrows in food.  When he had gained almost 100lbs and his grades slipped to the point he wasnt going to be able to attend college let alone get a scholarship, Brad approached with his freinds and Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Fatboy!\" he yelled and Jason flinched.  \"Heard you aint gonna get into college, too bad, I got a full ride\"  Brad gloated as Jason tried to just shrink away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That aint gonna work for a doughboy like you, you cant hide\" Brad said as he poked Jason's belly, his finger feeling like a metal poker jabbing him in the stomach \"Oh i thought the doughboy giggled when you poked him in the belly\" and he poked him again \"Now giggle\" Brad said low and threateningly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didnt want to, he couldnt, not in front of Vanessa.  But Jason was defeated his spirit quickly crumbled and he looked away from Vanessa and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo~Hoooo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go again louder this time\" Brad said and jabbed him again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOO~HOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See your finally listening and accepting your place.  Now being the good guy I am I have something for you something to cheer you up\" Brad said as he held up a piece of paper.  \"Its gonna lift your restraining order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason Immediately perked up when he heard that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See i told you it was gonna cheer you up.  Vanessa already signed it now only you need to sign it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason quickly grabs the pen and signs the form without even reading it.  He jumps up to run over and hug Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa where you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I signed it no more restraining order!\"  Jason says frantically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly this form modifies the restraining order.  No hugging, touching of any kind, and as if i have to say, especially no kissing.  Your only allowed to hangout together and talk, and even then only when I give permission.  So until I give permission the restraining order is in effect.  IF I do give permission its for an hour after which you have to get my permission for another hour.\"  Brad said cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was crushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jason finally pulled himself out of his daydream he found himself outside Vanessa's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I daydreamed the whole time walking here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  he hear the melodic voice behind the door say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its me...... Vanessa,........ Jason.\" He said weezing his weight always made it tough after walking all the way here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jason your here, Let me call Brad real quick see if we can hangout\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood, waiting and sweating, he couldnt wait to get inside and sit down, he was starting to look forward to that more than seeing Vanessa.  He heard Vanessa talking behind the door but couldnt make out what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im sorry Jason Brad says, No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! I called him before I came over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear her relay what he said over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he changed his mind.... Sorry Jason\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I walked all the way here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was talking again on the phone, Jason unable to clearly make out what she was saying until, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I cant say that! But!\"  she pleaded over the phone \"BEAT IT FATASS!!\"  she yelled through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason knew Vanessa would never say that without being forced, but it still hurt.  Jason turned, slumped and began the hike back to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's life turned upside down and he doesnt even realize it.  The poor boy, even Greg's great life now has a blemish on it.  One can ascertain Laura had no intentions of allowing her \"wonderful brother\" to be manhandled in the past.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unintended consequences of messing with reality.  Have you even been listening to my warnings?!  How many times do I have to repeat myself?  Im trying to teach you people something here!  Damnit why do I even try.....

His eyes went wide when a whole list Jason Sullivan's came up. They were organized by address with the nearest at the top. He shook his head figuring that the app was linked to an online directory or something. \"Perhaps it attaches rendering to an individual in the real world. There's no way it could just have an image of everyone. Could it?\" Dismissing the possibility as insane he clicked the name at the top that matched his address.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was once again shocked when a perfectly rendered image of himself appeared on the iPhone's screen. It looked exactly like him right down to the clothes he was wearing (a Green Lantern t-shirt and his dark khaki pants). \"How is that possible?\" he asked out loud to no one. He looked around the room as if he were going to find a hidden camera sending his likeness to the phone in his hand.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he found no such thing he decided to try making some changes to his profile like he'd done with Greg's. He tapped through a few options until he discovered the muscle sliders he'd used before on Laura's brother. Jason, being the scrawny social outcast he was, had always been envious of Greg's superior size; he knew that he'd never be as big, but he could at least see what he would look like with huge muscles.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason moved the slider buttons up slowly enjoying how the image on the screen quickly bulked out. It didn't take long for the Jason on the phone to expand right out of his clothes leaving him clad in only his dark grey briefs (again, how did the app know what he was wearing?!?!). He didn't stop adding mass there, though, and instead kept pushing more and more muscle onto his avatars frame. He stopped when it appeared that he was carrying about the same amount of muscle as Greg. The readouts along the side of the screen listed that he would weigh, if he looked like that, 230 pounds at 6 feet tall.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's all in the name of fantasy so why stop there.\" Jason then quickly slid the muscle adjuster higher until he had far surpassed not only Laura's brother but every man who had ever stepped foot on stage at a bodybuilding show. \"Holy crap!\" Jason said when he spotted the updated numbers. He was still 6 feet tall but was much heavier. \"370 pounds?!? That's nuts! I wonder how strong I would be at that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent a few moments studying the muscled monster on the screen from every angle. He decided to save the settings in case Laura opened his file in the future. Jason figured she would get a descent laugh out of the super buff version he'd made for himself. Assuming the button in the top right labeled \"Apply changes\" was the save button Jason tapped it. As soon as he did a message popped up that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nATTENTION!<br>\r\nTemporal alteration application settings have not been selected. Alterations cannot be made until you've selected one of the following temporal profiles:<br>\r\n-Historical<br>\r\n-Immediate<br>\r\n-Pending<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemporal Alteration Settings can be changed later from the iPhone settings menu.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had no idea what any of those selections meant but he wanted to save his changes so he picked...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason picked the selection at the top of the list. He figured that if Laura wanted to change things later she'd still be able to. Once he tapped \"Historical\" the phone displayed a message that read: \"Calculating and mapping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason noticed that behind the status display the buffed up model of himself was clothed once again. The Green Lantern shirt had returned, but instead of pants the model now wore denim shorts. Both items were extra, extra large to fit his giant body. \"I wonder why the clothes came back. And why shorts? Seems random. Could be a glitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the phone in his hand became extremely hot and he dropped it to the floor. He looked down and saw that there was a message on the screen: \"Alterations complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason bent down to see if the phone was still hot, but when he reached out to touch it he froze. His forearm looked different. Holding it up and examining it he discovered that it was thicker. And more than that it was still expanding. He looked to his upper arm and saw that the same was true. His biceps had gone from nonexistent to about the size of a baseball. He flexed his upper arm and was amazed to see a significant pop in the size and hardness of his still growing muscle.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood and approached a mirror behind Laura's dresser. His reflection showed him that his shoulders were already much wider and his chest was surging forward with mighty pectorals at an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more Jason looked to Laura's iPhone on the floor. \"Is it possible? Am I going to turn into the buffed up version from the app?\" Jason lifted the hem of his shirt to examine his stomach. Already his abdominals, once invisible, had become a shredded washboard of solid bricks stacked 4 high in 2 columns. He laughed out loud at this discovery. \"I have abs! Holy shit! Look at me! This is insane, it's incredible!!\" Jason had now reached a size that was slightly larger than Greg and he raised his arms in a double biceps pose grunting with effort as he squeezed every possible inch into his swelling arms. He studied them and guessed them to be 23 inches around. He straightened his arms and flexed again. His heart soared as his bicep's peak rose higher and higher, his arms now measuring 25 inches. Another release and flex and his arms swelled to 28 inches.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a goddamn beast.\" He said. Jason then noticed that no matter how much he grew his shirt expanded along with him. That's when his eyes dropped to his lower body and he saw that his pants had transformed into a copy of the denim shorts from the phone. \"I still don't know where the shorts came from, but I'm happy to see them. Now I can check out my thighs.\" He raised one of the legs of his shorts and flexed his quads. Massive slabs of beef swelled and hardened beneath his skin. Now that his growth was slowing to a stop Jason realized that his thighs were now bigger around than his chest used to be. He knocked on one of the 4 defined quadriceps and found it to be as hard as stone.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned his attention back to his reflection. He was no longer growing and had become an exact duplicate of the profile he'd created. \"That means I'm 370 pounds of rock hard muscle.\" He curled his arms inward and roared upon witnessing his arms explode into steel girders of strength 31 inches around.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I feel so powerful, so strong. Look at me, I'm way bigger than Greg. Heck, I must be the biggest man in the world. Well, in terms of muscle mass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason confined to pose and flex watching the way his super sized body swelled and bulged. He was so lost in his own reflection that he nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard a gasp from behind him. He spun quickly to find Laura in the doorway, fresh from the shower with a towel wrapped around her middle.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to speak and try to offer an explanation to his new epic girth, but Laura's surprised look softened and she signed. \"Oh, Jason. You startled me. I didn't know you were here.\"She entered the room and pushed past Jason to get to her dresser drawers. \"Outta my way, Gigantor. I forgot my hair dryer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was confused (yet again). He had just added a good 200 pounds of muscle to his frame and Laura didn't seem to notice at all.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to turn and head back to the bathroom with her dryer in hand when something about Jason's expression made her stop. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jason spoke slowly. \"Do you notice anything different about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked him up and down, her eyes moving in great round waves around Jason's massive bulges. \"I don't think so. Same clothes, same haircut, is there something I'm missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think I look, I don't know... bigger, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura threw her hands up. \"Oh, good grief. We go over this every other week. I keep telling you that you're enormous. Look, someone like me puts on 10 pounds and it's noticeable. Someone like you puts on 10 pounds and it's hard to tell. I'm sorry, ok? You look as big and buff as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason raised his hands to calm Laura down. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean anyth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't sweat it. I'm sorry. I just... sometimes I get kind of sensitive. I mean my brother and my sister are both gorgeous and then you're in a league of your own. I guess I just feel like there's nothing special about me. I would give anything to have curves like Vanessa or muscles like you or even Greg. Sorry, I didn't mean to go off like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's brain was working overtime. Clearly he had just transformed into a mountain of muscle and it seemed totally normal to everyone. He then thought back to the message he saw right before he transformed: temporal settings, historical. Somehow the phone had changed the past to account for his increase in size. It seemed so impossible, but so did growing muscle from nowhere. Jason noticed that Laura was looking at him was a devilish grin.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that look for?\" he asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I feel them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He held his arm out and she put her hands on the swell of his bicep. Then he curled his arm up and flexed. Laura's hands seemed to shrink in comparison to the boulder that expanded beneath his skin. When he has fully flexed his arm Laura tried to squeeze the giant ball but found no give whatsoever. She ran her fingers through the grooves and over the hills giving Jason a chill of excitement. She seemed to be getting turned on by his hulking form and Jason began to understand the depth of his new powers. No longer would be blend into the background. He could take what he wanted when he wanted, and there were very few who could stop him. Heck, with a few more minutes with that phone and there would be nothing that could stop him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura released Jason's arm and shivered with giddy excitement. \"Oooh, I never get used to that. You're like living steel.\" She picked up her hair dryer again and adjusted her towel. \"I'm going to go dry my hair and finish getting ready. Why don't you go and watch TV or something and I'll be down in 10 minutes or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Jason said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was about to head out when she looked back over her shoulder and said, \"You know, I'm really glad that you're my friend. You could be out there having your way with any woman you wanted. I mean my sister would give just about anything to jump your bones. But you stick by me. You're a true friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Laura had left Jason scooped up her phone and went downstairs to the living room. He flipped the television on, but paid no mind to what was on. Instead he opened the Alterations app again. He really wanted to make some adjustments to Laura so she could be happy with her body. Maybe some super sexy curves or massive muscles. Or why not both. But Jason was also getting an itch for more power. He was curious to see just what else he could do to his body to become even more super.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason held Laura's phone and stared at his Alterations profile. He really wanted to make some more changes to himself, maybe make himself taller, perhaps even bigger or simply stronger. He wanted to sort through the dozens of options and see just how far he could push his body. But he knew the right thing to do would be to make some of Laura's dreams come true. She deserved some womanly assets or thick muscles and he would deliver. Jason pulled up her profile and saw the 3 dimensional Laura, only this time she was wearing grey cotton shorts and a green t-shirt, not naked like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. Which would she like more, large breasts or big muscles? Maybe I can strike a balance.\" Jason grinned and began making changes.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he did was to increase her height from 5 foot 4 inches up to 5 foot 11 inches. Once her height was set he found a setting that adjusted the ratio of her torso to her legs. Jason shifted her body type so that her legs were longer. Then Jason added several inches to her hips while removing a few from her waist then made adjustments to her butt so that it was round and firm. He was about to expand her breasts, but decided he would save that for the end.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he turned her brown hair to a shimmering gold and brightened her eyes. Jason made some minor tweaks to her face and even found a setting to give her soft, flawless skin. The more he adjusted the more his penis stirred and hardened. He was creating a woman of incredible beauty.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the fun part.\" Jason flipped over to the muscle mass tab that had been so good to him and began increasing her physique. He decided that he wouldn't push her musculature too far. He watched her weight increase from 130 pounds to 185 at which point he stopped. The model version of Laura had gained wide shoulders and a powerful looking chest. Her abdominals, barley visible in the space between the bottom of her shirt and the waist of her shorts, had popped out and looked etched in granite. Her long, long legs were now thick with sinew and her quads were clearly defined. Jason zoomed in on her arms and found that he could add more mass to them separately from the rest of her body. He increased their size by a good 5 inches making them disproportionately large, but when he zoomed back out he loved how they stood out from the rest of her body. She had the overall size of a smaller female bodybuilder while her arms were in league with a few of the larger men. Jason decided to examine some of the other muscle settings he hadn't tried before. First he adjusted Laura's muscle density. He found that no matter where he moved the slider her appearance didn't change at all. Jason deduced that increasing density was a way to increase strength without increasing size. He pushed the slider up to about a 10% increase making Laura far stronger than anyone else her size. Then he saw a menu called \"expansion ability.\" When he tapped it a drop down asked for specific triggers. There were all sorts including anger, arousal, flex, self control and many more. Jason selected \"flex\" and was then prompted to dial in her expansion factor. This he set to 30%.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm right this means that she'll be able to flex her muscles up to be 30 percent larger than they already are. That should be interesting. Ok, at long last: the boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went back to the main menu and zoomed in on Laura's chest. The stats along the side listed her has having a 42 inch chest and an A cup bust. Jason put his finger on the slider to increase her breast size and began adding. He watched as her t-shirt expanded and moved away from her body as if filled with a pair of balloons attached to an air hose. Laura's bust very quickly eclipsed her older sister's measurements and kept right on growing. Jason kept increasing her size until she was sporting an I cup. Her massive mammeries were on par with those of Jordan Carver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wanted to look at the overall model. When he zoomed out there was a brief pause and the word \"Updating\" appeared. A moment later Laura's enhanced body reappeared but her shorts and t-shirt had been replaced with a very skimpy red bikini with black trim.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Jason said aloud. \"With the temporal setting still on historical she'll want to really flaunt that body.\" He studied the goddess on the screen. She was impossibly sexy. Her massive breasts stood high and firm on her muscular chest like a pair of volleyballs. Just below her soft fleshy pillows was a cobbled path of muscles atop Laura's trim tummy which then led to her flared hips.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to hit \"Apply changes\" so he could meet this goddess but he held off to search through other options just to make sure there was nothing else he wanted to bless Laura with. A few pages over he found one titled \"Relationships.\" He was happy to see his name listed under the \"Best Friend\" category but saw that the \"Love Interest\" one was blank. Jason was excited to unleash the new and improved Laura on the world, but he wanted to make sure she didn't run off and leave him. Truth be told he was feeling very territorial over her. After all he was the one giving her the most incredible body around, didn't he deserve her affection? He added his name to the love interest column and was greeted with yet another slider. This time to select the level of interest she had in him. At the lower levels were listings such as \"crush\" or \"infatuation\" while on the other end were settings like \"soul mates.\" Jason set her interest level a little beyond halfway in the \"strong sexual attraction\" area.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last he was ready to apply the changes. The only decision left was to determine if he wanted to adjust the temporal alteration setting. If he kept it on historical she wouldn't freak out but she could also take her body for granted if her memory was altered. On the other hand the instantaneous setting could cause some panic but once Laura realized what was going on she could really enjoy her new assets though he didn't look forward to trying to explain her changes to anyone else.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some consideration he picked... \u00a0</span></div></div>",

Somewhere in the past Laura would get used to having this amazing body, he could skip awkward and potentially friendship ending confrontation and jump straight ahead to sexual experimentation with his best friend who would be hotter than any woman currently living.  He flexed his enormous bicep and grinned from ear to ear before he flicked thumb across the \"Apply Changes\" button.

He wobbled on his feet for a moment as an inexplicable wave of dizziness washed over him and he fought to not sink back onto the couch.  \"What the hell was that?\" he muttered as he rubbed his head.  He instantly noticed a number of changes around the room that caused alarm bells to go off in his head.  Lauras \"shelf' on the entertainment center, that was seconds ago packed full of Anime and superhero movies was now all chick flicks.  The top of the entertainment center was crowded with senior prom pictures of Laura and various jock and preps Jason recognized, most of who were older than they were.  \"Original\" Laura had never been to any prom...  \"One, two, three, four, senior prom pictures?\"  Jason wrapped his head around the fact that Laura would not be a senior herself until school started again in the fall.  \"They let seniors take junior high girls to the prom?\"  His eyes lingered on the pictures again, taking in how exponentially gorgeous she was in each picture.  \"Shit... we never went to prom together, if she went why didn't she go with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason?  Is that you?\"  Lauras voice startled Jason out of his reverie and he spun around to face her, holy shit... she was more intensely beautiful than he could have imagined.  \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not at all.  The play date thing is so far over, get your head around it,\" she punctuated this with a sharp poke to Jasons ribs with her forefinger and he realized with horror that all the muscle he had given himself had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth hung open with shock and he moaned, \"I don't understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed, \"There's nothing to understand Jason, we haven't been friends for a long time now and the creepy stalker thing has got to stop.\"  She leaned forward, enough for her gargantuan breasts to swell against his chest as she shoved her phone in his face.  \"You snooping on my phone to figure out who I'm dating now so you can cry to them and tell them that \"we were made for each other\" in the hopes they'll dump me and I'll hang out with you again has got to stop.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura picked Jason up bodily by his shoulders and walked/dragged him to the front door where she placed him firmly on the doormat.  \"And you, sneaking into my house has GOT. TO. STOP.\"  Laura looked firmly at Jason, as he tried to fight the feelings of complete bewilderment.  Her gaze softened slightly.  \"Jason, I know we were friends once, good friends.  And that's why I've tried really hard not to be mean to you about this.  But being nice isn't working so I'm going to have to be mean even if I don't want to.

It was something to focus on.  Something different to focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is your problem nerd?\" Jason spun around to see Brad Taylor, the star quarterback for the High School foot ball team who had graduated a couple years ago. He had been in one of Lauras prom photos.  Jason glared at Brad, resentful to see him here, angry that his inner turmoil was being interrupted, angry that this douche was apparently welcome here.  \"I don\u2019t want to have to kick your ass again punk. Leave!\u201d Brad jerked his thumb over his thumb over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glowered at Brad, shaking with anger and a sudden rush of adrenaline.  This prick had kicked his ass before?

The cartilage of his nose was crushed and blood was flowing down his face at an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\"  Brad's protests were cut off as Jason kicked him forcefully between the legs, Jason punched him the mouth as he sank to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't sure how long he had been pummeling Brad.

Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned from the slumped body of Brad with his teeth bared and his fist cocked back.  The owner of the voice was a cute girl, probably six inches shorter than Jason with frizzy red hair pulled back in a ponytail.  She flinched away from Jason and he blinked before lowering his fist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God what happened?\"  She rushed to Brads side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed and wiped at his nose with the back of his hand.  He could tell he was smearing blood on his face.  \"It was self defense,\" he said finally.  He sneered at two jocks that were standing uncertainly at the end of the sidewalk leading up to Laura's porch.  \"Real manly of you fellas to send the girl first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Self defense?  You don't have a scratch on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad said he was going to kick my ass, look at me.  If I didn't taken the first swing I wouldn't survive one hit from that meathead.\"  Jason sniffed again.  For some reason his nose was bleeding he noted.  Or maybe it was just runny and it was mixing with the blood he had smeared on his face.  It was hard to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shook her head and pulled out an iPhone.  \"I'm calling an ambulance,\" she declared.  Jason stood uncertainly wondering if he should stick around or leave.  Before he could decide what he was going to do Laura's front door flew open and Laura stood there with an expression of horror.  Her eyes went from Brads limp body cradled in the redheads arms to Jason and before he could blink Laura had dashed across the porch and lifted Jason off the ground by the front of his shirt.  His feet swayed inches off the ground and he sniffed again.  He was pretty sure it was a nosebleed, he could taste blood in the back of his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, what the fuck did you do?\"  Laura was growling like an animal.  Fine, that made it easier to hate her.  Jason was pretty sure he wanted to come out of this hating her.  It would make what felt like her betraying him easier to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He threatened to kick my ass and I decided this time I wouldn't let him.  I've had enough of him and his jock bullshit.\"  Jason wasn't sure what jock bullshit specifically he was referencing but if it involved him getting his ass kicked then he was dedicated to the concept of having had enough of it.  \"Speaking of which why don't you tell those two hiding behind your mailbox that it's safe to come out now that you're here to protect them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone insane?\"  Laura shook Jason hard, his ears were ringing and his neck ached like he had suffered whiplash when she stopped.  \"It looks like you tried to kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you're bigger and stronger than me, might makes right doesn't it?\"  Jason slapped Laura across the face hard, leaving a bloody handprint on her cheek.  \"Don't ever shake me like that again Laura or I'll make you kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura dropped him and Jason stumbled as his feet hit the ground.  She stepped back, balling her fist and Jason braced himself for the inevitable punch but the squawk of sirens nearby distracted her.  \"Nikki, stay with Brad,\" Laura hissed.  \"If you don't walk away right now Jason you will regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed and rubbed at his nose again.  \"I already regret ever having come here.\"  He spat a gob of bloody phlegm on the ground between him and Laura before he turned and walked slowly away.  He glared at the two jocks as he walked past, relishing how they flinched away from him.  His sneer dimmed as he realized that in addition to an ambulance a police car was also pulling up to the scene.  </span></div></div>",

The cop shook his head and told Jason to put them behind his back.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Jason smirked, \"you want to do me from behind. Sure thing boss.\" Jason turned around and stuck his butt out with his wrists together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a punk,\" the cop said and pushed Jason against the wall. \"And you'll get what's coming to you. But not from me.\" he cuffed Jason making sure to get them nice and tight.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer lead Jason down a hall to an interrogation room where a very serious looking detective was waiting. The cop shoved Jason into a chair across a table from the detective. Jason eyeballed his reflection in the one-way glass that ran along the wall and wondered if they had an audience.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy you beat is in intensive care.\" The detective told Jason. \"He's bleeding internally and his doctors aren't sure they can stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason considered this for a moment. \"He threatened me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you came at him with a weapon? He was unarmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A weapon? What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you use, a baseball bat, a golf club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't use anything. I punched him and kicked him. That's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective stood up. \"Then explain to me how you managed to break 22 bones in his body and leave him bleeding to death on the ground with just your hands and feet! Look at your hands, they're not even bruised. I've worked here 20 years and I've never seen a beating that bad that didn't involve some kind of foreign object. No scrawny kid like you could ever do that to Brad without resorting to cowardly tactics. I knew Brad, I know how tough he is, and no runt like you could ever take him down with your bare hands. Unless, of course, you're hiding some pretty big muscles in those twiggy arms of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't like where this was going. Clearly this guy had some connection to Brad Taylor, perhaps he was even a relative, and he was looking to exact some kind of revenge. Thats when his last statement rang in Jason's ears. Was it true that he'd administered a beating far beyond his own capabilities? Was it possible that he did in fact have hidden muscles? The iPhone app said he was creating a paradox, what if this was a part of it and his body was small but still carried the strength of the massive muscles he had given himself before everything went wrong. That could really change things. But maybe he'd just gotten lucky and was able to get some good hits in. He had to test his theory and find out quickly before this detective lost control and decided to put him in the hospital too.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed the cuffs around his wrist and began pulling his hands apart with all his might. He put began twisting and straining the short chain that kept his hands bound together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason nearly gasped when the chain between the handcuffs snapped. He hadn\u2019t even begun to try very hard either. He kept his hands together and tried not to let his expression give away his emotions while inside his heart was doing backflips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m strong,</i> he thought. <i>Not just strong, super strong! This is gonna be good. This asshole is going to be sorry he ever picked on me. He\u2019s just like Brad, he thinks that just because I\u2019m smaller than he is he can push me around. Oh, this is going to be good!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe detective stood up and walked around the table to where Jason sat. Then he leaned down and put his face right up to Jason\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I think happened,\u201d the man said. Jason smelled hints of alcohol on his breath and began to wonder if this guy was even supposed to be here today or did he just show up when he learned that they had the guy who had put Brad in the hospital. \u201cI think you snuck up on Brad and clocked him with a baseball bat. I don\u2019t think he ever saw you coming. I think you\u2019re a goddamn coward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed loudly in the detective\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re calling me a coward? You\u2019re the one threatening the skinny kid in the handcuffs. But that\u2019s ok because I know something you don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh yeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am stronger than anyone you\u2019ve ever met, and I\u2019ve already broken out of these pathetic shackles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective gave Jason a quizzical look then Jason reached up, grabbed him by his hair, and slammed his head into the metal table. The force of the man\u2019s skull left a deep crater in the table\u2019s surface. His eyes rolled back in their sockets and a spurt of blood ran down his temple. Jason then gripped his would be attacker around the throat and, standing up, lifted the man into the air. Jason felt good. This was so easy; he could overpower anyone. No one would ever be able to take advantage of him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sucker punch Brad.\u201d Jason told his victim. \u201cHe saw me coming. But he didn\u2019t know what he was getting into. Just like you didn\u2019t. You thought you\u2019d just come in here and teach me a lesson. He\u2019s just a scrawny little kid, I can take him, right? Wrong. I\u2019m guessing no one is watching since what you\u2019re doing is very illegal, so there\u2019s no one to help you now. Not that they could.\u201d Jason tossed the 220 pound detective across the room and into the far wall like he was tossing a rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d He told the nearly unconscious man on the floor. \u201cIf you\u2019re smart you\u2019ll just let this go. If you come after me you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d Jason walked up to the locked door and gave it a solid kick. The lock shattered and the heavy door swung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason made his way down the hall. He didn\u2019t really know his way around the police station, but he wasn\u2019t too concerned. Most police officers he\u2019d come across were arrogant and he figured they would assume that anyone walking the halls couldn\u2019t be a prisoner. He just kept his head up and tried to look like he knew where he was going. On his way out he passed three different groups of police officers and not one of them broke conversation to ask him who he was or where he was going. With a huge grin Jason walked right past the front desk and out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason strode down the street a free man with superhuman strength. His brain was working overtime thinking about what he should do next. There were so many people he wanted to pay a visit to, so many who had made fun of him or bullied him over the years. In the mean time, though, he thought it would be best to go home and clean up first and maybe get some rest. He suddenly felt very tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later his path home took him past the local gym. Looking in he could see a group of guys at the back pumping iron. They were all friends of Brad\u2019s and most had bullied or tormented him at one time or another. Perhaps a little payback would feel good.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason very much wanted to go into the gym and teach those bullies a lesson. He could feel anger building inside him and now that he was super strong he had a way to let that anger out. He even made it so far as to grabbing the door handle, but then he decided against going in. There would be plenty of time to terrorize those guys just as they had terrorized him. First he wanted to go home and clean up. And pass out.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason arrived home a short while later. As he approached his house he began to really wonder just how strong he was. Was he super human or just as strong as a really big man? By the time he was a few houses away from home his curiosity got the better of him. There was a Mini Cooper parked in front of the house right next to his. Jason walked over and squatted down behind the small car and gripped the frame beneath the bumper. Standing and lifting he tried to lift the car using every ounce of strength he had. He really didn't know what to expect so he was quite surprised when the back end of the car lifted up about 6 inches off the ground. He held it there for several seconds before the strain became too much and he had to return the car to the ground.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned. \"Not bad,\" he told himself. \"I'm no superhero, but I can definitely overpower most anyone.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied Jason entered his house and climbed the stairs to his room. Once inside he saw that his walls were covered with pictures of Laura. Many were taken from magazines or advertisements but most were candid shots and in each and everyone she was achingly beautiful.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Jason could feel his rage returning. He was reminded of the friend he had lost and the way she had treated him, like a stalker. He had to admit she was right, but this wasn't really him. He stood at his desk looking at a picture of Laura at her friends at a bonfire on the beach. In the photo she was wearing a pair of denim shorts and a white bikini top that supported and flaunted her massive breasts. The breasts that she had because of him. He didn't realize it, but he was holding onto the wooden desk chair and squeezing his anger out. Jason gripped so hard that the thick oak split and snapped apart in his hands. Another victim of his enhanced strength.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirmly back in reality (or this one, at least) Jason looked at the photo again. This time he focused on Laura's face and really recognized just how happy she looked. Jason sighed and began removing the pictures from his wall. Once they were all down he tossed them in his closet and then went to the bathroom across the hall to shower.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up Jason felt refreshed but also exhausted so he climbed into bed and was asleep within minutes.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke the next morning he was shocked to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning Jason awoke groggy and sore as if he'd been working out hard all night. He stumbled out of bed and into the bathroom. Once he flipped on the light and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror all the tiredness swept out of his body and his eyes opened wide.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" he said taking in his reflection. \"First I'm strong and now I'm buff.\" Somehow his body had expanded overnight and he was now sporting the physique of a middleweight bodybuilder. His nightshirt, usually large on his thin frame, was now plastered to his expanded pecs and sinewy shoulders. Jason raised his arm and laughed when his bicep bursted out giving him an arm 17 inches around. \"What the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went to the bathroom and returned to his room. Everything looked exactly the same as it had the night before. So why had he grown? Jason pulled some of his clothes out of his closet hoping that perhaps the historical function of the iPhone app was working and had given him some bigger clothes to go with his bigger body but alas, no. He went through article after article looking for something that would fit him finally settling on a pair of gym shorts he'd never worn and a promotional t-shirt for the movie \"Serenity\" he'd gotten but was always too big to wear. Now it fit just a little tight around the chest and arms.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason admired his physique in the mirror. In one night he had outgrown Brad or any of his bully buddies. He was a little bummed that they would no longer underestimate his power, but he had to admit he looked good. He lifted the right leg of his shorts and flexed his thigh. Thick, powerful quads swelled forth brimming with untold strength. \"Well,\" he said aloud, \"I may not be as big as I was before this whole paradox thing began, but I'm not about to look a gift horse in the mouth.\" Jason thought for a second then continued, \"Maybe that's what's going on. Maybe the paradox is righting itself and the other reality, my reality, is bleeding through. That would also explain why I was much stronger than I looked yesterday. And I have to admit, I feel even stronger today.\" Jason put his hands on his hips and flexed his chest. He smiled when a symphony of pops and snaps erupted from his strained shirt as the seems were overtaxed by his thick chest.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever's going on things seem to be turning around for me.\" Jason looked out his bedroom window at the beach. It was still early and people were just arriving and laying out their towels. \"Well, no sense in sitting around inside all day.\" He slipped his shoes on (a little snug, but still fit) and left the house.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spotted the Mini Cooper still parked at his neighbors and decided to test a theory. Returning to the rear of the car he, once again, gripped the rear frame. This time when he lifted the entire back end of the car came up a lot more easily. He held the bumper up to his chest and stood all the way up. He curled the car's back half a few times watching as his biceps leapt to attention, the large vein running across the peak was bulging out ready to burst through his skin. \"I am stronger. This just keeps getting stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone noticed Jason returned the Mini to the ground and headed around his house to the back patio which had a staircase leading down to the beach. He spent a few hours just walking along the shore enjoying the way all the girls would watch his rippling muscles as he passed. On more than one occasion he flexed his arm feigning a stretch and watched as the nearest girl would go wide eyed and turn red.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guy could get used to this kind of attention.\" Jason said to himself as he sat down in the sand near a lifeguard tower. He waved at a big breasted beauty who was eyeing him from a distance. When she waved back he gave her a quick wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a shadow fell over him and a voice spoke from his right. \"Jason! Is that you? How did this happen?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cJason, how can this be you? What happened? How did you get so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up and saw a girl standing over him. She had red hair that fell down over her shoulders. She was undeniably cute and wore a black bikini top that contrasted her creamy pale and slightly freckled skin and framed a pair of pert C cup breasts. He could see that she was also wearing a matching black bikini bottom, but it was shrouded behind a white silk sarong that was tied off at her hip and hung down almost all the way to her knees. He knew this girl looked familiar, but from where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason pondered when he\u2019d seen this girl before she continued to berate him, \u201cAre you on steroids or something? Is that why you beat the crap out of Brad yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it, she was the one he\u2019d seen yesterday. She\u2019d called for help and held Brad until the ambulance arrived. What was her name again? It was on the tip of his tongue. \u201cNikki...\u201d he said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Nikki\u2019 me, I want to know what\u2019s going on. How could you go from scrawny to huge overnight? And why were you so brutal with Brad? You almost killed him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood up and held his hands up to calm Nikki. He had a good 6 or 7 inches on her and the fact that she now had to look up to him as well as his expanded physique helped to quiet her down. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not on drugs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then how did you get so big?\u201d Nikki\u2019s eyes flowed over Jason\u2019s shoulders and down his thick arms and back up to his heaving chest. Jason didn\u2019t know this girl but he could see that behind her anger she was turned on by his muscles. He decided to play this to his advantage. He grabbed the hem of his shirt and pulled it up over his head in one quick motion leaving his torso bare. Now that Nikki could see his surging pecs and sculpted abs her face flushed slightly. To his left and over her shoulder Jason could see the busty blond he\u2019d been making eyes with smiling and taking in his form. She blew a kiss his way and pretended to fan her face as if she were overheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest I\u2019m not sure. That is I have a theory about it, but really I just woke up this way.\u201d He raised his arms and hit a double biceps pose. He examined his own arms and wondered to himself if they had grown throughout the day. He wasn\u2019t completely sure, but they did look bigger than the 17 inch guns he\u2019d had this morning. Was he constantly growing? It would make more sense than only growing while he was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was staring at his arms. Her hand slowly began to rise in an effort to touch his biceps that was likely more subconscious than anything. As her hand got to around the height of her shoulder Jason lowered his arm and let Nikki\u2019s fingers envelope his mountainous peak. \u201cWow,\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Jason said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked him in the eye. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your theory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dropped his arms and Nikki did the same. He spoke with an air of mystery, \u201cI\u2019d tell you, but I doubt you\u2019d believe me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry me.\u201d She was beginning to sound annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later.\u201d Jason looked back over Nikki\u2019s shoulder to the blond again. She was still watching their conversation intently and now that she made eye contact with Jason again she used the opportunity to heft her huge boobs and squeeze them together. Then she licked her lips and patted the sand next to her in a \u201ccome on over\u201d gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki took in a deep breath. \u201cLook, I can get past the beating you gave Brad. You went way overboard, but that bully probably had it coming. But something really strange is going on with you. It\u2019s not normal for someone to grow muscles overnight, but if you know what\u2019s going on and you\u2019re keeping it from me then I think we might just be over. I don\u2019t like to give ultimatums, but you need to let me in. Please tell me or I\u2019m going to walk away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked from Nikki to the mysterious bikini beauty. He was confused, it sounded like he and this girl were involved and that could be worth looking into. At the same time this new reality was a chance for him to be someone totally new. He was no longer a skinny nerd he could be a super powered muscle machine and get just about any girl he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he knew what he really wanted...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason looked into NIkki\u2019s eyes. There was something very compelling about her that he wanted to explore. As much as he wanted to break out of his nerdy shell and go have his way with some random women he wanted to be with this adorable redhead even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole story. I doubt you\u2019ll believe it, but I\u2019ll tell you. First can we go somewhere private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded. \u201cSure. Let\u2019s go back to my place.\u201d She took his hand and led him across the sand and away from the beach. They went to a small one bedroom apartment about two blocks inland where, Jason guessed, Nikki lived alone. The living room was a bit messy so once they were in NIkki spent a few minutes picking up a few random articles of clothing that were strewn around. As she did Jason approached a large bookshelf against the wall near the television. He saw that there were a few photos on the top shelf and one of them was of Nikki and Jason with their arms around each other smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded and sighed. He was afraid of this. It would make things a bit tougher. He sat on the couch and a few moments later was joined by Nikki. She sat close to him and slightly turned with her leg bent on the cushion between them. The sarong was open revealing her thigh all the way up to her hip and Jason found himself eying her soft skin. He followed the line of her waist up to her breasts and again found himself wishing he could reach out and run his hands over her body. This girl was damn sexy. Suddenly he realized that he was staring at her boobs and she\u2019d probably be upset, but when he looked her in the eye he found that she was checking him out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was still shirtless and Nikki looked ready to devour his chest. \u201cI still can\u2019t get used to this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible, but look at you. You look so hot.\u201d She reached her hands out and placed them on his chest. She squeezed the thick muscles then slid her hands down to his stomach feeling the grooves between his abdominals and then the tiny ridges of his obliques. NIkki let out an excited gasp and Jason noticed that her nipples were erect and pressing through the fabric of her bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki slid her hands back up to Jason\u2019s shoulders then down his arms. As she reached his biceps he flexed and watched as goosebumps broke out all the way up her arms. He was just about to lean in and start feeling her up as well when she straightened and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, how did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down. \u201cThis isn\u2019t easy. Like I said I don\u2019t expect you to believe me, but just know that what I\u2019m telling you is the truth. I just don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings or make you think I\u2019m inventing stuff or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki took Jason\u2019s hands in hers. \u201cBaby, it\u2019s okay. Have you ever known me to get mad at you for telling me something I didn\u2019t want to hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d he said meeting her eyes again. \u201cI don\u2019t know you. I mean, I don\u2019t remember you. I see that picture over there and clearly we have history, but I never saw you before you yelled at me yesterday.\u201d Jason could see confusion in Nikki\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut don\u2019t feel bad, that whole few minutes in there was a real mystery to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. You lost your memory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. It\u2019s more like I never had it. Let me start from the beginning.\u201d Jason told her everything. He started with him and Laura as friends. He told her about how he\u2019d been planning to hang out with her today and found the iPhone with the strange app on it. He told her about changing himself and then Laura. And he told her how he\u2019d suddenly found himself back to normal size and being tossed on his ass by Laura and then threatened by Brad Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused while Nikki took everything in. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t believe you. I mean, I do, kind of. I guess. It\u2019s pretty unbelievable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jason agreed. \u201cI\u2019m still figuring it all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how does this all apply to you growing muscles overnight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the app said I was creating a paradox. I think that because I made Laura really attractive she was more prone to making friends and leaving me behind. Since we weren\u2019t friends I never got her to buy an iPhone and therefore she never got the app and I never changed her. Paradox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but your muscles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yesterday I was still really strong even before I started growing. That\u2019s why I beat up Brad so bad. I didn\u2019t realize I had super strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki seemed intrigued by this thought, she perked up slightly, \u201cSuper strength?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was even able to rip a pair of handcuffs off. I tore right through the metal. Then I found I was able to lift one end of a car up off the ground a few inches. Not for long, but I did it. I think that even though my muscles were gone my strength remained somehow. And now for some reason my reality is merging with this one and my muscles are growing back. The funny thing is that it\u2019s making me even stronger. When I woke up with morning I was like this and I think I\u2019m even bigger now. Oh, and I tried the car lift again and found it much easier to get the car even higher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re still growing? How big are you going to get?\u201d Nikki asked. Her breathing was getting slightly heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed, \u201cIf I go back to my size before the paradox I\u2019ll be a giant. You have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squinted at him then smiled a mischievous grin. Jason could see that she was turning the idea of enormous muscles over in her mind. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you should stay here for the next day or two while you... uh... grow. That way I can keep my eye on you and make sure you\u2019re okay. Plus maybe being here will help jog your memory of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t think it works like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki moved closer to him and slid her body into his arms so she was leaning up against his chest. She traced a finger along the outline of his giant pectoral. \u201cI\u2019m happy to do my part. I could reenact a few of your... favorite memories.\u201d She leaned in and kissed his shoulder moving up towards his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could feel his penis getting hard. He wanted this girl so bad, but there was something in the back of his mind telling him that something was wrong. She was a little too accepting of his outrageous story. There was no way in the world that anyone should believe him, but she was right onboard. Then again he was a hulking mass of proof and she was clearly turned on by his body. Perhaps her attraction was allowing her to accept what he was saying more easily. After all there was a picture of the two of them happy together, they clearly had a pretty good relationship.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason placed his hand on Nikki's knee and slowly slid it up her thigh taking in her flawless skin on inch at a time. \"Well, I suppose I really should stay. You seem so eager to help.\" He leaned in closer hoping for a kiss.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, I am,\" Nikki purred. She put her hand on his cheek and pressed her lips to his. Jason put his hands on her hips and used his incredible strength to lift Nikki up and place her on his lap, her legs straddled his legs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you are strong.\" Nikki rubbed the copious bulges of his upper torso.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And getting stronger all the time.\" Jason bounced his pecs up and down.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me!\" Nikki got up from the couch and ran down the hall to her bedroom. A minute later she returned with a sewing kit. She searched through the contents for a moment then pulled out a tape measure. \"I think it would be good to know exactly how big you are. Plus we can measure you as you grow. You know, for science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \"Alright, if that's your custom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up, big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason complied. Nikki looked him up and down.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now,\" she said, \"where to start. How about with those juicy thighs.\" She slid her hands around his right leg and wrapped the measuring tape. Jason flexed and Nikki moaned as his quadriceps swelled in her hands pushing her fingers apart. Once she got the tale measure set she announced the result: \"25 inches, very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moved down his leg to his calf. Jason obliged with another flex and once again she called out the result. \"18 inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and wrapped the tape around his chest at the thickest part of his pectorals. \"Wow, your chest is a bulging 52 inches. Very impressive. Finally let's check those guns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason flexed his arm and watched as Nikki measured. \"19 inches. Amazing.\" She released the tape measure and let it fall to the floor. Then she leaned in and kissed the peak of his bulging bicep. Jason couldn't stand it anymore. He scooped Nikki up with one arm under her butt and carried her to the bedroom with ease. He tossed her down on the bed and climbed on top of her.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her firm legs around his middle while he took hold of her bikini top with both hands and pulled it apart with a snap. He took in the sight of her perfect C cup breasts for a split second, then he descended on them, sucking and licking with abandon. His hands moved south feeling the curve and contours of her hips and thighs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ravaging her breasts for several minutes Jason sat up. When Nikki saw him her expression turned to one of concern.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, your nose. It's bleeding.\" she said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason touched his hand to his face and it came away red and sticky. He got up and went to the bathroom to find that his nose was, in fact, bleeding.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Nikki called from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason kept pressure on his nose for a few minutes to staunch the flow of blood. \"Yeah,\" he replied. \"It's funny, I had a nosebleed yesterday too. Not sure why. I suppose- AAAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!\" A sharp bolt of pain shot through Jason's skull. He braced himself by grabbing the bathroom sink, but the porcelain basin shattered in his hands.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was at the door in a flash, \"What is it? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason waved her off. \"I'm ok, it's going away. Just something in my head. I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Can I get you anything? Do you want to go to a hospital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he stumbled out of the bathroom. \"I just want to lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it to the bed and Nikki joined him. She lay by his side and intertwined her legs with his. \"Are you sure you're okay, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said, though he really wasn't sure. \"I just need some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later he was asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was sitting on a bench in a park. About 20 yards away a small group of girls were chasing each other around some trees and across a field. He recognized one of them instantly, it was Laura. The enhanced one. She stood a head taller than most of the other girls around her and her long legs propelled her faster than all others. As she ran her thigh muscles swelled and pumped her quads to bodybuilder proportions. She wore skintight black lycra shorts and a matching bikini top, and her immense breasts bounced beautifully in a hypnotic rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ran up behind another girl, a tiny blond, and scooped her up hoisting her onto her shoulder with one hand. With her free hand she flexed her bicep which swelled with incredible muscle expansion to 22 inches in girth. Laura yelled something to the other girls, but Jason couldn\u2019t quite make it out. It must have been some kind of challenge because the other four advanced on Laura. Jason recognized only one of the group: Nikki. Laura lifted the blond girl high into the air with both of her hands and smiled. Jason could see that the girl Laura held was laughing so hard tears were running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura again taunted the girls by saying something Jason couldn\u2019t understand (though the words on her lips looked a lot like \u201ccome and get her\u201d) and the four pounced. Nikki and another girl climbed up either side of Laura, holding her arms and planting their feet on her thighs. The other two girls aimed low and wrapped their arms around Laura\u2019s legs at her knees where they held tight trying to keep the mighty girl from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled broadly as she surveyed what was happening, then she spun quickly easily breaking the hold of the two girls at her feet and simultaneously tossing Nikki and the other climber off. She then took about five steps away while dragging one of the girls along the ground clinging to her shoe, she shook that girls hand off then set the tiny blond down. Laura raised her arms into the air triumphantly before flexing a stupendous double biceps and transitioning into a crab flex with size and definition that any male bodybuilder would have been proud to display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched as Nikki got up off the ground and jogged over to where he sat. His eyes followed her gorgeous legs as they flexed and relaxed, while they possessed no where near the size or strength of Laura\u2019s stems Jason still found them to be perfect in their own way. She was wearing light blue cotton shorts with a white stripe on the side and a tight tank top that was torn off at the bottom to show off her trim tummy. Her red hair was tied back in a pony tail and, Jason noticed as she got closer, she was covered in a slick sheen of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sat down next to Jason and smiled. She said something, but it was as though he had cotton stuffed in his ears; he couldn\u2019t make out a word. Apparently he didn\u2019t need to, though, because he spoke a response which was also impossible to hear. Whatever he said must have been good because Nikki grinned and even blushed a little. One of her hands went to her chest where her finger did a slow dance across the skin right where her cleavage began. Jason noticed, a bit to his amazement, that NIkki wasn\u2019t wearing a bra and between the dampness from her sweat and the tightness of her top he could clearly make out the outline of her nipples below the fabric of her shirt as well as the curve of her grapefruit sized breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason said something else and Nikki smiled a dazzling smile. She spoke something in return and while Jason couldn\u2019t understand it the look in her eyes was an unmistakable \u201ccome hither\u201d look. Jason leaned forward and put a hand on Nikki\u2019s leg. He had just enough wherewithal to notice that he was back to being his scrawny self. Then he went in for a kiss. Just before their lips touched things went very white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blinked. For a minute he wasn\u2019t sure where he was then he began to remember: he was at Nikki\u2019s apartment. There was light streaming in which had woken him from his... dream? No, it felt like more than that.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to the source of the light and saw Nikki at the window. She'd just pulled the curtains back and sunlight was filling the room. \u00a0She wore a black pleated skirt that displayed her legs spectacularly and a tight white button-up shirt that she had tied off just under her bust. She'd also left the top buttons open and her gorgeous cleavage was on full display. Nikki's mouth was open in a look of total shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason squinted at her. \"What's that look for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Look at you! You.. You're.. I mean wow!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood up and examined himself. He was clearly huge. He still had not reached the full size he'd programmed for himself with the Alterations app, but he was well on his way. Already he'd outgrown Laura's brother Greg and pretty much any bodybuilder the world over. Jason raised his arm and flexed. A massive bolder erupted from an arm that, just 2 days prior, had been rail thin.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the tape measure!\" Nikki ran to the living room and scooped up the tape measure from the floor. As she went Jason spotted a scale on the floor near the bed and stepped on it. The dial spun and landed on 290 pounds. His eyes went wide, he still had a fair bit of growth ahead of him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki returned from the living room and, just like the night before started with Jason's thighs. When he flexed them she just couldn't help but feel all over the massive slabs of muscle. Jason watched as she explored the swells and valleys of his leg, running her fingers through the grooves between the defined plates. She stopped when she realized she was being watched.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I got carried away.\" Nikki pulled the measure around his leg. \"Whoa! 38 inches!\" She then slid down and cupped his calf muscle in her hand before measuring. \"25 inch calves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stood up and attempted to wrap the tape measure around Jason's chest, but it wasn't quite long enough. \"Looks like about 70 inches or so, hard to tell. Now, let me see those guns again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled and flexed his arms for her. She ran the tape around the largest part. \"Oh my. 26 and one half inches. Is that a record?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged. He really didn't know. He did know that regardless of his size his strength was sure that his strength was a record. He could feel even more power flowing through his body today than before. And there was still more to come.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't kidding when you said you'd be huge. I just never thought you'd get this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled and wrapped a thick arm around Nikki's middle and pulled her close. \"I'm not done yet. I've still got about 80 more pounds to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's eyes went wide again. She shook her head in disbelief. Then she landed back in reality. \"Oh shit, I'm going to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work, dummy.\" She escaped his embrace and grabbed a pair of black sneakers.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt lost again. \"What time is is? Where do you work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 2 in the afternoon. And I work at the All Star Sports Bar and Grill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at her clothes again with her body on extreme display. \"Bartender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish. Waitress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must do really well in tips.\" Jason felt like an idiot as soon as the words were out of his mouth.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead Nikki smiled. She hefted her breasts up and squeezed them together. \"The girls never fail me. But we've got to get you into a ladies club. You'd make a million dollars a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. He was typically the shy type, but with his new body and super strength he was feeling more and more bold all the time. He actually thought it could be fun to dance in a club like that. The thought of girls clamoring over each other reminded him of his dream. He asked Nikki about it and she smiled back at him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember that. That was the first time we kissed. See! You're getting your memories back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you all doing with Laura? Why were you attacking her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a bonafide Laura Friedman workout session. They typically devolved into Laura showing off how much stronger she was. I'm sure you could take her now, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what happened between her and me? Why does she hate me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a long story and I don't have the time.\" Nikki squeezed Jason's hand as if to reassure him that they would talk later. \"Ok sexy, I got to go. Help yourself to the kitchen. I'll try to get out early and see if I can find someplace to get you some clothes. In the meantime it looks like you're my prisoner, unless you want to walk around naked. I sure won't complain.\" She winked and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was alone to contemplate the nature of the paradox he was in, and the more he thought the worse he felt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once he was alone Jason approached a large mirror in Nikki's bedroom and examined himself. He flexed various muscle groups and watched as his body exploded with size and hardness never before seen. He was already bigger than anyone in the world and still growing by the minute. And to top that off he was in possession of strength that would easily be considered superhuman. He could feel untold power flowing through his massive arms and bulging chest. He could feel strength in his tree trunk legs that lead him to believe he could propel his enormous body over buildings. The sight of his naked and engorged body brought his penis to fully erect status.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down at his penis and laughed to himself. \"If only I'd made you grow too,\" he told it. \"You look a lot smaller compared to the rest of me.\" It was true that he'd always been above average in the size of his unit (though he'd never really had the courage with women to use it) but now his 8 inch member looked kind of tiny. \"Oh well, I guess I'll just have to settle with the rest of me being enormous.\" To emphasize his point Jason curled his arms inward and struck a crab flex that blasted his arms, shoulders, back, and chest to ridiculous size.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly realized he was starving so he checked Nikki's kitchen to see what was available. Feeling that her supplies were a bit limited to support a hunger as large as his body Justin decided he would order out. He returned to Nikki's bed and found the remains of the clothes he had, apparently, grown out of overnight. He collected his cell phone (an iPhone just like the one Laura used to have) and his wallet. He found the number to a local pizza place on the side of Nikki's fridge and placed an order for 5 extra large pizzas to be delivered. When the person on the other end of the phone asked for an address Justin panicked for a moment, but he found some unopened mail on the kitchen counter that told him where Nikki lived. Justin was given a delivery time of about half an hour and decided to use the opportunity to take a quick shower. He took a certain joy in soaping his muscled limbs and chest, but had difficulty reaching his back or lower legs in the confines of the shower stall. Giving up he just relaxed in the hot water thinking about his place in this new reality. There was something nagging him at the back of his mind, something very troubling.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could figure out what elusive thing was bugging him Jason realized that his pizzas were nearly here and that he had nothing to wear to greet whoever was delivering them. He shut off the water and dried off. It took two towels to get himself sufficiently dry, and when he was done he wrapped the largest one he could find around his waist and tied it off. He returned to the living room with the towel just barely hanging on and doing nothing to cover his enormous thighs, but his crotch remained hidden.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later there was a knock at the door and Jason opened it to the shocked expression of someone who just spotted Elvis alive and well.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Jason said as he signed the receipt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery guy laughed nervously. \"Five extra large pizzas, I expected a party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just me.\" He raised his arm and flexed a bicep which had grown a bit beyond the 26 and a half inch measurement Nikki had taken. \"I'm a growing boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason closed the door with a huge grin across his face. Alone again he stripped the towel off and toss it to the floor and plopped down on he couch in the living room. He began scarfing down pizza while flipping through the channels on TV. Before he knew it he'd finished off three and a half of the five he'd ordered, and showed no signs of slowing. He tried to convince himself that most of his hunger was due to the fact that he hadn't eaten in over a day, but he knew that meals would be big for him going forward since it would take a lot of calories to fuel the 370 pound body he was growing into.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that brought to mind the first question he had. Why was he growing? Jason absentmindedly flipped through the channels on TV while he thought back to the beginning of this whole ordeal. He remembered that Laura's phone had warned him of a paradox when he was about to change her. It seemed obvious what that was referring to now, he had changed history so Laura had never gotten an iPhone and she couldn't have used the app. That's why she got to keep her body and he'd lost his. But he hadn't really, even when he had returned to being tall and scrawny he still had the strength of all the muscle he'd lost. Then he'd begun to grow. It was as though the two realities were merging. So why did he continue to get stronger as he grew? Clearly the merging of the two realities had unpredictable effects.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at the television. He'd stopped on a showing of Back to the Future and Doc was explaining to Marty about how the change in the timeline was slowly erasing his family before they we're born.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what's happening to me?\" Jason said aloud. \"But instead of being erased the other realities are writing over this one and adding to it. That would explain how that memory got into my head last night, the memories I should have in this reality are creeping in. I just hope my head has room for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue Jason realized that blood was dripping from his nose for the third time in as many days. He had just enough time to correlate the nosebleeds with his theory about memories squeezing into his head before a bolt of pain blasted through his skull. He gritted his teeth and waited for the pain to subside preying it wouldn\u2019t last long. Seconds later he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was at school and since he was back to being small he quickly realized that this was another memory invading his mind. He wandered through the hall and rounded a corner when he spotted Laura talking to a group of popular kids. She looked incredible. She wore a long sleeve button up shirt that was open at the top to show off the tops of her luscious I cup breasts and a pair of jeans that were tight enough to show off her spectacular behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and her friends were laughing and Jason approached her. He said something to her that, like the last memory, he couldn\u2019t make out. It was quite frustrating to not get any of the audio. Whatever he\u2019d said didn\u2019t go over too well because Laura\u2019s friends looked disgusted that he was even there and Laura seemed angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura said something and flicked her head to the side in a \u201cget out of here\u201d kind of gesture. This must have really set Jason off because he started pointed a finger right at Laura\u2019s chest and spat a few words at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s face went red and she grabbed Jason by the belt and lifted him off the ground. Jason noticed that the sleeve around the arm that was holding him up had split open around Laura\u2019s expanded bicep. Laura backed Jason up to a wall to hold his body steady while she lifted him even further off the floor. Laura spoke to Jason through gritted teeth and from behind angry eyes. Then Laura raised her free hand and flexed her arm. From her shoulder to her wrist her shirt split open around her 22 inch bicep and 15 inch forearms. Clearly she was threatening to use her expandable muscles on Jason if he bothered her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura released Jason who crumpled to the floor. Laura continued to shoot angry words at Jason while she tore the tattered remnants of her sleeves off turning her shirt into a sleeveless garment. Then she turned and rejoined her friends who all pointed and laughed at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Jason woke up on Nikki\u2019s couch. The sun had gone down while he\u2019d been out. A glance at the clock told him it was a few minutes to 8:00 PM. He got up and made his way to Nikki\u2019s bathroom where he cleaned the blood from his face. He felt a slight tinge of guilt when he noticed that the basin was cracked from where he\u2019d grabbed it the night before. He made a promise to himself that he would have it fixed. Nikki had been so good to him, it was the least he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning himself Jason went into Nikki\u2019s bedroom and found the scale he\u2019d used earlier. Stepping on it he found that his weight was now up to 337 pounds. \u201cMore than 30 pounds to go.\u201d he said. He found it quite amusing that he would have gladly accepted 30 pounds of muscle onto his old 170 pound body and it would have made a huge difference. Now, at his current size, it was conceivable that 30 pounds wouldn\u2019t even be noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Jason heard the front door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!! Big, naked, and sexy? Where are you?\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice came floating down the hall. \u201cI have clothes for you, though you\u2019d better not want to put them on until I can jump your super muscled body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason emerged into the living room and Nikki\u2019s eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are enormous!!\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be done growing by now, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \u201cAlmost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki approached Jason and rubbed her hands across his pumped chest. She slid her hands down to his abs then further to his penis. She began planting kisses on his chest while stroking his hardening member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, big guy. I\u2019ve been waiting all day for this. Carry me to bed show me what you\u2019re made of.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason suddenly realized just how hungry he was, but not for food. He wanted Nikki so bad he thought his penis would erupt in a fountain of come right where he stood. Without a word he scooped an arm under Nikki's bottom and held her to his chest like he would an infant. Jason turned and carried her to her bed amazed at how light her 120ish pound body was to him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they traveled Nikki kicked off her shoes and untied the knot that held her shirt together at her stomach. Jason reached his hand under her skirt and ripped her panties right off tossing the torn garment to the floor. Then he gripped the waist of her skirt and pulled it off over her shapely legs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tossed Nikki onto her bed where she quickly removed her shirt and cupped her perfectly rounded, C cup breasts and squeezed. Jason crawled onto the bed and over Nikki ignoring the groans from the mattress and frame which were staining to hold his mega muscled body aloft. He ran a hand along her thigh and up to her waist then continued to take in her incredibly smooth skin until his hand rested on the side of her face. Then Jason leaned down and locked his lips with Nikki's while their tongues danced together in the shared space between them.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's hands were everywhere. She was frantically feeling the ridges of his abs and the swells of his pectorals. Then she would squeeze his bulging arms before grabbing his shoulders and neck. Finally she wrapped her arms around his sides and grabbed ahold of his wing-like lats which she used to pull herself up and wrap her legs around his waist. She broke the kiss with him and gasped a single word out: \"Over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat up on his knees with Nikki still hanging onto his body, then he slowly turned and lay down on his back. Nikki detached and straddled his middle, Jason's penis rubbing against the front of her crotch. Jason put his hands around Nikki's waist just above her hips and lifted her up. Then he slowly and effortlessly sat her down with his penis inside her. Nikki gasped and moaned with pleasure as he filled her up. Once she was all the way back down Jason moved his hands to her breasts and began kneading the soft flesh and pinching her erect nipples.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki began grinding her hips so that Jason's member would slide in and out of her while her hands ran up her own torso and bunched her red hair atop her head. She the pounced on Jason's chest and squeezed the granite hard muscles beneath his skin while speeding up the pace at which she was pumping her hips. Before long she was bouncing rapidly while Jason began to pant and grunt trying to stay his orgasm as long as possible. This only worked for half a minute more as the glorious sensation of Nikki pumping away at his dick was far more than he could stand and he let loose a pounding stream of come. His orgasm was so intense that Jason tensed his entire upper torso which flexed into a titanic mass of rippling, surging muscle unlike anything Nikki had ever dreamed of. The sight alone pushed her over the edge and a tidal wave of pleasure wracked her body causing her to collapse onto Jason's meaty chest still twitching and moaning.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair lay panting for several minutes before Jason pulled Nikki's body higher on his own so he could kiss her again. As their kiss extended longer and longer Nikki began to return his fervor with passion of her own. Moments later Jason's penis was at full attention once more. He rolled Nikki over and took her again, this time it was nearly a full hour before he came, though she quickly lost count of her own orgasms. When they were done they rested for half an hour before making love two more times.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Jason started their sex romp a little after 8PM. They didn't finish until nearly 3AM at which point they both passed out from exhaustion (though Jason was fairly sure that his new super stamina would have allowed him, had he made the attempt, the power to keep going for days or even weeks). Jason awoke the following morning at about 7 feeling fully rested and full of energy. He got out of bed and, for no other reason than he could, did 200 one armed pushups switching arms throughout. By the time he was done he didn't even feel the slightest bit tired but decided to stop anyway, his arms and chest having received a descent pump not from the strain but the motion. He looked at Nikki and considered waking her for another round of sex, but she looked completely wiped out so instead he let her sleep and decided to go for a walk. Before leaving her, though, he ran his eyes over the gorgeous contours of her body and thought about just how lucky he was to have a girl like that so interested in him. It didn't hurt that he was a hulking stud, but he was lucky nonetheless.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found the clothes Nikki had bought for him near the front door. He pulled a pair of shorts and a shirt out of the bag and pulled them on. Each item fit, but just barely; when he took a deep breath he could hear the tank top straining to hold together. He also found some socks and shoes which fit better. With his new clothes on Jason stepped out into the cool morning air and turned toward the beach which was 2 blocks west. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't gone more than a block when curiosity regarding his strength got the better of him. When he was pretty sure no one was around Jason approached a rather large SUV and attempted to lift it off the ground. The ease with which the huge vehicle shot into the air was astounding. And Jason found that he could hold the whole car over his head with a single hand effortlessly. He pumped the SUV up and down 10 times and felt no fatigue set in, so he simply placed the car back where he'd found it with a massive smile plastered all over his face. There was no question about it, he was truly superhuman. with the SUV back on the ground Jason couldn't help but squeeze out a staggering most muscular flex (causing a few tears in his shirt) and grunting with authority.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the beach Jason began to jog along on a paved path that ran alongside the sand. Even though he felt he was only keeping a mild pace he zipped past the few other joggers that were out. He kept his pace for nearly an hour before he decided to stop and turn around. Before he could resume his run, however, he saw something in the distance. It took his brain a moment to believe his eyes, but once he figured it out he was certain he saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason jogged forward, keeping his eyes on Laura.  He had run by the beach work out area the other way so fast he hadn\u2019t paid it any attention.  Now that he had slowed down he could see a few large men working out on one side and Laura on the other.  A few young female on-lookers hung around too.  They appeared to be paying more attention to Laura than the men.  When he neared he could understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was curling a bar filled with a very large weight.  Her biceps were pumped up to incredible proportions due not just to the base muscle he had given her, but to her expansion abilities kicking into full gear.  Laura tossed the bar onto the thick pad covering the sand and the weight bounced up a few inches before settling down.  Laura smirked and was about ready to pull up her right arm into a massive bicep pose for the admiring girls nearby when she spotted Jason.  Her happy expression changed quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked forward with a sad look on his face.  While he had nearly reached his final weight of 370 pounds and had super strength, he could also now clearly hear the anger in Laura\u2019s voice and finally understand what she was saying.  He let out a sigh as some memories were now planted in his head and he shook a stray pain away as the thought of him teasing Laura with his superior size and strength flashed through his head.  It wasn\u2019t really meant to be mean, but to Laura, it was.  Jason\u2019s assent happened without any effort.  Laura\u2019s did too, but as he had eclipsed her, their work-outs together became strained.  But now as the altered realities were finishing their merge, Jason was coming to terms with things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sad that he had lost Laura as a friend, but he had women like Nikki who appreciated him.  So if there was no way to repair the friendship at the moment he shrugged his massive shoulders, then shot a glance over at the women now staring at him instead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just out for a morning run.  It\u2019s a free country after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys saw Jason now and were walking over.  They had stayed out of Laura\u2019s way, especially when she was working biceps, but knew that Jason was more than a match for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grunted.  Jason\u2019s presence was clearly throwing her off guard.  Jason walked closer and noticed that she too wasn\u2019t quite where he had set her from the ap.  While he was now up to the size he had programmed, his strength was beyond what he remembered programming.  Laura on the other hand was bit different as well.  She was at her 5 foot 11 inch height from what he could tell, but her body was bigger than he remembered setting.  Her breasts were big, but proportionally so, not the porn star size he programmed.  Her arms looked huge, which he did remember setting.  Now pumped, they looked to be pushing 30 inches around as she was clenching her fists down at her side.  The red bikini top was straining against her incredibly muscled upper body and the red spandex shorts barely covered her muscular glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the men closed in, Jason walked over to the weight Laura was curling.  He nodded his head with an impressive smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re curling half a ton!  Wow!  Very impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tried to sound sincere, but the words came out with an unintended sarcastic tone.  The girls caught it and giggled as Laura\u2019s eyes narrowed.  The men had no issue with letting out a quick laugh.  One of them walked up to Jason and pushed out his hand.  Jason took his eyes off Laura and turned to smile and clasp the bodybuilder\u2019s hand for a quick shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Jason, you\u2019re looking as big as ever!  It\u2019s an honor having you stop by.  Care to work out.  Laura here has some really big weights that might at least give you a small pump.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s smile widened.  \u201cWell, maybe for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked forward, ignoring the fact that Laura\u2019s face was turning red.  He stood next to the weight Laura had curled and smiled.  It was then that another sharp pain crossed his head.  He narrowed his eyes as everything blurred and shimmered for a moment as he felt a small trickle of blood run down to his upper lip.  He shook his head and wiped the blood away quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to refocused he saw.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blur was still a shimmer as he saw Laura had pulled her very large arms up across a massive chest and her eyes were narrowed.  She looked larger, but her figure was in some type of flux and he couldn\u2019t yet focus on her.  She also looked even angrier, but it was a bit more than that.  There appeared to be a level of confidence that wasn\u2019t there moments before.  She spoke with even, furious tones that to Jason were muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to try and show me up again, huh?  Well unlike you, I continue to work out hard.  And you may be super strong and all, but I\u2019m no slouch anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked around and saw that the men looked more fearful than before and the girls were smiling and looking back at Laura.  The girls had changed too.  Their previously thin bodies were now quite muscular.  As his eyes struggled to focus it was if their muscles were growing even bigger.  Shaking his head again, Jason looked over at the weight he was about to lift.  He had figured a one armed half-ton curl would sufficiently impressive everyone.  But the weight too was changing.  Larger and larger plates appeared to morph their way forward.  By the time the world cleared up he was staring at a two inch thick bar with what appeared to be several tons on either side.  Laura now chuckled at what was seen to all as Jason\u2019s apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Jason, afraid of lifting ten tons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shot Laura a quick glance and turned back toward the bar.  \u201cNo, of course not.  Piece of cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason reached down and curling his hands around the weight stood up easily.  He let out a quick sigh of relief, initially worried that if things were changing that his super strength might not be there.  He did feel some resistance as the weight was really heavy, but he pulled it up and completed a sloppy curl, leaning into it a bit.  He grunted again and struggling a bit, completed another five.  He placed the bar down and backed up.  The smile on Laura\u2019s face was disconcerting.  The girls were now giggling and the men were stepping back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked forward and he got a good look at her upper body for the first time.  She was now beyond massive!  Every muscle looked to be as big, if not bigger than his!  He couldn\u2019t really tell how large she was yet, so he backed away to try and take her all in.  As he did Laura was reaching down to the bar and the shimmering returned.  Trying to focus he noticed that Laura was standing next to the weight and was reaching down with only one hand.  A sinking feeling was settling into his stomach as Laura spoke with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kept telling you that if you didn\u2019t work out that I would catch up to you some day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura curled her small hand around the thick bar and with a light grunt pulled it up to her side.  \u201cNow you can barely curl 10 tons with two arms for a few reps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura casually looked over at the weight and then back at Jason.  \u201cWhile I on the other hand, can now do THIS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stared with befuddled wonder as Laura slowly curled up the 10 ton weight.  With one arm!  Otherworldly muscles exploded across her arm in a frenzy of super human muscle expansion!  Her tricep dug low as big as a half bowling ball while her mighty bicep pressed outward and upward bigger than a basketball molded into a muscle mountain!  Veins pumped super human strength into her magnificent muscles.  Jagged, throbbing muscle fibers bristled up the sides and across her pumped up bicep split and up to her expanding peak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped as Laura pulled the bar down stretching her arm out straight and holding the weight with minimal strain!  Smiling with cocky confidence she let out a controlled sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd THIS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued to pump the weight up and down as if it were a broom stick, pumping her biceps to seemingly impossible heights!  Her mighty muscles were flexing up biceps over 50 monolithic inches around!  After 20 reps, Laura finally dropped the weight to the ground and Jason looked down to stare at the bar in disbelief and then back up at Laura!  Laura smirked at the wide eyed Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you bothered to stop by just so I could humiliate you.  But since you did, perhaps you\u2019d like to see what two of my students can now do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the two girls as he was trying to keep his focus on Laura, but it was then that the gorgeous blonde haired girl walked up the weight.  She only stood at 5 foot 6 but was sporting enough muscle to blow away any man away except for him.  Huge chucks of sinew rippled across her bikini clad frame in waves as she stood in front of the weight.  She wiggled her toes on her small feet and tensed her legs a few times causing her calves to surge outward to be seen from her front and massive quads to bunch and separate into angry mounds of pumped up muscle.  Her abs bristled into no less than a 10 pack and her obliques arched away toward wide lats and a thick, muscle fueled chest.  The two large breasts pushed out in defiance of gravity as the small bikini triangles tented against her excited, erect nipples.  She flexed her broad, football sized shoulders and as she reached down, her arms pushed out pumped up muscles like a bodybuilders dream.  Gripping the bar she pulled it up easily and pulled in a few controlled breaths.  Laura smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could only do six poorly executed reps.  Let\u2019s see what Hanna can do.  She\u2019s only 16, but I think she\u2019s got potential.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Hanna began to curl the weight up to her massive chest, performing the first one without a waiver.  She dropped it back down slowly and now smiled.  Laura nodded for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd potentially she\u2019s as strong as you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Hanna continued to curl the bar with focused control, reaching five reps, then ten!  Hanna set the bar down and smiled.  She pulled up her arms and flexed down biceps that consolidated and expanded upward at an alarming rate!  Her biceps jumped upward with her flex once, twice, three times, four times!  Each jump pushed her peak higher and added mass seemingly at will!  With a final pulse, Hanna\u2019s biceps expanded to 40 incredible inches around!  Laura chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr apparently stronger!  And if I\u2019m not mistaken, those biceps are bigger than yours too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took a step toward Jason and he backed up, finally taking in all of Laura\u2019s beyond massive muscles for the first time.  Her entire body was a bodybuilder\u2019s nightmare, as every muscle was pumped up to a preposterous degree.  Every muscle on her body was bigger than his.  And apparently stronger too!  And her arms were even bigger!  Laura laughed at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Jason?  Afraid of me now?  Well you should be!  And not only that, but you should be afraid of Hanna too.  And there are plenty of other girls lifting weights now and growing stronger and stronger!  Soon there will be many girls to strike fear into your so called manly heart.  Now why don\u2019t you get out of here before I show you some other uses for my muscles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason backed away, unsure of what to make of this.  He decided to head back to Nikki\u2019s and started running with earnest.  He turned to the road off the beach and walked into the room.  Another short wave of dizziness hit him and he leaned against the door frame of the entrance.  Stumbling forward he regained his composure and walked into Nikki\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked a few times as he saw Nikki was standing there, naked with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She must have just stepped out of the shower as her body was still glistening with a sheen of moisture, her red hair slick and wet against her head and neck. But her body was what really sent Jason over the edge of sanity. She was enormous, bigger than him even, though not by the same margin that Laura could now claim.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's smile was huge and warm. \"Hey stud, did you have a nice run?\" She approached him and hung her thick arms on his shoulders before leaning in for a deep kiss.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. yeah, I guess.\" Jason said once the kiss ended.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki frowned. \"What's the matter, baby? You look like something is bothering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... well, I ran into Laura while I was out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's upper body tensed and her chest and arms swelled. \"She didn't hurt you, did she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, nothing like that.\" Jason moved away from Nikki and sat on her bed. \"I just don't understand what's happening anymore. My memories are all screwed up and the world keeps changing around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sat next to him and put her hand on his thigh. The bed groaned under their combined weight, but not as much as Jason expected and he decided that Nikki had had it reinforced in this reality. \"Tell me everything, we'll figure this out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and for the second time in as many days he told the story of how he had apparently torn a hole in reality using a strange iPhone application. When he got to the part about leaving Nikki as a petite girl and returning to find her grown into a behemoth she smiled and even blushed a little.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds insane,\" Jason finished, \"but I swear it's the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you.\" Nikki said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is nuts, but why would you make up a story like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed a little. \"Yeah, alright. So can you tell me how you got to be so big? And what's with Laura and her beefed up minions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was you and Laura that got me into this shape.\" Nikki said. \"Laura was always one heck of an athlete and she had wicked muscle expansion like no one had ever seen. The the two of you started working out and discovered a lot of new techniques to pack on muscle faster than anyone could imagine. Together the two of you grew bigger and stronger than anyone else in the world. Then you shared your secret techniques with me and I exploded too. Those were the good old days, I guess. The three of us spending nearly everyday in the gym together, pumping iron and watching each others bodies grow on a daily basis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled. It sounded like a nice memory, he wished he could have it. \"So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Laura figured out a way to teach others to expand their muscles just like her. She taught me, in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you can expand your muscles like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no; not like her. Her expansion has only gotten more extreme. I can do it, but only a little. There is a lot that is genetic, some can't do it at all. Like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to learn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you got frustrated when you couldn't do it. You blamed Laura for not teaching you right. By this time you were way stronger than any of us and you... well, you were kind of a jerk to Laura. You'd spend a lot of time talking about how your lifts were growing much faster than hers and how she'd never come close to matching your strength. In the end you guys said some things and she made me choose between you and her. She never liked that I chose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hung his head. The only memories he did have were of mocking Laura and picking on her. He really couldn't blame her for being angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki continued, \"Lately I've heard that Laura has been searching for girls to teach her muscle expansion techniques to, and of course she shares your secrets for muscle growth with them as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like I was a real ass to her. I don't blame her for being upset. And now she's way, way stronger than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed. \"I've been telling you for months that you weren't that bad. I think she just let stuff build instead of saying something. Also, she's only stronger than you now because you stopped working out. You were so upset with yourself that you decided you were plenty strong enough and you just quit. If you'd kept going you'd probably be ten times stronger than she is now, at least. Your body has an insane capacity to get stronger and stronger at an exponential rate. I'd even be willing to bet that if you and I went back to the gym you could eclipse her in just a few weeks. You know, if you wanted to.\" Nikki smiled and ran her small hands across the huge swell of Jason's pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem excited by that idea.\" Jason said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shot Jason a hungry look and leaned in close to his ear. \"Baby, I've never seen anything so hot as when you're in the zone, pumping iron and blasting your super powered muscles to insane size.\" The hand on his thigh slid up to his crotch and gripped his penis through his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason moaned softly then looked down at Nikki's supercharged body. \"It looks like you're the one with the insane size and super powered muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, these little old things?\" Nikki raised her arm and flexed. Her arm was clearly bigger than Jason's 31 inch cannon, then she tightened her grip and activated her expansion ability. The peak of her striated bicep rose and separated while the low hanging valley of her triceps swelled out in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... wh... w.. I mean, wow. How big is...?\" Jason trailed off overcome by the sight of the monumental muscle held before him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just 42 little old inches.\" She straightened her arm and flexed again and again causing the incredible bicep to pop and harden over and over.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still work out?\" Jason asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki leaned Jason back onto the bed and straddled him. \"Only once a week or so. Gotta keep my girlish figure. Of course if you were to go back and hit the weights again I'd be happy to accompany you.\" She leaned down and ripped his shirt apart exposing his thick chest. Nikki leaned down and began kissing his meaty pecs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long Jason was frantically pulling shorts off and kicking off his shoes. Nikki's smile as he entered her nearly sent him over the edge, it was amazing what this woman could do to him with the simplest of looks. Jason and Nikki became a sweaty writhing mass of muscle for several hours. When they were done they lay together, Jason on his back and Nikki's head on his chest, competing ideas running through his head.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand he'd really loved the feeling he'd had earlier when he was the strongest man in the world. He was really turned on by the idea that he could return to the gym and begin packing on even more super powered muscle. Just thinking about how Laura had curled that 10 ton weight with ease made him desire such power. And the idea that he could even outgrow Laura was really appealing. Plus it was clear that Nikki was really turned on by the thought as well.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another voice in his head, though. One that said all of this was silly. He had apparently lost his best friend over a silly fight, and it seemed the best course of action to find her and apologize. At the very least it seemed a bad idea to have a superhumanly strong woman out there be angry with him. And who knows, if he could repair the rift between them perhaps he could still get back to the gym and pack on some more muscle.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end be knew what he really wanted.\u00a0</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason wanted to repair his relationship with Laura, that was definitely important to him. The trouble was that she overpowered him so greatly that he was convinced that she would just beat him up if she ever saw him again. He decided he needed to at least get close to her level of power before going to talk with her. Heck, if he were stronger again and still remained polite and apologetic perhaps it would help his case and convince Laura that he really had changed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed Nikki on the forehead. \"Honey,\" he said, \"there's something I want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and met his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wan to go back to the gym,\" he told her. \"I want to get bigger. But I need you to show me how. Oh, and where will we go to find weights heavy enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's smile was an excited and hopeful one. \"The place we used to go to is just down the street; they had a room in the back for us with tons of massive weights we could use. They did it all as a publicity stunt. 'Come see the Titanic Trio!' Laura especially loved to show off for her fans. That's where I've been going for my once a week session, but I'm sure they'll be excited to see you return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Jason said. \"When do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's smile grew wider.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Jason found himself in the back room of the gym surrounded by stack and stacks of enormous weights. As Nikki had suggested the owner and a few patrons were quite excited to see Jason return. They all commented on how big he was looking even though he hadn't been around in nearly 6 months. A rather big guy named Danny complimented Jason on his definition while the owner, a really friendly bodybuilder named Mike, asked if Jason thought he would be able to get even bigger.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm here to find out.\" Jason had told him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jason was listening to Nikki's direction. She was walking him through the routines they would be doing and how to maximize his lifts for rapid growth. She commented more than once about how strange it was to be teaching him this stuff since he was the one who had thought it all up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope I'm a good enough teacher,\" Nikki said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're amazing,\" Jason said looking into her eyes. \"Thank you for doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to Jason and rubbed her ultra buff body against his, her hand sliding down his chiseled stomach and cupping his crotch. \"Well, I'd be lying if I didn't say my intentions were somewhat selfish. Now, let's get started little guy. You've got a long way to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair spent the next 10 hours moving around the room lifting, pushing, squatting and working their bodies into pulsing masses of pumped up muscle. Jason's body was drenched in sweat and glistening in the harsh lights of the gym. His body was fully pumped and hard as steel from head to toe. Veins stood out all over his form looking fit to burst through his skin.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready he could feel his strength growing and to prove it he had Nikki put together a 10 ton barbell for him at the end of their session. Jason took a deep breath and lifted the giant weight off the floor. He began performing curls and bringing the weight to his chest with relative ease and control. He made it through 10 curls with little strain and continued on towards 15. As he approached 20 reps he felt a lot of fatigue and had to really power through to finish. He made it to 20 with a triumphant yell and dropped the weight to the floor. He observed his reflection in the mirror with pride. After just a single day he was already stronger than Hannah, the girl who had shown him up earlier. He still had a long, long way to go to dream of matching Laura's power, but it was a start.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire way back to Nikki's apartment she could hardly keep her hands off of him. She was intensely turned on my watching him work out and the moment they got inside she pounced on him. Jason was so worn out he didn't think he could perform, but he also couldn't fight back, so he resolved to let her climb on top and have her way with him. This seemed a fair compromise and Nikki rode Jason for three hours before collapsing next to him in bed. They slept in until 1 o'clock the following day at which point they got up and went back to the gym to repeat their workout.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued like this daily. They would sleep in, work out at an insane pace into the night, have a marathon sex adventure and pass out together. After a week of this Jason realized that he didn't know anything about Nikki's source of funds. In a previous reality she was a waitress, but now she didn't seem to have a job at all; yet she always seemed to have money available. When Jason asked about this Nikki dismissed the question with a quick explanation about receiving residuals from some sponsorships she'd done in the past. When Jason asked who the sponsorships were for she just dismissed him and refocused on their workout.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dodging the question!\" Jason said with a sly grin.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge this!\" Nikki said picking up a 1 ton plate and flinging it at Jason like a frisbee.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason caught the huge disc bent the reenforced iron in his hands like putty, curling it into a u-shape. Then he dropped it to the floor and looked at Nikki as of to say \"is that all you've got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki flushed and launched herself at Jason; his display of strength and confidence had turned her on beyond her ability to control herself and the pair had wild sex right there on the gym floor. It was during this romp that Jason realized that he could now overpower Nikki because at one point he pinned her to the floor and refused to let her up. He used the opportunity to tease her with his cock head which he rubbed against the lips of her vagina but refused to enter. Nikki bucked and thrashed begging him to give her what she wanted, but he continued to tease. Her body was pumped to it's full expanded size but still Jason was in control, and he loved it. Finally he plunged his penis into her and began pumping rapidly. Moments later the walls of the gym were shaking from the force of their combined orgasms. Fortunately it was after hours in the gym and they were the only ones there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month after they started working out Nikki had seen some pretty impressive growth, but Jason had exploded. He'd gained a little over 100 pounds to his body and was now bench pressing 300 tons and squatting just shy of 500. He could even curl the 10 ton weight with one arm now, though he struggled through a single rep, but he was on his way!\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs excited as he was about his incredible power he was even more pleased that he hadn't had any nosebleeds or seen any shimmering since his day on the beach with Laura. He really hoped reality was done shifting because he was enormously pleased with his current life, but he constantly feared another change was brewing.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason and Nikki stuck to their pattern until life became a blur. Jason quickly got to the point where he lost track of time and even lost track of what day of the week it was. From time to time they would take a day off to hang out at the beach, walk around town, or just spend the whole time having sex, but for the most part it was business as usual. As their strength grew so to did their need for weights to lift, so Mike agreed to supply them with the iron they needed if they would be willing to put themselves on display. He knocked down the wall that separated the back room from the rest of the gym and installed a huge picture window in its place. People came from all over to watch Jason and Nikki work out and blast their already humungous muscles to even greater size. Of course Mike only let paying members of the gym come in, and he sold enough new memberships to cover the cost of the new equipment plus a little extra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only concern that Jason had about going public was the chance that word would get back to Laura about just how big and strong he was becoming, but even that worry would fade into the back of his mind when he was curling 25 tons in each hand for multiple reps. His body was continuing to grow steadily, but his strength was just shooting off the charts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was enjoying he newfound celebrity and pushed himself everyday to show his adoring fans just how strong he could become. Of course there were several skeptics who claimed that Jason and Nikki were using plastic surgery to enhance their bodies and fake weights to increase their strength, but they tried not to let that get to them. One day, however, when he was arriving at the gym in the morning he was greeted by his usual slate of groupies and a small band of protesters who claimed he was a total fraud. They were marching and carrying signs implying he was not nearly as strong as he had been pretending to be. Jason stopped and watched the demonstration for a minute while Nikki tried to convince him to just go inside so they could get started on their routine. Instead Jason, without speaking a word, spotted a garbage truck that had just rounded the corner and was approaching the gym. He casually walked out into the street and, when the huge truck stopped at a stop sign he quickly haunched down and lifted the massive machine up into the air with ease. With its load of trash the truck likely weighed over 20 tons, but that kind of weight was nothing to him now and he easily balanced the truck on one hand, pressing it up and down while he flexed a massive 48 inch bicep with his free hand. Jason set the truck back down and entered the gym having never said a word to the protesters who now were stunned into silence and had started leaving the scene embarrassed. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that nearly half of the protesters returned to purchase a membership to the gym so they could watch Nikki and Jason work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 months of work Jason figured he had surpassed Laura by a great margin, but he was still concerned about how much she may have gained in the same amount of time so he continued to push himself for another 6 weeks. The truth was that he also had grown addicted to the growth and power at his command. His attitude had shifted and new confidence made him a new man. He did his best to hold on to the memories of his previous life, though. He was determined to keep himself from going full on macho and becoming the asshole that had driven Laura away in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally as summer turned to fall Jason decided it was time to confront Laura and be the bigger man, both literally and in action. Now Jason stood in the back room of the gym looking at his reflection in the mirror. There was hardly a trace of the scrawny nerd he\u2019d been months earlier. Now he was 780 pounds of raging, granite hard sinew. He was clad only in a tiny speedo and his body was pumped to the max. His shoulders were 6 feet wide, his chest over 2 and a half feet thick. Jason had stopped working his legs 2 week prior as it was getting very difficult to walk when his thighs measured 150 inches around in their relaxed state. When he flexed them he was able to add another 50 or so inches to each of them and his quads would rumble outward in all directions with abandon enveloping his knee and fighting for space. It was impossible for him to stand up straight and flex both thighs at the same time, there just wasn\u2019t enough room. Jason\u2019s arms, though, were his favorite muscle group both to work and to flex. As time went on he had adjusted his workouts so that he worked his arms more and more, and the results were obvious. His arms measured 45 inches cold and relaxed at his side, but when he pumped them they would erupt into massive mountainous muscles unlike any before. The dual headed monster bicep would rise higher and higher surpassing the top of Jason\u2019s hand and cresting higher than the top of his head. His monstrous arms could reach 80 inches around and had power enough to curl 100 tons each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as Jason took in the sight of his magnificent body he raised his stupendous arms and flexed watching as the tiered peaks popped out and up like a wedding cake being formed under his skin. He released this flex and turned to his right. He extended his right arm straight down and flexed his triceps, feeling the massive swell with his free hand. He marveled at the massive horseshoe shape that sprouted from his tree trunk arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good, stud muffin.\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice was enough to tear himself away from his reflection. He turned and took in her amazing body. She was dressed in white cotton shorts and a spandex tube top. She too had grown quite a bit in the last 3 and a half months, but her gains paled in comparison to his. \u201cYou are truly a muscle god. I hope you\u2019re still satisfied with my tiny little muscles.\u201d She curled her arm and flexed a solid 45 inch bicep, then she grunted and tightened it further making it expand to 56 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ran one hand over the mighty peak of her bicep while wrapping the other around the small of her back and pulling her close. \u201cYou are, by far, the most incredible woman on the face of this planet.\u201d He tilted her chin up and kissed her. She kissed back and the two of them stood wrapped together in a display of mutual passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they separated Nikki was breathing heavy. Jason laughed to himself; the woman could bench 300 tons without getting winded, but she always lost her breath when she got turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at, jerk?\u201d Nikki said punching Jason in the steel wall that was his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, nothing. I was just thinking, well, a couple of things really. First I was thinking about how strange it is that I have more muscle mass in just one of my arms than I had in my entire body just a few months ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember that scrawny little nerd!!\u201d Nikki shouted. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen him since we started high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, well he\u2019s a much more recent memory for me. The other thought I had was that I think it\u2019s time to find Laura and set things right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki just smiled. She never said a word, never asked a question or spoke against his decision. She was 100% behind him and would stand by his side no matter how the confrontation with Laura went. Jason knew all of this inactively and loved Nikki all the more for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair got dressed, Nikki pulled a huge sun dress on over her head and slipped her feet into her flip flops while Jason pulled on a pair of jogging shorts and a 15XL muscle shirt that had been custom made for him, and they headed out together. To find Laura and see just how much she\u2019d grown in the last 3 months. Regardless of how big or how strong his former friend was now, he hoped he could still find his way into her heart and that she could find forgiveness for him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki and Jason walked along the beach slowly, enjoying the moment.  Jason couldn\u2019t help but feel that he was now big and strong enough to match Laura and her students.  In fact, he had asked one of the men from the gym to check Laura out; and while she had grown larger, Nikki was now as big as Laura and from what he knew, as strong as well.  This gave him even more confidence as they walked forward.  He had wanted to have the strength advantage.  Then when he apologized she would see it wasn\u2019t from fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had also heard that Laura had set up some new weight machines as her growing legion of girls needed larger weights and more area to work out.  The spy had told him of a large machine with cables and 10 ton plates mainly used for chest and bicep workouts.  Jason smiled at the idea that he could now lift twice as much as Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the back of mind he was still worried, as if his actions from before the last shift were still unresolved.  Memories flashed in and out too quickly to make any sense, but it would always affect his attitude momentarily as if the old Jason; the cocky, too proud Jason, was looking to get out.  Jason sighed, his nervousness of confronting Laura mounting.  He wanted it to go well.  Nikki tossed her long, gorgeous red hair over her massive shoulder and smiled up at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been awfully quiet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s sullen expression softened a bit.  \u201cWell it is Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled weakly and nodded.  \u201cI know.  But you\u2019ll be fine.  And I\u2019m here to back you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and his apprehension built.  He smiled back and released his hold of Nikki\u2019s hand as they neared the work-out area.  He could see several large figures ahead and the large weight machine towered above anything else on the beach.  As they drew closer he felt a familiar and unwelcome trickle from his nose move down his upper lip.  His head hurt as he could hear Nikki say something, but the words were muffled.  Her voice had a troubled sound instead of the calm, steadying one from moments earlier.  His brain told him to turn around, but his legs kept moving forward until they finally reached the small group of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls said something that he couldn\u2019t quite make out.  She looked young and pretty, with long brown hair and clean, youthful features.  A familiar voice from off to the side said something that was still a bit muffled, but he could make out the words.  And they didn\u2019t sound all that sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook girls, it\u2019s the strongest MAN in the world.  And he\u2019s been working out!  Look how big he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen-age girl, who looked to be all of 5 foot 2 walked up and pushed her hand out with a bright smile on her face.  Her blue eyes sparkled.  Her figure was still shimmering, but he could see that it was large and full of muscle.  Blinking his eyes he absently reached out and took her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he realized that the girl wasn\u2019t just looking for a handshake, but was testing her strength on the strongest man in the world.  He wasn\u2019t sure what this new reality held, but he still believed that he was strong enough to at least handle this girl.  So as she squeezed down, he did the same and for a moment he felt he was more than holding his own.  But as the shimmering cleared the girl\u2019s body morphed forward into the biggest, most muscular form he could have ever imagined for a girl that tall.  She had on a tight pink athletic top that looked strained against the raging muscles pumping out from her massive pectorals and incredibly wide back.  He grunted as she increased the pressure and it soon felt like his hand was in a vice!  She smirked as Jason was slowly driven down to one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Jason, at least give me a challenge!  How does it look for the strongest man in the world to be out muscled by a 14 year old girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted as he flexed all of his massive muscles in an attempt to fight back.  He could hear Nikki complain behind him, but he also heard Laura step in between them and laugh, giving encouragement to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep going Taylor, show him who\u2019s boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sunk lower and then yelped in pain as the girl squeezed down harder and started cracking the bones in his hand!  With a laugh of her own, Taylor pulled her arm back hard.  Jason\u2019s 780 bulk jerked to the side as she yanked so hard that his shoulder was dislocated with a terrible tearing sound.  He fell onto his side, but Taylor held her grip, pulled him back up and shot a wicked punch to his side with a dull crack.  Jason groaned in pain.  With a girlish giggle Taylor finally released her death grip and allowed Jason to fall to the sand.  As Taylor backed up, Nikki ran to his side, gently pulling him up so he could sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor stood there with a wide grin on her beautiful young face as she flexed up her muscles into a raging mass of Amazonian might.  Her arms were off to her sides as she clenched her fists, pushing out mounds of obscene muscles across her fantastical arms so big that they didn\u2019t look real!  Her biceps ballooned out like two watermelons, with her peaks pushed out well beyond her flexed fists.  Her shoulders and gently flexed back had to be five feet wide and her chest bulled out over two ungodly feet in front of her with huge slabs of muscle writhing, surging and pumping up larger with each breath!  Her top strained and groaned against the super powered muscles raging against it.  Her exposed abs were uncannily narrow, yet etched with thick, detailed muscle blocks.  Her legs mashed against each other with overloaded muscles that engulfed her knees and bloated out as large as his mighty quads in what should be an impossible display of supercharged muscle.  Jason could hear her muscles crackle as she tensed them and twisted her small bare foot in the sand to jut out her calf as big a basketball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could hear Laura off to the side as he stared up at the teenage powerhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you show him how much you can curl Taylor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor smiled and took a few steps over toward the machine.  Jason gulped as he got a look at the weights.  They were no longer the 10 ton plates, but were now 50 tons plates!  Another gigantically muscled girl who he recognized as Hanna set the machine and smiled as Taylor reached down with one small hand and gripped the bar.  Jason\u2019s eyes widened as he watched 4 plates sail into the air as Taylor curled 200 tons!  Her bicep shot up into a mountain of girl muscle up as the peak pushed up over her fist, over the top of her head and six inches beyond that!  And as she pumped the weight a few times her massive muscle crystallized harder as the muscle fibers pushed to the surface into jagged chunks of steel.  Her bicep was as large, if not larger than his 80 inch monsters!  And just when he thought he had seen enough Laura spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdd more weight Hanna, let\u2019s see what Taylor can do.  After all, that\u2019s only twice what the strongest man in the world can curl.  And Taylor\u2019s biceps are barely up to his size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor held the hand down as Jason could hear the additional weights clank loudly.  Taylor looked up worried, but from behind him Laura must have given her a confident nod as Taylor\u2019s expression changed to a determined look.  Apparently if Laura thought you could do something, you could do it!  With a look of pain, Taylor began to pull upward, causing large veins to blast to the surface across her overloaded arm, pushing more and more super strength into her muscles until she was pulling up 6 plates!  She was about to curl 300 tons with one arm!  And as she did so her bicep expanded up to seemingly impossible height and her tricep bulled down a foot and half deep.  As the weight rose higher and Taylor let out a short yell her bicep pushed upward and outward as more and more muscle blasted forth!  Her watermelon sized bicep had added a bowling ball sized muscle on top as thick veins and additional slabs of muscles ground outward until her gigantic bicep pumped up into a wall of girl muscle 3 and half feet tall and over 100 inches around!  Taylor screamed out as she completed the curl and then let the weight drop back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther girls cheered around Jason as Hanna moved over to congratulate Taylor.  Jason felt the ground shake as Laura finally moved around and stood in front of him.  To call her gigantic didn\u2019t do her justice.  The Hulk would look small next to her!  The only things she had on was a tiny black bikini bottom and two black skull and cross bone labeled pasties on her twin beech ball sized chest as if to indicate that there weren\u2019t any clothes that could contain her raging muscles.  With her arms out wide it was clear that her back and shoulders were as wide as she was tall.  And she wasn\u2019t even flexing.  She smiled down cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could only imagine what else Laura had in store for him.  He was about to find out as..</span></div></div>",

I was having some trouble motivating Taylor, but you were able to push her to the next level!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked up with daggers.  \u201cThat wasn\u2019t why he came down here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \u201cAlways defending him.  Always holding back your own gains to make him look and feel good.  I really don\u2019t care why you two came down here, but as you can see, he\u2019s never going to hold ME back again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled her right arm up and her bicep exploded up to the top of her head just by raising her forearm a bit above horizontal.  Her bicep then expanded up and up and up with bursts of superhuman expansion until her mighty arm was 120 inches around of the biggest, strongest muscle ever dreamed.  Her bicep had unnatural terrifying mounds, cuts and grooves that throbbed outward in disregard for all known biology.  Jason\u2019s eyes widened with fear.  How could he ever compete against that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grunted and pulled Jason up as he groaned in pain.  \u201cWell that still doesn\u2019t give you the right to have one of your girls do this to Jason!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled.  \u201cHa!  Don\u2019t worry Nikki, we\u2019re done with Jason.  You two are free to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki reached around Jason\u2019s bulk as best she could and forced him to walk away as quickly.  Jason gasped with pain and soon Nikki was carrying him like a child toward a nearby hospital as the jeers and laughs of the girls mocked him from behind.  Nikki was near tears as they entered the emergency room and the doctors and nurses took x-ray and wrapped up his hand, shoulder and upper body.  She sat next him in the small emergency room area as they waited for him to be discharged.  Nikki had hardly said anything since she had pulled Jason up from the beach.  He looked at her sad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave I been holding you back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sat up straight, her large figure tensed and her muscles swelled, pushing her massive chest out to stress the front of the sun dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would think that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura said that as though it were a well known fact.  If that\u2019s true; if the, uh, old me was making you feel uncomfortable or if my ego was getting in the way, please don\u2019t think that I still feel that way now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked down, tears forming in her eyes.  Jason smiled softly and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a giant Nikki.  I can work out and grow these incredible muscles and pump super human weights.  But it seems that the more I do, the greater Laura and now even her crew seem to grow in response.  And you\u2019ve stood by me throughout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused as Nikki looked back up with a smile on her face.  She wiped away a stray tear.  He reached out with his good hand and gently held her soft, narrow chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had good intentions.  You know I did.  But there is no way I can work out for a while now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki reached up with own hand to gently take his.  She smiled as her eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded his head.  He now knew that everything he said was right.  Nikki did hold back to please him.  Likely even to the point where she wasn\u2019t even aware she was doing it.  In this new reality, she was a bit bigger, but still not as big as he was.  He also suspected that she wasn\u2019t as strong.  But that was about to change as Nikki stood up, her muscles rolling across her body in waves, shifting and pulling the large sun dress to the point of rupture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody messes with my boyfriend and gets away with it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled and then winced in pain.  Nikki quickly sat back down, feeling a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was discharged, they ordered a taxi, which for them had to be a van.  They stopped by the drug store to pick up his prescription and were soon home.  Nikki mothered over Jason to the point where he gently asked her to take care of herself.  She smiled and stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get away from my care Jason!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason snickered.  \u201cThe doctor said I need rest, not 24 hour nurse service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki placed her hands on her hips and gave him a not very convincing angry look.  \u201cYou\u2019ll take what I give you mister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his good hand out and laughed.  \u201cOK, OK!  I\u2019ll do whatever you say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki chuckled.  \u201cYou\u2019d better!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and pulled off her sun dress.  Justin shook his head as he admired her fantastic curves and her equally fantastic muscles.  Muscles he was quite sure were about to the get the biggest workout they had ever seen.  Nikki smiled and climbed into bed, gently snuggling up to his good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to cut down on the sex for a while too I\u2019m afraid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  \u201cI know.  But you can put that energy into your work-outs instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stared at the ceiling for a while before responding.  \u201cYeah.  Work-outs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep for Jason was difficult even with the pain pills.  When he woke up in the morning he wasn\u2019t surprised that he slept later than usual and that Nikki was gone.  He sat up gingerly and getting up he saw a note tacked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOff to the gym.  Relax and I\u2019ll be back by the afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled.  There was no way he was going miss watching her work out.  The shower was slow and painful and getting dressed was even worse.  By the time he was ready to leave he needed another pain pill.  He sat down and relaxed for a short while and then slipped on some shoes and headed out the door.  As long he walked slowly he didn\u2019t put any extra stress on his cracked ribs.  Once he reached the gym he opened the door and saw Nikki working out.  A quick glance at the weights told him that she was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A large gym bag full of protein drinks sat beside the weight bench, a weight bench whose bar was loaded down with 10% more weight than he remembered being her max for bench press.  The huge weights caused the massive bar to sag heavily at either end.  Beneath the bar, lay the heaving mass of muscle he referred to as his girlfriend, and while she wasn't nearly as big as any of Laura's students, let alone the behemoth that Laura had become, she was clearly packing on muscle at an incredible rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dainty hands grabbed the bar and cleanly pushed up with only the softest of grunts and then slowly the weight lowered to her bulging chest and pushed back up.  The motion was clean, smooth, practiced, and seemingly without great stress.  As he watched, she repeated the motion fourteen more times and only on the last couple did she show any real strain, having to pause briefly before pushing back up.  Each rep, he swore he could see her chest swell ever so slightly, see her sports bra strain slightly more with each rep to contain her massive pecs and heaving bosom.  In spite of his pain, he felt turned on by the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand reached down and grabbed one of the protein bottles, popped off the top and brought it to her lips.  Seconds later, the 64 oz container was empty and her hands were back on the bar pushing, working her arms and especially her chest.  Another 18 reps later and a second protein drink disappeared, then 21 reps and a third bottle disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up seemingly oblivious to Jason's presence, a steely gaze of pure determination on her face.  Bringing her arms together, she flexed her chest causing the mountains of pectoral mass to erupt in thick grooves and veiny striations.  Nodding to herself, she moved over and grabbed a massive dumbell and began doing arm curls, pumping her biceps thicker and thicker with each rep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, Jason carefully maneuvered and grabbed one of the massive empty bottles.  On closer inspection they looked a lot like one gallon milk bottles, but the label showed that each one contained nearly a kilogram of protein and well over 2000 calories of pure carbohydrates.  Her heard a loud clang as one of the massive dumbells hit the ground and she walked right by him and chugged another gallon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her for hours repeating this same procedure with exercise after exercise, stressing every muscle group with superhuman exercise, always drinking her protein solution after every set.  At long last, she was out of her drink and seemingly snapped out of her trance.  Every muscle on her body was pumped to insane proportions, denser, harder, larger by incredible margins compared to where she was when she left him this morning.  She finally seemed to take notice of Jason, now sitting on the bench in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling over to him, her workout clothes strained through small rips and tears to contain her expanding form.  \"Sorry, I didn't notice you.  How long have you been here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf-smiling, he answered, \"A few hours.  You looked ... possessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda was, in a sense.  Anyway, tomorrow I'm bringing more protein drink.  It's nothing but 12 hours a day of workouts until I'm satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I can show Laura that she can't treat you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason helped her clean up, pack up, and together they went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After much thought Jason decided that he had to apologize to Laura. It may not do any good, but it felt like the right thing to do. He kissed Nikki on the forehead.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" he whispered, \"there's something I have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up and looked at him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to apologize to Laura for being a jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sat quietly for a long time looking into Jason's eyes. Finally she nodded. \"If that's what you think is best. She probably won't be too happy to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure she would love another chance to humiliate me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I mean. If you apologize you take the wind out of her sails and steal her fun. I'm coming with you.\" Nikki got out of bed and pulled on a pair of spandex shorts and a red bikini top.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his shorts back on and found a shirt to replace the one that had been torn off of his body. When he threw the ripped shirt away he saw several other torn garments in the trash and laughed to himself; it seamed that it was a common occurrence to rip clothing off in this house.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super sized pair left the apartment together and strolled along the beach. Jason had asked if Nikki knew where to find Laura and she had assured him that she would still be at the beach work out area.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She camps there all day. Even if she's not working out she'll be training her followers.\" Nikki had said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked Jason soaked in the stares from passersby. He loved the way he and Nikki commanded such awestruck looks and he didn't even mind that he was the smaller of the pair. As they walked he moved closer to Nikki and wrapped his arm around her middle (as far as he could, anyway) and held her warm body tight. She smiled at him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do this. I mean, you don't owe her anything.\" Nikki said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the right thing to do. If she wants to hold a grudge beyond this that's on her. But I'm going to clear my conscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked together enjoying the afternoon sun for almost half an hour. Jason didn't realize how far he'd run this morning, but the work out area was farther away than he had thought. Finally he spotted Laura and her two friends standing in the fenced off area surrounded by enormous weights.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached Jason recognized Hannah, the 16 year old who had shown him up earlier. Now the blond beauty was off on her own doing leg lifts with steel plates the size of monster truck tires. Her quads were pumped to obscene size and as she moved through each repetition she let out a guttural yell that echoed across the beach. Jason could hardly believe that the huge girl was only 16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Laura was working with the other girl who had been spectating earlier. She had dark hair and olive colored skin and was no less beautiful than Hannah. She wore a black tank top that had been torn off at the bottom revealing deeply etched washboard abs. Her lower half was clad in a black bikini bottom that was pulled tight over thick glutes. The dark haired girl stood with her eyes closed and her arms straight out away from her body. Laura was walking around her speaking and occasionally whispering in her ear.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she doing?\" Jason asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's teaching that girl how to expand her muscles. So much of it is a mind over matter thing. It comes down to the proper genetics coupled with the right knowledge. It was just a fluke that Laura learned how to do it, now she'll teach anyone if she thinks you're worthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they watched Laura stopped and stood in front of the girl. \"Now, do it!!\" Laura yelled and the girl tensed her fists and curled her arms inward flexing her biceps.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was impressed with the girl's musculature. She was not nearly as large as Hannah, but could still out muscle any professional bodybuilder out there. When she flexed her arms 25 inch biceps sprouted to life. Laura wasn't pleased, though, because she yelled for the girl to try again.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl straightened her arms and flexed again, but there was no change. Again Laura ordered the girl to try again. And again. And again. Over and over Laura barked at the girl who was beginning to sweat and a worried look crossed her face. She kept trying becoming more and more frantic until her eyes opened wide and Jason recognized the look of clarity. With a monumental scream the girl curled her arms once last time and this time they expanded well beyond 25 inches.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Nikki said. \"I've never seen anyone with that much expansion ability right off the bat. Not even Laura, not even close. I don't think she can grow that much now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was speechless. The girl's arms had exploded with so much muscle that it had nearly doubled in size. This girls arm looked like it had even outgrown Nikki's 45 inch bazookas. The girl examined her monstrous arms with satisfaction and pride. She allowed them to shrink back down again before flexing them back to ridiculous size again. She relaxed her flex once more and then closed her eyes again. A moment later every muscle on her body expanded all at once in a symphony of muscle growth. Her shirt split open revealing a bikini top to match her bottom, but even that was having trouble hanging on as her chest plowed forward until it was a wall 2 feet thick. The girl went from being really big to beyond enormous. Even Nikki, in her expanded form, couldn't compete with this giant. The girl held her body in its expanded form and walked around the work out area with a devilish grin on her face. As she completed a full circuit she passed Laura who slapped the girl on her butt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl! I knew you would be a beast.\" Laura shouted.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good.\" Nikki told Jason. \"I've never seen anyone gain full control so quickly and her baseline expansion is incredible. If she works at it she can up her expansion ability to untold extremes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to say?\" Jason asked. All of this was so strange to him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying that Laura has created a monster. This girl will be bigger than anyone before you know it. She is more of a genetic freak than Laura is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed, he was tired of worrying about just how big these ladies could get. He just wanted to get on with his current mission. \"Good for her. Let's get this over with.\" He approached Laura who greeted his arrival with a glare.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Laura said with a smug grin, \"I didn't expect you back so soon.\" Then she looked at Nikki, \"And you, I didn't think I'd ever see you at all. I see you've outgrown tiny here. Does he give you shit about it? Does he beg you to slow down so he can keep up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki spoke slowly and through gritted teeth. \"Not once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well I'm sure he'll get there. To what do I owe the honor?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stepped forward and look Laura square in the eye. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura seemed surprised by this. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a real jerk to you in the past. You didn't deserve that. I was wrong, I feel awful. And I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked suspicious. She glanced to the side at Nikki, \"Did you put him up to this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shook her head. \"This is all him. I tried to talk him out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled at this. Just then her dark haired student approached. For the first time Jason got a good look at her face. She looked Japanese, and had hazel almond shaped eyes. Her facial features were delicate and perfect, she was an astounding beauty. She had allowed her muscles to relax back to their original size, but she still commanded respect with her movements.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem here?\" she asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled at her. \"We're fine, Kimberly. Can you go spot Hannah? I don't think she's tried to bench that much before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded and left the trio. Laura looked back to Jason as if sizing him up. \"I could never figure you out,\" she said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to figure out,\" Jason told her extending his hand for Laura to shake. \"I've been through a lot of strangeness in the last few days and I realized that I lost a really good friend for no good reason. I just hope that you can forgive me.\"</span></div></div>",

She sighed once, then twice as she decided whether to accept this out of the blue apology or toss his ass into the ocean.  A third sigh caused her shoulders to slump ever so slightly and she looked to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.  I accept your apology.  But don\u2019t think one simple apology can erase all of the things you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and looked back at a relieved but still sorrowful looking Jason.

Hell of reunion.  Is there anything else I can do for you two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason licked his lips.  \u201cCan we work out together?  I mean, uh, the three of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nearly choked.  Nikki\u2019s eyes widened and she turned to look at Jason as through her were nuts.  Laura paused, laughed and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not.  But not today.  Come back tomorrow morning.  I\u2019m expecting more weights this afternoon and I need to finish up with Hanna and Kim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  This was going as well as could have expected.  As he and Nikki started to turn away Laura spoke with low controlled tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t think for a moment that I can\u2019t keep up with you now.  I\u2019ve had quite a while to refine the strength building techniques.  And some of my girls are even more talented than you ever were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Laura turned away and Nikki had to pull Jason away to get him to start walking back to her apartment.  Nikki sighed and snuggled up as they slowly walked the beach.  After a while Jason looked down at Nikki and bit his lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki kept looking ahead.  \u201cAbout what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout everything.  You seemed awfully concerned about Kimberly.  And I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d be equally concerned about Hanna.  How many girls is she training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure.  At least ten.  It was in the news a few weeks ago.  Laura had started looking for girls with unnatural strength and convinced them to work out with her.  Now girls search her out.  The strange thing is there aren\u2019t any boys who seem to have the abilities we have.  It\u2019s already starting to change the dynamic of high school and college sports in the area.  And now I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s might be right about her ability to increase her strength on pace with you.  I can only imagine if Kim or Hanna can become stronger faster than you.  And add that to their ability to expand their muscles\u2026.  They\u2019d be unstoppable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded as he slowly started to share her concerns.  The more he knew about this reality the stranger and more worrisome it felt.  \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped so he could look her over.  \u201cDid I really ever ask you to slow down?  To try and let me keep up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki\u2019s smile weakened his knees.  She was radiant against the setting sun and her red hair sparkled against the rays.  She blinked her green eyes, reached up and pecked him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it really matter now?  You know I\u2019m bigger than you and we were still together.  And since you stopping working out a while ago, I may be stronger than you to boot.  So what does that tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and returned her smile.  \u201cEverything I need to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded.  \u201cGood.  Because there are a few things you and Laura don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason furrowed his brow.  \u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve figured out how to increase the effectiveness of my work-outs as well.  That\u2019s one of the reasons I only need to work out no more than once a week.  I doubt I\u2019m up to your abilities, I\u2019m not really sure.  So if Laura is, that really makes me nervous.  And I\u2019ve always kept tabs on Laura.  I still don\u2019t trust her anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Nikki started walking again.  \u201cSo do you still want to work out with Laura tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled ruefully.  \u201cOf course.  You know the old saying.  Keep your friends close\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted.  \u201cYou really don\u2019t see Laura as an enemy do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it Jason.  We\u2019re all super strong and capable of growing even stronger.  Our muscles are so dense that we\u2019re nearly bullet proof.  Laura is putting together a growing group of like minded supergirls.  What do you think she has planned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped again.  He had never considered any of this.  He looked at Nikki who had remained almost unnervingly calm.  \u201cI don\u2019t know.  What DOES she have planned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki gave him a gentle tug to keep them walking.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure.  That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to work out with her tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head.  Just a few short hours ago he was the strongest person on earth.  Now as far as he could tell he may not even be in the top ten.  They stopped and picked up some Chinese dinner.  Nikki paid for it without pause as Jason realized his wallet was quite empty.  He felt weird about that and said so, but Nikki brushed him off.  More questions he would need answers he thought.  They returned to Nikki\u2019s apartment and ate dinner with Jason asking more benign questions about the reality as he tried to catch up with things.  As Nikki stood up to toss out the empty boxes, Jason stood up with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re stronger than me now, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki cocked her head to the side.  \u201cYeah.  At least I think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat down and putting his elbow on the table put his arm out.  \u201cProve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled and sat down across from him.  \u201cYour funeral tough guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they locked arms, Jason flexed up his mighty bicep into a rock hard 31 inch mass of he-muscle.  Nikki smiled wickedly and flexed up her bicep into a rock hard 35 inch mass of she-muscle, not bothering to pull in her expanding ability just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re ready Jason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they fought for position, Jason looked up into Nikki\u2019s beautiful eyes and nearly lost the match right there.  Shaking his head he figured he\u2019s better keep his attention on the match and stared at their arms.  Once he did he concentrated and was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason started pushing hard and veins started rising across his super strong arm and he was soon pushing Nikki\u2019s arm down a few inches.  His confidence raised, he kept up the pressure, plowing all of his formidable super strength against Nikki.  He got her arm way down when he could feel her grip tighten causing him to let out a pained grunt.  He looked to see that Nikki\u2019s bicep was growing larger, harder and tighter as his progress was halted.  But he had the advantage now and he started to roll his shoulder try and push her down further.  Nikki responded with another hard flex, pushing her bicep up to her full 42 inch power packed girth, applying additional pressure and causing Jason\u2019s eyes to tear up.  Nikki breathed hard through her grit teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try Jason, but you forgot just who you\u2019re messing with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, within moments their arms were back up to the starting position.  Jason\u2019s face was turning red from the effort as he gasped out a painful breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?  Just who am I dealing with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled through her strain and with a hard jerk, sent Jason\u2019s arm downward.  Nikki groaned as she started rolling her shoulder for one final push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with Uber Nikki, that\u2019s who!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s did his best to hold on, but Nikki put the last of her strength into one final surge and pushed Jason\u2019s hand down to the table.  They both let out sighs of relief and rubbed their arms, snickering.  Jason got up to kiss Nikki and she returned it in earnest.  Before they knew it they were back in bed and another shirt was ruined.  And soon after they fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up together, Jason looked over at Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Uber Nikki, what would you like to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled.  \"We don't want to miss working out with Laura.  It will be a good chance to see what she's up to.  But maybe we should get a quick work out beforehand to see how strong we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat up.  \"OK, let's..\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason looked into Nikki's eyes and recognized her confusion as well as her lust. He even tried to form a connection but then he envisioned her holding Brad's beaten body and felt his rage from the previous day returning. When the chips were down Nikki had been at Brad's side not his. Now that he was buff she attempted to see things from his point of view, but where was she when Laura was shaking him silly? Now that he was getting big muscles and super strength he didn't need to worry about what this girl he didn't even know thought. Especially when she was obviously friends with a jock asshole who would have beaten him down without a second thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's fists tightened and his arms and shoulders flexed. He did his best to keep his anger in check but knew he was primed to explode. \"Look,\" he said through tight teeth, \"I already told you I don't know what's happening to me. But I'm fine, better than ever. If you want to leave, fine. Go. But all I have is a theory. If that's not good enough for Your Highness, then forget it.\" Jason dismissively looked over Nikki's head at the blond bombshell who was now slowly and seductively rubbing oil into the bronzed skin of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a child sometimes,\" Nikki said. \"Call me when you get your head straight.\" As she spoke these last few words Jason could hear her choke back tears which sent a jolt of guilt through him. Then she turned and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sucked in a deep breath to calm his anger and quell his nerves then approached his prey. He stood over her casting a broad shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough,\" she said without looking up. Jason felt suddenly nervous. This wasn't like him, first telling off a perfectly nice girl then about to attempt to bed a seductress. He flexed his pectorals and let their size and power fill him with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what might your name be?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up and took her sunglasses off. She gave Jason a sly grin. \"I'm Gina. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat down on the sand next to Gina. \"I'm Jason.\" He then braced himself for a bold move he never thought he would ever have the guts to attempt. \"I have to say, Gina, you have really huge tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina raised an eyebrow while her grin grew larger. \"Oh! Well thank you.\" She slid her hand under her bikini top and squeezed her bulbous boob. \"All natural, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What's your cup size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, straight to the point. I wear an F cup.\" This time she used both hands under her top and squeezed her breasts together. Then she took her hands out and readjusted her top quickly giving Jason a glimpse of her nipples. \"You know Jason, you have really huge muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jason's turn to grin. \"Thank you,\" he said raising an arm and flexing his bicep. Gina reached a hand out and ran it over the swollen peak giving his muscle a solid squeeze. \"All natural,\" Jason said extending his arm and flexing again. He was now certain his arm was bigger now than it was this morning. \"And super powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Gina slid her hand up Jason's shoulder then down to his chest. \"Wow, you're not kidding. I've know a few buff guys and none of them felt this solid, this... hard.\" She leaned in and whispered this last word into Jason's ear in a voice that was breathy and dripping with sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt his penis begin to stiffen in his too tight shorts which caught Gina's attention. \"Oh my,\" she said, \"looks like all of your muscles are huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's frame of reference had been ruined by porn and his lack of experience with women so he'd never really considered his 8 inch penis to be large, merely average, so the news that he was big all over came as a pleasant surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina's free hand went to Jason's crotch and gripped his shaft. \"Mmmmm, just as hard. I think we need to go someplace private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned slightly so he could put his hand on Gina's thigh which he then slid slowly along her soft skin towards the heat of her vagina. \"You live close by?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, no.\" Gina said. \"Arizona, actually. But my friends and I are renting a house right over there.\" Gina motioned to a house that was only four doors down from Jason's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're renting the Houser's place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged. \"Just in passing. I didn't even realize they had already left on their yearly tour of Europe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just yesterday.\" Gina said continuing to fondle Jason's muscles. \"You're not so close to them that you would have a problem having sex in every room of their house, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering her question Jason simply scooped Gina up in his arms and began carrying her to her rented abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I was hoping to hear,\" Gina squealed with glee as she wrapped her arms around Jason's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably a good 500 yards from their spot on the beach to Gina's place, but Jason carried her the entire way and never even felt the hint of strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived Jason climbed the stairs to the deck and passed the pool. Finding the rear sliding door wide open he entered and saw the television was on. A girl with jet black hair was watching some show about a Kardashian or Coco Austin or some other crap. When the girl heard Jason enter she turned then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina! What did you find?\" The girl stood and approached Jason to get a good look. She was a gorgeous Japanese girl with brilliant hazel eyes and a tiny dash of freckles across the bridge of her nose. She was tiny (about 5 foot 2 inches) and not nearly as curvaceous as the blond he carried, but what she lacked in boobs or hips she made up for in athleticism. She had on a red bikini top that covered modest B cup breasts but also revealed toned abs and strong shoulders. Jason's eyes traveled down to the girl's lower body where she wore tight jean shorts that has been cut off so that a few strands of denim dangled against her perfect olive skin. As she walked Jason watched her short but strong legs pump with defined quads. Jason took a guess that this girl was either a cheerleader or a dancer, either way he wanted her about as bad as he wanted Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly,\" Gina said, \"this big hunk of beef is Jason. Jason, meet Lilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh believe me,\" Lilly said devouring Jason with her eyes, \"the pleasure is all mine. Gina, I want to play with your toy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina chuckled. \"He's mine! I found him, I get dibs. Maybe if you're good we can all play together later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the hunk of beef get a say in this?\" Jason asked. He still held Gina in his arms and continued to be amazed at how easy it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your giant muscles I doubt I could stop you.\" Gina said. \"But don't you believe in finders keepers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked Gina in the eye. \"I believe in being a gentleman; I came home with you and you get me all to yourself... to start.\" Now he looked at Lilly. \"I also believe every lady deserves a good time. So I'll expect you to join us later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly blushed and nodded. Jason immediately got the sense that despite her talk Lilly wasn't as outgoing as her busty friend, which endeared him to her even more since he, too, was acting more confident than he typically was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, big guy,\" Gina commanded, \"let's get a little privacy. Up the stairs and to the left.\" Jason started to cross the living room when Gina stopped him. \"Oh wait! Lilly, have you heard from Alicia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly grinned. \"As a matter of fact I have. She sent a text that she's at lunch with a musclebound hunk of her own. Maybe she'll bring him here and you two can compare. Though your catch is going to be tough to beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right!\" Gina point upstairs. \"Now, fuck my brains out, Jason.\"</span></div></div>",

Big bodybuilding community. And I mean big.\" She put her hands on Jason's shoulders and squeezed. \"Soooo big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the bedroom and Jason tossed Gina down onto the bed. He quickly stripped his shorts off and stood before Gina in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does my body excite you?\" he asked hitting a crab flex that caused his torso to explode with ripped sinew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god yes,\" Gina whipped her top off and threw it aside letting her gorgeous breasts bounce free. She cupped one and started tweaking her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to touch, suck, bite, and lick my muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina leapt off the bed into Jason's arms and began doing just that. Jason easily supported Gina's weight with one hand under her rear which left his other hand free to explore. He squeezed the supple flesh of her thigh then ran his fingers up her back and gripped a handful of her hair before sliding back down to her crotch. Jason took hold of Gina's bikini bottom and pulled until the thin strings snapped. He tossed the scraps of fabric aside and slid his fingers into her vagina. This was his first experience with a woman so he worked his digits around not entirely sure about what he was doing, but gauging his success on Gina's reaction. He found that when he twisted one way she moaned deeply and tightened her legs around his middle; then he curled his fingers and stroked her vaginal wall which caused her to gasp and let out a loud shout of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued this for several minutes, his powerful fingers sending spasms ripping through Gina's body. It didn't take long before she was beating her fist against his chest screaming the words \"oh fuck\" over and over again. It was the most intense orgasm in her life to date. Jason could only laugh to himself; he had been under the impression that getting a woman to come was a real challenge, but that was way easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened Jason lay Gina back down on the bed and pulled her legs open. He put his face in her crotch and began licking her vagina for all he was worth. Once again his lack of experience was more than made up for by his super strong tongue. He was so proficient that within two minutes Gina was once again screaming very similar phrases while she clawed at the bed sheets and bucked her pelvis. It was another orgasm and it had come so quick that Jason decided he would simply keep going. He kept eating her out for another 20 minutes while orgasm after orgasm plowed through Gina's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally stopped and began slowly licking his way up her body Gina was a barely coherent, heaving mess. Jason snapped her back to reality by clamping his mouth down on her right breast and sucking deep while pinching her left nipple. Jason's frame of reference was severely limited but his considered Gina's boobs to be about the best the world had ever seen. He indulged in them completely sucking, squeezing, nibbling and just worshiping them through and through. As he did so Gina returned to running her hands all over Jason's shoulders, chest, and arms which he tensed for her enjoyment. Finally Jason moved up and planted a kiss directly on Gina's mouth that sent their tongues dancing. While they kissed Jason moved the head of his penis closer and closer to Gina's crotch until he had begun to enter her. The feeling of being inside her was so much better than Jason had imagined, so warm, so wet, that he instantly plunged all the way in. This elicited cries of shock and joy from Gina. Jason began grinding his hips and pumping his cock in and out slowly. It took every ounce of self control to keep from coming but Jason held off. Minutes went by and he kept pumping, slowly he began to pick up speed and increase the force of his thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't help but laugh when Gina, in the midst of her rhythmic panting, rolled her eyes back and said, \"Well, shit. Here we go again.\" She then grit her teeth and grabbed the bedspread tight while she began to orgasm yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Jason had increased his speed to a runaway jackhammer pace that had Gina screaming and coming nonstop. Eventually he felt a pressure well up inside his cock and balls and he knew he couldn't hold back any longer. Jason's body tensed and he let loose blast after blast of come into Gina with a mighty roar that shook the walls. It was then that he thought of poor Lilly who had to listen to the terrifying noises coming from Gina's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina detached from Jason and rolled onto her side panting. Jason realized that while she was drenched in sweat he had hardly begun to perspire. He let Gina catch her breath before he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you done?\" He made sure to hold a surprised tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina rolled back to face Jason and her eyes went wide when she saw that he was stoking a fully erect cock that was hungry for more. She made a few failed attempts to speak then finally took in a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck it!\" she said then crawled forward grabbing Jason's penis with both hands and guiding it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later Jason lay in bed with his arm around Gina. The poor girl was completely exhausted though Jason had never felt better. His first foray into the world of sexual pleasures had been a wild success. He was practically a sex god on top of a superhuman powerhouse. And he was still growing. He watched the shadows move around the room as the sun began its descent towards the sea Jason could almost feel his body swelling and his strength increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he got up, at first attempting to not disturb Gina, but the weight of his body caused the bed to pitch, move, and shake. Thankfully, Gina was so tired she didn't even stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason scooped up his shorts and went across the hall to the bathroom. After relieving himself he examined his reflection and found himself to be noticeably larger. If he had been a light or middle weight bodybuilder when he awoke that morning then he was now easily into the heavyweight division. He raised his right arm and pumped his bicep a few times watching as his arm swelled to over 20 inches around. Maybe even 21 or 22. He then tried to put his shorts back on, but they never made it beyond his giant thighs where they ripped apart in his hands. Jason chucked the torn remnants in the trash and grabbed a large towel which he wrapped around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went downstairs in the hopes that he would find Lilly still hanging out, but he decided he would settle for a dip in the pool at the very least. He was pleasantly surprised to find...</span></div></div>",

She had changed from her bikini and cut offs into tight Lycra shorts and a sports bra and had worked herself into a fairly descent sweat. Jason watched her bob and move to a workout that looked to be a modified kickboxing routine. Her gorgeous legs flexed and pumped with each move and Jason could feel his penis begin to fill with blood yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat startling Lilly who spun around. Her eyes went wide taking in the sight before her. Jason had been holding Gina earlier so Lilly hadn't gotten a full look at the buff beast, but now that she saw him he was even bigger than she had previously thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got very nice muscle tone.\" Jason said admiring Lilly's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly blushed slightly but fired back. \"You're one to talk. Your physique is incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason puffed his chest out. \"Yeah, I'm ok.\" He looked himself over. \"Still packing on pounds. Someday I'm going to be really big. Listen, I was going to relax in the pool for a bit; you look like you've earned a dip yourself. Would you care to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Lilly tossed her hand weights onto the couch and began to cross the room towards the stairs. \"Let me just go change back into my swimsuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason moved to block her path. \"No,\" he said then pulled the towel off from around his waist. \"No swimsuits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took in Jason's naked body for a moment. Then nervously responded, \"Um... yeah, ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lilly.\" Jason said with a huge smile. \"No time to be shy, we're going to have some fun.\" He placed his hand on the small of her back and guided her out to the deck. Then, standing at poolside Jason pulled Lilly close to him, her head against his chest, and moved his hands up her back. He slid his fingers under her sports bra and pulled the garment up over her head. Lilly complied then helped by sliding her shorts off and letting them fall to the ground. Jason put his hand on the side of Lilly's face and turned it towards his own. He began to move closer as if he were about to kiss her, but then, quick and without warning, Jason scooped Lilly up and tossed her over his shoulder. Then he turned and leapt into the blue water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pair surfaced Lilly punched Jason in the shoulder. \"Jerk!!\" she shouted, though Jason could tell by her smile that she wasn't really angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason reached out to grab Lilly but she squealed and turned to swim away. He was too quick for her, though, and he grabbed her ankle and began slowly pulling her back in. As he did he slowly ran his hands up her calves and thighs reveling in the generous swells and tightness of her muscles. Jason pulled her tight against his own body and began rubbing his 8 inch cock against the inside of her thighs. Suddenly he saw something in her eyes that concerned him, she seemed worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the matter?\" Jason asked trying to be as comforting as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is my.. uh.. first time.\" Lilly's eyes dropped away from Jason's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Jason chuckled. \"Look, we don't need to, if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I do!\" Lilly wrapped her legs around Jason's middle and squeezed tight. \"I want to so bad. I just wanted you to know in case I wasn't very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled warmly. \"Don't you worry about a thing. We'll start nice and slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word Jason began very slowly but Lilly quickly demonstrated an aptitude for sex that surprised them both. They spent the better part of the next hour trying out various positions in every corner of the pool. Lilly then led Jason out of the water and sat him on one of the deck chairs before straddling his waist and riding him with such vigor that he began to doubt her claims of virginity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done the pair went back inside and showered together to rinse the chlorine from their bodies. Showering together proved challenging because of Jason's bulk and their forced close proximity led to yet another round of intense lovemaking with Jason using his superior strength to hold Lilly's lithe body aloft nearly the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their shower Lilly and Jason returned to the living room where they both sat naked and entwined on the couch to relax and watch TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Lilly turned to Jason and asked, \"Is this what I've been missing? Is sex always this incredible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could respond a voice behind them answered for him. \"No, not even close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Lilly turned to find Gina standing at the base of the stairs. Gina was wearing a white robe tied off at the waist and open enough across the chest to show off copious amounts of cleavage. She approached the couch from behind and leaned down between the nude couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy really shouldn't have been your first, Lilly.\" Gina said. \"I don't think you'll ever find another like him.\" Gina locked her lips onto Jason's. They kissed for so long that Lilly began to get jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly pulled Gina away. \"Ok, ok! You had your turn already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina stood and glared at her friend, \"And you had yours! Don't get greedy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could hear hints of anger creeping into Gina and Lilly's voices and he knew he had to diffuse the situation, plus he saw the potential to live the clich\u00e9d male fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls,\" he said, \"first of all there is no reason to fight. There's tons of me to enjoy. Second, you're both friends, so you need to kiss and make up right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina smirked. \"Oh, I bet you'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe I would. And you two are going to keep right on kissing until you're closer than you've ever been. And then you should kiss some more, and maybe some sensual touching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina's smile widened. \"Now there's the directness I like.\" She rounded the couch shrugging off her robe as she went. Just as Jason had guessed she was completely naked underneath. She sat next to Lilly on the couch and placed a hand on her cheek. The two girls both seemed nervous but they slowly moved together until their lips were touching and then their tongues were sliding together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched as their trepidation vanished and their passions for each other increased. It wasn't long before the two friends were grinding together and exploring each other with an intense hunger. Jason was pleased to see that Lilly was just as excited about Gina's breasts as he'd been. The young girl sucked intently on her buxom companion's cantaloup sized boobs eliciting moans of pleasure. Gina dug her fingers deep into Lilly's luxurious dark hair, massaging her scalp, and pressing her head harder against her own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was no longer content to remain on the sidelines and scooped a hand under each of the girls bottoms. He lifted them both together and placed them down so each was sitting on one of his tree trunk sized thighs. Grace, never missing a beat, moved one hand from Lilly's scalp, gripped Jason's cock, and began pumping away. And just like that Jason completed the journey from a guy who was a virgin mere hours earlier to a guy who had had sex with two women both separately and together. Plus, with his muscles, strength, and (most importantly) self image still improving this was very likely only the start of a whole new life for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later the door in the foyer opened and Gina and Lilly stopped to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be Alicia.\u201d Lilly whispered. \u201cShould we get our clothes on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if she sees me naked,\u201d Gina replied in similar hushed tones. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if she\u2019s alone or not, and I\u2019m not ready to show some stranger my goods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what goods they are.\u201d Jason gave her left breast a firm squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina slapped Jason\u2019s hand away. \u201cNot now, I hear a man\u2019s voice and they\u2019re coming this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls flopped down on the couch while Jason slid down and crouched on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds ticked by and then all three of them could hear Alicia speak. \u201cThe bedroom\u2019s are upstairs this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d Alicia\u2019s date had a very deep voice that was somehow familiar to Jason. Needing to ease his curiosity he raised his body just a little higher to see over the back of the couch. The first person he spotted was Alicia who\u2019s figure was even more curvy than Gina\u2019s. This girl had short, light brown hair that didn\u2019t quite touch her shoulders and she wore a pink halter top with spaghetti straps. The top was packed to overflowing with perfectly spherical boobs that were at least two full cup sizes larger than Gina\u2019s. Alicia also had a very narrow, slim tummy that curved out to very wide hips. She wore tiny white shorts that housed a gorgeous bubble butt and gave way to very long, perfect legs. Jason was imagining all the wonderful things he was bound to do with Alicia\u2019s body when her date came into view and Jason forgot all about Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did recognize the man she was with, but only the face. The body was entirely outrageous and carried more muscle mass than even Jason, perhaps even more than the hulk that Jason was becoming. In his own reality this guy was big, but something about this one must have made him gigantic. Things were bound to get interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, shit.\u201d Jason whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know him?\u201d Gina asked from her hiding place. She couldn\u2019t see either Alicia or the beast she was with, but the look on Jason\u2019s face got her curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI know him. His name is...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Everything ok?\" Gina asked Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason snapped back to reality, or at least the strange reality he found himself in. After spotting the enormous, hulking Greg Jason's mind had begun to wander but now he looked at his two playmates and smiled. \"Sure, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that guy?\" Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the brother of someone who used to be my friend,\" Jason explained. Even now thinking about Laura was beginning to make him angry. Jason could feel an ocean of rage flowing beneath the surface of his mind. He knew this was something he was going to have to deal with at some point but had no desire to even think about for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter who he is,\" Jason continued. He hugged each girl close to either side of his massive chest. \"Let's all go upstairs and make the two of them jealous. Let's shake the walls and wake people up for miles. I'm in the mood to make you girls scream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood and carried Gina and Lilly in each arm up the stairs to Gina's bedroom where they continued their sex games for several hours<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason woke up around 7 the next morning after only sleeping for about 3 hours. Even though he'd barely eaten a thing and hardly slept he still felt as though he were bursting with energy. He didn't know where this energy was coming from, a person with a body his size should need massive amounts of calories to keep functioning, but as it was he couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten and he still felt like he could run back to back marathons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he had the night before he slipped out of bed without waking the exhausted beauties on either side of him and made his way, naked, to the bathroom. Once the he caught sight of himself in the mirror a smile spread across his face. He still had quite a bit of mass to add before he regained his 370 pound physique, but he was still a giant unto himself. He found a scale on the floor and cautiously stepped on. The display read 308 pounds, he still had over 60 pounds to go. Maybe he'd be finished growing by that evening, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason raised his arms and hit a double biceps pose and whistled when his arms swelled to what he estimated to be 26 inches. He was bigger than the biggest of bodybuilders, or at least he should have been; he remembered the sight of Greg's humongous frame and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he told his reflection, \"maybe I can't be the biggest but maybe I'm still the strongest. I was curling the back end of a small car the other day and I feel like my strength has been growing exponentially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason returned to Gina's room and found his remaining personal effects: a shirt that would never fit him again and his iPhone. He pulled the shirt apart into scraps and tossed them in the trash, took his phone, and returned to the king sized bed and his place between the sleeping naked women. They stirred a little and hugged close to his muscled body but neither awoke. Lilly slid her strong legs around Jason's bulging thigh which caused his member to begin to swell, but he wanted to research his monstrous rival and let his companions rest so he ignored his throbbing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason unlocked his phone and opened the web browser. He put in a search for Greg Friedman and found his personal website. It was just as he had suspected, in this reality Greg was a 460 pound monster. His site was littered with pictures of him flexing and working out his titanic body and banners at the top of the page proclaimed him the strongest man in the world. Jason clicked around a few pages and read that Greg had what scientists were calling the Friedman Mutation which allowed him to build muscles bigger and stronger than anyone in history. The page also made mention of Greg's sister being effected by the mutation as well and offered a link to her personal website, but Jason did not care to see her lest his anger get out of control. As it was he could feel himself turning red and feeling frustrated; after all he was the cause of this whole mess. A chunk head like Greg didn't deserve to be so big and powerful, and Jason had turned Laura into a real bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took in a deep breath to calm himself. Then he click on a link that took him to Greg's list of world record setting feats of strength. It looked as though Greg's top bench press was just over a ton at 2090 pounds. Jason thought back to the Mini Cooper that he had lifted the day before. How much did it weigh? 2000 pounds maybe? 2500? More? Obviously he hadn't curled the whole thing but the part he had lifted had been fairly easy, right? He began to wonder he he would have been able to bench press that car and decided he probably could have, and with his strength still growing he was sure he could today. Jason nodded to himself, he was stronger than the strongest man in the world. It was going to be a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, Gina, and Lilly snuggled together for a few hours until the girls woke up around 11 am. They all crawled out of bed and began the girls began to get dressed. Lilly pulled on her ripped denim shorts and a T-shirt while Gina slid into some black yoga pants and and a tube top.  Jason stood and stretched, when he heard them both gasp he knew exactly what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason! Are you bigger?\" Lilly spoke with astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... your muscles. They're bigger than they were yesterday.\" Lilly stepped forward, put her hand out, and touched Jason's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason raised his arm and flexed a bowling ball sized bicep, he looked closely at his arm and frowned. \"No, I don't think so. Looks the same to me.\" It was actually a good 5 inches bigger now than when he had approached Lilly the previous evening and probably 9 or 10 inches bigger than when he had first met Gina on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar,\" Gina said from behind Lilly. \"I thought you were bigger last night but I also thought I was crazy so I didn't say anything. But when we first met you were maybe a middleweight bodybuilder and now you're bigger than anyone I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned and shrugged. \"Whatever you say. But I think your buddy Alicia found someone even bigger than me, and not by a small margin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina and Lilly looked stunned. \"Really?\" Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Why don't you two go downstairs and see if he's still hanging around while I forage for some clothes to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to steal Mr. Houser's clothes?\" Gina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Borrow. The guy is the size of a walrus, I'm sure I can find something that should fit. I can't very well spend the whole day naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina rubbed her body up against Jason's. \"I strongly disagree. But since you insist I suppose we'll allow you to put some clothes on for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls went down to the living room while Jason made his way to the master bedroom. He went into the closet and searched around. It took him a bit longer than he'd expected but he eventually found a white tank top that Mr. Houser likely used as an undershirt and a pair of khaki shorts. Both items were much tighter than Jason had hoped and he knew he would likely outgrow them by the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the bedroom he caught a quick glance at himself in a mirror and still couldn't believe what he saw. He was an incredible powerhouse with muscle exploding off of his frame. Even if he was to have trouble finding clothes that fit him going forward he was excited to have that problem if it meant having a body like his. Jason left the room with a spring in his step and went downstairs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason went downstairs and found the girls in the living room drooling over Greg, as he assumed they would be. Alicia sat off to the side with a smug grin on her face as her friends pawed at the man she had wooed and brought home. Seeing her for the first time in daylight Jason was reminded just how outrageous Alicia's figure was. Huge, perfectly round breasts sat high on her chest contained within the skimpiest of bikini tops that left a good 90 percent of her boobs exposed save for her nipples. Just below her extreme bust-line was a very trim stomach. She wore the same tiny white shorts as the night before and her long, tanned legs were crossed before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, though, was dressed very differently. Jason had expected to find him in workout clothes or even shirtless, but instead he looked like he was dressed for an office job. He had on a button up, long sleeved shirt and khaki pants. However both garments were made of some sort of material that hugged his muscles like a second skin. Every curve, bulge, vein, and valley was perfectly visible as though Greg were wearing nothing at all. It shouldn't have been possible for Jason to count the individual bricks that comprised Greg's abdominal muscles, but he could even identify each and every oblique that ran up the sides of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's enormous body was splayed out on the couch with Gina and Lilly on either side of him, both girls running their hands over his chest and arms in wonder and amazement. From time to time Greg would raise an arm and flex a mind blowing bicep that expanded his arm out to 36 inches around. Jason realized that the material of Greg's shirt had been designed to stretch to accommodate his flexing without ripping. It even shrank right back when he relaxed his bicep and remained tight around his arm. Jason felt the anger inside him swell at the sight of the girls fawning over Greg, but he took a deep breath and let it go. He knew how much they loved guys with giant muscles and they didn't get any bigger than Greg's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia was the first to spot Jason as he entered the room. She raised an eyebrow and gave him an approving grin. Jason approached her and introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia extended her hand for Jason to shake. \"Gina and Lilly were telling me all about you, as well as the wild time they had yesterday. They were right, you are mighty sexy. And you almost the most muscular man I've ever seen. Almost.\" While her words could have landed like an insult they were instead playful and Jason couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been told it's not the size that matters but what you're able to do with them that makes a difference.\" Jason bounced his pecs one at a time straining the tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia lit up. \"Oh, so true.\" She draped her hand across the top of her breast letting their fingers play across her tightly packed cleavage. Then she slid her foot up the inside of Jason's thigh until the quadriceps of each leg began pressing into each other and she could go no further. \"From what I hear you do amazing work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's penis sprung to life and added further strain to his too tight shorts. He leaned down and put his hands on the armrests of Alicia's chair. He put his face very close to hers. \"I look forward to giving you a full demonstration. And I must say I'm very excited to test out your,\" he then ran his hand over her shoulder taking hold of the thin strap that held her bikini together and tugged lightly before sliding his fingers around the swell of her giant breast and giving it a good, solid squeeze. \"Generous curves.\" he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!\" A deep, booming voice came from behind Jason. He turned to see Greg on his feet pointing a finger at Jason. \"Don't you touch her, pipsqueak. She's with me.\" Greg's voice seemed to resonate and amplify inside his enormous chest and Jason could feel the vibrations in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt his rage returning. In his own universe Greg had been a descent guy, but now he was just a huge bully like all the others. Jason wasn't going to let anyone push him around. He calmed himself as much as he could and spoke slowly. \"She's not with you, you're with her. Subtle difference, but it changes a lot.\" He pointed at Gina and Lilly. \"I'm with them, but they're not necessarily with me. So if they want to play with you they can. And if Alicia here wants to play with me,\" Jason grinned wide, \"well, who could blame her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 girls chuckled at Jason's joke, but Greg was not impressed. \"Yeah, well maybe I don't like you hanging around at all. I think you should just leave before I make you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting harder for Jason to control his anger, but he held fast. \"You're going to make me leave? How are you going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sneered. \"I'm the strongest man in the world. I can make you do whatever I want. I can do whatever I want. And I can take whatever I want. Right now these girls belong to me.\" Greg put his hands on his hips and flexed his pecs. His tight shirt tightened further but, just like before, stretched enough to keep from tearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina, not pleased with Greg claiming ownership over her, stood and took Lilly by the hand. The two girls crossed the room and joined Alicia behind Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled. \"Oh, is your big man going to protect you? I'll show you what a real big man looks like.\" Greg raised his right arm and flexed his bicep. Just like before it hardened into a 36 inch mass, but this time it didn't stop there. Greg's insanely tight shirt was no long able to keep stretching around his growing arm and quickly began to rip apart at the seams from his shoulder to his wrist. Greg's bicep and triceps swelled and grew with abandon and somehow managed to look overly large on his already ridiculous frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg's sleeve ripped and fell away Jason could hear Gina and Lilly gasp from behind him. He then heard Alicia quietly explain what he already knew, \"He can make his muscles expand and grow even bigger,\" she said. \"He showed me last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's arm finally stopped growing at nearly 50 inches around. The peak of his jacked bicep stood slightly higher than the knuckles of his raised hand while the vein that snaked across the top was as thick as a garden hose. Greg straightened his arm, maintaining its mass, then pumped and flexed a few times watching with excitement over his own miraculous sinew that seemed to writhe beneath his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked back to his audience and locked his eyes on Jason's. \"Are you ladies ready to see the real me?\" His entire body then began to expand. For half a second his clothes attempted to hang on, but they quickly submitted to Greg's increasing size. Rips and tears formed all over then his outfit simply exploded off of his frame leaving him clad only in a red speedo. Greg was a hulking, twitching mountain of muscle. Even as big as Jason was he knew that even two of him wouldn't match up to Greg's full size. Fortunately he also knew that Greg's expanded muscles did nothing to increase his strength, though it was stilly mighty intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg folded his arms across his chest, or tried to anyway, and gave Jason a death stare. \"So, little man, are you going to leave easy or am I going to make you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" Jason said. \"I challenge you to...\"</span></div></div>",

You really think you can challenge me?  I don\u2019t know what you smoked, but if that\u2019s all it will take to get rid of you, then fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked around and pointed to the bar in the corner of the living room and walked around and stood there with a smile on his face.  Jason smirked as well, knowing that he was going to enjoy overpowering the strongest man in the world.  Striding over, his own muscles pumped with purpose and his tank top strained against his massive chest.  The girls all moved in closer, with Alicia the only one looking worried as she started texting furiously.  The other girls snuck a bit closer, but still far enough away to take both men\u2019s physiques in and to stay away if the arm wrestle turned physical.  Greg reached out and Jason did the same, and when their elbows hit the thick wood it groaned under the pressure.  Locking hands, Greg started to squeeze down with a smile on his face and Jason quickly squeezed down as well.  Greg\u2019s smile dimmed a bit as Jason was able to fend off his attempt to crush Jason\u2019s hand, causing Jason to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime you\u2019re ready Greg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg growled and without further warning, said \u201cNow!\u201d and started to push down.  Jason was caught a bit off guard and his arm went down for a moment, but to Greg\u2019s continued frustration, Jason was able to bring their hands back to the starting position with a quick burst of his own.  And then both men started to push hard against each other, causing their muscles to swell and their arms to shake.  They were better matched than either one thought they would be.  The girls watched with fascination as Jason slowly started to push Greg\u2019s much larger arm toward the table, at which time Greg\u2019s muscle appeared to expand even more, halting Jason\u2019s advance.  Jason was no longer certain that Greg\u2019s expanding muscles were just for show, but even so, Jason could feel his muscles tighten as well, seemingly adding the addition size and power he knew was coming.  So before Greg could mount a counter attack, Jason rolled his shoulder and blasted Greg\u2019s arm to the table with a terrible crack as the wood splinted against the hands of the two strongest men on earth.  Jason released his grip quickly and his face red from the effort, took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like those muscles are just for show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg growled and reaching his arm up, swung it down harshly, smashing through the bar and breaking several bottles sitting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have cheated!  There\u2019s no way you\u2019re stronger than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg quickly moved out from behind the bar as Jason backed up, his own anger building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew you!  I kicked your sorry ass, now beat it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg tensed his fists at his side and his muscles surged up to massive proportions.  Jason leaned forward a bit and tensed his fists as well.  He could feel his muscles surging larger as well.  He was certain he was stronger than Greg and knew that kicking his ass was going to be even sweeter than beating him at arm wrestling.  The girls shouted out for them to stop, but the two massive men ignored them as they circled for a moment.  Just as Greg was reaching back to deliver the first blow, the door burst open and the two men turned their heads to see\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Neither man looked happy to see Laura, but it was Jason who looked surprised as well.  Apparently he and Greg weren\u2019t the only ones who had grown larger.  Laura stood there in a thick black, sleeveless athletic top and black undersized athletic shorts.  Both garments were straining against the biggest, sexiest set of muscles Jason could have imagined.  She was nearly as large as him!  And as he looked down at her arms, those disproportionally large arms from before now looked enormous!  He could see the veins snaking across them and they bulged to ridiculously massive balls of jacked up power even as they hung to her side.  Jason now had to wonder just what was happening.  This reality caused several changes and for some reason his body was catching up to what he had originally entered into the phone.  But it was more than that as he was much stronger than he had input into the phone.  Now it was apparent that his original changes to Laura were morphing as well.  Only she had started out changed like he originally indicated, but now that he was growing, so was she!  And if she had started out really strong he was momentarily concerned about just how strong she was now.  He already knew about Greg.  He briefly wondered about Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind raced he pulled himself back to moment and sighed as he noticed that Laura was bare foot and her long brown hair was a mess, indicating that she had rushed over.  But while her size was a shock to Jason, Greg was less impressed as his muscles were still larger than Laura\u2019s.  Staring at the two men she knew so well, Laura strode quickly toward them and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it you two!  Do you know how much trouble this will cause?  It\u2019s not like you both don\u2019t have issues with the police already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men growled in unison.  \u201cShut up Laura!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s shock of the larger Laura waned as his anger returned.  Greg shot daggers at his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to tell me what to do, much less try and stop me from kicking his ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura frowned and walked closer.  The girls were surprised that Laura would dare get in between these two, even if she was the biggest, strongest woman on earth.  She sneered at her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do better than that!  Maybe I\u2019ll just kick your ass instead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sniffed.  \u201cI don\u2019t have time for you right now, this pip squeak needs to be taught a lesson!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spat.  \u201cAnd I need to knock this asshole\u2019s head off, so why don\u2019t you just mind your own damn business!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned toward Jason and gave him an angry stare of her own.  \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I can\u2019t handle you as well.  I know how strong you\u2019ve become.  You don\u2019t frighten me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point both men stepped toward Laura as she neared them.  The other girls gasped as both men lashed out, Jason from his anger and frustration with Laura in this reality and Greg from Laura\u2019s constant badgering.  Laura tried to dodge Jason\u2019s blow, but when Greg hit her first on her right cheek, Jason\u2019s punch connected on her left.  Fortunately for her, they were both glancing blows, but the combined power knocked her head back and she stumbled away, but amazingly, caught her balance before falling down.  Both men stood back upright, still seething and willing to take Laura down before they went at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a loud moan as her own anger rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is then?  The two strongest men on earth against a girl!  Fine by me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as both men readied themselves, Laura took a quick step forward and twisting to the side with amazing quickness, pulled her massively muscled left leg out and with shot gave a kick to Jason\u2019s abs with such force that he was launched across the room and smashed right through the wall into the next room where he tumbled a few times and crashed into a table.  The girls screamed and Gina ran into the room to check him.  Laura smirked as she righted herself, staring at her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne down, one to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned her head just in time to see Greg send another hard punch toward her abs.  Laura flexed her stomach and her abs consolidated into a thick wall of hard, deeply separated muscle blocks across her narrow midsection.  The blow connected with dull whack, but to Greg\u2019s surprise, his fist bounced off and his wrist received a jolt of pain as though he had punched a brick wall.  Laura smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Greg?  Did that hurt?  I would think the strongest man on earth could take down his little sister pretty easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s grumbled under his breath and pulling back his other arm he send his fist sailing toward Laura\u2019s nose.  But this time Laura reached out and with a loud smack caught his fist in her outstretched hand, incredible blunting his blow!  Greg pulled his arm back, but Laura only jerked forward a few inches, holding firmly onto his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always thought you were the strongest, that you could flex up your muscles so much bigger than mine.  Did it ever occur to you that maybe, just maybe I was holding back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s anger was only growing as he twisted his body to gain more leverage in an attempt to pull his arm away from Laura.  His anger soon turned to pain as Laura gave his fist a hard squeeze, crackling his bones and sending him down to one knee.  Laura smirked as she looked down at Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose records of yours, that one ton bench press.  That\u2019s just a warm up for me now.  I can bench over twice that!  For reps!  That\u2019s right tough guy, your little sister can bench well over two tons!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked up with pain etched across his face, shocked that she could make that boast, but his broken hand indicating that it must be true.  Laura smiled at his pained expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you think those muscles are big?  What do you think happens when I flex down hard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled up her right arm and the muscled started pumping larger, slowly at first and then with an eerie sound of stressed rubber, even quicker.  Her already overtly large 30 inch biceps added enough mass to push her arm passed 35 inches, then passed 40.  The sound intensified as her bicep climbed higher, piling incredibly detailed muscles across her arm in a frightening display of muscle expansion that was soon eclipsing Greg\u2019s incredible show.  As her arm reached 50 incredible inches around, the peak neared the top of her fist but to Greg\u2019s horror was still climbing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think your muscles can expand to gigantic levels?  You haven\u2019t SEEN expansion Greg!  I\u2019ll show you what a real WOMAN can do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pumped her widening forearm up and down, adding more and more muscle to her overloaded bicep and as Greg looked up, the peak now towered over her clenched fist and pushed her forearm to vertical and even a little back!  Her bicep was approaching 70 monolithic inches around!  The front bicep pushed outward as big as a distended basketball, while the deep split showcased the back bicep building up higher with crazy feathered muscle fibers pulsing and throbbing and growing and surging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Greg, look at my muscles!  I can flex them even larger!  And when they grow this big, I can curl a ton with each arm!  That\u2019s right Greg; I can curl your best bench press with one arm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pushed his hand away and Greg fell back on his behind as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had struggled to recover from the incredible blow Laura had leveled on him and struggled to sit up.  He willed himself up through the pain and stumbled toward the hole in the wall he had created, gripping the sides to see Laura flex up the biggest bicep he could have ever imagined.  Laura noticed him and released her mind bending flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow are you two ready to stop this crap or do I need to get rough?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa pushed open the door quickly and with a loud crunch the doorknob was destroyed in her feminine hand.  Vanessa scowled at Jason and Greg and narrowed her eyes at the group of women huddled in two corners of the large room.  Vanessa absently ripped the doorknob off the door and tossed it to the tiled floor where it bounced hard with a metallic ping followed by several softer pings as it rolled to the side.  Jason and Greg watched the ruined doorknob come to a rest and then they both looked back at Vanessa.  Jason then glanced over at Greg to make sure Greg had backed off since he was about to try and punch him in the head.  Jason was a bit surprised that Greg, the biggest, strongest man on earth as far as anyone knew, looked concerned.  As Jason stood upright and relaxed for the moment he focused his attention back on Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say she was muscular didn\u2019t do her justice; to say she was drop dead sexy meant redefining the term.  The fact that she was in a similar, business casual outfit wasn\u2019t that surprising, seeing as that\u2019s what Greg had been dressed in.  Even the white long sleeve blouse and khaki pants she was wearing stretched across her body like a second skin wasn\u2019t a shock.  But the crazy part was that she was sporting the same, massive muscles as her brother, but with generous feminine curves that were enough to start sending blood toward his nether regions.  Vanessa\u2019s long blonde hair was thick and neatly done, hanging around her broad shoulders with super model waves.  Her face was lightly made up, as her natural features and skin tone already made her gorgeous beyond words.  Only her expression wasn\u2019t sexy, it was perturbed.  She placed her slim, manicured hands on her comparably narrow, super muscular waist and cocked one hip out the side as she raised her right foot up on her the toes of her tan flats and turned to look at Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it Greg.  You were supposed to be at the gym already.  Instead you\u2019re chasing after these muscle lusting bimbo\u2019s, destroying another custom made outfit and picking a fight with\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason saw Vanessa\u2019s expression soften slightly and then change to wry smile as if she had just figured something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason, who appears to have grown quite large.  Of course not as large as you dear brother, but I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s stronger than you suspected.  Maybe even stronger than you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason frowned.  Not only was Vanessa not surprised that he was this large, but she somehow had some insight into his true strength.  Jason turned back to look at Greg\u2019s expression grow harsh once again.  Greg spat out with frustration and anger as his massive muscles tensed and rolled like the Hulk when he was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you know?  I was about to teach him what messing with the strongest man on earth would get him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found Vanessa\u2019s amused smile a bit disturbing.  The feeling only intensified as Vanessa flexed her upper body and the skin hugging top thinned out even more as her intense, bulging muscles expanded, showcasing detail to shame a contest ready male bodybuilder and enough size to make him run away.  Her chest pushed forward as a thick shelf of bulging, rippling pectorals pressed her gravity defying breasts hard against the material without causing those juicy tits to dimple in response.  Her nipples expanded as well, no longer hidden by the thick material, which also made Jason realize that she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra.  The sleeves of her blouse moved up her forearms a bit as the muscles across her arms expanded into hard, thick balls of fury making Jason wonder if she wasn\u2019t already as muscular as he was.  Glancing at his own massive arm he licked his lips as he thought that perhaps she had already surpassed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason remembered that Vanessa had always been fit, and that she had maintained her fitness level even after high school.  But he had to wonder what was going on.  He hadn\u2019t made any changes to Vanessa on the phone.  How did this fit in with what he had done?  Had she started to grow bigger and stronger when he did?  If so, where did she start at?  And even if she did, how would she compare to Greg?  And what about Laura?  Shaking his head, Jason took a step back as Vanessa continued to pulse her muscles as she stared down her much bigger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Greg, your world records are all well documented.  You are clearly the strongest MAN on earth.  But haven\u2019t you noticed that I\u2019ve, well, grown quite larger lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s anger was back to being mixed with some confusion.  Jason could tell that Greg didn\u2019t like the situation and he clearly wasn\u2019t used to being challenged.  First by him, and now by his sister.  Greg glanced at Jason, and then grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I mean you always had a female bodybuilder figure, but now, well you\u2019re just\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggled.  \u201cHuge, gigantic, monstrous?  You don\u2019t know that half of it.  While you work out during the morning and work during the day, I work during the day and work out at night.  So you haven\u2019t really paid attention to what\u2019s been happening the last few days have you?  You didn\u2019t notice my huge strength spike the day Laura tossed Jason out of the house.  And you haven\u2019t paid any attention to my surging physique either?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg grunted, unable to understand the strange goings on around him.  Jason had some kind of idea and for some reason, it only made him mad.  How dare Vanessa burst in here as he was about to take out Greg in front of his girls?  So without much thought about the consequences Jason growled his own response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares?  Greg and I were about to settle things, why don\u2019t you just leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa turned her head toward Jason, holding her smile.  Her beautiful blue eyes then lit up and she licked her ruby lips as Greg growled his concurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the two of you tough guys want me leave so you can settle things huh?  Well I\u2019ll tell you what.  How about a test of strength?  The two of you against me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed, thinking she was crazy, but spat out a quick \u201cFine\u201d.  Greg did the same and Vanessa stepped further into the room and brought her thick, muscle bulging arms up into the air, reaching out toward each man.  She kicked off her flats, and standing tall at 5 foot 10, didn\u2019t give up much height to either man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head.  Was she crazy?  The ultimate test of strength against both of them?  In the back of his head, Jason thought about what had been happening to him.  In this reality he was really strong with his original, slim body.  Then he slowly began to add the muscles he had programmed into Laura\u2019s phone, growing stronger all the while.  Greg was bigger in this dimension and somehow had the expansion abilities he had given Laura to a seemingly higher degree.  Only Greg apparently had grown this big over years.  In this reality Vanessa wasn\u2019t the same either.  She was apparently a bodybuilder, although he didn\u2019t know how big she was originally.  He also had no idea if or to what degree she had the expansion ability, although by her quick chest growth, he assumed she had some.  But unlike Greg, Vanessa had apparently grown bigger and stronger the last few days, just like him.  He now wished he had done more research.  But as he reached up with his right hand to lock into Vanessa\u2019s left and Greg did the same to Vanessa\u2019s right, he lost himself in his anger, forgetting about what all of this might mean.  After all, he was stronger than Greg, he had to be stronger than Vanessa.  And the two of them together would be more than she could handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then..  As he squeezed down and he glanced over to see Greg do the same he quickly found that Vanessa wasn\u2019t backing down, she wasn\u2019t buckling under, she was\u2026. Moaning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, give it to me hard boys.  Make me feel your strength.  Squeeze me for all your worth.  Use both hands.  Drive to me to the ground with your massive, manly strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and the purred.  \u201cIf you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted as it was clear that even as he applied all of his strength that Vanessa was matching it.  And by the way she was talking, it was turning her on!  He could hear Greg grunt as he was apparently pushing with all he had as well!  He could also here the expansion of muscle sinews and the stretching of material and the popping of threads.  Looking at Vanessa her face looked flush, not from exertion, but from\u2026 excitement?  Her eyes were closed as she was apparently reveling in the powerful feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes!  Press harder boys; give me all you\u2019ve got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as both large men did as she requested their arms began to shake with exertion, but to their growing frustration they weren\u2019t able to make any headway.  Vanessa was holding them firm!  As Jason looked up Vanessa\u2019s arms he could see the muscles now rolling across her forearms, triceps and biceps, splitting the material of her blouse, bulging to obscene, yet achingly sexy proportions as they approached the size of Greg\u2019s massive guns.  And then with another wry smile across her face, Vanessa opened her eyes and her gaze turned lustful and commanding as she announced.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMy turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing one foot back, she leaned forward and began to apply pressure to both men, causing all her muscles to expand forward with destructive results and to slowly drive both men to the one knee!  Jason grunted with pain and Greg growled like a wounded animal as Vanessa was easily overcoming the two strongest men on the planet.  Jason yelped as he could feel his wrist bend back further than it should and all of his formidable muscles yield to the Supergirl before him.  Her clothes shredded from her monstrous physique and fell to the ground around them, exposing her naked, Hulk like muscles as they expanded and pulsed to new levels of massiveness.  Vanessa looked down at both men and now laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right boys, kneel before your mistress.  Bow before my strength, yield to my power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward further, Vanessa amped up the pressure, driving both men further toward the ground, cracking bones and tearing ligaments as they now screamed in agony.  Greg pulled his free hand away and started punching Vanessa in the stomach in an attempt to stop her.  Each punch landed with a dull thud against Vanessa\u2019s narrow, cobblestone abs of steel, bouncing away harmlessly even as Vanessa purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s right Greg.  Hit me harder.  Let\u2019s see what all the fuss is about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg hit her as hard as he could and the loud thud and grunt from Greg only indicated how useless his punches now were.  Jason reached out and punched her in inviting breast, but was amazed that his fist barely sunk in at all, and to his chagrin didn\u2019t seem to bother Vanessa at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good one Jason.  That felt wonderful.  Do it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were running down Jason\u2019s face and he was no longer thinking very clearly, but desperation caused him to try again.  Vanessa tensed her upper body and her pecs exploded outward with frightening size and definition into a twelve inch shelf of striated power, pushing her massive tits outward and infusing them with overwhelming power and strength, causing her nipples to grow to the size of bullets from her advancing excitement.  As Jason connected with a punch it was like hitting a wrecking ball and his fist bounced off, sending a shock wave of pain down his arm toward his shoulder.  Jason hung his head in defeat as Vanessa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve proven my point to you two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing down, she released her death grip and both men fell to the ground, gripping their damaged hands.  Vanessa reached down and grabbing Greg by the throat lifted him up high with one arm until his feet dangled above the ground.  He struggled a bit as his face started to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow dear brother I strongly suggest you get your ass to work before I get angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling menacingly up into the now fearful eyes of her brother, she chuckled.  \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, even in his pained, humiliated state was turned on by not just her massive muscles, gorgeous looks and incredible strength feat, but by the 70\u2019s Hulk TV reference as well.  Vanessa looked around at the other women in various states of confusion, fear and lust.  Knowing she could likely steal these girls away from both men if she so desired, Vanessa hummed with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the rest of you women can make sure Greg gets to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa set Greg down on his feet as he gasped for breath, gave Vanessa a fearful and shocked look and turned toward the door, not willing to even say a word in defiance.  The other girls all marched toward the door as well, looking at Jason with sad eyes, but like Greg, wordlessly complied.  Jason looked at the door as they filed out and then back up at Vanessa, who looked down at him with a dominatrix smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Jason, that just leaves you and me.  Whatever shall we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stepped forward, reaching one foot out and pressing against Jason\u2019s chest, easily pushed him flat on his back.  Placing her hands on her hips Vanessa licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa stepped forward, reaching one foot out and pressing against Jason\u2019s chest, easily pushing him flat on his back. She had to lean forward, bending at the hips, to see around her protruding pectorals and meet Jason's eyes. Placing her hands on her hips Vanessa licked her lips and smiled with an allure that melted Jason's spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should discuss how this happened,\" she said. She tightened her toes and began applying pressure to Jason's chest driving the breath from his lungs. Jason didn't know how much pure force Vanessa was exerting on him, but he was certain that without the super strong layer of muscle in his chest he would have been crushed to bits. Moments later he could hear the hard tile beneath him cracking from Vanessa's increased pressing. \"And you're going to tell me everything, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to speak his agreement but there was no air left in him so he nodded his head vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" Vanessa purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt the stupendous weight lifted from his chest, though Vanessa's foot remained in place on his sternum. He took a huge gulp of air and looked up at the muscle goddess above him. He still felt a strange and deep well of rage in the back of his mind, the same that had been there since the night Laura had thrown him out on his ass, but something about Vanessa, the way she was looking at him, and her stupendous body pushed his anger back and left an overwhelming sense of lust in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout really realizing he was doing it Jason placed his hand on Vanessa's relatively dainty foot and began sliding it up her leg. He passed her slender ankle and arrived at the swollen calf muscle that lived beneath her smooth skin. He gave her calf a hard squeeze and shivered with excitement over how hard it felt. It was difficult to say for sure since he was still growing, but he was pretty sure her calves were larger than his own by a few inches. The muscle in his hand was almost cartoonish in its girth and Jason rubbed and squeezed it while his penis hardened in his tight shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa moaned clearly turned on my Jason's muscle worship. \"Do you love my big strong muscles, little man?\" she asked, playing up the dominatrix role. \"They can get soooo much bigger, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt a rumbling under his fingers which was followed by Vanessa's entire leg, and only her leg, expanding with more and more muscle. Jason held tight to Vanessa's calf which was blowing up like a balloon and yet feeling more and more solid all the time. It seemed her thin layer of skin was stretched over diamond. Within seconds Vanessa thigh was over two feet across and her calf muscle was as big around as a basketball. Her freaky expansion stopped and she ran her dainty fingers over the hills and through the grooves of her quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So big,\" Vanessa said and moaned. \"And I can still go so much bigger. If you're a good little boy and you do as you're told I might just show you what I'm really made of.\" She gripped large chunks of thigh muscle in both of her hands and growled with excitement over her own size. Then she took a deep breath and calmed herself. \"But not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's leg quickly receded to its former size and she turned towards the bar that Greg had smashed in a rage mere minutes ago. \"I feel like a drink,\" she said then looked over her shoulder. \"Do you want anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got to his feet and saw that there was a series of cracks that outlined his shoulders, arms, and back in the dining room tile and a depression where his body had been. \"Um... No thank you.\" He turned his attention to the fully nude Vanessa who was strutting around as if she were alone in her own home, not with a casual acquaintance in a strangers house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" she asked vanishing behind the bar. \"I don't think my idiot brother destroyed everything in here. She stood up holding a few undamaged bottles of liquor. \"Last chance....\" She spoke with a sing-songy voice while she held a large, unopened bottle of vodka in the valley between her bulbous breasts and pulsing pectorals. She glowed with a huge smile and shot Jason a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later.\" Jason was feeling so much confusion. Vanessa had dropped the dominatrix angle and now seemed to be playing sexy hostess instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shrugged. \"Suit yourself,\" she said then undid the top and took a long swig of vodka. When she finished Jason noticed that a third of the bottle was gone. Vanessa began to walk back around the bar, then paused and grabbed a second bottle. She strode past Jason and moved toward the sliding glass door that lead to the pool deck. \"Come on, sexy, let's take a dip in the pool while we chat. Oh, and lose your clothes. I want to see the whole package.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of the confidence Jason had possessed the previous day was gone, but he dare not disobey. He followed Vanessa outside to the pool area stripping off his over tight clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took a second gulp of vodka then set both bottles down at poolside. Jason noticed the one she drank from was more than half gone already. She glanced back over her shoulder at Jason taking in his naked form and grinning. Then she made her way to the steps that led into the blue water. She entered the pool until she was waist deep; the water must have been cool because goosebumps by the tens of thousands broke out across her shoulders and arms. Vanessa shivered and ran her fingers up the outside of her right arm feeling the tiny bumps and playing with the giant horseshoe that made her triceps. \"Ooooh, that feels nice. Come on in and join me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason did as be was told. He found it odd that less than a day ago he was skinny-dipping in the very same pool with Lilly only then he had been the dominant one. Now he was no where near in charge, this was all Vanessa's game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason waded out until he was chest deep and Vanessa joined him. She put her hands on his shoulders and moved them down his chest to his stomach, her fingers tracing the sinewy grooves all the way. \"I have to say, this is a really good look for you. Let me see your guns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Vanessa's ever changing mood Jason was a bit reluctant but still had enough pride in his physique that he held his arms up and hit a powerful double biceps pose. This morning he'd guessed his arms were 26 inches around, now he believed his slow, continuous growth had added enough muscle to put on two or three inches more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa licked her lips and gripped his towering peaks giving each a gentle squeeze. \"Yes, those are very nice. What do you think of mine?\" She mirrored his pose and, to Jason's surprise their muscles were closer in size than he had thought, so long as she wasn't using her freaky expansion ability. Vanessa pushed her chest right up against Jason's so she could get her arm close to his. She had him beat, but only by an inch or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're amazing.\" Jason said. He was beginning to feel more at ease with this superpowered beauty, perhaps she wasn't so dangerous after all. That is, she was clearly stronger than him by a long shot, but she wasn't the terror he originally thought her to be. Emboldened he asked, \"May I touch them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sexy smile warmed Vanessa's face. \"Please do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason groped Vanessa's 30 inch arms from every angle still marveling over how hard her muscles were, like living steel. As he did she began to moan once more. She pressed her body against his grinding her pelvis against the hardness of his 8 inch cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little sad that this muscle didn't grow as well,\" Vanessa said placing herself atop Jason's rigid penis so the shaft laid across the pulsing heat of her vagina. \"Good thing it's always been pretty big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused for a moment wondering just how she would have known that. His slight hesitation was just enough to open a window for Vanessa to back away and swim to the wall where her liquor bottles waited. Jason was in a lusty frenzy, he wanted to just take Vanessa but he knew she wasn't like the girls he'd been with the past two days; one misstep and Vanessa would crush him like an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hulking woman grabbed the half full bottle and downed the remaining vodka in seconds as if it were water. Then she studied the empty container for a second before cocking her arm back and throwing the bottle in the direction of the sea. Jason watched as her empty sailed up easily clearing the several hundred yards of sand then vanishing out over the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supergirl,\" Jason mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Vanessa asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hadn't realized he'd spoken aloud and for a moment his heart stopped. \"I uh... I said Supergirl. You're like a super buff version of Supergirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby, super doesn't even begin to describe what I am. You, you're super. I'm something else all together.\" Vanessa opened the second bottle of vodka and sucked down half its contents in one go. Then she looked at it and shook her head. \"Nothing, not even a buzz.\" She set the bottle back then, with an effortless kick, glided back across the width of the pool to where Jason was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa opened her beefy legs and wrapped them around Jason's waist, then she slid her massive arms under his and hugged him tightly. She put her mouth to his ear, her breath was hot on the wet skin of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa whispered into Jason's ear, \"Now is the time when you tell me how you went from scrawny to bulging in just two days. I want to know everything.\" She slipped her lips around Jason's ear lobe and gave a suck that sent chills down Jason's spine. \"You're going to tell me the truth or I'll just squeeze it out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Vanessa's arms tightened around Jason's torso while her legs clamped down around his middle. She drove the air from his lungs and crunched his pelvis with an ease that spoke of untold power. Jason was reminded of the time half an hour earlier when Vanessa had crushed and maimed his hand and wrist like nothing and he became very afraid. This girl was unstable. One minute she was all over him as though she loved him, then she wanted to brutalize and humiliate him. She loved the way he worshiped her muscles and was turned on by his own, but her power also seemed to be too much for her to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt he had no choice but to tell her what had actually happened to him, lest she make good on her promise to crush him to paste, but what if she didn't believe him? Worse: what if the strange app that made him what he was fell into her hands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Jason hollered with the last remaining bubble of air in his lungs. Vanessa loosened her grip and resumed sucking on Jason's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" she said as she moved down and began kissing and sucking on his neck. Her hands were moving all over his back and sides exploring his massive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the fact that one of the most beautiful girls Jason had ever known, a girl he'd had a crush on for years, had somehow developed the most incredible physique that could expand to hulk-like proportions at will was rubbing her naked body all over his own Jason did his best to not be distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"There's a lot I don't understand myself,\" he said. \"But it all started the day before yesterday...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"There's a lot I don't understand myself,\" he said. \"But it all started the day before yesterday when I went over to hang out with Laura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa choked back a laugh. \"Hang out with Laura? Why would she have anything to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'm from another universe or I created this one, or, I don't know. My whole life I've been best friends with Laura, and she was the same as me, a skinny nerd and social outcast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Vanessa's eyebrows lifted. \"Laura a skinny nerd? I would pay money to see that. Ok, Mr. Muscles, you have my attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason proceeded to tell her everything. He told her about finding Laura's iPhone and the strange app, about growing enormous muscles then changing Laura and ruining everything. When Jason described the changes he'd made for Laura, including the ability to expand her musculature at will, Vanessa's eyebrows raised but she didn't interrupt his story. Jason went on to describe being thrown out by the new improved Laura and beating Brad to a pulp (which made Vanessa grin in an interesting way) which led to his arrest and discovery of his enhanced strength. He told her of his excitement over discovering his own muscles growing which also seemed to be making his already superhuman strength grow too. Vanessa laughed when Jason told her about dismissing the redheaded Nikki for the busty blond bombshell Gina and even seemed very interested in a detailed description of Jason's sexual escapades, as he gave his account of events Vanessa's breathing became heavier and it looked as though her hand was rubbing at her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So right after I beat your brother at arm wrestling he got pretty pissed and that's when you came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's nipples stood tall and hard like bullets atop her melon sized breasts. She purred with excitement and proceeded to finger herself harder and faster. Jason could feel a mild current forming from the back and forth motion of her hand at her vagina. She shut her eyes tight and bit her lower lip as she came; Jason saw Vanessa's muscles pulse outward for a brief moment before returning again to their new normal size. Finally Vanessa exhaled slowly, her mouth in an \"O\" shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buff beauty then spoke as if the conversation never paused, \"You have no idea how angry Greg was that you beat him. He actually a lot stronger than he lets on, that way he can keep 'making gains' even after he eventually plateaus. His size and strength are his pride, his everything, and you beat him. That's so delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could point out that Vanessa had beaten Greg even more severely the muscled beauty used her monstrous legs to leap out of the pool and onto the deck. She walked toward the large glass door and vanished inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason slumped against the wall and let the water rise to his chin. He didn't know what he was going to do about Vanessa. Could he just ask her why she was acting so strangely? Would that set her off and cause her to pummel him into oblivion? Should he just try to placate her until she left him alone then flee the state?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa returned carrying her torn pants. She was fishing in the pocket and Jason's stomach sank when she pulled out an iPhone. She unlocked the phone and began tapping away at the screen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa shook her thick blonde hair and ran her fingers through with one hand as she used her other hand to play with the phone.  She walked toward the pool and sitting down on a lounge chair, placed the phone on a table next to her and tossed her ruined pants on the ground.  She peered over at Jason and smiled as she could sense his fear rising when she was playing with the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on up and sit next to me Jason, I want to share with you a few things now that I know your story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason reluctantly complied, doing his best to shake the water off his naked body as a slight chill ran down his spine.  Forcing a smile he sat down and looked into her gorgeous, dominating eyes.  Vanessa smirked as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was always pretty strong myself.  Not nearly as strong as Greg of course, but not as far off Laura as most people thought.  And I did have a similar expansion ability, but again, mine wasn\u2019t anywhere on par with Greg or Laura.  However, working at the gym kept me in pretty good shape and having recently won a bikini contest I was training for an upcoming fitness competition.  But then the day before yesterday, the same time you came into this\u2026\u201d  She looked at Jason who sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUniverse or reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded and giggled at the idea.  \u201cI was at the gym closing things up and decided to get in a quick work-out.  And to my surprise I was surpassing my best lifts at every turn.  And the more I continued to lift, the stronger I grew.  It was exciting, orgasmic even.  Suddenly having that much strength, that much power\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could sense her excitement increase as she momentarily paused and her muscles rolled across her body, expanding slightly under her flawless skin and jumping out with imposing size and definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd my endurance was incredible as well.  I lifted for hours, hitting every muscle group until there simply wasn\u2019t enough weight left to tax my muscles.  I was thrilled beyond words.  I had gone from pretty strong to stronger than Laura to stronger than Greg to seemingly impossibly strong in a matter of hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled as she pulled in a breath, pushing her gravity defying super breasts out several inches against striated pectorals that bulged overtly outward as well, providing an erection inducing super chest bigger and sexier than any comic book hero Jason had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo as I was about to leave I stopped in front of the mirror to hit a few poses.  My muscles hadn\u2019t grown much bigger yet, just like you explained, but the pump from the workout definitely made them look harder.  As I flexed my muscles I could feel the untapped power roar within them.  And then when I activated my expansion ability\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason swallowed as Vanessa shivered with excitement, narrowed her sexy eyes, and reaching out with her right hand, tweaked her bullet nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say that there weren\u2019t any records left that night that didn\u2019t belong to me.  I left Laura\u2019s and Greg\u2019s expansion percentages in the dust.  And when my muscles grew larger, they grew harder and more defined as well.  I actually grew even stronger as I flexed by muscles to devastating proportions!  I had wanted Greg to be there, just to see his reaction.  But as I came off the high and left I needed to understand things before showing off to anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa chuckled as Jason surmised that her recent exploits finally got the reaction from Greg she had desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as if that one night wasn\u2019t enough, things continued to change.  My muscles, even in their relaxed start were growing bigger, slowly but continuously.  I tried to hide it as best I could, unsure of where it was all heading or why it was occurring.  It was then that I started hearing about you and your exploits.  I would have written them off as crazy rumors if I hadn\u2019t been experiencing similar changes.  By the next night at the gym I had to put every plate on several bars and bend the bars together just to have enough weight get a small pump.  I gave up and headed toward the old warehouses down the coast.  I found things heavy enough to get a decent workout.  My muscles had grown bigger as well and my expansion ability was, well, beyond anyone\u2019s imagination.  That little trick with my leg I gave you was just a taste of where I was at yesterday.  Just imagine where I\u2019m at now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa grinned like a crazed super villain, causing Jason to shift uncomfortably.  Vanessa laughed as she stared Jason down until he glanced away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I made sure to keep track of you, texting those you came into contact with, asking around.  Waking up this morning I laughed at how much bigger my muscles had grown.  I knew I was stronger as well.  None of it really made any sense until Alicia texted me and I rushed over here.  I ran actually, several miles in less than a minute.  I\u2019m surprised my outfit held up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stood back up, casting a menacing shadow over Jason, whose emotions were back to being mixed.  It was clear to him that his barely contained rage and lust appeared to be amplified in Vanessa, although he surmised that she had no reason to be angry anymore.  Smiling down dominantly, Vanessa flexed her arms at her sides and the muscles leapt forward, pressing out to intimidating size and definition with just a minor flex.  Her large legs visually pulsed with imposing strength and size, her abs bristled as the muscles rolled across her narrow midsection with each breath.  Vanessa flexed her back and her lats spread out wide, then wider with a seeming casual flex.  Her mighty chest surged forward, pulling his eyes toward twin volleyball sized tits of power.  Jason shivered from lust and fear as much as from a quick chill.  Vanessa looked at him with seductive eyes, cocking one hip out and causing her right thigh to bulge out into separated slabs of she-muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if everything you\u2019ve told me is true, you haven\u2019t finished growing.  Which means that I haven\u2019t finished growing either.  And I think we both know that means growing in both size and strength.  If you were telling me the truth, your arms alone have another 3 or 4 inches more to expand.  Just think how much additional strength that will mean as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s eyes lit up as her scary smile reappeared on her angelic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s pulse picked up as he thought about that.  He had figured that he would reach his programmed size by tonight.  Tomorrow morning at the latest.  Now those happy thoughts turned toward near dread at the fact that his gains would be amplified into Vanessa.  She was already ridiculously powerful.  And if his arms would grow to 32 incredible inches around, hers would be at least 36 without any additional expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Vanessa reached down to pick up her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve shared our experiences, you need to tell me about this ap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped.  Vanessa was already nearly unstable with the power building in her, what more havoc could she unleash with full control?  But if he didn\u2019t give her what she wanted then she had no trouble crushing his body to dust.  However, if she had access to the ap, maybe he could change himself as well, or even fix things.  As Vanessa\u2019s eyes narrowed and her muscles began to pump larger, Jason slumped his shoulders and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ap is called Alterations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa lit up and started tapping on her phone.  After a few moments she stopped and looked at Jason.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly all the tiredness Jason had been feeling swept out of his body. He gripped the door handle and surveyed the interior of the gym. The place was entirely deserted aside from the 4 jocks in the back near the free weights and the receptionist at the front desk. Anger was once again brewing in Jason's gut; these guys had tormented Jason all through high school and simply because they felt they could, because they were stronger. Now he was stronger and it was time to dish out some justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason realized that his fingers were gripping the door handle so tight that his fingers were leaving grooves in the metal. He grinned to himself. He couldn't be sure but it felt like he was getting stronger all the time. Perhaps he was just becoming more aware of his strength, recognizing the feel in his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason entered the gym and approached the receptionist, a gorgeous brunette with an amazing body. She was engrossed in a muscle magazine and didn't even notice he was there so Jason slowly slipped past her. As he did he noticed that she was staring lustfully at the photos of insanely beefy and pumped up men and that her cheeks and neck were flushed while her nipples were poking through the extra tight polo shirt that must have been her uniform. Jason chuckled and moved on, his eyes on his targets and his anger returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis former bullies were taking a break between sets and chatting with each other. John Brooks was closest and had his back turned. John was on the local college football team along with Brad and the Moore twins who were standing to John's left. Kevin and Kyle Moore both played linebacker positions and were giants. They each a inch or two taller than John's 6' 2\" and weighed around 250 pounds. The most intimidating of the four, though, was Clark King who used to play football with the rest but had given it up because of his height and decided to take up bodybuilding instead. In spite of his short stature Clark's 5' 6\" body was bursting with muscle and he outweighed his friends by a fair margin. Clark's physique was Olympia ready and tipped the scales at 285 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason approached it was Kevin Moore who spotted him first. He tapped John on the shoulder and the four jocks turned to face Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys,\" Jason said smiling. He really didn't know what to expect and his only plan was to let his strength guide him through this. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's face curled into a snarl. \"You're the little prick that came at Brad with a baseball bat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everyone keep saying that?\" Jason said a bit exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering his question John nodded to Kyle who charged Jason with his twin brother at his side. The two enormous jocks moved toward Jason with crazy speed and Jason suddenly thought he'd made a huge mistake. Kyle and Kevin grabbed each of Jason's arms and shoved him over toward John. Jason feigned a fight but was quickly reassured, these giant men were exerting great pressure on him but he was certain he could toss them off him with ease. Now he'd just wait for the right moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't have to wait long because John and Clark shared a look after which Clark said, \"You go first, there won't be anything left when I'm done.\" To drive his point home Clark flexed his huge 22 inch arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn took a step toward Jason, \"This is for Brad you son of a bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John cocked his arm back Jason delivered a kick to his stomach that sent him flying through the air hitting a mirror 20 feet away. Glass fragments shattered and fell around his huddled body causing a hundred small cuts all over his back, legs and arms. Next Jason quickly freed his arms from each of the Moore twins then grabbed them by their throats and lifted them into the air handling their combined 500 pounds with ease. Once quick shove to either side and each of the twins were launched in either direction. Kevin crashed into the metal frame of a squat machine while Kyle crashed through the drywall that separated the locker room from the main gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Clark's turn. He rushed Jason with his arm back ready to deliver a huge blow to Jason's chest. Deciding he wanted to see what would happen Jason stood his ground and tensed his thin pecs. Clark's blow landed hard but the big man felt every bit of it as the bones in his hand shattered. Jason barely felt anything but Clark screamed and nursed his limp hand agains his massive chest. He backed up to the broken mirror where John was now back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the problem with this town,\" Jason said, \"too many jocks. You've all gotten it in your heads that picking on the little guy is okay. All four of you have made my life hell but that was all fine and dandy because you were bigger and stronger. Well, who's stronger now?\" Jason turned to the bench press rack to his right and shoved the numerous plates off the bar. Picking up the bar alone he placed his hands wide apart and began attempting to move his hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason instantly regretted this display of power as the reenforced steel held steady even against his vastly enhanced strength. He was just about to give up when he saw the expression on Clark and John's faces, their eyes went wide and their mouths dropped open. Clearly something was happening so Jason glanced down. His shirt, still bloodstained, was stretched taut over large pectoral muscles and expanded shoulders. His formerly twig-like arms were now pumped with sinew and still expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>MY MUSCLES! THEY'RE BACK!!</i> Jason had to restrain himself from betraying his cool exterior with his giddy inner-monologue and just managed. The sight of his expanding physique caused him to redouble his efforts to bend the bar and when he did his body only grew faster. Now his shirt was ripping apart revealing muscles that rivaled Clark's but much, much stronger and getting stronger by the second. As his shirt fell to the floor in rags the bar in his hands began to groan, moments later it began to bend, slowly at first then faster until the two ends touched. Jason tossed the ruined metal to the floor at Clark and John's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I get to be bigger, too.\" He said hoping to make his expansion sound planned. He could tell that even though he hadn't been working his legs they had grown right along with the rest of him and now his pants were primed to explode off of his thighs. Deciding he wasn't going to fit in the pants anymore anyway Jason gave his legs a quick flex causing a series of rips to open and his beefy quads expanded outward in all directions like sausage freed from its casing. Jason pulled off strips of denim until he was wearing a pair of cut off shorts. The look was silly but with a body like his no one would ever dare tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took another bench press bar and unloaded the weights. He approached Clark and John who were frozen in place. With a sneer Jason bent the bar (this one with ease) and wrapped it around the bullies' necks bounding them together and leaving them sobbing on the floor. Before he turned to leave Jason regarded Clark's muscles and noted with satisfaction that his own were bigger. He still wasn't back to the full size he'd programmed for himself with that strange iPhone app but he had likely crested the 300 pound mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if I'll make it back to my 370 pound body? Do I have to exert myself more to get bigger?</i> A million other questions ran through Jason's mind but they would have to wait. No doubt the receptionist had called the cops and made a run for it. When Jason turned to leave, however, he found that she was actually still there. She had stepped out from behind the counter and stared with a look that was a mix of terror and lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason approached her putting on the most friendly smile he could. His eyes roamed her body taking in her generous curves. Along with the tight polo shirt she wore tiny shorts that showed off her long and toned legs. Jason quickly decided he wanted her; knowing her love of big muscles he would put his new body to the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was still 10 feet away he stopped. \"I just wanted to say I'm sorry about all this. I know you may not know it, but those guys were pretty terrible human beings. They all got what was coming to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, not afraid but still cautious. Good god this woman was pretty. Her angelic face was makeup free (she didn't need it) and framed with waves of chestnut hair. Her hazel eyes had a glow to them and her lips were full and looked like they wanted to smile, she just needed to be sure it was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a few more steps toward her. \"I'm Jason, by the way.\" He held his hand out slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... a.a.a.. Amy.\" She shook his hand and her eyes were glued to his arm. Her breasts, easily a D cup, probably larger, were packed into her work shirt and he could see her nipples harden just like earlier when she was reading her magazine which caused Jason to smile even more. \"How did... um.. how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" To be honest I don't really know. Pretty cool though, right?\" Jason raised his free hand and flexed a bicep that eclipsed Clark's by a good 2 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Amy said then put her hand to her mouth as if she had said too much or been too honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled, \"Look I want to make this up to you. I want to take you to dinner, if you'll let me. After what happened here I'll understand if you don't.\" He went around her to the front desk and scribbled his phone number on a piece of paper. \"Here, call me if you're interested. If not then no hard feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took the paper and stuffed it in her pocket just as the sound of sirens began to grow in the distance. Amy looked like she wanted to shrivel up and vanish. \"I'm sorry,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \"No problem, I'll just slip out the back door.\" He began jogging toward the rear of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! There is no back door,\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shot her a wink. \"I'll make my own.\" He entered the locker room and passed by Kyle's unconscious body and punched a hole through the rear brick wall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was feeling amazing. He had given the police the slip at the gym and was now walking down the beach in nothing but his modified shorts. As he walked he flexed his massive muscles for the amusement of everyone around him. There were tons of things that didn't make any sense to him but the fact was that he didn't really care what was going on. He was a superhuman powerhouse with expandable muscles, it was a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer to his own home Jason left the beach and went around to the front of the houses hoping that as he passed Laura's house she would get a look at him and what he had become. Perhaps even Vanessa would see his new body and come running to find out who he was, Jason knew that girl was obsessed with bodybuilders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason passed Laura's house with no incident which disappointed him a little. Disappointment turned to frustration when Jason spotted his own house and the pair of police cars parked out front. He sighed. He wondered if this was fallout from the gym fight already of if they were looking for their escaped prisoner. Either way he wasn't afraid of anything they could do to him, he could take on the entire police force alone. And if he needed to his body would just grow bigger and stronger, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason approached his home slowly until he realized that both cop cars were empty. The officers must be inside with his mother and sister, Jason decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should send them a message to leave me alone,\" he told himself. Of course he knew that more provocation would only make them less likely to lose interest in him, but he had an idea in his mind of something that he just had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason quickly and quietly approached one of the squad cars. He looked up and down to street and saw no one else around, not that witnesses would be a huge problem, but he wanted a little privacy if possible. Then Jason reached down under the front bumper of the car and grabbed the frame. He was able to lift the front end up without too much trouble but once he tried to get the 2 and a half ton vehicle off the ground Jason found the going was much tougher. Just like earlier, though, Jason could feel his body swelling and his strength exploding to match the effort. Moments later Jason carried more muscle mass than any bodybuilder in history and held the car over his head with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed the car up and down several times, each time it was lighter and lighter. \"This feels amazing,\" Jason practically roared. Then, wanting even more power he held the car aloft with just a single hand. Once more his body exploded with additional size and while he struggled to hold the car up at first it very quickly became light as a feather. He flexed his free arm and laughed with glee as his arm swelled to well over 30 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I'm bigger now than I was when I grew myself with the app. I don't know why I would be but at this point I don't even care.\" He pumped his arm a few times and watched as even more size poured in. \"Now let's put these babies to some use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gripped the front end of the car and swung it like a mallet bringing it down on top of the other parked car. The crash sound was deafening and both cars flattened like pancakes. Laughing loudly Jason crouched down, flexed his leg muscles, the leapt away before anyone could exit their homes to see what was going on. He flew through the air like a missile landing on the beach a half a mile away. He was a few hundred feet from the pier so he used a more controlled jump and landed on the concrete structure a few feet from a pair of bikini clad busty blondes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, girls.\" Jason said as if a monstrous bodybuilder landing at their feet was the most ordinary thing imaginable. \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl on the right turned bright red and was speechless while the one on the right simply spoke what was on her mind. \"You're huge,\" she said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you noticed.\" Jason tensed his thick pecs which swelled into a foot thick wall of muscle. \"Wanna feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls nearly fell over themselves rushing to Jason's side. He wrapped massive arms around them and held them close enjoying the soft warmth of their large breasts agains his sides while they both pawed his chest and abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Jason heard his phone buzzing in his back pocket. \"Pardon me,\" he said pulling it out and checking the caller ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason looked at his phone. The name read Nikki and there was a picture of the cute redhead from Laura's party. Jason was intrigued by what this call could be about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your girlfriend, is it?\" the girl on Jason's right side asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged. \"Let's find out.\" He answered and put the phone to his ear. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason? What's going on? The police came by my place to ask if I'd seen you. They said you'd escaped. That's crazy right?\" The girl on the other end of the line sounded concerned and a little frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did escape. They put me in an interrogation room with a drunk cop friend of Brad's that tried to beat me up.\" He looked down at his busty companions to see if they were impressed and it appeared they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, are you okay?\" She believed him, that was interesting. Jason had expected Nikki to argue that a cop wouldn't try such a thing but she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd say I'm doing just fine.\" He raised an arm and flexed a bowling ball sized bicep that his companions pawed and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki continued. \"Look, I'm sorry I freaked out yesterday. I'd just never seen you go bananas like that. I know Brad has done a lot of shit to you over the years and this was a long time coming, it just scared me to see you lose it that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was really beginning to believe this girl was his girlfriend, or at least someone very close to him. Suddenly the macho Jason was gone and the sensitive one was back. \"I understand. I did lose it pretty bad but I'm getting myself back together. I just don't know if the police are going to see it that way and let it lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a place to stay? I'd recommend my place but I'm sure the cops will be looking for you there. Oh! My uncle is in Spain, you could stay there for a few days, at least until we figure out what to do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was really beginning to like this girl, she was very much on his side. \"Sure,\" he said, \"that sounds great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll text you the address, it's a ways inland but I'm sure you can hail a cab or something. And I'll come check on you in the morning before I go to work.\" Her voice was practically giddy, she was excited by all this scheming and hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki, thank you. For everything, I mean it.\" Jason was glad to have at least one true friend in this reality, even if he knew nothing about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta take care of my baby, don't I? You take care of yourself and I'll see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hung up the phone. \"Sorry girls, I've got to be going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blonde playmates moaned their dissatisfaction as Jason squeezed them both close to him then released them. He walked away until he was off of the pier at which point his phone buzzed with the address he needed as well as where he could find a spare key. He checked the location on his phone's map and saw that he was about 10 miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of leaping he decided this time he would run. He started out at a moderate pace then pushed his body faster and faster until he was blowing past traffic. Jason covered the 10 miles in 8 minutes, the time it used to take him to run a single mile in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was a surprisingly large ranch style house with 5 bedrooms and a huge sprawling back yard. Jason found the key right where Nikki said it would be and let himself in. He wondered around the property for a while before picking a room and flopping down on the bed. Seconds later he was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason awoke the following morning to the sound of Nikki's voice calling to him through the house. Jason pulled back the covers and was surprised to find his body was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yoo-hoo!! Jason! Where <i>are</i> you???\" Nikki's voice sang though the whole house but Jason was more concerned with himself at the moment. He was back to being the scrawny nerd he remembered al too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Jason said with disappointment. Part of him knew that being superhuman was just too good to last but nonetheless he had grown very used to the idea of taking whatever he wanted at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think any further on the matter Nikki entered the room. Upon seeing him her smile lit up her face and sent warmth radiating through Jason's body. Having been a bit preoccupied with beating Brad and being arrested Jason hadn't really noticed before, but Nikki was something of a stunner. He had originally thought of her as cute but now that she was no longer fretting over a bloodied body Jason could see clearly that she was even more, she was beautiful. Her wavy red hair was tied back in a loose ponytail and Jason spotted a light dash of freckles over her nose and cheeks. She watched him with brilliant emerald eyes that looked hungry and her lips were plump and rose colored though she wore no makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked like she had just come from the gym, she carried a large duffle bag and was clad in skintight yoga pants and a black sports bra under a loose t-shirt that had been cut just below her bust-line to show off her trim tummy and the soft lines of her abs. Jason tried not to stare but his eyes were drawn to the surprising hourglass curve that existed between her slender waist and curvy hips. When Nikki turned to set her gym bag down Jason saw that those wide hips supported a very round rear end that was probably the most amazing butt he had ever seen in his life. Jason desperately wanted to give her ass a good hard squeeze and his penis, which was already beginning to stir at the sight of the redheaded beauty, leapt to full attention in his cut off denim shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked around the side of the bed and sat down at Jason's side. \"How are you doing?\" she asked. She ran her fingers through his hair in a way that felt affectionate but Jason thought could also be simply sisterly. Jason was a smart guy but he was very much at a loss in this world and figuring out what his relationship with this woman was was going to be delicate work. Was she his girlfriend? Was she a very close friend? It was even possible that she was an insane stalker and he had just deposited himself in her lap, though this theory seemed unlikely. Still, not knowing how close they were made it a challenge to know how much he should tell her; he wanted a confidant but not one that would turn him in to the cops or go run and tell the world about what he'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled. \"I'm fine. Yesterday was a strange day. How was your workout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" she said blushing slightly. \"Today was arms and shoulders. Wanna feel?\" She raised her arms into a double biceps flex and tiny little bumps appeared atop her toned arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason obliged and ran his fingers over her arms and gave a soft squeeze. \"Very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know they're not much, but I'm super proud considering that giant gob of goo I used to be. The very fact that I have any kind of definition is astounding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat up and looked Nikki in the eye. \"You look incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she purred. She moved her face towards his and for a moment Jason was pretty sure she was going to kiss him, then she stopped. \"Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Jason braced himself for the inevitable question regarding one of the many things he'd done in the past 48 hours. He quickly weighed how much truth he should tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal with your shorts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was caught off guard and burst out laughing. He collapsed back onto the bed. Even in his laughing fit Jason felt overpowered by Nikki's smile and her eyes and decided right then there that if this girl wasn't already his girlfriend he would find a way to make her his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously!\" Nikki said not actually serious at all. \"You know I love you but these things look like you made them yourself and besides, you are not a cut off kind of guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Jason said, \"I'll differ to your expert opinion. What kind of a guy am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki placed her hand on his chest and slid it up to his neck. Then she leaned down and lay her body across his. \"You're my kind of guy.\" Nikki pressed her lips against Jason's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment Jason didn't know what to do, all he could feel was a tingling numbness through his body. Then Nikki's lips parted and her tongue slipped into his mouth which shocked him back to reality. Realizing he didn't want this opportunity to slip by Jason placed his hand on Nikki's head, just behind her ear taking in the softness of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss was over way to fast for Jason's taste for which Nikki actually apologized. \"I would really love to stay and play but I need to take a shower and get ready for work.\" She stood and rummaged through her duffle and pulling out some clothes and a makeup bag then vanished into the attached bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lay back as he heard the shower turn on. \"I could get used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby?\" Nikki was the bathroom door. She still wore her yoga pants but was topless. Her breasts were larger than Jason had imagined, a product of being hidden by her sports bra no doubt, and hung down in perfect teardrops. \"Would you be willing to make some coffee? Uncle Mike has one of those single serve brewing things, so it shouldn't be hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to respond but couldn't speak. Instead he just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Nikki smiled and winked then vanished once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering himself Jason got out of bed and made his way to the kitchen. He found the coffee machine Nikki was talking about and turned the power on, he then went through a few cabinets looking for some mugs. Slowly his thoughts returned to himself and his new, strange body. Nikki had arrived before he could really figure out what had happened but now that he was alone for the moment he could think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, I'm back to being small. The question is, am I still strong and I can I get bigger again?</i> Jason looked around for something heavy that he shouldn't be able to lift. The very large stainless steel refrigerator in the corner of the kitchen seemed to fit the bill. The appliance was so wide Jason could just get his arms around the sides. He squatted slightly then lifted. After some initial struggle with the cumbersome size of the fridge it came off the ground fairly easily. He performed a few quick reps and even attempted to hold the fridge in awkward ways to increase the strain on his muscles, he was super strong and needed to push himself if he was going to grow again. Jason's efforts must have worked because when he set the refrigerator back down he noticed that all of his muscles had grown slightly, he now looked like a sprinter instead of a beanpole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled with the knowledge that he still had the ability to grow bigger and stronger if needed. \"Alright,\" he said aloud, \"I shrunk while I was sleeping so perhaps if I relax I can undo my growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. He let all the tension flow from his body as he stood perfectly still. For a long time Jason didn't feel any different but after a time he sensed a release, almost like a plug holding his muscles in their slightly inflated state. With concentration he was able to let this pressure out and when he opened his eyes he was back to being painfully skinny once more. For the first time ever Jason was excited to see his pitiful frame because it showed he was gaining control over his new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to the coffee machine and brewed a cup for himself and one for Nikki just as she exited the bathroom dressed for work. Just when he thought this girl couldn't get any more amazing she found ways to stop his heart again. Jason guessed she worked at some Hooters knockoff because she was dressed in a button-up shirt that was open and only held together at the bottom where the two sides had been tied together in a large knot. Her cleavage was on full display as was the strap between the cups of her bra. A name tag on her left breast told Jason this really was her work uniform and not just a \"for pleasure\" outfit. Her perfect ass was on full display in a pair of black spandex shorts and now that Jason was finally able to see her bare legs he had to hold back the drool. Her pins were long and strong with developed thighs and round calves that popped even in her sneakers. Jason couldn't help but wonder how he landed such a gorgeous girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to be a bummer but I'm running late, the lunch rush is starting soon.\" Nikki said as she poured the coffee from the mug Jason held into a travel mug. \"But thank you.\" She kissed him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't help himself and gave her behind a quick squeeze which made Nikki purr, it was just as firm and amazing as he had imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back here around 7 or so, okay?\" She smiled and Jason nodded. \"We have a lot to talk about, I want to know what's going on with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed. \"Sure thing,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned to leave then looked toward Jason again. \"Oh, and you know I love you but seriously lose the cut off shorts, you look like an idiot. Help your self to stuff in my uncle's closet if you want. His stuff will probably be big on you, but it'll be better than what you have on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I'll find something that fits,\" Jason said as he watched Nikki leave for work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling like a kid who was anxious to play with a new toy Jason anxiously searched the house to find something else to test his ability with.  The fridge had barely challenged him enough to get any growth (the irony of the fact that he had never before even dreamed of being strong enough to casually lift a fridge never entered his mind) he had needed to bend steel bars and lift cars last night to get pumped up.  He didn't think going out into the street and bench pressing the neighbors vehicles would fit into the whole \"laying low\" thing he was supposed to be doing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe searched the house briefly (tossing around the fridge a little bit as he went through the kitchen) hoping to find a weight set or something to challenge his muscles with but the house didn't seem to have something like that.  He was about to find clothes so he could go search the garage when he was struck by an idea.  What if he didn't need anything to trigger the growth?  Maybe he was taking the concept too literally?  Thinking back to last night his entire body, including his legs, grew when he exerted pressure on trying to bend metal at the gym.  If he didn't need to exert any effort directly with his legs to make them grow maybe he didn't need to actually be lifting or pulling anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a deep breath and tried to do the reverse of what had made his muscles shrink.  He tensed up and concentrated, trying to will himself to grow larger.  After a few seconds of effort nothing happened except making himself see spots momentarily.  He tried again and again, striking different poses like double bicep and finally a crab flex.  The crab flex felt different, he was tensing his entire upper body inward and he felt like he was on the right track but it still wasn't working yet.  He relaxed and shook out his arms then tried again, this time placing the palm of his hands together and flexing inward, as though he was trying to crush an imaginary walnut he was holding between his palms.  Almost immediately the sensation reminded him of the almost impossible resistance of the steel bar last night.  His arms began to tremble with fatigue and then it was like something clicked, he gasped as he could see his pecs and the muscles of his arms begin to swell, slowly at first and then larger and faster as he continued to hold the flex.  He grunted with effort, his whole body was beginning to quiver with the strain but he was trying to hold this flex for as long as he possible could.  The ridiculous jean shorts that Nikki had picked on him about began to give way with starting loud ripping and popping sounds as his quads swelled even larger than they had last night.  Finally he couldn't hold the flex any longer and let go, just as the shorts finished tearing away from his body entirely and he stood, naked and puffing with exertion in the middle of the empty living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Jason groaned after a moment of realization.  \"I should have done that in front of a mirror so I could have seen it!\"  He rushed back to the bedroom he had slept in and after squeezing through the door he examined himself in a full length mirror.  He was definitely larger than he had programmed the app to make himself.  He had no idea how that was possible but here he was.  He hit flex after flex, reveling in not only the sheer size of his muscles but also in the perfection of their sculpted shape as well.  The peaks of his biceps were amazing, the sheer mass and definition of his triceps was mindblowing.  Every muscle looked like it had been carved out of marble and was just as hard.  He tried the imaginary walnut crushing flex again, this time keeping his eyes locked firmly on the mirror.  His muscles pulsed and rippled but didn't grow noticeably larger, he held the flex long enough that darkness began to swim over his eyes and he had to break out of the flex to keep himself from falling over as a wave of dizziness almost overcame him.  \"Whoa,\" he breathed, trying to slow down his heart rate.  He hadn't appeared to grow larger but the floor under him groaned as he shifted his weight.  Had he gotten heavier?  Had his muscles increased in density because they had hit a maximum size?  Jason flexed a few more times, marveling at the sheer enormity that were his biceps and he began to believe that there might be any way for them to be any larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh he willed himself to relax, and like before there was a feeling like water being drained from a tub and he was eventually back to his normal size.  \"This time I'm going to watch,\" he told himself with a smirk and flexed again.  Jason went back and forth between his normal size and his maximum size a few times as well trying a few variations in between.  Each time he did it the transition was quicker and felt easier to control.  He tried isolating body parts but that didn't seem to be possible, it appeared to be an all or nothing transformation.  He did eventually figure out that he could slow the transformation down to a slower and more dramatic pace if he wanted to and he also found it was exhilarating to grow through clothes like the incredible Hulk.  He was enjoying growing slowly until the shirts of Nikki's uncle were literally skin tight and then flexing or growing them slowly until they were utterly destroyed.  He had just shrunk down to his normal size and was buttoning up a flannel shirt to do it again when his phone went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked it up, it looked like he had a text from</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason smiled when he saw the text message was from Nikki. Short and sweet it read \"Thinking of you.\" Jason unlocked his phone with the intention of responding when another message from Nikki arrived, this time it was a photo. It took Jason longer than it should have to realize that it was a close-up shot of her cleavage. A few seconds later another picture arrived, this one was easier to identify as it was taken from slightly further away. It included Nikki's face, her gorgeous smile this time in the shape of a wicked grin, and she was pulling her shirt open and one of her bra cups down to show off her naked breast. The next shot arrived and now she was pinching her bare nipple, her eyes closed and a look of pleasure across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt a primal rush through his body, his hormones were screaming out with the need to bed this woman as soon as possible. He actually growled out loud and tensed his body building his muscle mass and turning himself into the manly beast that Nikki made him feel like. Jason laughed as his pants and shirt grew tighter on his expanding frame. He consciously stopped his growth right around the time that his clothes were ready to rip and looked down at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really is getting easier,\" he said aloud. \"I hardly even had to try and grow that time.\" It was true, the hard flexing that he'd used to trigger his growth earlier was, just like the bar bending and car lifting from the day before, just a distraction. Every time he grew Jason could feel the energy pouring into his body from some unseen source as if there were an invisible power cable attached to his body that he could draw from. The real question was what exactly was he connected to that he was taking energy from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think about this for too long he felt his phone buzz in his hand again. It was another text from Nikki, this one said \"I want your hands on me so bad.\" and was accompanied with another photo, this one of her naked rear, plump and firm and perfect. She had pulled her shorts down and somehow managed to snap a picture while she was also grabbing a handful of her own ass and before Jason could even begin to marvel at this impossible contortionists feat his erection ripped a hole in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess super strength includes every part of me,\" he said looking at exposed cock. He was about to go ahead and expand the rest of his body since his pants were already ruined when he realized that something felt different. He could feel the energy that powered his muscle growth present in his penis as well. Not sure of what to expect Jason acted on this and drew from the mysterious source focusing on his member, filling it with power. Instantly the head of his penis surged forward rapidly while the shaft thickened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, that's new!\" He regarded his new size. He'd always had a very large penis, nine inches in fact, but now he was probably a foot long and almost twice as big around as he'd been moments ago. He gripped the shaft of his penis in his hand and squeezed half expecting it to deflate but it held feeling even stronger than before. Still holding tight Jason sapped more energy and again his cock swelled forcing his hand to open wider for his new girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing with manic glee Jason grew his cock with abandon until, much like his muscles earlier, he reached what must have been a limit of some kind. Jason looked on with astonishment at his new penis which was as big around as a wine bottle and, he guessed, two feet from base to the tip of his softball sized head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is definitely something strange going on here,\" he said to himself. \"I never even had a chance to alter my penis with that app. If the phone is related to my powers I must be able to use it in more ways. Maybe I can change anything. Maybe I can have even more powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his mind got away from him Jason closed his eyes and began to reach out for the body-shaping energy. Making solid psychic contact with it he decided to try something new. Eyes still closed he imagined the energy flooding him and his body stretching out, getting longer, taller. Feeling an infusion much like before he opened his eyes to find the ground rapidly falling away. Overcome with vertigo Jason began to fall, spinning to his right as he did his enormous penis knocked a lamp over then crashed into a nightstand by the bed crushing it to splinters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at the destruction caused by his penis and chuckled. \"I gotta be careful with this thing, that stand was thick, heavy wood. Imagine what it'll do to the ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his bout of dizziness pass Jason stood up. And up. And up. At his full height Jason's head was just six inches below the ten foot ceiling. Looking down he noticed that his clothes were shredded all over leaving only various scraps of fabric hanging from his body. Jason spread his arms out wide then curled them into a most muscular pose while at the same time growing his muscles out to their maximum size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason roared while his body exploded out in all directions, the few bits of clothing left could no longer hold on and fell to the floor. When he was done he was a nine and a half foot tall monster, aside from the color of his skin he looked very much like a very horny Incredible Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't see much of his own body around his enormous shoulders and chest but when he raised his arms to flex his bicep he found a muscle that was far bigger than it had been at his previous height. He didn't even want to guess at its size since everything seemed so distorted now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe since I'm taller my body has more space to grow muscle onto before it has to just get denser. I wonder how much taller I could get.\" Jason slowly added more height to his body relishing the warm feeling that spread through the entire core of him. Jason stopped his growth when his head touched the ceiling. The room around him looked so small to him now, like he was stuck inside a doll's house or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was even taller Jason decided to experiment further and see if his muscles would expand further. Tensing his immense physique he felt raw power crackle within his muscles hinting at the super strength within. Jason realized that he'd need to be careful lest he destroy the entire house as easily as he'd destroyed all those sets of clothes. Focusing on growing once more he was delighted to discover that his body was able to add more mass, quite a bit actually. Six extra inches in height apparently translated into several hundred pounds of extra muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last Jason allowed himself to shrink all the way back down to his scrawny, six foot, 150 pound frame. Now that he'd let all that mysterious energy leave his body he felt extremely tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should take a nap, transformations can be draining.\" Jason told himself. \"Then again maybe drawing more energy is what I need. I could search for even more powers.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason began to clean up the mess from his latest growth experiment, picking scraps of clothing and pieces of broken lamp up from the floor and tossing them into a trashcan.  As he worked his away around the room he found himself feeling more and more tired by the second.  By the time he had dealt with the last of the garbage he could barely keep his eyes open.  His last conscious thought as he staggered to the bed and collapsed onto it was worrying if he had pushed his new powers too far and whether or not he had somehow hurt himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't sure how long he had been asleep when a voice began to cut through the fog.  \"Jason.  Jason I need your help.\"  Jason struggled to open his eyes, the voice sounded vaguely familiar.  \"Jason, please.  I need you.\" He struggled to open his eyes and a very familiar face came into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jordan Carver?\" Jason croaked, his voice still heavy with sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan nodded her head eagerly.  \"I heard about your powers Jason, you have to help me.\"  Jason felt his eyes almost bug out of his head as Jordan began to unbutton her shirt.  \"I regret it Jason, you have to fix me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regret?\"  Jason coughed as Jordan finished taking off her shirt and began undoing her bra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, \"the breast reduction, I regret it so much, please fix me Jason.  Put me back to how I used to be.\"  Jordan finished wriggling out of her bra and tossed it aside.  She arched her back, thrusting her breasts towards Jason and he froze. \"Please,\"she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's thoughts swirled.  Jordan had always been one of his favorite big boob models and he couldn't count the times he had wished she had never had a breast reduction.  He could easily picture how her breasts had looked at their peak size.  He began to reach towards her breasts with both hands but hesitated just before actually touching her.  \"How?\" Jason began to ask but his voice trailed off as Jordan leaned forward, firmly pressing her breasts against the palms of his hands.  She gasped and Jason almost pulled away from her but instead he gently groped, his fingers sinking into the soft, warm expanse of her breasts.  She purred some kind of words of encouragement as he kneaded them slowly, trying to picture how to use his power on her.  He suddenly felt sure it was possible. He could feel the now familiar stirring of energy and he drew at it while simultaneously trying to force it towards Jordan through his hands.  She cooed happily as sparks danced across his fingertips and he could feel her breasts beginning to swell under his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, c'mon wake up.  You're starting to worry me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat up with a jerk, suddenly wildly disorientated.  He tried to call out for Jordan who had apparently vanished but his voice was only an incomprehensible groan.  He swallowed a few times and finally managed to get out a weak, \"Nikki?\" as he recognize who was now sitting on the bed in Jordan's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet, big guy.  You had me worried for a minute there, I don't think I've ever seen anyone sleep that hard before.\"  Nikki pushed at Jason's hands, \"your hands were more awake than you were,\" she said with a laugh.  She leaned forward to give Jason a peck on the forehead as she peeled his hands away from her breasts.  Jason was startled at the sight of sparks dancing across his hands as they separated from her breasts.  She laughed and sat up.  \"Why are you sleeping in the middle of the afternoon anyway?\" Nikki asked.  Jason couldn't answer though, all of his attention was now on Nikki's breasts which were definitely beginning to grow, starting to put obvious strain on her already tight work shirt.</span></div></div>",

It had only been seconds since the spark passed from his fingers into her breasts but already she'd gained several cup sizes. Nikki's bra, once unseen beneath her shirt, became visible as the cups began to overflow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling okay?\" Nikki asked, a look of concern on her face. \"You look really flushed all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason only just managed to tear his eyes away from her bust to make eye contact. \"Oh yeah, I'm fine.\" He hoped she didn't hear the minor crack in his voice as his mind put together what had happened. <i>I can not only change my body I can change other people's too!!! Oh no!! What if she grows as big as Jordan Carver?!?</i> He could feel his penis stir at the thought of Jordan Carver's HH cup breasts on Nikki's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded then turned and vanished into the bathroom. Jason sat up bracing himself for the potential shriek of terror when Nikki's shirt exploded. Moments went by and nothing. After a while she exited the bathroom completely topless. She was clearly angry about something. She huffed across the room to the trashcan by the door and slammed her bra into it. She then marched back into the bedroom grumbling to herself, \"Stupid bra was brand new and it fucking shrinks on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved quickly but Jason only got a cursory view of her new breasts. They were clearly larger but they'd stopped growing. Jason allowed himself to relax a little. A few minutes later Nikki emerged from the bedroom having changed out of her work clothes and into something much more comfortable. She wore a tiny pair of black cotton shorts and a plain white halter. She was adjusting her top with a confused look on her face. Jason could now see that her former C cup breasts had added a few cup sized and were likely now in the F cup range. Jason was actually shocked that she hadn't noticed the difference yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki got the halter to the best place she could on her new bust then, still confused about the fit of her top, grabbed her boobs. \"Geez, I'm so bloated.\" She returned to Jason, \"You sure you're feeling okay? You were really under for a bit, there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm good.\" Jason realized that he was telling the truth. While he'd felt impossibly tired after using his powers earlier, his nap had given him all he needed. In fact he felt so energized he could probably run a marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's look softened. \"Well, I was just going to plop down on my uncle's couch and watch his TV, I was wondering how you'd feel about a snuggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect,\" Jason said. He went with her to the living room and cuddled up close to her body while she channel surfed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mind was racing. He kept settling glances of Nikki's new breasts. They were incredible, even at their new size they remained firm and perky on her chest. Jason noticed that her nipples were at full attention and starkly visible through her top. He began to imagine Nikki's breasts growing even bigger. Or perhaps he could change her in other ways. He even imagined growing himself for her, maybe expanding his muscles or erupting his dick right through his clothes. He had to say something, right? Or did he just want to wait and see how long it took Nikki to notice her expanded breasts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason had moved beyond simply stealing glances at Nikki's improved breasts. Now he was just outright staring at them. Nikki didn't seem to notice, though, instead she seemed distracted. Her eyes were looking up at the wall a few feet above the television. As Jason watched he saw the skin of her chest and cheek turn bright red. He could feel the heat coming off her blushing flesh from where he sat. Nikki crossed her legs and squeezed her thighs together tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Jason asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki jumped, coming out of her daydream. \"Oh! Uh...\" she squished down in her seat, a huge smile appearing on her face. \"Yeah, I'm good. Really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like something's got your motor running.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, the red returning to her face. \"Yeah, I was just thinking about stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just... I had this picture in my head. I don't know where it came from. I could see you, except you had these enormous muscles. Like, Hulk big. It was so hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to watching TV while Jason sat in stunned silence. Minutes went by as his brain sifted through every possibility. <i>She must have picked up a memory from me when I shocked her.</i> Before he could move on to how he should respond Nikki spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe furrowed her brow as if something was bothering her. \"Jason? Who is Jordan Carver and why do I know so much about her all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's heart stopped. \"Hmmmmm?\" he asked hoping to stall for time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just, I can see this woman. She's beautiful, really-\" she put her hands out in front of her chest to simulate huge breasts. \"Curvy, I guess. I've never heard of her before but suddenly I know her name, I know she's 5' 6\" and around 120 pounds. I know she's from Germany and had a 32HH chest up until a few years ago when she had a breast reduction. How do I know all that when I've never heard of her before just now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and looked Jason in the eyes. He could see a wild hunger in her eyes, there was a thin layer of sweat on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I've never been so turned on in my life!\" She leaned in and grabbed Jason's arm. \"Can you imagine it? You with gigantic muscles and me with boobs as big as my head?\" As she spoke of her breasts she pulled the neck of her halter top down exposing her newly expanded assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't even think he just dove in and began sucking on her beautiful chest. As he made his way from one nipple to the other he imagined her boobs growing once more, completing the journey to match Jordan Carver's former size. The more he focused on the image of Nikki growing the more he could feel a surge of energy growing within him. It was moving through his body, through his neck and into his mouth where his tongue danced around the areola of her right breast. He held back, unsure of if he wanted to actually make her grow. Clearly she wanted it, but what if she picked up more of his memories? Could he hold back and only give her size? Perhaps he should make himself grow and delight her with the massive muscles that drove her so wild. She grabbed a fist full of his hair and pressed his face even harder into her chest nearly derailing his thoughts. In the end he knew what he really wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

Nikki's breasts were now dramatically overflowing the cups of her bra, making it almost look as though she had two sets of boobs stacked on top of each other.  She tugged at her bra again and grumbled under her breath.  Her top had become so tight it no longer had any more room to stretch and was beginning to pull upward, exposing the lacy edges on the underside of her bra at the same time her cleavage was pushing it's way upward out of her low cut neckline so dramatically it looked like it was going to touch her chin any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\"  Nikki reached out and closed Jason's mouth for him which he hadn't even realized had dropped open at some point.  In the process of this motion her arm rubbed against her expanding chest which seemed to be the first time she had any conscious indication of what was happening to her.  She tugged at the band of her bra again as she looked down at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously startled, Nikki inhaled sharply and a lot of things happened in a very short amount of time.  With an abrupt sound of ripping fabric her breasts tore free of the straining cups of her bra and almost immediately afterward her tortured top also split apart.  Jason gasped as her now free and still growing breasts surged outward bouncing and jiggling from their dramatic release until they settled into dramatically pert teardrop shapes.  Similar to his earlier unconscious reaction to seeing a picture of Nikki's naked rear Jason's penis reacted so quickly and so aggressively it split the front of his shorts open, throbbing and twitching in the open.  Nikki's hands flew to her breasts, whether for modesty or to confirm with her touch what her eyes were seeing Jason wasn't sure but once his shorts split open her gaze became firmly fixed on Jason's exposed, fiercely erect cock.  Jason wanted to say something reassuring because he could see in her eyes that Nikki looked like she was on the verge of panicking but he was quickly distracted by the fact that somehow he had started growing without any conscious effort on his part.  He grunted as muscle piled on to his body, rapidly expanding him to his previous maximum size and the bed creaked alarmingly at his now immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's mouth moved silently for a moment as she continued to knead her own breasts.  Jason was sure she had already surpassed Jordan Carver by at least two cups sizes and they were obviously still growing.  His erection was throbbing so hard it was almost painful.  \"You're growing Jason,\" Nikki said quietly but calmly.  Jason had never felt more aroused in his entire life and it took him a moment to register that it wasn't just his muscles or height she was referring to but also his cock which seemed to slowly expand with every intense pulse of blood through it.  \"I'm also growing, what is happening to us?\"  A tremor of fear undercut Nikki's question and Jason was once again afraid she was going to panic.  His brain struggled to think beyond how horny he was and how he could keep Nikki calm.  \"What is happening to us?\" She repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly she already looked more contemplative than frightened as she let a hand drift up his forearm.  \"Wow, just like the incredible Hulk, except not green.  That is so hot...\"  She was now gripping his forearm with both hands, giggling as her hands failed to make any impression on it.  \"I've had this dream before, I don't know what I was worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dream?\"  Jason pulled his arm back and Nikki quickly slid closer to him, her hands on his chest now.  Her nipples brushed against his chest and they both gasped at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Nikki shrugged as her fingers traced their way across the rock hard muscles Jason's chest and abs.  \"These sort of things don't happen in real life.\"  She leaned back and cupped her breasts which seemed to have finally stopped growing.  \"I mean I think I've dreamed of having bigger boobs before, not this big but I guess they're OK.  But you having muscles, oh yea.  I've had this dream more than once.\" She gave Jason a seductive smirk as she let go of her breasts and pounced on his chest again, this time grinding herself against him.  Jason put his arms around her and tried to tell her it wasn't a dream but was stopped by her mouth on his.  He opened his mouth to protest again when they finally disengaged from their kiss but he was stopped as she tried to lower herself onto him and yelped.  \"I always thought bigger was better but it looks like you're so big now you won't fit anymore.\"  Jason's whole body trembled at the feeling of Nikki's vagina trying but failing to envelope his dick.  \"That's never happened in a dream before,\" Nikki said with a playful pout.

Finally he lifted Nikki up, spun her around to lay her on the bed and straddled her.  She squeaked with surprise and then joy at the maneuver .  \"Oh my GOD, you are so strong and that turns me on so much,\" she gushed.  Jason paused for an instant, trying to figure out how he was going to proceed next.  He felt like his entire body was crackling with the energy that he had been drawing on the last two days and with a burst of inspiration he plunged his finger deep inside Nikki which made her gasp.  He focused this energy into his finger and pictured transferring it to Nikki like he had when he had made her breasts grow, willing her body to change before he withdrew his finger and began to enter her, slowly at first but then as soon as it was obvious he was going to fit he plunged forward, going impossibly far inward until he actually bottomed out.  Nikki moaned and writhed in pleasure beneath him and for a moment Jason was struck at the sheer size difference there was between them now and he worried that he may actually hurt her without her meaning to.  Then he once again felt the strange energy surging within his body and he smiled.  He could fix that.  He could fix anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found that once he started modifying Nikki he couldn't stop.  He added generous muscle to her shoulders, arms, back, chest, and abs. He pinched her waist in and widened her hips.  He gave her a firm, strong, generous sized ass and then covered it with a thin layer of soft fat so it felt better to grab and even better to bump up against when he took her from behind.  Every position they tried led to new tweaks to her body, he had already made her taller but then he made her even taller still by lengthening her legs so she could wrap them around his torso better.  During one of her turns on top he gave her more powerful legs, especially her thighs so she could ride him as long as she wanted without getting tired.  He even made her hair longer, thicker and wavier just because he could.  He altered and optimized every part of her body except her immense breasts which he was convinced were already perfect, he could barely keep his hands or mouth off of them.  Through appearance, touch, feel and performance he had crafted and tweaked Nikki's body into the pinnacle of perfection and compatibility with his attractions, desires and physical needs.  Every time he thought they were done making love he would look at her and become instantly aroused again.  She was a vision of sexual perfection he never dreamed could even possibly exist, like the combination of a barbarian warrior women from a Frazetta or Vallejo painting and a voluptuous pin up model.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after more hours had passed and more sex had taken place than either one of could have kept track of Nikki finally pushed Jason away when he tried to initiate another round.  \"Not that this hasn't been incredible big guy but I don't think my insides can handle anymore right now and I'm exhausted,\" she said with a low chuckle.  Jason rolled over onto his back and let out a deep breath while he stared at the ceiling, trying to will his erection down.  Nikki slid over next to him, draping an arm over his chest and nuzzling her face into his neck, her breasts squished between the two of them so tightly Jason was surprised she was comfortable with it.  She silently ran her fingertips over his chest and stomach, for a moment before stopping.  \"We're not dreaming are we Jason?\"  She finally asked.  Jason sighed, and glanced around the room, taking in the scraps of cloth that were all that remained of the clothing they had outgrown and the now ruined bed that had been demolished very early on in their love making.  He silently shook his head and Nikki sighed.  \"Yea, I didn't think so.  You have a lot of explaining to do.\"  Jason opened his mouth but realized she had already passed out.  He sighed and stared at the ceiling until he fell asleep as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason picked up his phone to find a text message from a number that wasn't in his contacts. This sort of thing was always worrisome since he hardly ever got text messages from people he knew, much less people he didn't; and now that he was legitimately a fugitive Jason had even more call to be concerned about messages from strangers. After reading just a few words, however, Jason's fears melted away and he was left with a giant smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Hi Jason! This is Amy, the girl from the gym yesterday. I've thought a lot about your offer for dinner and I think I would like to take you up on it. Tonight would be great if you're free.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's fingers immediately began tapping out a message that hell yes he was free tonight but he stopped in his proverbial tracks when he remembered Nikki. <i>I have a girlfriend now,</i> he thought and his stomach sank slightly with the weight of that attachment. This sort of conundrum was entirely new to Jason and he didn't know what he should do. On the one hand he wanted to be loyal to the girl that had given him shelter and cared for him when no one else seemed to. On the other, though, he had made a promise to Amy and after the way he had destroyed the gym and 3 of its patrons it only seemed fair to hold up his end of the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what his choice ended up being dinner was likely out, at least tonight, since Nikki said she'd be back at 7 and he'd agreed to discuss matters with her. Perhaps he could see if Amy was available for lunch and hope that fulfilled his obligation to her. Seeing her again would be nice; he kept picturing her gorgeous smile and glowing eyes, her round breasts and delectable thighs. If Nikki was beautiful in a \"girl-next-door\" sort of way then Amy was sexy like a porn star. Jason just wasn't used to having any sort of chance to go on a date with a girl like that and the thought of letting such a chance pass by seemed insane. But was he willing to be a cheater?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to his reflection. \"I don't even really know Nikki. I'm a stranger in this reality and I can be who ever I want to be. I'm already wanted by the police, why can't I also have lunch with a beautiful girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason furthered his rationalization: \"Besides there's this Jason and then there's\u2026\" He made his body grow quickly rending the flannel shirt to strips at his feet. He tensed his enormous body watching waves of sinew bulge and solidify impossibly hard across his entire frame. He hit a mind blowing crab flex, his arms exploding outward, his traps swallowing his neck and touching the bottoms of his ears. \"And then there's Jason.\" When he spoke it was as if with a different voice, deeper, confident, assured, in charge. And why not? He was a different person, really. This Jason was not encumbered by a relationship to anyone; this Jason took what he wanted and didn't dream of asking for permission or forgiveness, this Jason was unstoppable, inhuman. This Jason was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a god,\" Jason told himself. He grinned wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later he shrunk back down to his normal self, but the smile and the drunkenness that came with power remained. He looked at his phone and the message from Amy again. A tiny voice in the back of his head insisted that he wasn't the sort of person who cheated and that it wasn't worth gambling with Nikki's affections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he had to make a decision he\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason almost ignored Amy\u2019s text but after a few moments he found he couldn\u2019t get the thought of the gorgeous brunette, her too tight clothing and her generously sized breasts out his head.  He continued to grapple with the ethics of his relationship with Nikki and finally settled on the somewhat shady logic that taking Amy out to dinner would definitely be something he wouldn\u2019t be able to hide but a quick lunch date he might be able to keep on the down low.  He quickly typed and sent a somewhat non-committal text.  \u201cI can\u2019t make dinner work tonight but I have time now if you want to do lunch or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t have wait long until his phone buzzed with a new text.  \u201cI\u2019m at work and can\u2019t really leave right now :(\u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Jason grunted.  He began to actually start picking out some clothes to wear instead of grow out of when his phone buzzed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the Gym is closed because of your \u201cremodeling\u201d and I\u2019m the only one here so if you wanted to stop by I\u2019m sure we could find \u201csomething\u201d to do.\u201d  Attached to the message was a close up picture of what Jason recognized as Amy\u2019s cleavage, stuffed into what appeared to be an even tighter polo shirt than last night.  Amy was tugging the neckline down low enough so Jason was able to see the lace trim of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe right there,\u201d he texted back.  He threw on the largest flannel shirt he could find and tore the sleeves off, then pumped himself up as large as he could without destroying it.  He was able to button the shirt around his stomach but the swell of his pecs and the width of his lats made buttoning it closed over his chest an impossibility.  Regardless of how ridiculous Nikki might think they make him look he had to opt for cut off shorts again, the girth of his thighs was too much for pant legs to deal with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stepped out into the backyard and after glancing around and determining the coast was clear he jumped skyward like he had last night, aiming for the general direction of where he remembered the gym was.  His direction was mostly accurate but he misjudged the distance and landed in a parking lot a couple blocks over.  The sound of his landing startled the few people who were nearby but he didn\u2019t think they actually saw him land so he jogged at a casual pace to the gym and knocked at the back entrance.  He misjudged his own strength and pounded on the door hard enough to dent it.  A few moments went by without a response so he knocked again, making a conscious effort to use less force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time only a few seconds went by before the door opened with a groan and Amy looked flustered as she peered out.  \u201cIs the door sticking?  What happened to it?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might have knocked too hard, I think I bent it a little,\u201d Jason said sheepishly.  He gripped the door at the corner and bent it slightly, trying to straighten the slight warp he put in the door.  It gave little resistance but it was apparently enough to trigger some amount of growth because a button tore loose from his shirt with an audible pop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s face and neck burned red and she gasped before stammering, \u201cI\u2019m sure you fixed it, just come in.\u201d  The door closed easily behind them and Amy led Jason through a small maze of storage rooms and laundry bins to the main gym.  His exit had been covered with a large piece of plywood and was separated from the rest of the gym with construction sawhorses and warning signs.  \u201cYea, you made quite an impression,\u201d Amy said, turning to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn\u2019t help but notice that she had on more makeup today than she had last night, had she put it on to impress him before he got there?  She was good looking enough that she didn\u2019t need makeup at all in his opinion.  This train of thought was derailed by Amy who cocked he head as she regarding Jason and bluntly asked, \u201cdid you shrink since last night?  You look smaller than you did before you left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was caught off guard and hesitated before he answered, which apparently Amy interpreted as a cue to keep talking.  \u201cCan you change size whenever you want then?\u201d  Jason nodded and was cut off again before he had the chance to talk.  \u201cCan you show me please?  I would love to see it.  This is kind of a fantasy of mine, I would REALLY REALLY like to see it.\u201d  Amy only paused long enough to chuckle nervously.  \u201cIs that weird?  I don\u2019t mean for it to be weird I\u2019m just really\u2026. I\u2019m talking too much, yea?  I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sort of nervous.  I\u2019m not usually the nervous type but this is\u2026.\u201d  She trailed off once more as Jason just grinned and clasped his palms together, pushing them against each other and flexing his body down like he had just spent most of the morning doing.  Growing as slowly as he possibly could he kept growing until the seams of shirt began to split around his engorged muscles.  Amy put her hand up to her cover her open mouth and took a step backward as Jason continued to grow until every button on his shirt tore open and even the top button of his shorts gave way.  He only stopped when he was fairly sure his shorts were about to tear away from his body.  Amy\u2019s breath came in fast panting gasps as she reached a trembling hand to Jason\u2019s chest.  \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said breathlessly.  \u201cYou weren\u2019t this big last night, can you get bigger?\u201d  Before Jason had a chance to answer her Amy proved true to form and interrupted him.  \u201cI know we barely know each other and that this is probably a lot to ask but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began to remove his shorts but Amy stopped him, \u201cNo, grow out of them, wait a second!\u201d  She dashed off somewhere into the back and came rushing out again with a wad of shorts of all sizes.  \u201cThese are spandex, one of them should fit, you can put them on after.  Please, just\u2026 grow for me.\u201d  There was urgency in Amy\u2019s voice that was starting to set off warning alarms in the back of Jason\u2019s mind but he was enjoying showing off and there seemed to be an unspoken promise of sex after this.  And Amy was undeniably attractive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI\u2019ll go as big as I can but it reaches a point where I have stop or it feels like I might black out.\u201d  Amy nodded eagerly and Jason resumed his flexing and slow growth.  He had thought that he had already had a good idea what he looked like as he grew but Jason was quickly learning that having a mirror that took up an entire wall and much brighter lighting made a significant difference.  As his muscles continue to swell he could swear that the individual muscle fibers were visible through his skin.  Like before he hit a size where his body simply had no more room for additional muscle and the fibers quivered under his skin as he could feel them growing denser and harder instead of larger.  He wasn\u2019t sure if his muscles were creaking audibly or if it was a trick caused by the blood pounding in his ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he hit his limit.  His vision blurred and he began to sway.  His reflection loomed back at him, impossibly thick with more muscle than seemed possible for the human body.  He was about to release his flex when Amy rushed to his side, provocatively rubbing her body against his, \u201cplease, just a little more, I know you can do it.\u201d  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is amazing, keep going!\u201d  Jason let out a shaky breath and sucked another one in, his vision began to clear and the feeling of lightheadedness and vertigo faded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was staring at his own reflection and realized that he was not getting any more muscular.  With apparently nowhere else to put the muscle on his body and having probably reached maximum muscle density his body was now just growing overall larger.  He was inching upward, obviously beyond his already tall height of six foot one, and growing.  In fact it appeared that he was beginning to pick up speed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, YES!  YES!!!\u201d  Jason was shocked out of his flex by Amy who apparently had just brought herself to orgasm grinding away at this muscular leg.  She realized he had stopped growing and took a step back, gasping from the orgasm and the obvious arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his feet Jason\u2019s phone buzzed and reflexively he reached for it.

He touched down in the backyard and dashed into the house, trying to shed his muscular frame.  Judging from how cramped the house seemed to him now he guessed he was just over eight feet tall at the moment and it was hard to begin the shrinking process but eventually he was able to start shedding his newfound size.  Just in time too.  He could feel his body had shrunk down as small as it could just as he heard Nikki come in the front door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She carried a pair of to-go containers balanced in one hand and a large soda in the other. As soon as her eyes fell on Jason she froze, the food and drink falling from her hands and crashing to the floor. Jason had taken a few steps to meet her but when she stopped so did he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked. Nikki's face showed a mix of confusion and terror and Jason couldn't figure out why. \"Baby, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki furrowed her brow and tried to speak. \"You.. your bo-.. you have m-.. how?\" She took a breath then spoke slowly, \"What happened to you?\" She pointed a finger at Jason's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason followed her point and saw what was wrong. \"OH SHIT!\" He was still big. Not a giant like he'd been but far from the scrawny beanpole that Nikki was familiar with. If he had to guess he'd have put his weight in the 250 pound range which, at his height, made him a pretty solid bodybuilder. He bent forward to get a better look at himself and guessed he was perhaps a little bigger than Laura's brawny brother. This didn't make any sense, he had shrunk back down. He searched inside himself for the \"plug\" he'd discovered this morning, the one that released his inflated muscles but it wasn't there. Neither was the pressure really, this body felt like his natural state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, what's going on?\" Nikki looked like she was about to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I, uh, used your uncle's weight set.\" He said, though he'd found no such set while searching the house earlier. \"It's super effective!!\" To punctuate his joke he raised his arms and flexed his 20 inch biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki emitted a sound that was a combination of a nervous laugh and a scared yelp. She put her hand to her mouth, a move that Jason had recently seen Amy make when he was much larger than he currently was. Still, it was all relative. The buxom gym bunny was aware of his ability to grow and Nikki was only just discovering what he could do. Of course Jason now had to figure out how much he would tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" Jason said then closed his eyes. Instead of trying to release the pressure in his body he attempted to force it out. Within moments he could feel his body deflating; it was a strange feeling since he was getting smaller than he felt he should be almost like he was turning inside out. Had transforming too much or too far altered his natural state? Was he now a 250 pound bodybuilder when relaxed and \"normal?\" So many questions and no answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JASON!\" The panic in Nikki's voice pulled Jason back to reality and ceased his reduction in size. A good thing too because when he looked down he saw that he was even skinnier than he'd been this morning. His skeleton was painfully visible making him look like a malnourished prisoner. The spandex shorts Amy had supplied, once comically small, had fallen off and were bunched around his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" Jason quickly began regaining mass until he resembled his old self again. \"Sorry, this is still all new to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki ran her hands up to her scalp and grabbed handfuls of her wavy hair. \"Please tell me what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what I know,\" he said having a seat on the couch. He was still naked but no longer had any qualms about his body since his lack of physique was merely temporary. He motioned for Nikki to join him which she did after careful deliberation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason relayed much of his recent adventures to Nikki. He began with his arrest and interrogation. His discovery of strength when he was able to break out of his handcuffs (Jason wasn't sure but he thought he noticed Nikki flush at the mention of his feat of strength) and his escape from the police station(he made sure to mention how easy it was to kick the door open and this time was certain the skin around Nikki's neck and chest reddened). He told her about entering the gym and how Brad's pals had come after him and how easy it was to fend off their attacks and how his body had grown bigger and stronger when he'd bent the bar. He told her that he'd gotten so big that he'd burst right through his shirt and pants (now he spotted her nipples poking through her top, no small feat since she was also wearing a bra).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains the cut-offs,\" Nikki said crossing her legs tightly and resting one hand on the shelf of her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jason said then told her that was when she'd called him and offered her uncle's home and how he'd shrunk back to normal by morning. \"Since you left I've been playing around with my body trying to figure out what's going on; what I can do.\" Of course Jason failed to mention destroying the police cars or flirting with the girls on the pier, and he definitely wasn't going to tell her about Amy or the fact that he was from an alternate reality. Perhaps that last bit would come with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what can your body do?\" Nikki was finally returning to a comfort level that allowed for flirting and it sounded like she was even excited about his abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leaned closer to her holding her stare tightly with his own. \"Get big. And I mean, really, really big.\" He planted a quick kiss on her lips, then moved around a put a few on her neck. Since his plans with Amy fell through perhaps he could get some playtime with Nikki; plus there was the guilt free fact that she was his girlfriend and he didn't need to worry about cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki moaned and leaned into his kisses. \"Bigger than a minute ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \"Baby, I was so big earlier that I felt like I was back to normal a minute ago.\" He pressed against her body signaling her to lay down on the couch which she did. Jason placed his body atop hers and continued kissing and sucking her neck and chest. Nikki wrapped her leg around Jason's back and began grinding her crotch against his thigh. Jason slid his hand under her top to the base of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you show me?\" she asked between gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Jason said. \"How long do you have before you have to be back at work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki made a dissatisfied groan, \"I was just going to drop your lunch and run.\" She chuckled at her joke since she had <i>actually</i> dropped his lunch. \"But I don't want to go back now. I'll just tell them my car broke down or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and stopped his kissing. He sat back away from Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason frowned. \"As much as it pains me to say it, I don't think you should do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki leapt to her feet. \"You can't expect me to leave you now? I won't be able to concentrate on anything I'm doing. I want to stay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason held his hands up to calm her. \"And I want you to stay, but the reality is that the police are probably still looking for me. You've told them you don't know where I am but anything you do that's out of the ordinary will tip them off. In fact you should really be careful when coming here. I'm sure they've pulled your phone records and know that we spoke. All they have to do is follow you here and they'll find me.\" Jason stood and put his arms around Nikki. \"And then you'll get in trouble for helping me. I don't think I could stand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked into Jason's eyes for a long time then let out an exasperated, \"FUUUUUUUUCK!!!!\" She punched him in the shoulder then regretted it shaking her hand out. \"I hate it when you're right like this.\" She turned a strode quickly to the front door. \"Fine! But you had better be ready to show me just how big really, really big is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal,\" Jason said. \"And I'll be sure to make up for sending you away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better!\" She said then snarled in frustration. \"And you'd better clean up this mess!\" She pointed at the food she'd dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. Make sure you're not followed, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck you,\" she spat but Jason could see the smile behind her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki left slamming the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason returned to the spandex shorts and fished his phone out of them. He frowned when he saw that he'd missed 6 calls and had a string of text messages all from Amy. The first few messages were begging him to return the last few were demanding it. She was threatening to call the police and tell them what she knew if he didn't come back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason frowned. He knew that responding would only goad her further but he didn't think he had much choice. Finally he decided to try the dispassionate, reasonable route and typed out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">Amy, this behavior isn't acceptable. You're being obsessive.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">U don't undestnd. I been waiting for some 1 like u my entire life!!!!!!!!! I NEED U BACK!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">I think it's best if we take some time first. I'm still learning about my powers.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">NO!!!! U come back now or I tell police what i know!!!</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled at this thought. <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">They won't believe you.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">i have security tape.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jason's stomach dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">i kept it for myself. told them the cameras not wrk. you look good growing big bending bar. i've watched a lot. you don't come back i'll give 2 police.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and flopped back down on the couch. He had no idea this girl was going to be so much trouble. Even if he gave in would she ever stop demanding more? Did it matter if the police knew what he could do? Maybe it would get them to back off. Or maybe it would just help convince them to pull out the really big guns in their search for him, and that only put Nikki in greater danger. There was no easy answer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGeez,\u201d Jason mumbled to himself.  He leaned back on the couch and sighed loudly, closing his eyes and wishing he hadn\u2019t ever offered Amy his number in the first place.  His phone buzzed the arrival of another text and he groaned, fully expecting it to be from Amy.  A quick glance confirmed that his assumption was indeed correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">U have 1 hour.<br>\r\n</span></b><br>\r\nJason seriously considered ignoring her with the hope that she was bluffing but he finally decided he couldn\u2019t take that chance.  It wasn\u2019t just himself he was worried about.  He didn\u2019t want to get Nikki in trouble by extension either.  After a few more moments of deliberation he texted Amy back, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll be there in an hour so we can talk about this.\u201d  The phone buzzed again almost immediately but this time he did ignore it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got up off the couch and slipped back into the spandex shorts, surprised to note that he was once again at his \u201cplus one hundred pounds\u201d physique.  Apparently when he stopped thinking about it he had reverted to this size without realizing it.  He concentrated and forced himself to shrink down to his \u201cnormal\u201d size but in less than the time it took him to clean up the dropped fast food mess from the floor he had grown back again.  The soda was a complete loss, and some of the chili fries had fallen out onto the floor but the bacon cheeseburger was fine.  Once the floor was as clean as he could manage he wolfed down the burger and remaining fries then stepped into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried once more to shrink to his original size during his shower but once again, before he had finished with his usual bathroom routine he had ended up back at what his body now seemed to think was the body he was supposed to have.  He was almost about to try shrinking back once more before he got dressed but then decided against it.  If he would just end up growing back again the first time he stopped concentrating on what size he was supposed to be it would draw considerably more attention if he spontaneously grew a hundred extra pounds of muscle rather than just accepting that this was his new body.  He pulled on a hoodie and while it looked a bit snug across the chest it wasn\u2019t ridiculously tight.  He looked like a typical beach going meathead trying to show off.  In keeping with that train of thought he found a pair of shorts that fit over his thighs (barely) and pair of sunglasses and visor that both fit into the stereotypical jock look and to help hide his identity.  In fact with the added muscle he didn\u2019t think anyone would recognize him.  \u201cUnless of course Amy hands out video of me growing to anyone who might be looking for me,\u201d Jason realized glumly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through closets Jason came up with a backpack which he quickly loaded up with a few changes of clothes.  If he ended up growing out of his clothes for Amy again he wasn\u2019t going to wear those spandex shorts again.  He also stumbled across an ancient looking desktop computer shoved in the back of one of the closets.  It looked to be at least twenty years old and he couldn\u2019t find a keyboard or monitor anywhere that were compatible with it.  He tried plugging it in and turning it on but it failed to start.  Why was someone keeping it?  Shrugging Jason quickly dismantled it and pulled out the hard drive.  Not able to quickly find a hammer and getting concerned about how much time had already passed, Jason slammed the hard drive in the back door a few times until the casing cracked.  \u201cHopefully no one had anything important stored on here,\u201d he thought as he removed the magnets out of the hard drive and stashed them in the backpack as well.  Depending on what format Amy\u2019s security footage was on these magnets may help him destroy it if that became necessary and these  were considerably more powerful than the sort of magnets people used to hold stuff to their fridge with.  Jason slipped out the back and jogged at an easy pace to the gym, deciding it wasn\u2019t worth the risk for more dramatic means of transport.  He arrived a few minutes before his hour was up and knocked on the back door, this time being careful not to bend the door in the frame.  Almost immediately Amy opened the door and Jason stepped inside.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI knew you would come back to me!\u201d Amy shrieked with joy as she jumped up and wrapped her arms around Jason\u2019s neck.  Jason was so startled by her he didn\u2019t have a chance to react other than to put his arms around her waist to steady her when she started to swing around like a pendulum.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently untwined her arms from around his neck and set her down, \u201cAmy, we really need to talk about\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have time for that later, c\u2019mon I have something I need to show you,\u201d Amy spun on her heel and dashed towards the main gym without waiting for Jason to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed with frustration; actually talking to Amy was far more difficult than it had any need to be.  \u201cLook,\u201d he tried again as he followed her into the gym.  His voice trailed off as his mind tried to comprehend what his eyes were seeing.  The plywood covering had been removed from the hole in the wall and a Jeep was backed up to it.  The Jeep had been jacked up and a belt of some kind went from the rear tires to a Rube Goldberg-like contraption consisting of a series of pulleys and wires that surrounded a weight bench like a demented cat\u2019s cradle.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d  He said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d  Amy danced between the cables and sat on the weight bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason proceeded more cautiously towards her.  \u201cI don\u2019t even know what it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA guy who can grow big and muscular is only part of the fantasy,\u201d Amy said not even seeming to acknowledge that Jason had said anything.  \u201cThe even more important part is fucking him while he does it.\u201d  To emphasize her words Amy lay back on the weight bench and ran the tip of her index finger across the swell of her breast, down over her flat stomach and to her waistband where she tugged at the hem of her shirt, untucking it and pulling it over her head as she sat back up again.  She sat up straight, chest thrust forward, biting her lower lip.  \u201cWhat are you waiting for stud?  Get over here.  After you grow and screw my brains out you can show me how to grow myself.  I\u2019ve waited my whole life for this moment; I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s finally here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason,\u2019 Amy said, the sparkle of impish, lustful delight leaving her eyes, replaced by something flat and empty.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t up for debate.  Get over here.\u201d  She smiled again, hefting one of her breasts teasingly before she reached behind her back and undid her bra.  Jason forgot to breathe for a moment, her bare breasts were amazing, full, high on her chest and noticeably larger than Nikki\u2019s.  She also had the finely etched abs and rounded shoulders of a fitness queen that Nikki didn\u2019t have.  \u201cIt\u2019s set up so you can get constant resistance so you can grow while you\u2019re either on top of me or underneath.  It looked like all you needed was resistance to trigger your thing yea?\u201d  With a wiggle Amy was out of her shorts and panties and lay propped up on her elbows, regarding Jason with nothing more than a smile and eyes that sparkled with mischief.  Jason opened and closed his mouth a couple times before he was able to make anything like sounds or words come out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"C'mon, baby. You just put your wrists there, and the others connect to your ankles.\" Amy was trying to explain to Jason how to properly use her insane looking contraption. When he failed to move she sighed and sat up to begin hooking him up herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, I-\" he began but she pressed a finger to his lips and shushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been patient for a very long time but I don\u2019t think I have any patience left. If you're not going to cooperate I'm going to get angry, and you wouldn't like me very much when I'm angry.\" She looked him in the eye and Jason saw all the playfulness was gone, he wasn't even sure if she knew what she had just quoted. All he saw was a seriousness that only just concealed insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed. He wasn't afraid of this girl hurting him, he was far stronger than she could ever be, but he was terrified that she may hurt herself or Nikki somehow. Getting out of this unscathed was going to take some finesse. He relented and allowed Amy to begin to hook his body up to her pulleys. As she did she took the time to squeeze his muscles through his clothing, moaning as she did and pressing her naked body against his; Jason could feel the heat coming off of her even thorough his hoodie. He felt a spark inside him trying to ignite and quickly suppressed the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the cables were attached to his body Amy bounded away to the Jeep and started it up. A moment later the lines went tense as the rear wheels began turning and Jason felt himself being pulled in four directions at once. It wasn't bad, in fact his current strength level was more than enough to compensate. To prove he was fine Jason pulled his arms in together slightly; as he did he heard the engine rev up slightly and the tension increased. Somehow Amy had rigged the Jeep so that the more he pulled the more the engine pulled him back. For a moment Jason was amazed with Amy's engineering prowess, he didn't really have any idea how she had constructed such a machine, especially in such a short amount of time. Now with the added stress Jason could feel his muscles pulse slightly removing all slack from his hoodie and causing several seams to begin to snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait!!\" Amy came bounding back and returned to her position on her back on the weight bench. \"Okay, baby, come and get me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason put his hands up to calm her and signal that he wasn't about to do anything she asked. The motion caused the Jeep to rev up again and his muscles swelled slightly again. Now the hoodie looked painted on and his shorts had begun to split up the sides of his thighs. This drove Amy crazy and she began giggling while one hand began kneading one of her large breasts and the other hand gently massaged the space between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was astounded by how good it felt to have that constant battle going on; to constantly feel pulled apart and yet always have enough strength to battle back. That spark was back and he desperately wanted to pull with all of his might and see how it felt when the engine really tried to pull on him but he knew he had to resist. He did his best to relax his body but the Jeep didn't release the pressure. \"Amy, I'm sorry but this isn't happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you think,\" she said wiggling her body on the bench and extending one leg out to put her foot on his thigh. She slid her toes down through one deep grooves of his quads then back up another. \"You might say no, but this huge rock hard cock says you want me bad.\" Her foot landed on the shaft of his penis which was very clearly outlined within his overstressed shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There is no way I'm going to have sex with her</i>, Jason thought. This, however, was the last rational thought he had because something about the combination of the constant pressure from the Jeep along with the way she stroked his penis allowed Jason's guard to slip just enough for that spark to ignite into a full blown fire. Shortly after arriving in this reality Jason had lost his mind to rage and nearly killed Brad as a result, once again he was blindly overcome by his emotions only this time it was lust that was in control. He became an animal overcome by the need to fuck the gorgeous creature splayed out before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy must have seen something in Jason's look change because she screamed \"YEEEESSSS!!!\" as Jason let out a low growl and launched himself onto her body. The Jeep's engine roared and Jason's body surged out in all directions shredding his clothing and leaving his hulking body completely naked. He grabbed Amy by the waist and lifted her up then drove her down on his cock. Amy screamed as an orgasm roared through her body and she was hit with equal parts pleasure and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD YES YES YES!!!!\" Amy bucked her body up and down wildly and Jason was more than happy to assist. He drove himself deep inside her enjoying the hot wet sensation as well as the way her never-ending orgasm kept her vaginal muscles pulsing on his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pressed her body to his giant chest and wrapped one arm around his pecs while she placed her other hand on his bicep. \"Grow for me, baby!! Bigger, show me how big you can get!! C'mon, baby, grow!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was more than happy to comply and he pulled against the cables that were keeping him flexed. By now the Jeep's motor was screaming but he hardly felt the tension increase. The cables attached to his legs snapped doubling the pressure on his arms. This was enough to pump his muscles up a bit but he quickly adjusted, his strength easily countering the resistance. Amy screamed as he inflated. Jason raised his arms and pumped his biceps and she clawed at the 30 inch peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason scoffed, her machine was putting all the pressure it could on him and he still wasn't as big as he could be. He quickly yanked one arm forward causing another cable to snap; now all the weight was on a single arm. Again his body pulsed out a few inches in all directions and Amy went crazy but he still wasn't as big as could be. Jason snapped the final wire then wrapped his big arms around Amy's slender body and pressed his palms together behind her back. She was already covered in sweat and panting but as soon as she felt the rumbling in his muscles she pressed herself harder, grinded against his cock harder, begged him to grow, grow, grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason made his body swell slowly relishing the control over his own muscles as well as the madness he instilled in Amy. Within minutes he'd hit his size limit but he only pressed in harder causing his muscles to tighten and become denser. He could feel strength flooding his body like electricity and Amy could feel it too. She was no longer begging with actual words but instead mere syllables as if she were speaking in tongues. Jason could feel that plug or whatever it was inside him that regulated the flow of power to and from wherever it came only now it felt less like a plug and more like a tunnel: huge and wide open. Seconds later he reached the point where his muscles could tighten no further and his vision started to become fuzzy but Jason wasn't through. He pressed harder still forcing himself to fight through haze and, as it had earlier, his entire body began to grow larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was hardly conscious herself but she knew that he was getting even larger and began to cry with ecstatic joy. \"oh god, oh- you're getting bigger inside me\" she said softly. Jason smiled knowing what she said was true. As his body grew up and out so too did his cock; he could feel it getting longer and thicker inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last his penis began to twitch and tighten as it got ready to unload inside Amy. She could sense it too because she snapped back to attention. Jason felt the power inside him crackle like electricity filling every cell with energy which then coalesced in his crotch. Moments later he came and it felt like he was firing lightning bolts into Amy who reacted as if she were being electrocuted. Her body shook violently which only spurred Jason on to keep growing larger and pushing into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came for nearly a full minute, slowly growing larger the entire time. When his cock finally came to rest Amy fell unconscious against his massive chest. Jason slowly lifted her off of his penis which was no simple task since he'd grown so big inside her he could hardly get himself out without hurting her. Finally he'd removed himself from inside her and held her up, he had grown so large that she felt like a child in his arms. His giant hands could wrap entirely around her waist and his arms were bigger around than her chest. Jason set her down on a pile of gym mats to let her rest then approached one of the many mirrors to examine his titanic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was even taller now than he'd been the last time he transformed. He guessed he was somewhere around 8 and a half feet tall. His body was exploding with muscle and he felt like he could punch a mountain down. He gripped his enhanced cock and pumped it a few times. He'd been an impressive 10 inches before but now he'd added half a foot and was nearly as thick as a soda can. Despite it's enormous size it actually looked a bit small compared to the rest of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter posing for a few moments Jason's mind began to clear. He shook his head and took a deep breath. \"Whoa! What am I doing?\" He looked back at the sleeping Amy. The last twenty minutes were a blur in his mind but it was obvious what he had done. Still, with her out this was the perfect time to look for the security footage she held over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason forced himself to shrink back down and got dressed in some of the clothes he'd brought. Then he began his search.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason snuck quietly away from the dozing Amy, trying to steer his mind away from the haze of lust and sex to focus it on finding that security footage.  He looked over his shoulder at Amy to make sure she was still sound asleep and instead found himself taking in every curve and contour of her naked form.  He could feel his penis begin to stiffen in response and it was only with great effort that was able to make himself turn away again.  He suppressed an audible groan when he noticed that in the corner of the gym he was now facing there was a camera perched above that probably had a front and center view of his latest growth plus that half hour of mind blowing sex.  \"How could I have been so stupid, I KNEW there was a camera already.  This is what I get for thinking with the wrong head.\"  Jason cursed himself as he moved from the gym into the offices.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to find Amy's purse and with it her cell phone.  Luckily she didn't have it password locked.  He quickly searched through the contents of her phone and almost instantly found the video footage she had been holding over his head.  In full color and decent enough resolution that his face was easily recognizably.   Jason watched himself grow out of his bloody shirt then easily beat up the jocks.  \"That will bump me up the most wanted list if the cops get their hands on it.\"  He deleted the file then checked through Amy's texts, emails and social media account to see if she had sent it or shared it anywhere.  It didn't look like it so he returned the phone to her purse and continued to dig through it.  He found nothing else of interest except a small flash drive.  Jason impatiently crumbled it into tiny pieces in his fist, he didn't have time to check if a copy of the video was on it, better to assume it was and destroy it.  He returned Amy's purse to where he had found it and moved on, desperately searching for wherever the security video footage was stored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he found it.  A small computer set up with a handful of monitors, one showing the front entrance, another the rear entrance, the lobby and reception desk and the wide panoramic view of the gym.  At least it had been panoramic on the clip Jason had just watched.  It was now zoomed in so the weight bench was the center of the screen and Jason was disturbed to note that Amy was sitting up looking around the gym with a puzzled look on her face.  \"Shit,\" Jason barked.  He had no time for finesse.  Jason jerked cables out of the computer and pulled it out of its enclosure.  The sides of its case were held in place with security screws that were meant to require a special screwdriver to remove, and even as recently as yesterday this would have been an obstacle that would have stopped Jason.  Today, he simply peeled the case apart with his bare hands.  With a shriek of metal the guts of the computer were laid bare and Jason was yanking out hard drives and some kind of tape drive as the security screws were still rattling around the room.  He wasn't sure where or how the video footage was stored so destroyed everything.  He cracked the hard drives open, bent their media plates and scraped his magnets across them for good measure. He shattered CD discs into thousands of pieces and tore the content of the tape drive into shreds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in the process of running the magnets through the pile of shredded tape when he heard Amy's voice from directly behind him shriek, \"what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dropped the magnets and stood up to face her, she had put on her bra and panties but was otherwise naked.  And she was livid.  \"I can't live with you threatening me for the rest of my life,\" Jason said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was so angry she was almost hyperventilating and it was an effort for Jason not to stare solely at her heaving chest.  \"Damn it!\"  She finally blurted.   \"Damn it, I'm so close.  You almost did it Jason, I can feel it, it almost happened.  But I need more.\"  Amy took a step towards Jason with such intensity that he actually flinched backward.  \"Once more, maybe twice will do it.  Jason I NEED MORE!  It's not enough yet!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened his mouth to ask what wasn't enough yet but true to form Amy struck him speechless before he got a word out but this time she did it without saying anything.  Instead she clasped her hands in front of her chest, mimicking Jason's palm to palm flex and grunted with effort.  And she slowly began growing more muscular.  In less than a minute a good thirty pounds or so of solid muscle filled out her already impressive frame very nicely and once again Jason felt himself growing hard.  Amy swayed on her feet and cursed loudly and creatively.  \"I can't get any bigger, there's something stopping me,\" she sobbed.  She grunted louder as she tried flexing again, this time after a few moments of effort with no additional growth she fell to one knee and hung her head as she panted to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mind reeled. This should have been impossible but in the last 24 hours he had found himself redefining what was possible remarkably often and looking back on it it made sense.  There had been a moment towards the end of their sexual encounter where he had felt like was acting like a conduit for whatever source he was drawing this power from.  Thinking back over it he suspected it had something to do with the act of having sex with her while he was in the process of growing.  \"That's pretty impressive Amy,\" he finally said.  \"Especially since most people can't do that at all, I would be pretty happy with that if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy raised her head to look at Jason and her eyes burned with anger, frustration and desire.  \"I need more Jason, you have no idea what it's like to want something impossible for your entire life then find out it's not impossible.  I NEED this!  I need to be able to get bigger, as big as you at least.  Please Jason, you know you liked fucking me.  Doing it once or twice more wouldn't be a chore would it?\"  To emphasize her point she tore her bra in half down the center, letting her spectacular breasts free. Her nipples were erect and suddenly having sex with her again didn't seem like that bad of an idea.  She swept the security monitors from the desktop and leaned back, arching her body suggestively.  \"Take me again Jason, you know you want to.\"  She giggled at the sight of Jason's manhood straining against his clothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to think of all the ways this could turn out badly so he could find the strength to say no but it was getting harder to think clearly the more turned on he got.  He could feel himself slipping in the almost trance-like lust state he had been in earlier.</span></div></div>",

He was momentarily successful at blocking out the effects that watching Amy grope her spectacular breasts were having on him.  He even managed to ignore her sensuous, pornstar-like moaning.  He felt like he had regained his composure and was about to turn away and walk out the door when Amy arched her back, thrusting her hips provocatively towards him as she slid both hands between her legs and roughly tore her panties away from her body like she had her bra.  The display of physical strength and the sight of her moist pussy tipped him over the edge.  \"C'mon big boy...\" whatever she was about to say was cut off as Jason ungently scooped her up off the desk and kissed her forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped as their mouths parted and her face broke into a dazzling yet sultry smile as Jason unzipped his fly.  She gasped again as Jason plunged himself into her without preamble.  He grunted at the feeling of her wet, hot sex clamping down around him as she squealed.  Her ass thumped against the desktop as Jason unceremoniously dropped her and he leaned over her, rhythmically pumping.  He finally cupped a hand under her ass and lifted her slightly off the desk as his other arm went around her shoulders so he could control her better and soon they were both lost to the building passion.  It didn't escape Jason's notice that he was performing this feat of strength (effectively performing rapid fire bicep curls with the entire weight of one woman essentially resting in one hand) with almost no exertion at all.  Despite what should have been an incredible workout Jasons muscles barely reacted to the exertion.  Amy didn't fail to notice this either and began to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow for me Jason, grow for me,\" she goaded him as she clawed at the collar of his shirt, seemingly torn between wanting to rip it from his body herself or indulging her fantasy once again by watching him grow out of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason silenced her with another kiss and shook his head wordlessly.  He would be lying if he said he wasn't enjoying fucking Amy but he was pretty sure that the fact he had climaxed while growing had somehow bestowed some measure of new ability on Amy.  Despite being in the almost overpowering throes of raw lust Jason didn't think Amy needed to grow anymore, but that didn't mean he was going to pass up the chance to fuck her brains out.  He shook his head again and sped up his rhythm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason's body was working like a machine, fast, precise and with almost no exertion, he continued to cradle Amy as he pumped like a jackhammer while simultaneously guiding her along his cock.  His inhuman strength and stamina were barely taxed and her whole body began to twitch, starting with her hips and spreading quickly, as a powerful orgasm built within her.  Jason grinned as her back arched and she began to shriek with ecstasy.  He changed up his pace slightly as she began to recover from the orgasm, readying for his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer incoherent babbles of lust and pleasure subsided enough for Jason to be able to pick out actual words, \"Grow, please, grow...\"  Jason firmly shook his head again, still intending to finish this as quickly as possible then leave before Amy entangled her crazy self any further into his life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason quickened his pace again, thrusting into Amy a little more forcefully when the desk squealed and then shattered, Jason stumbled and almost dropped her on the floor before he regained his composure. Despite supporting the majority of Amy's weight in his arms Jason had still been leaning against the edge of the desk as he thrust and apparently the stress of being between the wall and his constant abuse had been too much for it.  Jason chuckled and readjusted his grip on Amy's bottom as he resumed his vigorous love making.  But something was different now and Amy sensed it immediately.  Jason's stance had shifted slightly to allow him to continue without the support of the desk and he could feel Amy's weight more directly in his bicep as he lifted her.  His body reacted to the marginally increased strain by pulsing barely larger but Amy instantly recognized that this had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!!!\" She shrieked.  \"Grow for me again baby!  You can do it!\"  She relaxed her legs, which had been wrapped tightly around his waist, causing even more of her weight to settle onto his bicep, dropping her weight onto his hand just as his flex was on its way up, causing his body to marginally grow again.  She giggled and did it again, tightening her legs grip on his waist then loosening it to drop her full weight, timing her bounce to coincide with the point in his flex where it put the most resistance on his muscles.  She did again and again, causing micro bursts of growth each time.  \"Oh yes, baby!  Grow!  Grow!  GROW!!!\"   Her excitement tipped her over into another orgasm and she quickly lost the control of her leg muscles she needed to continue the calculated challenging of Jason's muscles but he quickly realized the growth wasn't stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped pumping, holding Amy in his arms as she blissfully writhed on his penis, trying to put a stop to whatever process had begun in his body but it was too late.  His orgasm was on his way and his body was seemingly growing in reaction to it.  He opened his mouth but only a guttural moan escaped his lips.  Amy continued to thrash, her tight pussy continuing to urge the event along.  Jason could feel his muscles explode free from the confines of his shirt as his growth accelerate but it seemed distant, like it was happening to someone else far away.  He could barely even hear Amy's ecstatic shrieks of lust and joy as his entire consciousness seemed to be overwhelmed by the sensation of building energy that felt like it was emanating directly from his crotch.  The last remnant of his logical mind told him to get Amy off of his penis before he came inside her but his body was rigid, locked in the split second before orgasmic release. He tried to hold it back and his body swelled even larger, as though trying to hold it back was only making it more intense.  Amy's cries of joy began to turn to cries of concern as her pussy became impossibly tight around his penis while his entire body swelled larger than ever.  Jason cried out again as he tried desperately to hold back the tide of his orgasm and for a moment he thought he would be able to do it but then his head slammed into the ceiling of the office.  His concentration broke and he finally orgasmed.  It was primal and overwhelming, his vision blurred as he came seemingly endlessly.  Once more Amy convulsed like she was being electrocuted and Jason could feel himself growing ever larger throughout the entire orgasm until she had obviously blacked out again.  Jason gasped as continued to feel like lightning was discharging through his penis before he blacked out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened his eyes and groaned, momentarily unaware of where he was.  He groggily sat upright and let out a low whistle as he surveyed how massive he had grown.  Even without flexing or any effort he judged he was almost as large as his peak musculature would allow.  He was almost afraid to stand because he had the gut feeling that he was much taller now, perhaps too tall to stand upright in the office.  With a start as he realized Amy was standing nearby, currently ignoring him.  Her eyes flashed with a no longer concealed madness as she brought her palms together and flexed.  Her body instantly reacted and began to grow, quickly surpassing the thirty pounds or so of muscle that she had gained earlier.  </span></div></div>",

She arched her back and tore her panties away similar to how she had removed her bra.  \"C'mon big boy, make me as big as you,\" she gushed.  The image of Amy being as large as him had a certain appeal, but at the same time the though of this unstable girl being as strong as him or stronger was more frightening than it was arousing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, it was fun but this is where it ends, enjoy what you got out of it already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Amy snarled, she jerked up into a sitting a position and glared at Jason with rage filled eyes.  He thought again of her being as strong as him and involuntarily shuddered.  \"I didn't say this was over yet!\"  Amy pounced on him and Jason barely got an arm up in time to block a roundhouse blow to his face, she followed that up with two rapid shots to his stomach that hit hard enough to knock the wind out of him.  She attempted a leg sweep to knock him down as he stepped back but he caught his balance and grabbed her in a bear hug, pinning her arms to her side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea stud, c'mon, give it to me,\" Amy purred, rubbing her body up against his, grinding her crotch relentlessly against his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out,\" Jason growled, trying to maintain his resolve even though his level of arousal was making it extremely difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was able to hold out long enough that her mood switched again and she began to shriek and fight back.  She kicked at him and trie to force her arms loose from his grip.  He could feel her fighting back hard enough that her entire body was quivering from the effort and he realized she was trying to force herself to grow again.  After a few moments of intense effort she gasped and went limp.  Jason continued to hold her, uncertain whether she had actually passed out or was faking so he would let her go.  Finally he decided to risk it and laid her down on the desk.  He was relieved that she appeared to have passed out completely.  After a moment her newly grown muscle began to melt away and she was soon back to how she had originally looked.  \"Gorgeous but crazy as hell,\" Jason muttered as he crept out of the office, and swiftly snuck out the back door.  \"I really hope this is the last I see of her.\"  Jason jogged quickly back to his hideout and took a long cold shower.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before Jason could prepare himself she launched herself at him, her body plowing into his as her arms went around his neck and her face went to his.  \"You have no idea how hard it was to finish my entire shift like I didn't have one of the hottest guys imaginable waiting for me,\" she said when she finally stopped kissing him long enough for them to breathe.  Jason felt himself flush with some embarrassment at her compliment but she didn't seem to notice, instead she unwrapped herself from him and took a step back.  \"Are you even bigger than you were you earlier?\"  Nikki's voice was full of awe and an undertone of lust.  \"Is this as big as you can get?\" She chuckled nervously, \"I can't believe that's even a real sentence I just said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm any bigger, than last time you saw me\" Jason said, knowing full well that after his last growth experience with Amy he had added about another 40 pounds to his new \"normal\" body weight.  But he really didn't feel like getting into that with her.  \"And no, I can get much bigger.\"  Jason flexed a bicep and grinned when he saw Nikki get literally weak in the knees at the sight. \"Much bigger,\" he repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki put her hands on her hips and looked Jason in the eye.  \"Jason, I'd be lying if I said this wasn't freaking me out a bit but... Show me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here now?  Shouldn't we go to the bedroom or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bedroom huh?  Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I,\" Jason could feel himself turning beet red with embarrassment.  \"I just figured doing this right in front of the living room window was a bad idea,\" Jason finally mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed.  It was easy and infectious laugh.  \"Oh my gosh, you are so cute when you blush.   I'm just messing with you, lead me to the bedroom hot stuff,\" she laughed again.  Jason led Nikki to the bedroom, where he had already made sure the blinds were drawn.  She closed the door behind them and turned to Jason with a serious look.  \"Now what?  How does this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you want it to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Nikki was clearly confused by getting a question in response to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean how do you want me to do this?   Grow as fast as possible?  As slow as possible?  As big as I can?  I have to warn you I can get pretty big.  Should I grow out of the clothes I have on or do you want me to take them off first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, that's a lot, hold on and let me think.\"  Jason waiting patiently while Nikki mulled over the options he had laid out for her.  \"OK,\" she finally said.  \"Grow out of the clothes, that sounds pretty hot.  Then get as muscular as you can, slowish I guess so I can see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I can do that,\" Jason said confidently.  Jason strode to the foot of the bed then turned and faced her.  \"Ready?\"  Nikki nodded eagerly.  Jason nodded back then clasped his hands in front of his chest, leaned forward and flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could feel the power building in him and he let it build, only letting it out slowly.  He could feel the now familiar sensation of the shirt he was wearing begin to tighten around his body.  Nikki gasped as seams began to audibly tear apart.  \"Oh my gosh, this is so unbelievable,\" she breathed.  Jason watched her expressions change as his muscles filled out, growing thicker, more massive, bursting out of his clothing.  It was a progression from fearful awe to fascination to eventually straight up lust.  She was really getting off on this.  Not as blatantly or as disturbing as Amy but she definitely liked seeing him grow.  Her eyes were darting everywhere across his body, trying to see everything at the same time.  Finally he felt himself reach the point where he was as muscular as he could get, he stopped before he went through the increased density phase.  \"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh\" Nikki was repeating herself almost unintelligibly.  \"Oh my gosh, you are fucking enormous.  I've never seen anything like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get bigger,\" Jason said and Nikki almost swooned.  \"Not really more muscular, this is as muscular as I can get, but I can just get overall bigger.  Taller.... Bigger.\"  He shrugged and Nikki gasped as the cascade of rippling muscle this simple movement set off across his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I touch you?\"  Nikki asked hesitantly, reaching towards him as though she were half afraid she may burst into flame if she got too close to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea sure,\" Jason smiled and flexed a bicep for Nikki to feel and his grin only widened when he saw the look of amazement on her face as she examined his immensely engorged arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People do not get this big,\" Nikki breathed as she touched his arm, tentatively at first then more aggressively, prodding and poking at it.  \"Geez, it feel like stone,\" she said finally.  She drifted from his arm to his chest, caressing his mammoth pectoral muscles, squealing happily when he flexed, bouncing them up and down for her.  Finally she couldn't take any more.  \"You're damn right the bedroom was a good idea.  Now take me to bed before my panties soak all the way through.\"  Jason picked her up and gently laid her on the bed.  \"Be gentle, but not too gentle big guy,\" Nikki winked as she undid the top of her waitress uniform and then her bra.  Jason could feel the lust haze settling over him again as he regarded her bare chest.  She may not have Amy beat in the size department but Nikki still had one of the most perfectly formed pairs of breasts Jason had ever seen.</span></div></div>",

Nikki was in the throes of her third of fourth orgasm when Jason came to the realization that as much fun as sex with Nikki was, it would feel even better if he were growing.  And that got him thinking of how he had made Amy grow slightly which made him think about how much more fun it would be to make to love to Nikki and NOT have to worry about being so much stronger than her.  The more he thought about it the more reasons he came up with why he should try to make Nikki grow.  Like if he could make her grow large enough she could defend herself against Amy if she ever showed up.  \"Oh my God Jason, this feels amazing but I don't think I can do this much longer,\" Nikki panted as Jason continued to pump steadily.  Nikki gasped as he bottomed out again and again, his long shaft filling her almost as much as she was able to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost there baby,\" Jason grunted, pumping slightly faster, searching for that feeling and not quite able to find it, trying to focus on growing again.  Finally he lifted Nikki up, cradling her in his arms as he kneeled on the bed and he clasped his hands together behind her back and started to flex.  Nikki wrapped her legs around his waist and squealed as she bucked her hips along in time with his thrusting.  Slowly Jason felt his body growing harder and more dense, the bed groaned beneath them at the increase in weight.  Like before his vision began to swim and he became lightheaded as he hit his size limit and again he managed to push through it.  His vision cleared and he felt another incredible rush of power into body as he began to expand, taller and broader.  Nikki felt it too and she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason,\" she moaned.  \"Oh my God, you're getting bigger.\"  Jason flexed harder and it felt like his growth accelerated.  \"Jason, you're getting bigger inside of me,\" there was a note of fear in Nikki's voice but Jason ignored it, too wrapped up in his own building orgasm.  He was concentrating on the feelings in his body, trying to focus on what felt like a flood of power building in his body, the feeling of their being a plug or valve or anything to slow the flood of power into his body was gone, it was just the power within him, surrounding him filling him to the point of overflowing.  Nikki squirmed uncomfortably as Jason's growth accelerated even more.  \"Jason, it's starting to hurt, please stop.\"  The bed collapsed beneath them and Nikki squeaked with fright as she was startled.  Jason opened his mouth to try to comfort Nikki but all that came out was a groan of ecstasy.  This was it, his penis twitched in anticipation of blowing its load.  \"Jason,\" Nikki tried to wriggle out of Jason's arms but she may as well have been trying to move a mountain.  \"Jason you have to...\" Nikki voice cut off as Jason's penis finally exploded inside her.   Jason was so overcome with pleasure he couldn't even see anything but lighting behind his closed eyes and Nikki's body convulsed like there was an electrical storm raging through her body.  Jason groaned aloud, a long drawn out guttural roar that seemed to drag on as long as his orgasm and his body quaked with the intensity of his ejaculation.  Deep within his body it felt like he had become a conduit for the power he had been calling on, he grew massively larger as he continued to come, Nikki quivered in his arms, unconscious from the overwhelming sensations tearing through her body.  Finally Jason came down from this massive sex high and realized his head was brushing the ceiling even though he was kneeling on a bed that had collapsed flat on the floor.  He had no idea how tall he was now.  12 feet?  15 feet?  He had Nikki's unconscious body cradled in his arms, he gently laid her down on the bed and ran his hand over her forehead.  It felt like she burning up with a fever and a bright blue spark leapt from her skin to his hand like static but with a loud crack and enough force to sting his skin and leave behind an after taste of ozone in the air.  With great effort and a lot of contemplation on non sexy things he got his penis flaccid enough to remove from Nikki.  He was suddenly very worried for her, he had been completely out of control during his last episode and her breathing seemed unusually fast and shallow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki,\" Jason said trying to wake her.  \"Nikki get up.\"</span></div></div>",

Then maybe you shouldn\u2019t have started HULKING OUT DURING SEX!\u201d She fumed. \u201cGod fucking DAMNIT, Jason \u2013 what the hell! What the ACTUAL hell?!\u201d She pushed ineffectually at Jason to try and distance herself from him, even though she was utterly incapable of moving him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let her go and she just stood there, fuming in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?!\u201d She said after a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I don\u2019t know what came over me!\u201d He said, only partially lying. \u201cThis ability\u2026 it can make me lose control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo shit.\u201d Nikki said, in a deadpan that made Jason physically uncomfortable and recoil slightly from Nikki, even if there was no conceivable way she could pose a threat to him \u2013 especially given the inches in height and pounds in muscle mass his latest bout of excess had added to his baseline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Jason again considered telling Nikki about how he\u2019d wanted to give her his ability to grow but it seemed very difficult to bring up that particular topic without some awkward questions being asked and the last thing he wanted to do was explain to an irate Nikki that he\u2019d just gotten done fucking a psychotic Hulk/muscle/muscle growth obsessive \u2013 who, by the way\u2026 he\u2019d given some small fraction of his power to. The less said about Amy, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d She said grudgingly but then, she looked at Jason who looked so genuinely concerned and contrite and her look softened slightly. \u201cYou scared me! I mean\u2026 it was amazing to start with and even if I\u2019m mad with you, it WAS a huge turn on to see you grow but then you didn\u2019t stop and it started to hurt and\u2026 well, obviously I blacked out.\u201d She looked him dead in the eye and said pointedly. \u201cYou need to be careful! I\u2019m\u2026 well, just an ordinary girl! You\u2019re sexy as hell and even though I\u2019m still mad at you are turning me on something fierce right now but I\u2019m not ready for sex with the Incredible Hulk, OK? Especially when your dick is hulking out inside me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! I know! I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 this whole thing\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d Jason trailed off, not really sure how to explain it. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s this power inside of me and normally, there\u2019s a plug or a valve or something but when we started having sex and I started growing \u2013 it stopped being something I could control and became some kind of conduit.\u201d He shrugged.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason took a look around at the ruin contraption for a moment and shook his head at the incredible abilities he possessed.  He really was superhuman at this point.  Which made him smile with supreme confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only for a moment.  He really didn\u2019t want to risk everything and shook his head to pull himself back to the task at hand of finding that security tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of an engine idling pulled him over toward the Jeep he had easily overpowered.  As he neared, Jason snickered that it was still running.  The broken cables were attached, but he thrust his chest out with pride that he had succeeded in not only overcoming the mighty horsepower output, but had done so with one arm.  Peering at the Jeep for moment, he opened the door and turned off the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrinkling his face in thought, he began his search for the hidden security tape in the Jeep, but after a few minutes gave up, deciding it was perhaps somewhere else.  As he looked around, he glanced over at Amy, still in her sex coma.  Smiling, he gave himself a mental high five.  As much as he thought he might not have wanted to have sex with her, he knew that his base desires had other ideas.  And he really didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all, I am a god.  I\u2019ve got the strength of a superhero and the ability to grow bigger and stronger with a thought.  Nobody can stop me from doing whatever I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again lost in his own power lust, he momentarily thought about pissing Amy off and having her show the tape to the police just so he could force a challenge, but after a long pause he stuck to his decision to stay out of the limelight for the now.  So with his task back in his mind he peered at the front desk where he first saw Amy.  Was she really that careless to leave something so valuable in such an obvious place?  He sure hoped so as he walked around the equipment and lifted the plastic over the front desk and started opening drawers.  After finding nothing of interest, he found a drawer that was locked.  Smiling he glanced over at Amy to make sure she was still out and giving the drawing a hard tug, stripped the metal and caused his bicep to bulge up into a hard mound of muscle.  A loud snap followed and Jason pulled the drawer open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackpot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere lying on top of some other papers was an envelope with the words Jason Grows scrawled across it.  This was nearly comical.  Jason suspected she must have used the tape on a laptop or something to pleasure herself.  That thought also caused a pang of worry that she might have additional copies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the envelope he pulled out a crude looking tape that had to fit into an adaptor for a VHS tape.  He laughed at the thought that they still had this type of system available.  But it also gave him some confidence that Amy couldn\u2019t make any copies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his pocked he pulled out the magnets and rubbed them against the tape for several minutes.  Pausing he sighed as he stared at the tape.  How would he know if he was successful?  Maybe he would be better off just crushing the tape and taking full control of the situation.  As he contemplated his next move he was jerked back to reality with a loud shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHHH!  What are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood up and held the tape in his right hand and narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaking sure you can\u2019t manipulate me anymore you crazy bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy ran toward Jason as fast as she could while screaming,  \u201cNOOOOOOOO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was taken by surprise, but quickly raised his arm up and began to squeeze, deciding her reaction told the story that this was very likely the only copy.  Amy reached him quickly with her arms outstretched toward his hand, and she grabbed his forearm in a useless attempt to pull his arm down.  Jason smirked as he pulled his arm back away from her grip and crushed the tape in his hand with a loud crunch.  Amy backed up with a crazed look on her beautiful face, her sensuous, naked athletic body shaking with frustration as Jason worked his fingers to crush and tear the tape before slamming the ruined tape onto the desk to finish the destruction.  Amy glared at him through angry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastard!  You fucking bastard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed.  \u201cListen Amy, this was fun and all, but there was no way I was going to let you bribe me into being your massive muscled dildo.  If anyone is going to be in charge from now on, it\u2019ll be me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stood there fuming, breathing hard and mumbling incoherently.  But she also appeared to calm down and her eyes narrowed.  Jason shook his head.  This girl really was nuts.  Best to leave her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step forward to get out of the gym and put this strange ordeal behind him, Amy reached out with her right hand and placed it on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think your going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped and scoffed.  \u201cWhere ever the hell I want to go.  Whatever you thought we had was nothing to me.  Now get out of the way, you know you can\u2019t stop me.  With my power, nobody can stop me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grit her teeth as Jason turned and took a step, causing Amy\u2019s hand to slide across his shirt.  She quickly shuffled her feet and stood back in front of Jason with her hand back on the center of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI warned you not to make me angry Jason.  I also asked you to show ME how to grow bigger, just like you.  Well it turns out that I\u2019m feeling rather powerful myself.  And I\u2019m really angry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason rolled his eyes and reached out with his left hand to pull her arm off her chest with intent of pushing her away, harshly if necessary.  But he never got the chance.  Amy pulled up her other arm into a bicep flex and Jason\u2019s eyes widened when he saw and HEARD the muscles across her arm grind upward and expand outward recklessly, bulling up muscles on top of muscles!  Her fitness bicep expanded into the size of a baseball, up to the size of a softball, up passed the size of a cantaloupe, appearing larger and harder and more defined than any woman he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the crunching and crackling from her bicep continued as the mighty she muscle continued to expand, spreading wider across the base, causing Amy to moan with pleasure.  Jason stared dumbfounded as her forearm was being forced away from her swelling bicep as the peak pushed up well over her thickening shoulder and into a literal mountain of girl muscle!  Now it was now Amy\u2019s turn to scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Jason.  That little nothing we just had has must have given me the same super power you have.  I can FEEL the extreme power flooding across my body, pounding like a sledge hammer into my magnificent MUSCLES!  That intense electric shock you gave me during sex is being AMPLIFIED into my very being!  As if my muscles are charging with greater and greater and GREATER strength!  Like my mighty girl muscles are being SUPER charged!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason kept on staring at Amy\u2019s flexed bicep as the massive mound continued to surge larger with actual discharges of electricity sparking and snapping around the expanding mass of muscle that pounded up what had to be 30 impossible inches around.  And the damn muscle was still growing!  Striations rippled along the sides, the peak danced as it pressed higher and small veins pulsed with the growth.  He hardly noticed that Amy had taken a step toward him, bending her other arm while keeping her hand flat against his chest.  He also failed to notice that it wasn\u2019t just her flexed arm that had added muscle, but her entire body!  Amy was now pumped up with enough muscle to blow away any of the huge men that ever come into the gym.  The massive muscles surged and pumped across her feminine frame in nearly cartoonish size and curved incredibly around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up into Jason\u2019s eyes from her 5 foot 6 inch height, Amy spoke with soft, lusty tones, pulling Jason\u2019s attention down toward her beautiful face and blue eyes that sparkled with unnatural brightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just like you Jason, I\u2019ve grown stronger too.  I can FEEL it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips her crazy eyes widened.  \u201cWant to feel it yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could say anything, Amy pushed her arm forward against Jason\u2019s chest, sending him flying backwards, flipping over the desk and tumbling along the ground until he hit a shoulder machine with a thud.  Jason groaned with pain that was quickly turning to rage.  He shook his head and grit his teeth, slowly standing up and flexing his body upward with muscles.  His shirt and shorts tore against the raging muscles and his height pushed up to 6 foot 9 inches.  Jason growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook you crazy bitch.  You may have gotten some of my abilities, but are forgetting just who you\u2019re dealing with?  Don\u2019t think I care about hitting a woman.  Especially one as nuts as you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had released her bicep flex and sneered at Jason from behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhh.  You want to fight?  This is going to be great!  Then we can have some more muscle sex!  I can\u2019t wait to grow with you as we grind out bodies together, pushing our muscles to even greater size and strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked incredulous and shook his head as her off-putting words caused his growth to momentarily stop.  Amy simply smiled, took a step forward and pulling her now massive arms up over her head, quickly pulled them down to obliterate the desk in front of her with a terrible BOOM and crunch.  She took a step forward and keeping her eyes locked on Jason reached down at either side of the desk and flipped them away.  Either side tumbled and cracked as one half crashed into some weights and the other half crashed into the front wall.  She then marched purposely forward, her mighty muscles surging larger across a growing body that was pushing up toward 6 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now clear to Jason that he was going to have fight Amy.  And with a confident smirk he was OK with that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Letting out a hard breath, Jason pulled his attention back to the task at hand.  Knocking this crazy bitch out.  As she neared, simply striding forward, Jason pulled up his right arm and swung it toward her head.  But even though he was quick with the punch, Amy expertly ducked under his massive arm, leaned to one side and delivered a hard punch to Jason\u2019s thick midsection like a sledge hammer, her tiny fist digging into muscles harder than steel like they were warm clay and causing him to gasp and lurch to one side.  Amy quickly brought her other arm up into a fist and delivered a hard downward punch to the side of his head, causing a bright flash across Jason\u2019s eyes as he dropped to the ground with a hard thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, Jason struggled to get up to his hands and knees, his concentration broken and his growth halted again.  Amy took a step back and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really know how to fight do you?  I mean you took out all of those guys in here before because you were so much stronger.  But now that you\u2019re facing someone who can match your strength, you\u2019re nothing but a nerd trying to fight a bully.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose comments caused Jason to see red.  Recovering quickly, he stood back up and growled, pushing his muscles larger as his entire body shook with anger.  Amy\u2019s eyes widened once again with irrational excitement as she could feel the wild electrical shocks tear through her own muscles, ripping and rebuilding them, forcing them larger, harder and stronger beyond her wildest dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnleashing the beast within, Jason quickly pulled his arm back again.  \u201cI\u2019ll show you what a nerd can do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Jason went for a larger target, Amy\u2019s massive chest.  With a roar he stepped forward and delivered a hard punch with all of his massive strength straight into Amy\u2019s left breast.  Amy saw the punch coming, but was so enamored with the erotic feeling of her growth and the thought of being in a real fight that she simply bent her knees, leaned forward slightly, tensed her massive arms at her sides and waited to see just how hard Jason\u2019s punch would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to Amy\u2019s delight, Jason\u2019s large fist slammed into her flexed up chest with a loud THUD, barely sinking an inch into her incredible breast before meeting the resistance of her super powered boobs.  Jason roared with pain and frustration as his mighty punch was blunted and the force was pushed back through his arm and up into his shoulder.  Jason stumbled back and shook the stinger tingling through his arm.  Amy\u2019s face lit up as she squealed with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!  Oh!  That was WONDERFUL!  Hit me again!  Hit me HARDER!  Make me grow stronger.  Watch me become more powerful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was slipping away from rational thought.  He grit his teeth and with another roar pulled up his left arm and punched her right breast.  Only now, Amy was flexing harder and her muscles rumbled larger across her torso and her pectorals and breast melded into a wall of feminine terror.  What once were a pair of soft DD\u2019s were surging forward into the biggest, strongest chest ever flexed.  Massive, rippling pectorals blasted forward as inch after inch of muscle expanded forward with pink strips of might!  Her chest was flexed up a foot thick with bulging, pulsing muscle ridges, jagged striations and throbbing veins.  Nipples punched straight ahead as the most powerful chest ever flexed was over two feet across and more than a foot from her top to the bottom.  With her mind reeling, Amy willed the most intimidating torso ever tensed to expand even larger, harder and more muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s next punch didn\u2019t sink into her flexed up torso whatsoever.  His punch collided with muscles much harder than steel and once again shook Jason\u2019s entire body and he stepped back in frustration.  But at this point there was no stopping him as his muscles continued to grow larger and he kept on pounding on Amy\u2019s chest.  BOOM after room shaking BOOM echoed off the walls as Jason continued to pound on Amy\u2019s expanding torso with grunts of pain and frustration while Amy yelled with excitement and ecstasy.  After nearly a minute of punching, Jason\u2019s head was growing dizzy as he had pushed himself to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gasped for breath and could only stare with befuddlement at Amy\u2019s smiling face, nearly hid behind twin beech ball sized pecs of pure power.  Before he could put a rationale thought together, Amy released her mind altering flex, pulled her right arm back and grinned like a Jack Nicholson in the Shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stepped forward and with the strength and speed of a Tomahawk Missile, shot her small fist into Jason\u2019s massive chest with a horrible crunch as she tore through his steel hard muscles once again and cracked the ribs below.  Jason\u2019s 8 foot tall mound of muscle went sailing backward and collided with a horrible metallic crunch into a huge squat machine, bending the large structure around his bulk.  He wheezed with pain as his head spun and his body was encased in a metal prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stepped forward and stared down at Jason with disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really did give it everything you had and you couldn\u2019t even dent my girlish boobies.  Everything you had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then paused as her crazy eyes lit up again.  Amy was barely over 6 feet tall and her muscles with her muscles as large as Jason\u2019s, except for her mighty pecs, but now that she was no longer tensing them, they had reduced somewhat as well.  Amy tilted her head to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what happens when I give it everything I\u2019ve got.  I mean I was definitely pumping my chest up, but there was more to left in the tank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pulled up her right arm.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we find out, hmmmmmmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s cloudy muscle lust mind was slowly clearing up.  But his huge body remained and the humiliation from the nutcase woman that he had turned into an advanced super version hung over him.  And now\u2026. Now she was going to humiliate him further.  It wasn\u2019t enough to be stronger than him, to be a better fighter, to showcase a harder, tougher body.  Now\u2026 now she was proceeding to pull up her bicep with intent of flexing up larger muscles than him as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pulled in a lusty breath and let the air out with small shivers as she tensed her fist and muscles, already oversized for any man, much less any woman began to expand once again, building into a literal mountain of muscle across her arm.  One flex bulldozed her bicep up as large as a molded bowling ball, pushing the base hard against her forearm and shoulders and building up her peak to her wrist.  Muscle fibers roped their up the expanse and striations and pulsing veins rocked up the sides as loud cracks of electricity discharged as if her muscles could barely contain the super strength the mighty muscles contained.  Amy hummed as Jason began to sweat, and his member began to rise in reverence to the goddess before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhh, I can just FEEL the power in my muscles Jason.  The strength to curl a battle tank with one arm with my indestructible, super powered biceps.  Biceps just aching to grow, to expand, to crystalize with super duper power!  The mega watts of electric energy are surging, making me stronger the more I flex!  Can you feel my might Jason?  Sense the power in my super muscles?  And there is more to flex Jason.  More muscle to build.  Mmmm, oh yes, moooooooore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped as he watched Amy bicep grow larger, pushing her peak up to the top of her fist, then to the her eye level, then to the top of her head as more power flooded her system and Jason watched as the light behind Amy was being obscured by the gigantic bicep, flexing a long, deep shadow across this body and highlighting the cascade of electric energy poring up her mountainous muscle as the circumference of her bicep approached 80 inches around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, Jason, I\u2019m finally hitting my limit!  I\u2019m getting a bit light headed, but let me give one last squeeze.  One last HARD tense to push my power and strength to once impossible heights!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a horrific KA-POW from an electric explosion of power, Amy flexed her bicep, turning her Herculean bicep into a missile of mega destruction as muscles continued to pile on top of muscles!  The strength to punch out a 100 car freight train at full speed thundered into her gargantuan bicep!  Amy moaned and shivered as her watermelon sized bicep pushed up so large the pulsing peak pushed up beyond the top of her head as showers of electric discharges crackled noisily until her bicep reached 100 impossible inches around!  Well over twice the size Jason had flexed when he was an 8 and half foot tall behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed and giggled, drunk with power and she swayed a bit.  Shaking her head, Amy released her mind altering flex and regained control, pulling her bicep back down, but maintaining the massive muscles across the rest of her naked, Amazonian frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, little man.  Like I said earlier.  Time to have some serious sex.  I want to feel that giant cock inside me so my power packed vagina muscles can pull you over the limit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason struggled to recover, his frame had remained the same and his member was at full attention, which was now something far more dangerous than the police seeing him taking out those men.  He had dished out his strongest punches at full power to Amy and she laughed his incredible strength off without a scratch.  She had flexed up muscles over twice his size and only grew up to a little over 6 feet tall.  He could only imagine how strong she was now.  And if she milked him again, would she grow even stronger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy licked her lips and took a step forward, Jason struggled to pull himself out of his metal prison with low metallic squeals.  But even if he could get out, he had no hopes of stopping Amy from doing anything she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo hope at all.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't in the gym anymore or his house. He didn't recognize the room or the bed he was in. He felt incredibly lethargic, but as much as he would rather lay in bed for the rest of the day, he needed to figure out where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled back the covers with more difficulty than he was used to. He looked down at himself terrified, \"My muscles are gone...AGAIN!\" he thought to himself. he groped uselessly at his original un-muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately flexed all his muscles and tried to grow bigger. \"OW!\" A stabbing pain shot through his head and he immediately released. <br>\r\n\"I must have pushed myself too hard or something. I better hold off on that for a little while at least\" Jason wondered if he would ever be able to get his muscles back. With how fast everything was happening, he couldn't be certain of anything anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of food cooking drifted into the room and entered his nostrils. Jason got up and walked toward the door and heard distant humming/ He almost continued downstairs until he remembered he was totally naked. He looked back on the bed and saw the pants he wore from the day before. Jason picked them up to look at them. There was not way this would work. He could probably fit his whole torso down one pant leg. He looked around for other options. He found many pairs of athletic shorts in different sizes that Amy had the other day. Amy! This had to be her place. Jason wondered how she would react now that his muscles were gone and what he should do. <br>\r\n\"One thing at a time.\"<br>\r\nJason managed to find a pair a shorts that fit his scrawny frame and went downstairs. There were no shirts, so this would have to do. He slowly made his way out of the bedroom and downstairs toward the melodious sound of humming. Jason went down and could see None other than Amy cooking in the next room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing him, she brought her arms up for a big morning stretch. She wore short black athletic shorts filled up by her powerful ass and showed off her smooth, defined legs. Her big breasts sat proudly on her chest and struggling against the otherwise loose white t-shirt she was wearing. Her chest pulls the shirt upward exposing a few inches of her comparatively tiny waist. Her midriff  is covered by a feminine set of abs that ooze the essence of both strength and sexiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to see Jason staring at her. Her face flashed with excitement, then concern. \"Oh my God, you're so small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever ego remained within Jason had been promptly stamped out with that statement. He wondered if it was a mistake not to run to the door first chance he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you passed out you started to get smaller and smaller. At first I didn't know what to do, but eventually you got to a size that I could actually move you. So I decided to take you to my house.\" She started to cry, \"It was my fault! I pushed you too hard and now I've ruined your life. I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok. I didn't know this would happen either. Thanks for taking me to your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm\" She wiped the tears from her eyes, \"You can still grow back, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'm still tired from last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" she said nervously. \"well, why don't you eat and we can figure this out after, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate breakfast. It was surprisingly good, but Jason couldn't help but feel kinda humiliated in his weakened state next to this busty bombshell of a woman.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finish eating and Amy turns to him and says:</span></div></div>",

There he found a room with a standard multi-function weight machine in the middle and several free weights on a rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to grow when you exert yourself, so let's see if these do it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy directed him to a workout bench then turned around to grab two 50 pound off the rack A sizeable bicep popped up in her arm as she did, making Jason's dick twitch. He was surprised he hadn't been rock hard this whole time. She walked back, her face bunched up a little at the effort and placed the weights down in front of me.<br>\r\n\"Try pressing these. They may be a little heavy, but you'll grow into them\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed the weights and leaned back. He could barely get them into the starting position, much less lift them. He grunted and pushed as hard as he could, but the weights would not budge and he would not grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked in front of Jason and leaned down to his face, giving Jason a view of her cleavage. She rested her tits on Jason's chest and whispered seductively in his ear \"Please baby. Grow for me\" and kissed him. Jason felt a spark from her lips run into him and down through his whole body. Suddenly, he felt the weights he was straining to hold on to get a little lighter. He slowly pushed up. The weights slowly gave way to his efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy could feel her boobs being pushed back by Jason's chest. He was growing again! \"YES!\" she moaned. She pulled back and ran her hands over Jason's torso as it slowly began to fill with muscle. He pushed the weights to the height of the lift.The muscles in his arm swelled out from their formerly flabby prison. Jason's confidence grew along with his muscles. His whole body swelled with strength as he went down for another rep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's nipples grew hard as Jason's chest and then abs started to rise like dough from his torso. Then the little big of fat on Jason's stomach melted away and cut grooves into his growing 6 pack. Amy tweaked her nipples and started to grind against Jason's cock through his pants. His dick responded in kind as it too began to stretch and lengthen to its full nine inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not working his lower body, his legs swelled into thick pillars of muscles. With all three of his legs growing, he was quickly running out of room in his pants. Sensing this, Amy slid back off of his pelvis to watch him outgrow his shorts. Amy pulled off her t shirt, revealing her huge gravity defying tits, nipples rock hard with arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Amy's perfect naked torso caused Jason to have a brief surge in growth. His pants tore to shreds and the effort as his whole body swelled 2 inches bigger at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of this made Amy cum on the spot \" FUCK YES! Grow!...growwww\" she buckled over, quivering for a moment at the pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continues to pump, the weights barley providing a challenge anymore as his body swells back to its size when he first got big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's cock, now freed stiffened straight up in the air, throbbing as precum streamed down its length. Overcome with arousal, Amy leaned forward and wrapped her tits around Jason's cock and began to titfuck him with abandon. \"Bigger. So. fuckin. biiiiiggg\" She continued to moan as Amy sucked on Jason's tip poking through her cleavage, licking him wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then felt that spark from before move through his body and centralize in his dick as he explodes in orgasm into Amy's awaiting mouth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned toward her and she quickly looked away , her cheeks visibly flush with embarrassment.  \"I'm sorry, I can't help it,\" she said sheepishly in response to his questioning expression.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help what?\"  Jason hesitated with a forkful of food halfway to his mouth.  Why would this gorgeous girl have any reason to look remotely self conscious around him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flush deepened and she pushed a bit of food around her plate in silence before finally answering.  \"I can't help fantasizing about you growing again.\"  Jason could feel his own cheeks blushing as she hurried on, \"I mean this has been a fetish of mine almost as far back as I can remember.  Other girls were dreaming about boy bands but I wanted to fuck the incredible Hulk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason snorted with surprised and found himself gagging on a mouthful of food.  \"Wow,\" he said when he was finally able to breathe again.  \"Umm, I don't even know how to respond to that,\" he tried to end with a chuckle but it just trailed off and he felt his cheeks flush even harder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy waved her hand, \"You don't have to say anything.  I think I pretty much wore my fetish on my sleeve for you already.\"  She shrugged and popped a bite of food into her mouth.  \"What's your thing?\"  She asked after she had swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sex thing,\" she clarified.  \"Everyone has one, you totally know mine, now I'm curious about yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you work at the gym?  Seeing buff dudes helps you with your sex thing?\"  Jason asked, purposefully trying to deflect her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Amy said as she shook her head.  \"I mean, don't get me wrong.  I like buff dudes.  But for me it's not so much about the dude BEING buff, it's about the transformation, the growth, the clothes ripping,\" her voice got lower and huskier as she continued.  Jason found himself leaning closer to hear her as she leaned closer to him with a conspiratorial grin.  \"But you didn't answer my question,\" she finished quietly before sitting up again.  \"C'mon, it's not like it's a big deal, everyone has a kink or a fetish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stared blankly at Amy for a moment until she began gesturing impatiently.  \"Boobs,\" he finally blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boobs?\"  Amy repeated back with a question mark attached.  \"Just boobs?\"  She looked mildly disappointed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big boobs,\" Jason clarified.  He could feel his cheeks burning hotter than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy arched an eyebrow.  \"OK,\" she pulled her phone out.  \"Like who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"  Jason was caught completely off guard by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like whose boobs?  My girls are just average,\" she cupped one of her breasts and hefted it, making Jason's heart skip a beat and his penis twitch.  \"You have to have somebody in mind when you say big boobs, whose boobs are big enough to turn you on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis conversation felt like it was taking a surreal turn, \"I don't know, someone like Jordan Carver or Denise Milani,\" he found himself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrolled through her phone and frowned thoughtfully at the screen, \"they're nice but I call bullshit,\" she said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, I call bullshit.  These girls have nice boobs but nothing outlandish.  You looked terribly embarrassed before you said \"BOOBS,\" she imitated Jason's blurted exclamation.  \"You wouldn't look embarrassed if these were the boobs you fantasize about, there's someone out there with boobs that are so big you're afraid I'll think you're a freak if you're honest. Whose boobs really get your sex thing going?\"  Amy was staring at Jason as though she could see through his soul, which was making him feel simultaneously awkward, embarrassed and painfully aroused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I really like is big natural breasts,\" Jason felt like he was hearing someone else talking, \"boobs like Wendy Fiore, Samanta Lily and even September Carrino.\"  He shifted in his seat and tried to surreptitiously adjust his shorts to make his erection less uncomfortable.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Amy nodded thoughtfully as she scrolled through images on her phone, \"Wow, those are some boobs.\"  She finally said before glancing down at her own breasts with a wistful expression.  \"Maybe I'm not as average as I thought, these are barely big enough to get your attention aren't they?\"  Jason opened his mouth to protest but Amy continued talking, not allowing him to get a word in.  \"The weird thing about wanting to fuck the Incredible Hulk though is I never really thought about what it would be like to be with Bruce Banner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"  Once again Jason felt entirely disorientated by this conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying I think you're cute.  It also doesn't hurt that you have a big dick.\"  Amy laughed at the look of utter shock on Jason's face.  \"Don't act surprised big guy, I saw you naked when you outgrew all of your clothes for me,\" she paused for a moment, \"and I'm saying that I liked what I saw.  I think we should....\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason wasn't used to receiving this kind of fawning attention from girls, especially not ones he would describe as \"smoking hot\" and as disoriented as the feeling was making him the realization that Amy was sexually attracted to him even in his normal body hit him like a splash of cold water in the face.  A succession of conflicting thoughts raced through his mind from \"holy crap I would love to bang Amy\" to \"would that be cheating on Nikki?  What do I even actually have going on with her?\"   Remembering Nikki jogged his memory further and he futilely patted down his shorts trying to find the phone he knew wasn't there.  \"Where's my phone?\"  Jason demanded, interrupting Amy mid sentence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once Amy looked startled.  \"Oh,\"she glanced around the kitchen, looking uncharacteristically uncertain.  \"I know I grabbed it before we left the gym.  Maybe it's in my bag?\"  She almost bolted out of her chair and hurried out of the room, returning just as quickly with a gym bag cradled in her arm as she rummaged through it.  \"There it is,\" she said with a note of triumph, dropping the bag as she presented Jason's phone to him with a flourish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason almost hesitated before taking it from her.  Her poise and confidence seemed like it was back with a swiftness that was starting.  He couldn't help but notice she was arching her back and assuming a pose that made her breasts look as large as possible.  The fact she had referred to them as \"average\" earlier seemed shocking to him and the subtle shift in her posture made him wonder if their discussion of his attraction to large breasts had actually made her self conscious.  \"Thanks,\" he said as he took the phone from her.  She beamed in response and sat down so quickly her breasts bounced dramatically enough to make Jason wonder if it was by design of just a coincidence.  He dragged his eyes away from her breasts and unlocked his phone.  He was surprised that Nikki hadn't texted him since he'd definitely been unconscious long enough for her to have noticed Jason was no longer where she had left him.  The only thing he seemed to have missed while he was out was a voicemail from a phone number he didn't recognize.  Curious to see whether or not it may be important he checked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the voice in his ear was obviously Nikki he was surprised.  \"Jason, you need to leave the house right away, I just got asked some weird questions about you at work and I'm pretty sure they're watching me, they'll probably figure out about my uncle's place soon if they haven't already.  Be careful.  Try to find somewhere safe, I'll get in touch with you when I can.  Don't call this number back, it's not mine.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything OK?\"  Nikki asked after Jason hung up and set his phone down.  \"Was that your girlfriend?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't sure if she was asking because he had looked as concerned as he felt or because she was fishing for whether or not he was single.  \"I'm not sure,\" he said slowly, still trying to digest what Nikki had just told him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure if she's your girlfriend?\" Amy asked playfully.  \"How many side pieces do you have if it's that hard for you to keep track off?\"  Her tone was playful but there was a flicker of what looked like worry in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head.  \"I'd have to have a main piece before I could have a side piece,\" he said, choosing his words carefully and deliberately not addressing even within his own mind whatever status he may or may not have with Nikki.  Besides, it sounded like he needed to find a new place to hide from the police.  Maybe this was it?  Amy regarded Jason with a look he could only describe as calculating and he could almost hear her inner struggle between wanting to definitively know if Jason was unattached or willing to leave it slightly ambiguous.  These glimpses of uncertainty in Amy made Jason realize that despite her amazing beauty she was still only human which also oddly made him feel better about his own insecurities.  In the instant Amy looked like she had reached a decision and opened her mouth Jason interrupted her again.  \"Hey, I'm sorry I cut you off before, it sounded like you were going to ask me something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's smile broadened and she looked more than happy to shift topics.  \"Well as I recall you promised me dinner.  But then you bargained me down to lunch.  But then I ended up feeding you instead.  Why don't we go have a real date?  Get to know each other better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed.  \"How much better do we need to get to know each other?  We already talked about our kinks and fetishes,\" he chuckled again and Amy laughed with him.  \"Besides I'd rather stay in,\" Jason said after worrying about the possibility of being seen by a cop in public.  It wasn't until Amy's expression turned noticeably seductive that he realized how the statement might be interpreted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay in?  What did you have in mind?\"  </span></div></div>",

She leaned forward as she licked her lips before flashing a dazzling smile and squeezing her upper arms together under her breasts, forcing them upward and outward while pulling her shirt so tight Jason could clearly see the outline of her nipples and aureola through the fabric.  She could not possibly be more overtly sexual and Jason's breath caught in his throat when he tried to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" he finally said.  He awkwardly shifted in his seat, trying to find some relief from how uncomfortably tight his shorts had become against his sudden erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's eyes narrowed and Jason felt a flicker of worry behind his arousal.  For a moment she looked more calculating than seductive.  \"I think you do,\" she said slowly after a moment, her expression softening as she slowly stood up.  Jason found he couldn't keep his eyes off of her nipples once they entered his eye-line, they had become erect in reaction to her shirt rubbing tightly against them.  He barely noticed her smirk as she clearly recognized what he was staring at.  She took a step around the table towards Jason, her smirk widening while she blatantly rubbed her forearm across her nipples and arched her back, improbably stretching her shirt even tighter as her nipples became even more obviously aroused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fidgeted again, his penis now so hard it was mildly painful.  \"Look... maybe...\" Jason sputtered.  He began to stand but Amy took another step towards him and placed her fingertips on his chest as she made a shushing sound.  He protests trailed off and he let her gently push him back down into the kitchen chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine.  You like what you see.  I'm glad my boobs are big enough to even get your attention.  I just wish they were bigger though, as big as you need them to be so I'd be the only woman you'd ever be interested in.\"  Jason tried to assure Amy that her breasts were fine but she startled him by raising a leg, placing a foot against the corner of his chair next to his right hip and kicking hard enough to make the chair swiftly rotate almost 90 degrees, turning Jason away from the table and aiming the tent in his shorts directly at Amy.   She smiled broadly.  \"Oh my, you're even bigger than I thought.  A shower AND a grower.  Lucky me,\" Amy said with a giggle.  She licked her lips again as she dropped to one knee in front of Jason and ran a finger across his shorts, following the outline of his shaft.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Jason tried to protest but Amy ignored him, pulling the waistband of his shorts down with both hands, fully exposing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked his tip and he shuddered in response.  \"I get why you don't want to go out, the police are still looking for you, they actually called me again while you were sleeping.  They wanted to know if I knew anything else or could remember anything else from last night.\"  She nonchalantly pulled her shirt over her head and tossed it aside as she talked.  Jason's sucked his breath in sharply at the site of her exposed breasts.  They were even more impressive than he had even imagined.  \"I didn't tell them anything of course, I could never give you up,\" her tongue darted out again, this time lingering and sliding slowly downward, Jason gripped the sides of chair tightly and his entire body trembled.  \"So don't worry about taking me out.  I get it, I'll just keep you happy here.\"  Her head bobbed down again, her lips briefly wrapping around the tip barely longer than a kiss.  Jason gasped as her tongue flicked across the tip again as she broke contact.  \"Besides, all I can remember anyway was seeing you grow out of your clothes,\" she said with a giggle.  \"Holy shit, there has never been anything that has turned me on more in my entire life.\"  As Jason was becoming more and more aroused he began to feel light headed.  It was very similar to how he had felt just before he blacked out and he felt a stab of worry over what may happen if this continued.  He made a half-hearted attempt to stop Amy and get up but she put her hands on his hips and pushed him back down again then wrapped her lips around him, slowly sliding downward like she had with her tongue earlier.  His vision blurred and he felt a disorientating mixture of arousal, fear and disconnection from what was going on.  \"I just wish I was superhuman like you are,\" Amy said after coming up for air again.  \"I don't know what I do to be able to grow muscles like you can. I hope you can it again soon, it was SO hot.\"  Jason moaned as Amy teased him a bit more.  \"Do you even like muscular girls Jason?  Or just big tits?\"  Amy either wasn't expecting an answer or was just asking a rhetorical question because she didn't wait before putting him into her mouth again.  This time she also wrapped her breasts around him and Jason felt his consciousness fading further and further away the closer he was getting to an orgasm.  As his mind drifted he found himself imagining what Amy would look like alternately as a musclebound version of herself or with the largest breasts he had ever imagined a woman possessing.  Her earlier question echoed in his mind and he tried to decide which version he found more attractive.  Amy suddenly made a gagging sound and Jason felt jerked back to reality by a sharp pain in his dick that he only realized was Amy's teeth digging into him as she jerked her head back.  There was a surprisingly loud pop as her lips separated from him.  \"Holy shit, I didn't realize your dick could grow!\" Amy's surprised exclamation was cut off as Jason finally ejaculated.  She sputtered as Jason blacked out entirely for a moment.  He quickly regained consciousness, feeling even more drained and lethargic than he had when he had awoken in Amy's bed earlier.  Amy was standing over him, still with a look of shock on her face with ludicrous amounts of his cum covering her face, dripping from the corners of her mouth, and splattered across her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Jason slurred.  He felt embarrassed, awkward and once again extremely self conscious about his scrawny physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Amy gasped, snapping Jason's attention back from his introspection and the weird fog he was feeling.  He eventually realized that Amy was growing...</span></div></div>",

Jason's tired eyes were locked onto Amy's impressive cum-soaked tits. Thrust out like this, they looked even larger than they had before, Jason thought. No...wait. They WERE bigger! Not by much but there was no mistaking her tits were larger, even with this enhanced perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's happening,\" Amy moaned. Her voice gets steadily higher and less coherent as something builds inside of her. \"I'm growing! I'm growing! I'm-\"  She then arches her back again and screams out even more intensely as she thrusts out her chest again and again in regular pulses. With each pulse, her breasts pushed out slightly further and grew slightly rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Jason's lethargic state, he felt himself grow incredibly aroused once again, barely able to hold onto consciousness, but unable to let his body tear him away from the sight before him. He thought he must be dreaming as Amy was going from busty bombshell to a body straight out of one of his fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's chest was now nearly double the size it had been originally as the pulses stopped and her body began to relax. She was panting heavily and her body sparkled with a thin layer of sweat. After giving herself a minute or two to recover, she came back to her senses and seemed to again realize what it was that had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. my. GOD!! My boobs are huge! She grabbed them in each hand, causing her biceps to tense slightly from the weight as she examined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Jason both marveled at how large, yet firm and perky her breasts were. They were nearly gravity defying save for only a bit of natural sag to form a perfect little teardrop shape. Jason estimated she must have been as large now as Jordan Carver in her heyday, but way more fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell me you could grow other people too! This is amazing!! How did you do it? Can you only change boobs? Can you do it again?\" She assaults him with question after question in her excitement without giving Jason time to answer, much less process what had just happened. How did this even happen anyway, he thought. Tired as he was, he was going to assume it was a dream. An amazing dream, but a dream all the same. Too tired to think anymore, his eyes pull shut again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason woke up slowly, like he was emerging from a fog.  His body, and even his mind felt heavy and sluggish and he drifted for a while at the border between sleep and consciousness before increasing hunger pangs finally drove him fully awake.  His stomach growled loudly and he rubbed at it absently before finally opening his eyes.  He was momentarily disorientated by the unfamiliar room before slowly recognizing that it he had been in it before.  Jason struggled for a another moment to remember why he felt he should recognize it when a flood of memories finally came rushing back.  Memories of waking up in this room, eating breakfast with Amy, flirting with her then getting an amazing blow/boob job from her that ended with his dick growing impossibly large followed by her breasts doing the same before he finally passed out.  Jason sat up with a gasp as his hand flew to his crotch to verify whether or not his memories were reflecting reality or whether it had just been an unusually vivid dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, it got smaller for some reason, not really sure why.  I'm pretty sure it's overall bigger than it was before but it definitely shrank while you were sleeping,\" a voice from slightly behind Jason said almost exactly what he had been thinking after his brief self-inspection.  He turned his head to see Amy was standing in the doorway to her bedroom watching him.  \"You've been asleep so long I was starting to get worried, how do you feel?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mouth dropped open at the sight of Amy's now titanic bust but he couldn't seem to catch his breath to make words come out.  Her breasts were stuffed to overflowing into what looked like a brand new sports bra and they bobbed and wobbled dramatically as she crossed the few steps from the doorway to the side of the bed.  Despite how foggy and sluggish his brain felt he was positive her breasts were even larger than they had looked before he passed out.  They were easily the largest he had ever seen in real life and rivaled all but the most extreme he had seen online.  His penis was erect and rock hard in an instant and his mouth went dry.  \"You're bigger,\" he finally croaked out, gesturing weakly towards Amy's bust, \"even bigger than before I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled and adjusted her sports bra, causing shockwaves and endlessly entertaining ripples across her bust.  \"Yea, they've been slowly growing pretty much since you doused me.  I think they might finally be done but I'm not positive.  We really need to figure out how you work before we try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try again?\"  Jason finally jerked his eyes away from her breasts to look her in the eyes.  She was grinning broadly and her eyes sparkled with an intensity that he felt a little off putting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she sat on the side of the bed, one foot remaining on the floor while she twisted at the waist to keep her gaze locked with Jason's.  The pose showcased the dramatic contours of her profile, including how trim her waist was and it also gave Jason a view straight down into the seemingly bottomless cavern of her cleavage.  \"I can't wait to grow again.  Though maybe you can give my muscles an upgrade next time so I can be a proper She-Hulk for you.\"  Amy flexed a bicep bringing up an already respectably sized and defined peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She-Hulk?\"  Jason's mind sluggishly attempted to switch gears from his now raging libido.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, otherwise I'd be afraid to fuck you  when you're fully hulked out, you might hurt me accidentally,\" Amy giggled.  \"I mean, I'd probably do you anyway, it would just be too sexy to pass up.\"  Her skin flushed as she visibly had to refocus her thoughts away from sex.  \"But like I said, first we have to figure out how this works before we try anything again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figure what out?\"  Jason asked absently, finding it hard to think about anything besides Amy's massive breasts and having sex with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're going to mess around again we need to figure out how your dick works.  You almost broke my jaw last time with your surprise growing penis and I'm not sure how that would have worked out if we'd actually been fucking.  Also it would be awesome if you could hulk out for me next time.\" Her skin flushed deeper as she obviously pictured him doing just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering Jason slowly stretched a hand out towards Amy's chest.  It was almost as though he couldn't control himself, her breasts felt like they had their own gravitational pull and he wasn't able to resist the pull.  When his hand closed around her breast and he gently squeezed Jason was worried for a moment she would be angry at his groping but Amy's smile surprisingly grew even wider.  \"Do you like them?\"  Amy barely paused long enough for Jason to nod dumbly.  \"I'm so glad, I hoped you would.  They look like they're the kind of size you're into.  You can make them even bigger if you want, that's fine with me but you definitely need to give me some more muscle first if you plan to.  I'm in pretty decent shape already but these are a bit heavy.\"  She demonstrated by cupping her breasts and jiggling them, Jason could feel the weight bounce under his grasp and he was surprised how heavy they actually were.  Amy finally stood up and readjusted her breasts in her sports bra.  \"Now come on, you need to eat, I heard your stomach growling from out in the hall.  Maybe after that we can get started trying to figure out more about how you work.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked upward at Amy her breasts dominated his field of view.  Even though he was hungry he was finding it hard to think of anything right now other than Amy's massive boobs, sex, and his erection that had been throbbing intensely since he'd put eyes on her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason wanted her so badly, but after considering he had already passed out twice recently, once from just cumming, he agreed to eat first. As well as simply being the smarter, healthier option, he didn't want to make Amy think he was some frail weakling. Besides, it definitely wasn't a bad idea to try to figure out this ability he seemed to have. It took a lot out of him and he wasn't exactly sure how it could be controlled, if it could be controlled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing Jason's silent acceptance, Amy smiled softly and headed back to the kitchen. Even with her back turned, Jason could still see her enormous breasts slightly at her sides. After waiting a few moments to let his dick calm down, Jason got up and began to follow. He looked out the window and saw that it must have been late morning the next day. \"I really was out for a while,\" he thought to himself. \"This 'passing out' crap better not become a regular thing with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason made his way back to the kitchen. He recognized a flash of deja vu from the previous day as he walks in to see Amy preparing food again. But this time, there were two massive differences jiggling on her chest with all the little movements she made. She turned to face him, Jason locked onto every subtle movement her tits made along the way. \"Just in time, big guy\", she said winking; her eyes drawn to his crotch. Not able to hold back for even a few moments of looking at her impossible breasts, he struggled to keep his dick from popping out of his waistband. \"I made you some sausage, but it looks like you brought more than enough.\" She giggled both at her corny line and Jason's embarrassed expression. \"No need to be embarrassed, really. I love how I drive you crazy. You're my dream come true and now, I can be yours,\" she said huskily. \"But! We'll have time for that soon,\" she quickly shifted tone. \"Eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the food over to the table and they both sat down to eat. Amy sat directly across from him, letting her breasts rest on the edge of the table, giving her some much needed relief from their tremendous weight and a deep line of cleavage that Jason was already taking full advantage of. The food was again great. Jason was impressed by how well Amy cooked, as well as how caring she was. All with a body straight out of one of his wet dreams. she was almost too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's talk about that magic dick of yours. I definitely started growing right after you blew your load on me. It was crazy! I was actually thinking when you covered my chest about my tits growing to match what you showed me earlier, and they did! Why didn't you tell me you could grow other people too??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, I didn't know. It surprised me as much as it did you. Honestly, I don't know much about this power I seem to have or how it works. Other than being able to 'hulk up'. I'm not entirely sure how to control it. And even that has been hard for me to control lately,\" he says reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" she stared thoughtfully at nothing in particular. \"Well, let's think about this. Maybe you get to choose how someone grows when you cum on them. What were you thinking about when you came?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biiiig boobs?\" Amy teased, giving her boobs a little shake. Jason silently nodded, his face turning red. \"See? You were thinking about boobs, and voila, I got boobs...But, I guess I was thinking about getting bigger boobs when you came on me too.\" Her face suddenly flushed at the idea. \"What if <b><i>I</i></b> get to choose how I change? If only I hadn't stopped thinking about growing into a she-hulk at the last minute...But then again, that might not be it either. What do you think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: When Jason ejaculates, he can make the girl he cums on changes depending on what he is thinking of at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: When Jason ejaculates, the girl he cums on (in this case, Amy) changes depending on she is thinking of at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: See \"Other options\" for more</span></div></div>",

A good workout always perks me up,\"  Amy began clearing their breakfast dishes and stacking them in the sink for later cleaning.  \"I have a pretty decent home gym setup downstairs, let's hit that and get you past these blah's then we'll try to figure out how your magic works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was amazed at how calmly Amy was adjusting to the reality warping events happening too her and around her.  When she was done Amy motioned for Jason to follow her and he stood up, feeling relieved that he at least felt less lightheaded.  Maybe he had just been really hungry.  He followed Amy through a short hall that looked it led to her back door but instead she went through a side doorway he hadn't noticed.  This door lead to a stairway going down to the basement.  Once again he marveled at the fact her breasts were now so large they were visible from behind her and he attempted to adjust his shorts for what felt like the millionth time.  It seemed like he had been in a constant erect state since he had seen her and her new bust.  \"Wow,\" he said softly when Amy flipped on the lights and her home gym was revealed.  Once again her tendency to understate things took him by surprise.  Her \"pretty decent\" home gym looked like it had everything including an impressive amount of plates for free weights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy began a stretching routine and Jason was unable to tear his eyes away from her.  \"Aren't you going to warm up?\"  She asked once she noticed he wasn't doing anything other than staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, of course,\" he mumbled.  He awkwardly went through an approximation of the same routine as Amy until she finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm excited you're here.  I usually can't get the most out of my weight rack without a spotter,\" she chattered almost non-stop as she set up a barbell on a weight bench and started loading plates onto it.  During the course of this Jason had drifted towards the head of the weight bench, he wasn't entirely sure what being a spotter entailed but he had vague impressions of the spotter standing at the head of the weight bench and maybe catching the weights for the person exercising if they started having trouble?  Whatever thoughts he was having went straight out of his head the moment Amy lay down on the bench and he found himself staring straight down her cavernous cleavage.  Her breasts settled to her new prone position, creating dramatic new contours and bulges he wouldn't have previously imagined.  \"Ready big guy?\"  She tilted her head back to meet his eyes and smiled broadly.  Without waiting for any response from Jason she refocused her attention on the bar and unracked it.  \"Oops,\" she giggled as the lowering bar almost immediately squished into her breasts.  \"I should have seen this coming.\"  She exhaled and inhaled sharply as she pressed the weights upward again then tried lowering it at a different angle, she repeated this a few more times, trying to bring the bar down as low in as possible at a few different angles before re-racking the bar and sitting up with a sigh.  \"I probably have to set up for an inclined press,\" she said finally.  \"I never even thought about how much harder that would be to do with huge boobs.\"  Amy got up from the bench and wiped it down with a towel.  \"Ready for your turn, stud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason snapped out of his boob trance and sputtered an affirmative.  \"Yea, yea, of course.\"  He lay down on the bench and wrapped his fingers around the checkered surface of the bar.  For a moment he thought about asking how much weight was on it or even having Amy take some of the weight off but he couldn't bring himself to do it.  He didn't want to appear weak in front of her.  With a mix of fear and the recurring shame in his physique he took a deep breath and unracked the bar.  His arms shook as he lowered it and the bar resisted his efforts to raise it again.  His face reddened and his muscles burned as he intensified his efforts to complete at least one bench press. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be OK Jason?\" Amy asked with an obvious note of concern in her voice.  \"Do you want me to take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ignored her and kept trying to complete the press.  His muscles burned and his blood pounded in his ears.  Jason felt the now familiar sense of an impending blackout closing in on him until the rising thrill of panic drove a surge of adrenaline through him, giving him barely enough strength to push the bar high enough to rack it again.  He sat up with a jolt as he panted deep ragged breaths, desperately trying to catch his breath and calm his nerves.  \"Oh Jason, you did it.  You did it,\" Amy said.  For a moment Jason thought she was talking about completing his bench press attempt but as she kept repeating herself with an almost hysterical fervor Jason realized something else must be going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Jason turned to look at Amy but she dashed around him to stand at the base of the weight bench.  He almost fell over trying to track her movement.  Jason rubbed at his burning, aching chest muscles and stopped, realizing how excited she was and why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were literal tears of joy in her eyes as she stared at him.  \"You're growing again,\" she whispered, confirming what his own hands had just felt.  It quickly stopped and he was nowhere near as big as he has been before but he had definitely grown noticeably more muscular from the exertion.  The weird fog he had felt since he woke up seemed like it was gone and for a moment he wanted nothing more than to get back to exercising so he could grow even more again but then Amy tore her sports bra in half with her bare hands, revealing her immense breasts and his breath caught in his throat.  \"Please, Jason,\" she pleaded as she similarly tore his sorts apart to reveal his throbbing erection, \"please make me grow more muscular like you, please make me your she-hulk.\" She licked and sucked at him while she distractedly rummaged under the weight bench with one hand.  Quickly seeming to find whatever it was she was after she held up a bottle of something she apparently expected Jason to recognize.  \"This will make things even better,\" she reassured him as she squirted some into her hand and began rubbing her breasts down.  Jason glanced at the bottle she tossed aside as it rolled away.  Posing oil?  The significance of the oil and her intention was quickly apparent as Amy wrapped her now oiled up breasts around his cock and began to work her magic.  \"Come on baby, make me bigger, I know you can do it,' Amy continuously encouraged him.  \"I need to be big enough to handle you when you're fully hulked out.  I need to be strong enough to easily handle these huge tits you gave me, I know you can do it.  Bigger.  Bigger baby, please.\"  Amy's voice seemed to fill Jason's mind and he kept picturing her bigger and bigger, not just more muscular but also taller, thicker, wider, a super imposing Amazonian powerhouse.  The last wisps of his rational mind began to worry he might going too far when Amy's exclamation of surprise startled him out of his reverie.  \"Holy shit, it's bigger than last time!\"  Jason opened his eyes to see his penis had grown shockingly large and Amy was fighting to wrap her lips around even the tip to capture as much cum as possible as he began to blow his load.  His eyes rolled back in his head and his entire body began to go limp.  Her sounds of sucking and gagging were all he could hear for a moment.  Until she happily began to murmur, \"here it comes, I can feel it happening.\" Jason's head was swimming as he tried to raise it to see what was going on.</span></div></div>",

He realized with horror that his muscles, the fifteen or twenty pounds he had managed to regain, were rapidly fading away again and even the new prodigious growth of his penis was vanishing.  He hadn't even finished falling backward before he had blacked out entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, JASON!\"  Jason's eyes fluttered open as Amy shook him awake.  He recoiled backward in surprise at how large Amy now was.  \"Jason, you're missing it!  It's happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's brain sluggishly processed that he must have only been blacked out for a short period of time and more importantly, that as massive as she already was, Amy was apparently still growing.  \"Oh shit,\" he whispered under his breath as he looked upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was beaming ear to ear with the brightest smile he had seen from her yet as she stood up to her full height, and up, and was obviously continuing to inch even further upwards.  Jason barely had the time to register that she was definitely growing taller when she struck a dramatic double bicep pose.  Every muscle on her body was literally rippling as they grew thicker and more dramatically defined.  She went from pose to pose and flex to flex, drawing attention to every part of her growing body.  \"Look at these triceps Jason, they're amazing, look at that horseshoe shape,\" she bubbled.  \"Oh my god, look at my ass,\" she squealed as she spun around.  Jason had already thought Amy's ass was incredible but now it was surprisingly even more impressive.  The back seam of her spandex shorts split as her hips continued to widen and she giggled as she turned to face Jason again  \"These abs, my calves, oh my god I never thought I'd have delts like this.\"  Amy posed and flexed and fondled each muscle as she called them out, her excitement continuously escalating.  \"Even my boobs are growing again,\" she said as she happily squeezed them, her abundant breast flesh overflowing her hands.  \"This is so crazy Jason, I love it!\"  Amy laughed as a hard flex of her thighs caused the remnants of her shorts to fully disintegrate, followed immediately by her panties similarly blowing off her body.  Amy's massive growth finally slowed to a stop, her hair brushing against the 8 foot basement ceiling.  Jason's eyes roved over every bit of her fully exposed body, taking in the immense musculature, the feminine curves, the imposing height, her physical presence was almost overwhelming and Jason had never been more turned on in his entire life.  He could hear a low chuckle rumbling in Amy's chest and Jason tore his eyes away from her body to look Amy in the eyes again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy bent down and picked up an empty weight bar from the floor, giving Jason an incredible view of her amazing ass.  Still chuckling to herself she twisted the metal bar into a loop.  It was done so quickly and so effortlessly that Jason flinched as the metal shrieked and then separated from the extreme force brought against it.  Barely even acknowledging the impressive feat of strength she had just performed Amy let the pieces of tortured metal fall to the floor as she grabbed a hundred pound plate.  With the same lack of obvious exertion she attempted to fold the plate in half but it quickly broke into two pieces from the pressure.  Amy's laugh was punctuated by the surprisingly loud crack of the cast iron.  She dropped one half and with a flick of her wrist embedded the other half in the concrete wall across the room.  It had moved faster than Jason's eye could even follow and he flinched once again at the sound of it's impact.  Amy paced around in a small circle, like a restless cat as she regarded her reflection in the mirror mounted on the wall opposite where the broken metal plate was now stuck in the wall.  Finally she flexed her entire body as hard as she could, her every muscle engorged and quivering.  She held the flex so long her skin was flushing a deep red before she released it and roared, it was a roar of joy and ecstasy but with an undercurrent of rage that made Jason's skin crawl.  He struggled to stand but the feelings of being light headed and fatigued overwhelmed him and he sank back down to sit on the weight bench.  Amy finally turned away from the mirror and looked at Jason as though she had forget he was in the room.  She smiled, it was a chilling empty smile that never reached her eyes, and she stalked slowly towards Jason.  He was as much aroused by seeing her unbelievable figure in motion as he was frightened by her displays of great strength and her vaguely ominous expression.  \"You have no idea how amazing this feels,\" Amy finally said as she reached Jason.  She towered over him and he could barely see her face past her breasts as he craned his head upward.  She flexed a bicep and slowly ran her fingertips across the immense peak.  \"Well I guess you used to.  It's a shame you seem to be broken now.\"  She chuckled mirthlessly as Jason struggled to stand and failed again.  \"So weak now though,\" she said with a slow shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just grew,\" Jason said defensively.  \"I can probably do it again.  We need to experiment more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you grew, just a little bit.  Then you lost it all again.\"  Amy placed a foot against the weight bench and pushed gently, sliding the bench up to the wall behind Jason.  She slowly bent over until her eyes were level with his and she put a finger in the middle of chest, pushing slowly until his back was against the wall.  \"I bet you can't grow huge like you used to anymore,\" she said as she gradually began increasing pressure.  \"Not more than just a few... measly... pounds.\"  Jason found himself gasping as the air was pushed out of his lungs and his ribcage began to creak alarmingly.  Amy smiled coldly.  \"I just don't know if I need you anymore.  Fucking the incredible hulk doesn't seem as important anymore now that I am a hulk myself,\" Amy smirked coldly and Jason felt as though his ribs were on the brink of shattering from the ungodly pressure she was applying with just one finger.  \"Give me a reason to keep you alive Jason.  A good reason.\"  Jason's brain churned as he tried to think of some way to avoid being squashed like a bug.</span></div></div>",

And it sounds VERY tempting,\" Amy giggled and provocatively lipped her lips.  \"it's not really a good idea.  I mean can you imagine?  I'm going to have a hard enough time living in this body.  Do you see me?  I'm almost eight feet tall!  I'll barely be able to fit through doors, or even drive a car.  Realistically there is such a thing as too big.\"  She pondered Jason silently as her face slowly transitioned from erotic pleasure to cold, calculating hatred.  \"But you do bring up one of the reasons I don't like the idea of letting you go.  Even if I don't want to get any bigger than this you might find someone else who does.  You might find someone to feel pity for you, to take care of you.  And you might get the idea of making them grow bigger than me to challenge me and I.  Will.  Not.  Let.  That.  Happen.\"  Amy emphasized each word with another increase of pressure until Jason cried out with pain as her fingernail broke the surface of his skin.  Jason weakly brought his hands up and tried to push Amy away in effort to get even a bit more relief but it felt like he was trying to push down a brick wall.  Amy laughed out loud at his efforts.  \"Oh honey, is that all you have?\"  Jason squirmed as she wiggled her fingernail, it felt like it was grinding directly against his breastbone.  Amy's laugh trailed off as her face grew cold again.  \"Why don't you try again?\" she said, drawing back her finger a bit but still leaving it rest lightly on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gasped and coughed as he struggled to ignore the burning in his lungs and gather his thoughts.  \"We don't know if this is permanent or not yet,\" he finally said.  Amy honestly looked surprised.  \"I've been shrinking after I've grown, what if you end up shrinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned and hefted one of her breasts with her free hand.  \"My boobs didn't shrink,\" she sounded gruff and irritated but there was a trace of doubt in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You barely had them a day, we don't know how this works yet, what if you eventually end up shrinking?  If that happens and I'm gone you not only lose your incredible hulk to fuck, you lose being a hulk yourself.  And you would never have another chance to get either of those back again.\"  Jason had to stop talking to try to catch his breath again and he watched anxiously in silence as Amy wrestled with a number of emotions like doubt, fear, and anger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she snapped.  She stood up and glowered down at Jason.  \"Fine,\" she repeated and scooped Jason under her arm.  He didn't even have the chance to protest before he was locked down under her arm with his face buried against the side of her mammoth bust to the point he could barely breathe or even see anything.  Under different circumstances he may have enjoyed this but instead he struggled to keep breathing as Amy carried him out of the basement.  The stairs creaked alarmingly under her weight on the way up and based on her direction of movement afterward he was carried out of the kitchen but instead of heading toward her bedroom she brought him somewhere else.  There was the sound of her opening a door and throwing things around before she finally let him go and shoved him through a narrow doorway.  \"Here, I'll figure out what to do with you later.\"  Jason barely had the time to register that he had been shoved into a hastily cleared out closet before the door slammed behind him and plunged him into darkness.  This was quickly followed by the sound of something heavy being placed in front of the door and Amy's heavy footfalls receding.  Moments later he realized that he must be almost directly above Amy's basement gym because the sound of heavy steel plates being moved around came from below his feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"  Jason muttered to himself as he groped his way silently around the small enclosed space he now found himself in.  It was a tiny, seemingly empty closet with what felt like cheap wooden paneling on the walls.  He thought for a moment about testing the paneling to see if he could break it but quickly dismissed the idea since Amy was very likely to hear him.  There was a small shelf just above his head that felt like it went across the back half of the closet and a rod for hanging clothes mounted under it.  He could reach the bare light bulb over his head but he wasn't able to find a light switch or pull chain to turn it on.  He tested the door and his suspicion was confirmed, something far too heavy for him to move was keeping it from opening even the slightest bit.  He sank down to sit on the floor and discovered his prison was so small he couldn't even fully stretch his legs out.  The clanking from below stopped and was soon replaced with the sound of Amy noisily pleasuring herself to an eventual orgasm.  He could picture her worshiping herself in front of her posing mirror and awkwardly tried to ignore the fact that even imagining Amy's new body had him painfully erect.  He sighed.  \"What the fuck am I going to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason seriously considered the idea of trying to escape.  He even began testing the strength of the closet paneling by bracing his feet against each side of the door frame and using his legs to push his back against the wall behind him but just before the point he was sure it was going to break he stopped.  Once again he was worried about making noise and how Amy might react if she heard him.  Even if he was able to break through the wall and get out of the closet he didn't think he'd be able to outrun Amy.  And he knew he would never have any hope of fighting against her if she did catch him.  Instead he pushed thoughts of escape out of his mind and tried to relax.  He sat cross legged, ignored his current situation, closed his eyes and let his mind focus on the events of the last few days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back to every time he had grown since this had started.  His inability to control his growth since Amy had talked him into pushing himself beyond his apparent ability made him angrier the more he thought about it.  Even more rage inducing was that despite the fact he could no longer grow himself, Amy had benefited from his ability consistently ever since he had \"broken\" himself.  He involuntarily grit his teeth as he thought about Amy.  It seemed like since he had gone back to the gym to see her that she kept him constantly off balance.  He hadn't felt like he had a moment's peace since he had woken up in her house.  He forced himself to stop going down this train of though.  Jason exhaled deeply to calm himself and tried to meditate his way back into contact with his ability.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost track of time as he sat in the dark trying to regain the connection to his ability.  So many times it felt like he almost had control of it again only for the feeling that he was going to pass out to almost overwhelm him.  Coming back from the edge of yet another near black out he explored his thoughts again.  He was trying to pinpoint when things had changed, trying to figure out why he could no longer make himself grow but could make Amy grow.  The clanking of steel plates came from below him as Amy launched into another workout to test her new body.  Thinking of Amy involuntarily made his penis stir and he sighed loudly in frustration.  He tried to block out the sounds of her exercising and also to ignore his rising arousal so he could resume his meditation when he felt something surprising.  The source of power he had felt so strongly a few days ago was back but it wasn't where he had been used to looking for it.  If he had been asked to describe his previous experience he would have said he was finding this power at his core, probably the center of his chest.  Now it felt much lower, deep in his groin and he could feel his erection throb harder and more intensely as he tried to reconnect to this source of power.  He couldn't begin to understand how or why it had seemed to move location but it suddenly made sense of some recent events.  Jason gasped with effort as he tried to pull the source back to the center of his core.  His body trembled and he felt short of breath but despite all that he was relieved that he didn't feel like he was about to pass out.  As a matter of fact he was feeling more and more energized the closer if felt like he was getting to realigning the source of this energy within his core.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis focus was broken at the sound of whatever heavy object being used to block the door moving roughly aside.  He gasped in pain as he could feel himself lose control of the source of his power which triggered an intense stabbing pain in his head, followed by a similar pain in his eyes as the door to his prison being thrown open and light flooding in.  He blinked to clear his eyes until he could clearly see Amy standing over him.  Her flushed skin was covered with a sheen of sweat and veins engorged from her recent workout traced their way over her biceps and forearms.  \"Jason,\" she growled.  </span></div></div>",

He felt him slip past what he came to know as 'the point of no return', but the black out didn't come. He had somehow made it past, for now at least. He didn't know if it was the adrenaline surge or Amy's voice calling him back to himself, but he had managed to get past the worst of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down. The first thing he noticed was how huge his penis was. Amy was sitting up straight on the weight bench, and his cock stretched all the way up her torso and rest just under her chin, all the while nestled between her incredible breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it started: Amy bent over slightly, clenching her teeth as her whole body tightened, as if she had just finished working out every muscle in her body to exhaustion. Then she started to grow. \"Yessss,\" she whispered. \"Oh god, I'm growing, I'm growing.\" Her shoulders and upper torso widened as her chest pushed out even further as mighty pectorals grew under her breasts. Her back stretched into a mountain range of power with deep canyons of definition cut in between. Amy subconsciously began to sit a bit straighter as the weight of her breasts no longer phased her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked down at herself, completely enthralled as her body grows. She lifts her arm up and flexes into a strong bicep, slightly larger than it had been originally. She relaxes her muscle and flexes again, this time swelling even higher. 'Grow for me...sooo..much...biggerrr.\" She moaned as she flexed and unflexed again and again, as her arms grew with every flex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's hips stretched outward, her waspish waist staying about the same to making an unbelievable hourglass figure. Her abs thickened and grew outward as her once tight girlish core swelled into six bricks of pure strength. The outline of an eight pack stretching into view. Then Amy started to rise upwards a few inches, not from standing or growing taller, but because her swelling ass was pushing her up from her seat on the weight bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy briefly snapped out of her muscle trance and yelped in pain as she jumped up and grabbed her ass, Her shorts were stretched incredibly tight over her widened hips and incredibly round butt. And her legs! Jason didn't notice when she was sitting, but her legs had gotten huge! Her thighs were swollen into thick pillars, much too big to pull her shorts down around. \"Come one, just a little more, more more..\" she pleaded with her own body to grow more, so she would tear right out of her shorts and make one of her long time fantasies come true...But it didn't come. Just on the precipice of release, Amy stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

The door clanged shut behind him with a note of finality that he should have found chilling but instead wrote off as cliched.  He rubbed his wrists where the handcuffs had left marks and looked around.  The only other occupant of the holding cell was a boy about his own age with long unkempt hair, a black t-shirt with the logo of some heavy metal band and jeans with gaping holes in the knees.  The other boys eyes widened as he looked at the blood stained apparition in front of him.  \"Jesus Christ, did you kill somebody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged.  \"I don't think so, just beat the shit out of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" the boy seemed to consider this.  \"Anyone I might know?\"  He asked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was surprised when the other boy let out a short barking laugh.  \"Good for you, that bloody git had it coming.  Colin, Colin Frazer,\" the boy offered his hand and Jason shook it.  It was interesting that Colin didn't seem to care that he now had semi dried blood sticking to his hands.  \"Do you smoke mate?\"  Colin asked taking a cigarette out of a crumpled pack and lighting up.  He waggled the pack at Jason who took one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, never tried it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough time to give it try then,\" Colin lit the smoke and Jason coughed but kept going.  The smoke bit into his lungs but seemed to steady the mild shaking he had noticed in his hands the last few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it,\" Colin offered.  \"So why did you beat the shit of old Brad?  I'm sure there's a good story behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you in for?\" Jason asked, ignoring Colin's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five finger discount.  Got nicked at the mall lifting a CD.  Or two... or three,\" Colin grinned.  \"But that's not as interesting as whatever led you here all covered in Brad Taylors blood now is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No I don't have a criminal record now, I have to go to court later though.  I don't think the other guy is dead, they would have told me if I was getting booked for murder.  Yea I'm fine, all this blood is from the other guy.  No I didn't stab him, I punched him a lot and probably kicked him a few times.  No, I don't have the court date yet.

He showered, dressed and grabbed a bagel quickly and quietly before heading out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wandered aimlessly, realizing after a moment that by habit he was walking right to Laura's house.  He almost detoured to the beach because Laura never went there but really, with the body she had in this reality?  She probably lived at the beach.  Jason turned on his heel and decided he was going to the mall.  Indoors, opposite end of town from the beach, he hopped on a bus and tried to avoid looking at anyone during the ride.  He was surprised when someone thumped him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi mate,\" Jason looked up to see Colin.  He had just boarded the bus and he flopped into the seat ahead of Jasons.

He wasn't sure if he had any friends in this reality since Laura had ditched them, if not then he had to make some new ones.  And he was fully expecting it when Colin pulled him to the side and whispered, \"Right mate, this is the store I got pinched at yesterday.

Jason waited a minute before following them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs predicted the clerk kept an eagle eye on Colin who loitered near the front of the store, handling every piece of merchandise he could reach.  Wendy had walked lazily around the store and Jason wasn't sure if she had grabbed whatever it was they were planning on stealing.  He hung out near the back flipping aimlessly through the rack of posters until Wendy passed behind him and whispered, \"Here.\"  He took the CDs without looking looking at her and stuffed down the front of his pants untucking his shirt to hide any strange angles.  \"Good work, now leave.\"  Wendy hadn't even stopped walking, she drifted to a clothes rack and stopped.  Jason flipped through a couple more posters then slowly walked out of the store.  Colin was in the middle of arguing with the clerk about his right to shop in the store as Jason passed.  As Jason walked through the theft detection system his heart was hammering in his chest.  He was relieved when it was clear that the alarm was not going off.  Jason grinned and kept walking until he reached the food court and sat on a bench in front of the fountain where he could watch the music store entrance.  Colin wasn't far behind him and it was only a couple minutes before Wendy joined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work mate,\" Colin thumped Jason on the shoulder and took the CDs that Jason handed to him.  \"Is there any \"shopping\" you need us to help you with while we're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned, \"Not today, maybe next time.\"  Jason's voice trailed off as he caught sight of Laura on the other side of the food court.  Nikki was with her as well as two other girls he didn't recognize.  Nikki recognized him right away and waved, which he returned without thinking.  </span></div></div>",

Laura glared at Jason like she would murder him is she could and he found it easy to return the expression if not the sentiment.  \"I thought you said you were going to call me today,\" Nikki said as she approached.  She looked as though she wanted to greet Jason with a hug but he remained sitting so she awkwardly let her arms drop.  Who was Nikki and how did he know her Jason wondered once again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today isn't over yet, I was gonna call,\" Jason said finally.  Nikki looked Colin and Wendy with obvious distaste.  \"Nikki, this is my friend Colin and his girlfriend Wendy.  Colin, Wendy, this is Nikki.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin looked over Nikki, lingering on her well presented C-Cup breasts and smiled.  \"Pleased to meet you.\"  Wendy gave her habitual bored wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Nikki turned back to Jason, \"Can I talk to you for a minute?  Alone?\"  She said with a pointed look at Colin and Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and stood up, letting Nikki lead him a few yards away by his elbow.  \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?  Is that all you have to say to me?\"  Nikki folder her arms under her arms under her breasts, pushing them up and out and Jason had to make an effort not to stare into her cleavage.  \"Who are you hanging around with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cColin and Wendy?  I thought we just covered that.\u201d  Nikki rolled her eyes and sighed with exasperation.  \u201cI met him in jail last night,\u201d Jason said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou met him in jail last night?  So what now?  You\u2019re BFF?  Jason what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, why would you care who I hang out with?  And it\u2019s not like I had people rushing to visit with me while I was locked up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki glowered.  \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, I called you.  And I kept Laura from\u2026\u201d Nikki trailed off and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what?  Forming a lynch mob?  Beating the crap out of me herself?  That should be hard for her, she\u2019s only three times my size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason what has happened to you?  Where did this whole tough guy thing come from?  Do you have any idea how freaked out everyone is?  You almost killed Brad.  ALMOST.  KILLED.  HIM.\u201d  She repeated.  \u201cI get that you\u2019re pissed off at Laura, and for whatever reason she\u2019s pissed off at you.  But I had always thought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki glared at him.  \u201cYou exactly know what.  I had always thought if you could ever get over your thing with Laura that we could try again; maybe make it work this time.  But no, forget it,\u201d tears started streaming down Nikkis cheeks and Jason was momentarily speechless.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this to myself anymore.  Grow up Jason,\u201d  She wiped at her eyes, smearing mascara and makeup.  \u201cJust grow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNikki, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said forget it Jason,\u201d Nikki said, cutting him off.  \u201cAnd watch out for Jim and Terry, they\u2019re going to try to get back at you for what you did to Brad.\u201d  Nikki turned and walked away, ignoring Jasons attempts to continue talking to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mind hadn't even finished processing the fact that he had apparently dated Nikki at some point in the past and now it was trying to deal with the fact that he had apparently just fucked up his chance to get back together with her.  He soaked in the details of her legs and ass (showcased nicely in tight Daisy Dukes) as she walked away and remembered how she had looked in her tight, low-cut top and how attractive her cleavage had been.  He pictured her eyes, her smile.  \"Fuck,\" he muttered, finally turning away and sitting on the bench next to Colin again.  \"Can I bum another cigarette?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mate,\" Colin handed him a smoke and lit it for him before lighting one of his own.  Jason ignored the fact that he was leaning against a \"No Smoking\" sign and inhaled deeply.  He fought back the urge to cough and stubbornly finished the cigarette with single minded intensity.  When he was done he had another.  \"Want to talk about it mate?\"  Colin finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Colin stood up and stretched.  \"I'm afraid we're wearing out our welcome and it may be better to leave on our own before we're forced to go.\"  Colin nodded his head toward the far side of the food court and Jason saw two mall security guards heading their way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him almost wanted to stay and fight but ultimately he decided it would be foolish to do so.  These weren't the people he was angry with.  He made a mental note; he was at war with Laura and her jock/prep clique.  He grinned wolfishly at the thought, remembering how it felt to beat down Brad and thinking of how it would feel to do it again to someone else.  Maybe this Jim and Terry?  He wondered if those were the two who had been hiding behind Nikki while he was kicking Brad.  \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, grinding out his cigarette on the No Smoking sign, grinning at the burn mark he left behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed Colin and Wendy back to the bus stop and they talked while they waited for the bus to arrive.  They boarded the bus and began the trek back home.  \u201cDo you fancy stopping by mate?\u201d  He asked Jason finally.  \u201cThat bass setup I was telling you about is at my place at the moment.  You\u2019re welcome to check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged.  He wasn\u2019t sure if wanted to buy, or even look at a bass.  But he also wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to go home and deal with his mom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A pretty girl with long pale blonde hair was standing there giggling, as though she realized that Jasons first reaction to her voice was one of fear.  Jason stood there, staring back at her with his hands thrust deep in his pockets.  She was beautiful in the almost unreal way that supermodels were, about five foot six or seven, shining blue eyes, slim curvy body with breasts that were just large enough to draw attention to themselves without being distracting.  He forced himself to look back at her face and he blinked as he tried to decide what it was about her face that seemed odd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colin is your brother?\"  Jason asked finally, trying to get a reaction from the girl who until now hadn't taken her eyes from her iPhone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's interesting,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?  The fact that you had some sort of nose job that left weird afterimages behind?\"  Jason blinked again, he could almost see the faint outline of a different nose superimposed over the one she currently had.  \"And your cheekbones, you accentuated them, nice job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl raised her hand to her face with a startled motion.  \u201cNo.\u201d   She said finally.  \u201cI was talking about the fact that your profile seems to be locked due to a pretty nasty paradox.\u201d  She turned the screen of her iPhone towards Jason and he was shocked to see himself as the muscular behemoth in the app from Laura\u2019s phone.  \u201cSo you\u2019re the one who\u2019s fucking this whole thing up for everyone else aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t see anything, you\u2019re completely blank. Well except for the dick you gave yourself.\u201d She let out a low whistle. \u201cVery nicely done, just over nine inches, and a hefty girth without being ridiculous. JUST big enough to be shocking without being so over the top people will freak when they see it. I bet you miss that thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually that IS my dick,\u201d Jason said coldly, \u201cthe only thing I changed on myself before reality blew up was my muscle mass.

Well good job king doofus, you may have very well completely screwed every plan I\u2019ve had for this thing since I got it. They\u2019re talking about shutting it down entirely if they can\u2019t unravel some huge paradox and if I had to guess, that would be you.

And here\u2019s a protip for you, they\u2019re green.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreen?\u201d  Jason sputtered as Monica turned away, giving him a clear view of an ass that was nothing short of perfection before her very long hair settled back down almost to her knees, blocking his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreen, don\u2019t fuck this up because if you do I won\u2019t give you a second chance.\u201d  She paused to look back over her shoulder at him.  \u201cYes you might be able to help me, but you need me a hell of a lot more than I need you.  Don\u2019t fuck this up,\u201d she repeated as she turned away and continued walking without looking back.  Jason stared after her shapely, sensuous legs long enough to believe they may have been the most perfect looking legs he had ever seen.  He shuddered slightly, despite how undeniably gorgeous she was Monica was unsettling.  Jason took a minute to backtrack to the bus stop and looked up and down the cross street, sure enough he could see a red house at the end of the block with a withering lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Jason grunted and walked down to the gas station to buy a soda.  The entryway door jingled as he entered and the clerk behind the counter looked up from a magazine.  Jason met his eye and waved.  The clerk scowled and went back to his magazine.  As he walked towards the soda fountain someone darted around him and the door chimed again as whoever they were exited.  An uneasy feeling settled in the pit of Jason\u2019s stomach, he hadn\u2019t got a clear look at whoever it was but it might have been one of the guys who had been hiding behind Nikki last night while he had been kicking Brad across Laura\u2019s front lawn.  Jason had a Styrofoam cup in his had then put it back without filling it.  Where was he going to find a weapon in a gas station?  An even better question was where was he going to find a weapon in a gas station that he would be able to buy with less than two bucks in his pocket?  He looked longingly at a short wooden club labeled \u201ctire thumper.\u201d  It was out of his price range and too close to the clerk for him to practice his newly learned five fingered discount skills.  He settled on a bottle of root beer, one of the cheap ones he didn\u2019t really like but it came in a nice glass bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk rang him up without a word and handed Jason back his change.  \u201cSee, this is why I love coming here,\u201d Jason said as he twisted the cap off and downed as much of the root beer as he could in one breath, \u201cthe friendly atmosphere and warm ambience.\u201d  He let out an ear splitting belch and shoved his way out the front door.  If the clerk replied Jason didn\u2019t hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped just outside the door and took another swig of root beer as he looked up and down the street.  \u201cNow if I were a couple of gutter crawling jock strap stains where would I be hiding?\u201d  Jason took a step towards the street then noticed the entrance to a small alley that led between the gas station and the building next it.  \u201cBetter question, if I wanted to beat the shit out of a couple gutter crawling jock strap stains without being seen where would I be hiding?\u201d Jason walked straight into the alley and wasn\u2019t surprised when two figures closed in on him before he was even halfway through.  He also wasn\u2019t surprised to see that they were the two douchenozzles who had been hiding behind Nikki.  \u201cWell well, Jim and Terry I presume?\u201d  Jason sipped at his root beer, almost done already.  But that was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know who we are dweeb,\u201d one of them snarled.  Jason raised an eyebrow when they both drew knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou boys sure you\u2019re up for this without a cute redhead to hide behind?\u201d  Jason wasn\u2019t sure if they were ignoring him or if they didn\u2019t understand that he was making fun of them.  \u201cAt least let me finish my drink first, ok guys?\u201d Jason rose the bottle to his lips and shifted his grip on the neck as they both predictably stepped in closer while he appeared vulnerable.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still firmly gripping the shattered bottle by the neck Jason rose on the balls of his feet, stabbing upward into Terry\u2019s gut, rocking him backward even as the jagged glass bit deep.  Terry let out a rising yell of pain that sharply cut off as warm thick blood ran over Jason\u2019s hand as he jerked the bottle back out and spun to face Jim again.  Jim was holding his head, where it looked like a section of skin had peeled back from his forehead, hanging over his eye.  Jim slowly fell over backward, like watching a tree being cut down in slow motion.  Terry had sunk down into a fetal ball, clutching his gut and taking shallow whistling breaths.  Jason absently wondered if he had punctured his diaphragm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of hard to breathe without a hole in your diaphragm huh buddy?\u201d  Jason knelt down and rummaged in Terry\u2019s pocket, pulling out his wallet.

In fact he was pretty sure that if he didn\u2019t call 911 in the next few seconds neither one of them were likely to survive.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, I\u2019m fine.  Right the ambulance is for the two guys who tried to mug me.  No really.  Yea, I\u2019ll stay here.  Jason, Jason Sullivan.  Sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood over Jim and Terry, watching them grow paler with blood loss, listening to the frantic but ineffective breathing from Jim\u2019s perforated diaphragm.  He had been right, it did feel good to kick ass.  He was still staring at them when the police and ambulance showed up, he didn\u2019t even resist when they cuffed them but he did chide them for kicking the broken root beet bottle across the alley.  \u201cHey, be careful with that thing it\u2019s evidence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you, a comedian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo seriously, that\u2019s what I beat them up with when they tried to mug me,\u201d Jason explained as they stuffed him in the back of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave it for downtown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, fine,\u201d Jason said with a shrug.  He looked around as the car pulled out into traffic.  \u201cThis is much nicer than the car I got arrested in last night; it had blood all up in it and smelled like puke, this is a class act.  I appreciate that you guys are taking care of the stuff my tax dollars are paying for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike last night Jason didn\u2019t spend time in a holding cell, it wasn\u2019t the expected room with the bright lights and two-way mirror either.  He sat across the desk from a bored looking cop in a suit who took down his statement and asked a few questions.  \u201cSo when these two guys came up to you did they say they intended to mug you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, they pulled knives and came at me, I made an assumption.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop grunted, \u201cYea, we recovered the knives.\u201d  There was a long silence after which the cop stopped writing and read from a file next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d  Jason prompted him after minutes dragged by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you were brought to the station last night after you put another boy,\u201d the cop glanced back at his file, \u201cTaylor, in the hospital.  And that one was also supposed to be self defense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best defense is a good offense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, now is not the time for you to show me how smart your ass is.  I don\u2019t care; I will put you away until I get answers if that\u2019s what I think needs to happen.  Don\u2019t make me think you\u2019re a wanna be hard ass who needs a week in the holding cell to learn the error of his ways.\u201d  The cop put the file down and folded his hands over it.  \u201cNow, why don\u2019t we try this again?  Look at it from my point of view.  I have three boys in the ER in two nights, all of which you claim attacked you first and yet you don\u2019t have a scratch on you.  And you know what else, I can\u2019t get statements from any of them because they are all either unconscious or under heavy sedation.  Can you see how this may be of some concern to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason bit back the urge to say something sarcastic and sighed instead.  \u201cSeriously, last night Brad told me he was going to kick my ass.  Told he was going to kick my ass and smiled while he said it.  If I had stood there and took a hit from him I would be dead, there isn\u2019t a doubt in my mind, I mean look at the guy, he\u2019s like twice my size.  I only managed to knock him down because I surprised him and kept kicking him to keep him down, I was afraid if he got back up that he would kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo of Brad\u2019s friends come at me with knives in an alley?  I don\u2019t know, I figured they wanted to mess me up because I hurt Brad.  They didn\u2019t specifically say they were going to do anything but geez, knives man.  I had a root beer bottle; I think I did pretty damn well for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop let out a short barking laugh then forced himself to look stern again.  \u201cI know they recovered two knives from the scene, I also know they\u2019re looking into whether or not this is related to what happened last night.  I\u2019m not going to hold you but don\u2019t leave town son, don\u2019t make me have to chase you if it comes down to that.  It\u2019ll be bad for both of us.  Now get the hell out of here.\u201d  Jason stood up and the cop stopped him.  \u201cNext time leave the root beer bottle and call us huh?  Let us do our job, don\u2019t go looking for trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking for trouble?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to screw with me kid; I\u2019ve seen it all before.  You stood up for yourself and it felt good.  Don\u2019t go looking for trouble,\u201d he repeated.  Jason nodded and left the police station.  He was about to call his mom to come pick him up when he realized how much she would freak out if she knew he had been hauled in two nights in a row.  But what other option did he have?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He waited a minute and not hearing a reaction from Nikki he pushed onward.  \u201cI just wanted to call to say thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo thank me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, you probably saved my life by warning me that Jim and Terry were after me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, yea, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Jason walked a little further away from the entrance to the police station.  \u201cThey came at me with knives but I\u2019m ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnives?\u201d  Nikkis voice trilled with panic before suspicion crept into her voice.  \u201cWhat did you do to them?  You hurt them didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed, he couldn\u2019t help it.  \u201cThat question is so absurd, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to laugh,\u201d he sighed and tried to make himself sound reassuring and soothing.  \u201cYes, they got hurt; I hit them with a root beer bottle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Nikki laughed.  \u201cA root beer bottle doesn\u2019t sound so bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you only knew,\u201d Jason muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, there\u2019s another reason I\u2019m calling.  A couple of reasons actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn\u2019t sure how to read the almost complete silence he was suddenly faced with.  So once again he forged ahead.  \u201cI want to talk to you, not on the phone, not at the mall with your friends on one side of the food court and mine on the other, just you and me, you know\u2026 talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki let a breath that it sounded like she had been holding for a while.  \u201cThat actually sounds nice,\u201d she said softly.  Jason mentally high fived himself.  \u201cWhere are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea\u2026\u201d now he was mentally kicking himself.  \u201cI\u2019m at the police station again.\u201d  Jason tensed up, waiting for Nikki to yell or hang up.  Instead she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures,\u201d he could hear her moving around and then the jingle of car keys.  \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a few.\u201d  She disconnected and he did a celebratory fist pump.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening officer,\u201d he said to a cop who walked past him towards the entrance, giving him an odd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had worried a little bit that he wouldn\u2019t be able to tell when she pulled up but he shouldn\u2019t have, it was the only convertible driven by a girl with flowing red hair he expected he\u2019d see in front of the police station tonight.  \u201cThanks for picking me up, I appreciate it,\u201d he said as he jumped in and buckled his seat belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Nikki put the car in gear and pulled away from the police station.  \u201cWere you serious about wanting to talk or were you just buttering me up because you needed a ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, if I just needed a ride I would have called my mom.  Yes, I seriously want to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time he had seen Nikki really smile and it was heart melting.  \u201cYea?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki drove in silence for a few minutes and Jason leaned back in the seat and stared out the window.  Nikki had had driven to the park and nearing the close of the day it was all but empty except for the soothing scenery.  It felt good to relax.  Today had been an odd day from start to finish.  He felt like an outsider in his own life and he noticed that he had a touch of the shakes.  The adrenaline rush from his run in with Terry and Jim was long gone and now that he was done putting on the snarky tough guy front he was acknowledging that the whole thing could have gone much, much worse than it had.  He wondered what it would have been like to be stabbed and shuddered; hopefully he would never have to find out.  In the wake of this strange day he felt empty, stressed and oddly horny.  He seemed to recall reading somewhere that people who survived brushes with death or significant harm often reacted with increased libido.  There was some primal link between almost dying and wanting to overcompensate for it by spreading your DNA around.  He glanced at Nikki and looked away again, trying to shake this train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d  Nikki asked as she turned her car off one of the the park roads, maneuvered somewhat off road, slipping through a set of bushes and parked in a secluded hollow, facing the setting sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh,\u201d Jason chose not to tell her he had just been imagining what she would look like with her denim skirt pulled up to her belly button.  \u201cYou know, thinking about the fight I was just in with Jim and Terry, glad I didn\u2019t get cut.  Glad you answered your phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded and shut the car off.  The leather of her seat squeaked as she turned to face Jason.  \u201cHow did that happen anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  The fight with the dumb-ass duo?\u201d  Nikki nodded.  \u201cWell after I took the bus back from the mall I stopped at the gas station, you know the one right down the street from the bus stop?\u201d  Nikki nodded again and Jason continued.  \u201cWell I went in to get a soda and Terry ran out as I was coming in.  It seemed weird but I figured there wasn\u2019t much I could do about it so I bought a root beer and left.  I didn\u2019t see either of them but I figured if someone were watching me I could avoid them by cutting through the alley next to the gas station, well it turned out they were waiting there.\u201d  Jason didn\u2019t want to lie to Nikki but he also didn\u2019t want to make it sound like he had gone looking for trouble even if that was what he had done so he was being somewhat selective with what was being left out.  \u201cThey pulled knives on me and I fought back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith a root beer bottle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith a root beer bottle.  I busted it over Terry\u2019s head and stabbed Jim in the gut with the broken end.\u201d  Jason watched Nikki\u2019s eyes widen in horror.  \u201cLook Nikki, I just did what I had to do to make sure I didn\u2019t get hurt.  I even called an ambulance for them so they wouldn\u2019t bleed out.\u201d  He figured he\u2019d leave out the part where he had looted them both for nearly two hundred dollars and stashed it in the alley for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki still looked horrified, \u201cTell me this wasn\u2019t like Brad Jason, please tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Brad,\u201d Jason reassured her.  \u201cI didn\u2019t kick them while they were down, I just did what I had to defend myself.\u201d  Jason paused before continuing.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why things went with Brad the way they did,\u201d he said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d Nikki said, her voice suddenly had a harsh snarling edge to it.  \u201cYou\u2019re jealous that he\u2019s fucking Laura and you\u2019re not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  No!\u201d  Jason was surprised by Nikki\u2019s reaction.  \u201cNo,\u201d he repeated.  \u201cI mean I know why I hit Brad, I hit him because he threatened to kick my ass,\u201d Jason paused, remembering the condescending threat from the football player, \u201cagain,\u201d he clarified.  \u201cI mean I don\u2019t know why I snapped and kept hitting him when he was down, I think at first I was afraid that if I let him get up he was going to beat the shit out of me and maybe kill me but I\u2019m not sure at what point I knew he wasn\u2019t getting up and I kept hitting him anyway.\u201d  Jason clenched his shaking fists, clearly remembering the rage he had been feeling.  It had been about Laura, about feeling let down and betrayed by her when he hadn\u2019t done the same to her when the tables were turned.  But it definitely wasn\u2019t about lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to fuck Laura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason almost sarcastically said something along the lines of \u201cif she offered I wouldn\u2019t say no,\u201d but he could see real pain in Nikki\u2019s eyes that sobered him and tempered his response.  Would he have fucked Laura in his \u201creal\u201d reality?  The sweet, somewhat awkward girl he had been best friends with since grade school?  Absolutely, in fact he realized now that he regretted the fact he hadn\u2019t.  But the Laura with the perfect body he had created who\u2019s sweet awkwardness had apparently been replaced by cruelty and selfishness?  \u201cNo Nikki, I do not want to fuck that bitch.  I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve come off in the past, probably like a moron, but believe me when I say that in the last couple days I have learned in ways that I probably can\u2019t explain very well that it\u2019s what inside that counts more than anything,\u201d Jason struggled to find the words to express his point without telling Nikki about the app and how outward appearances are surprisingly superficial.  \u201cNikki, you are the only one who called me when I was in jail, the only one.  Hell, it\u2019s been over twenty four hours and still no one has called.  I\u2019m sure that everyone knows about it, news like that travels fast.  You\u2019re the only real friend I know I have right now and it tore me up bad today thinking I had fucked that up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn\u2019t sure at first what Nikki\u2019s reaction was.  Her face ran through a gamut of emotion, doubt, surprise, maybe a burst of joy, but it seemed to settle on angry and Jason shifted uncomfortably in his seat, unsure of what to do or say while Nikki\u2019s expression continued to darken.  \u201cThat bitch,\u201d Nikki said finally.  \u201cThat manipulative two faced bitch.  I knew I shouldn\u2019t have listened to her, but you didn\u2019t make things easier either,\u201d Nikki wiped angrily at the corner of her eye where tears were forming.  \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you tell me something like this when we broke up instead of letting me think that you really were just going out with me to get closer to Laura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason struggled to answer what may have been a simple question if he could actually remember the circumstances of their break-up.  He settled for shrugging his shoulders and trying for humor, \u201cBecause I\u2019m a socially inept nerd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki responded by punching him in the shoulder, not hard enough hurt but hard enough to make him flinch because he absolutely wasn\u2019t expecting it.  Before he even had a chance to protest Nikki started laughing.  \u201cYou were still an ass to me at the mall earlier,\u201d Nikki said with a pout when she finished laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a little,\u201d Jason conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little?\u201d  Nikki punched him again, this time hard enough to sting.  This time she wasn\u2019t laughing.  \u201cJason, you were so cold and so\u2026\u201d she struggled to find an appropriate word before settling on, \u201cweird, you have no idea how much it hurt me.\u201d  She leaned closer to Jason and lowered her voice but not her intensity.  \u201cI won\u2019t go through something like that again, ok?  I liked going out with you, for a while it was good.  For a while it was VERY good.  But let me make this clear now so we don\u2019t have any misunderstandings like apparently happened last time.  I want to be with you, and if I\u2019m with you I\u2019m ONLY with you.  If you want to be with me I expect the same thing in return.  And if we have problems we need to talk about, we\u2019ll talk.  Like we\u2019re talking now, but no more of that macho, rude, silent treatment bullshit or whatever it was you were doing earlier today. You need to promise me that ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This would be great for a lot of reasons, Nikki was cute, she seemed like a genuinely nice person and he had the distinct impression that he had few real friends in this reality.  \u201cI guess I\u2019m just surprised you wanted to, I thought,\u201d he shook his head and started over.  \u201cNever mind what I thought, this is great, yes I promise, I\u2019m sorry for acting like an asshole earlier today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not just saying that?\u201d  The question was serious but Nikki\u2019s tone and mischievous smile hinted otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCross my heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d  Nikki surprised Jason by vaulting over the gear shift and landing in Jasons lap, straddling him.  She wrapped her arms tightly around him and he reciprocated, the two kissed passionately and Jason was gasping for air when they stopped.  Nikki giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Jason let go as Nikki leaned back, pulling her arms inside her shirt and doing some sort of contortions that ended with her arms popping back out and her bra being tossed aside.  He twisted his head around to watch it land in the back seat, doing an actual double take.  \u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShirt stays on Jason, someone might walk by and they\u2019re not getting a free show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Jason repeated.  He reached up and confirmed his impression that the fabric of her shirt was so thin it wasn\u2019t much of barrier anyway.  Then he no longer had any need to imagine how Nikki might look with her denim skirt hiked up.  Nikki smiled at Jason as she unzipped his pants and that image, that smile was burned into memory forever.  The sun setting over her shoulder, the fiery play of the light on her red hair, the spray of freckles across her nose and above all that smile, that gorgeous smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was long after dark when Nikki dropped Jason off in front of his house.  He kissed her good-bye and she made him promise to call her the next day.  \u201cYea, I have some stuff to do with Colin but I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m free.\u201d  She waved and drove off as Jason stared after her.  He stood there, feeling somewhat dazed for a few minutes before turning and heading inside.  He was surprised to find his mom up waiting for him; she looked like she had been crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d  Something had to be wrong; his mom never stressed about how late he was out.  Did she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you didn\u2019t come home, or call I was worried that you got into another fight.  I don\u2019t know what I would do if one of those bullies put you in the hospital again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hospital?  So Brad had kicked his ass bad enough to require hospitalization?  He wasn\u2019t about to admit to her that he HAD been in a fight, the fact that he had won probably wouldn\u2019t set her mind at ease.  \u201cMom, it\u2019s ok, I was on a date with Nikki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly this made his mother perk up considerably.  \u201cYou got back together with Nikki?  I\u2019m happy to hear that, she is such a nice girl.  I never understood why you two broke up in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, me neither,\u201d Jason deadpanned.  At least his mom approved of his choice in women.  Two days ago it seemed like he was trapped in a horrific depressing version of reality, maybe things weren\u2019t quite that bad.  \u201cI\u2019m tired, it\u2019s been a long day and I have stuff I need to do in the morning.  Jason had apparently missed a text from Colin asking him to stop by around ten.  Remembering Monica\u2019s earlier directions he knew he had to be there by at least nine thirty if he wanted to talk with Monica.  \u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d he texted back.  Then he got ready for bed and fell quickly into surprisingly dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason awoke to what felt like someone jumping on his bed, his eyes darted open and his not awake yet senses were met with a mass of curly red hair and the sensation of someone kissing him.  Before he could react the kiss was over and the blur of red resolved itself into Nikki\u2019s face.  It appeared that she HAD jumped in bed with him.  \u201cC\u2019mon sleepyhead, get up.  What are we doing today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sputtered, trying to get his thoughts together and failing.  \u201cWe?  I was\u2026 I had a thing I had\u2026\u201d he finally settled on, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s late, nearly eight o\u2019clock.  Your mom let me in, I think she\u2019s making breakfast for us.\u201d  She jerked Jason\u2019s blanket off and looked disappointed.  \u201cBoxers?  I thought you slept naked?\u201d  Before Jason could respond she grabbed hold of his shaft, boxers and all, which was (as it was most mornings) standing at attention.  \u201cIt\u2019s too bad your mom is home right now.  Now c\u2019mon, get up,\u201d she looked down and giggled as she released Jason.  \u201cI mean get out of bed.\u201d  She rolled out of his bed and stood looking down at him expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent a moment looking at the cute redhead in her tight t-shirt and daisy duke cut-offs and silently screaming out against chipper morning people before he also rolled out of bed.  \u201cOk I\u2019m up,\u201d Jason tossed his blanket back on the bed and started digging through his dresser for something to wear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wear these, I like how you look in these.\u201d  Nikki had apparently already picked out a pair of khaki cargo shorts and a black tank top he didn\u2019t recognize.  He shrugged and pulled them on.  The tank top was tighter than he was used to wearing and someone had cut the sleeves short, not quite enough to call it a muscle shirt but close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure, those shorts make your package look great and that tank top is perfect.  Those baggy t-shirts you wear make you look shapeless; this shows you actually have a decent stomach.\u201d  She ran her hands over his chest.  \u201cHave you been working out?  You look REALLY good in this shirt,\u201d before he could answer Nikki gave him a peck on the lips.  \u201cI\u2019ll meet you downstairs; don\u2019t keep me waiting too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason scratched his head.  How was he going to ditch Nikki so he could go talk to Monica?  Telling her he wanted her to get lost so he could talk to another girl wasn\u2019t going to work.  Maybe he should bring her with?  The question ate at him while he went through his morning routine.  When he got downstairs Nikki and mother were talking, Nikki was very animated and he spent a minute watching her before he let them know he was there.  What had someone who was bubbling over with so much energy ever see in him in the first place?  Had he really been dating her just to get closer to Laura?  Did it really matter now?  \u201cOh, there you are,\u201d Nikki surprised Jason by bounding out of her chair and almost tackling him with a hug.  \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s eat and decide what we\u2019re doing.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wondered how his paradox would have made her a better cook and got his answer when he said something about how tasty they were.  \u201cThank you, this is the recipe that Nikki gave me, it seemed appropriate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded and had another bite while he thought about how to approach the fact that he didn\u2019t intend to take Nikki with him to talk to Monica.  He really didn\u2019t know much about her and wasn\u2019t sure how to read her this morning.  Was this sudden visit charming spontaneity or was this her being overly clingy?  He figured he\u2019d start out slow.  \u201cNikki, remember last night when I said I had stuff to do with Colin and that I would call you when I was done?\u201d  Nikki nodded while she chewed her way through a mouthful of pancakes.  \u201cI\u2019m heading to his place around nine, it shouldn\u2019t take me long, I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m done, probably by lunch, maybe even before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this big mysterious thing you have planned with Colin?\u201d  Nikki asked after swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wants me to join his band,\u201d Jason said opting for the partial truth.  \u201cI\u2019m going to go check out an old guitar or something he\u2019s selling and talk with him about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d  Nikki sounded surprised.  \u201cYou never struck me as the musical type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged, \u201cThat\u2019s what I told him but he insists I have \u201cthe attitude\u201d to make it work, I think he\u2019s nuts but I thought I\u2019d at least hear him out.  I figure it\u2019d be good to try something new you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed.  \u201cI must be rubbing off on you; do you want me to drop you off?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Colin?\u201d  Jason\u2019s mother finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, someone I met a couple days ago, we hung out yesterday, he seems alright.\u201d  Items of note missing from the previous statement, I met Colin in Jail and while we were at the mall we shoplifted CD\u2019s together then smoked in the food court to piss off security.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to satisfy his mother and she left the room.  \u201cDon\u2019t forget to rinse off your plates when you\u2019re done, the dishwasher won\u2019t get off dried syrup,\u201d she called after herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you want me to drop you off or not?\u201d  Nikki asked, stabbing the last piece of pancake on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, sure.\u201d  Jason swallowed the last of his pancake and washed it down with a glass of milk.  He made sure to rinse their plates off before they left.  He didn\u2019t see any harm in taking her up on her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave Nikki directions towards Colins house.  As they approached he pointed to the gas station by the bus stop.  \u201cThere\u2019s where it happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere what happened?\u201d  Nikki slowed down as she tried to see what Jason was pointing at.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat alley by the gas station, it\u2019s where I had the fight with Jim and Terry last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki made a hard turn into the gas station parking lot.  \u201cI want to see it.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?  Why?\u201d  Jason suddenly wished he had kept his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want to see it, do I really need a reason?\u201d  Nikki shut the car off and got out, Jason scrambled to follow her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer low heels clacked quickly into the alley then stopped suddenly, causing Jason to nearly run into her.  \u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on her reaction Jason at first thought that instead of taking the two to the hospital the bodies were still laying there but in reality it was almost worse.  A large oblong area was roped off and in the rough center was two surprisingly large blood stains.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as this makes it look,\u201d Jason said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki spun around to look Jason in the eye, \u201cI hope not, because it looks pretty bad.  What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, I hit Terry in the head with a bottle, it broke and the glass gashed up his scalp pretty good, he fell there,\u201d Jason pointed to the blood stain on the right,\u201d  he pretty much just passed out after I hit him.\u201d  Jason didn\u2019t think she needed to know how bad the \u201cgashed up scalp\u201d really was.  \u201cThen Jim took a swing at me with his knife,\u201c Jason pantomimed pivoting to his left and ducking, \u201cand I still had the end of the bottle in my hand, so before he had the chance to try stabbing me again I stabbed him, \u201cJason finished the demonstration by stabbing forward and up like he had last night.  \u201cI think I punctured his diaphragm because he had a hard time breathing and passed out pretty quick.  That\u2019s when I called 911.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shook her head.  \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.  I can\u2019t believe those two would try something like that.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re ok.\u201d  She was making a point not to look at the blood anymore and began to walk back to the car.  Jason followed her but didn\u2019t get in the car.  \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leaned over to kiss her, \u201cYou can leave me here, it\u2019s right around the corner from the bus stop.  I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d  Jason nodded.  Nikki shrugged then drove away.  Jason watched her go then went back into the alley and was relieved to see that the proceeds from his reverse mugging were still where he had left them.  He entered the gas station, bought a pack of cigarettes, a lighter and enjoyed a smoke as he walked leisurely to Colin\u2019s house.  He checked the time, quarter after nine.  \u201cPerfect,\u201d he told himself, knocking firmly on the front door.  He was taken aback when the door was opened by a girl he didn\u2019t recognize.  She was tall, nearly as tall as he was and she was skinny, nearly unhealthily so, with pale skin and waist length dark hair, which was unkempt and hiding most of her face.  Her body language and expression screamed depression, anger, unease with her body and her place in life.  She also had probably the largest breasts Jason had ever seen in his life.  \u201cI\u2019m here to see Colin, is he home?\u201d  Jason asked while he tried to think of a big boob model to compare her to, maybe Wendy Fiore or September Carrino?  But neither of them were as skinny as this girl, the extreme disparity between her frame and breast size made it impossible to compare her to anyone and he realized far too late that he was staring and making an ass of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a picture, it\u2019ll last longer,\u201d the girl sneered, moving to close the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d Jason protested, the door stop just shut of closing all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not some freak show to be stared at, get lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t staring,\u201d Jason tried to defend himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d  Yea I was, why am I having this argument?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, prove it, what color are my eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door slowly opened again and the girl stood back, giving Jason the unspoken permission to enter.  Now that he was looking at them here eyes were very green.  \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the girl said as he stepped in. \u201cI get\u2026\u201d she raised her hands and let them fall down to her sides again, an awkward shrug, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again, moving to the couch in front of the TV and sat down, hunched over with her knees drawn up to her chin.  Jason closed the front door behind himself and let his eyes adjust to the dim light.  All the blinds were closed and the brightest source of light was the TV which was showing some cartoon show Jason didn\u2019t recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Jason said, not sure what else to say.  \u201cI\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cColin\u2019s room is down the hall on your left,\u201d the girl said, cutting Jason off just as he was about to admit that he had been staring.  He thought better of finishing the statement and turned to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said to the girls back as he left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you made it past Nyah, you either really did pay attention to more than her boobs or you remembered what I told you.  Either way, good work.\u201d  Jason almost jumped out of his skin.  Monica had come out of seemingly nowhere to stand directly behind him.  \u201cAnd you\u2019re early, which is good, we have a lot to talk about.\u201d  Monica waved Jason into what was obviously her room, and though confused he allowed himself to be led.  Monica made sure the door was closed and locked, then she grabbed a chair from a makeup table that was overflowing with products and sat on it.  \u201cGo ahead and clear off a spot on the bed.\u201d  Jason looked around the room which was littered with fashion magazines and moved an armful of them off the end of the bed before sitting down.  The walls were plastered with pictures of models from Victoria\u2019s Secret as well as photo spreads he recognized from Maxim, Playboy and other men\u2019s magazines.  Most of the pictures had notes scribbled on them and body parts either circled or highlighted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe beauty industry isn\u2019t an exact science, everyone knows that,\u201d Monica said tonelessly as she pulled out her iPhone and began working intently on something.  \u201cThere is no \u201cperfect look\u201d that is universally accepted as being beautiful, instead you have to find the aspects that appeal to the most people.  Nyah for instance,\u201d Monica paused for a moment, appearing engrossed by her phone before tapping something then continuing, \u201chas limited appeal due to her breast size.  In certain circles she\u2019d be a superstar, but pure size fetishism has a relatively narrow appeal.  Whereas superior form and shape will have a much broader fanbase even at modest size.  It\u2019s hard to get serious modeling work if you\u2019re much over a D cup, I\u2019m at DD at the moment and trying to decide whether or not I want to reduce down further.  I might leave them as is, if I make the movie transition they appear to boost my success more as DD.  Any bigger though and I can\u2019t seem to get past modeling in girly mags.  I really hate the thought of going smaller if I don\u2019t have to though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNyah,\u201d Jason said, sounding out the unfamiliar name, \u201cis she...\u201d Jason mimed the shape of breasts in front of his own chest, \u201cwith the app?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot Nee-uh.  NI-uh, with a long I sound, and no, she\u2019s all natural.  Poor thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t notice she\u2019s miserable, she doesn\u2019t think anyone will notice there\u2019s a real person behind those boobs but she\u2019s too scared to get a reduction because she\u2019s equally afraid that if she does she\u2019ll get no attention at all.  But we\u2019ll talk more about her later, let\u2019s talk about you.\u201d  Monica turned the phone so Jason could see it.  Instead of displaying the muscular version of himself Monica had shown him yesterday it looked like he did now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s me, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t understand,\u201d Monica said rolling her eyes.  \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t \u201cyou\u201d it\u2019s your last revision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy last what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s not that complicated.  Each time you change something on yourself you\u2019re revising it.  The revisions get saved and numbered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a computer program?\u201d  Suddenly this was a concept he was familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod,\u201d Monica sighed, \u201cI knew you were a nerd.\u201d  Monica swiped a long hair back from her face and continued.  \u201cThis is your last revision, which appears to be what you are now even though your current revision is the beefcake model you gave yourself.  Which is fairly nice as those things go, a little over the top but some people are into that sort of thing.  But here\u2019s where it gets interesting.  Your previous revision, or what you currently are now, is changing, I think it\u2019s trying to sync up to the revision you broke reality with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSync up how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica sighed, \u201cOk, you know that most people burn calories constantly to maintain their body right?\u201d  Jason nodded.  \u201cWhich means if you weighed someone with a precise enough scale they would always be losing tiny amounts of weight as the calories burn right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not losing weight, you\u2019re gaining weight, a little bit all the time, I haven\u2019t been studying it long enough to accurately gauge it but I would guess around a pound a day, maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less.\u201d  Jason looked down at himself.  \u201cAnd nice outfit, I was afraid after seeing you yesterday you didn\u2019t really understand how to dress yourself; this may be easier than I thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ignored the jab about his ability to dress himself and asked the question that was bothering him the most.  \u201cHow can you see the future with that app?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked up from her phone and stared at Jason long enough to make him feel uncomfortable before she looked down again.  \u201cIt can\u2019t \u201csee the future\u201d but you can use it to view profiles at any age.  There\u2019s a lot that can be inferred with how your life is going to turn out and you can judge how it might change before you apply changes.  You really didn\u2019t read any of this stuff before you started screwing around did you?\u201d  Jason morosely shook his head.  Ok, here\u2019s the crash course.  No one is sure WHO made the app, but a few of us have our suspicions.  It works on a pretty simple system, for every change you make you run the risk of screwing something up.  How big the risk might be is directly proportional to how drastic the change is.  Also change effects are cumulative.  So a lot of small changes are somewhat safer than a couple really big ones but it all still adds up, you with me so far?\u201d  Jason nodded again.  \u201cSo if you push the envelope too far and get big time karmic backlash, something bad WILL happen to you.  Like for instance, there\u2019s a feature where you can implement changes retroactively, it appears to alter the past itself, that one is like playing dice with the universe.  Most people are lucky to get one bump with that setting without running into a paradox.\u201d  Suddenly Monica looked at Jason with an expression that made Jason look for the blinking lightbulb over her head.  \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Monica trailed off and Jason hung his head and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwice,\u201d he said, answering her unasked question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica swore, \u201cDid you get a paradox warning BEFORE you finished doing what you were doing?\u201d  Jason nodded again and Monica swore again.  \u201cAnd did it anyway?\u201d  Jason\u2019s nod this time was almost imperceptible.  Monica swore like a sailor before continuing.  \u201cWell that certainly explains a lot.\u201d  Monica looked disgusted.  \u201cSo as I was saying, this app runs by entering you in a lottery you don\u2019t want to win.  YOU, have hit the fucking jackpot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, who would design something like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica rolled her eyes, \u201chow many powerful beings can you think of that get off on giving people what they think they want while having the potential for it to horribly blow up in their face the entire time?  But I\u2019m not here to have a theological discussion; I\u2019m here to try to fix our mutual problem.  Like I said yesterday, whatever you did it\u2019s like you don\u2019t even exist anymore.  It\u2019s like it knocked you out of reality AND the reach of the app.  Which is why I think your body is trying to sync up to this,\u201d Monica showed Jason the muscular version of himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m safe then?  I don\u2019t really exist as far the app is concerned and I\u2019m getting the body I wanted anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod you are na\u00efve.

Let\u2019s talk about the first one.  Nyah is a wreck, she has assets that will take her very far in certain industries, she hasn\u2019t started down the road to any of them yet but it\u2019s damn near inevitable that she\u2019s going to.

At the moment he was so wrapped up in his thoughts he may as well have been on the moon.  To him there were too many holes in the story and too many unanswered questions.  There was at least one hugely glaring contradiction in Monica's explanation.  He was worried about the things that were probably true but at the same time he didn't doubt that she was planning to use him like a pawn for her own gain.  The more he thought about it the more he was convinced that she planned to double cross him and not hold up her end of the bargain.  And what he kept coming back to was the image from last night of Nikki's smile that had burned itself into his memory like a photograph.  \"What's the second thing?\"  He asked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica shook her head, \"The second one is easier than the first but it's all or nothing, if you can't get past the first one don't bother asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should use that app to massage your people skills a little bit, would it kill you to talk to me like you're a human being?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked up for a moment to focus her obvious scorn like a search light.  \"I'm sorry, I almost forgot I'm talking to the guy who single handedly wrecked my life's goals.  Thanks for reminding me.\"  She offered a very fake grin before looking back down and continuing.  \"FYI, they're talking about using some sort of throttle on the app now, either locking users out who don't use it often enough or making existing users deactivate their accounts before letting new ones sign on.   Maybe both.  If you're not going to help let me know now so I can start making others plans because I have the feeling time is pretty limited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think about it and get back to you,\" Jason said getting up and moving towards Monica's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This counts and deciding not to help,\" Monica said without looking up from her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason left without saying anything else.  He stood outside of Monica's door, looking first down the hall towards his left, trying guess which door was Colins, then looking back towards the living room where he could see the back of Nyah's head.  He was startled to hear Colin's voice directly behind him, \"Hey mate, didn't realize you were here already.  Did Nyah let you in?  Ah, of course she did.  Her royal ice cube doesn't sully her hands with work the peasants can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Even as he verbalized his momentary confusion Jason realized Colin was referring to Monica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My younger sister, if you meet her you'll see what I'm talking about.  But she doesn't mingle very often with the commoners, she has lofty aspirations.  C'mon, I'll show that bass I was talking about, I also managed to \"obtain\" a guitar last night, I'll let you have first choice at either one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't sure if he was in the mood for this anymore, part of him just wanted to leave and go crawl into a hole and forget the last few days had ever happened.  He felt overwhelmed and lost.  He also found himself desperately missing Nikki.  Or maybe something like this would be just what he needed to take his mind off his problems.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Colin\u2019s room was crowded full of music stuff.  Instruments, posters, stacks of CD\u2019s and cassette tapes.  It wasn\u2019t messy, things were obviously organized but it would be fair to describe it as \u201ccluttered.\u201d  A battered old stereo system with cartoonishly oversized speakers dominated the side of the room opposite the bed.  Jason noticed that the tousled hair of someone (who Jason assumed to be Wendy) was barely visible in the tangle of sheets and for some reason Jason had the gut feeling that she was naked under there.  He couldn\u2019t see that she was naked but it made him oddly uncomfortable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin kicked the bedroom door closed behind them as they entered and Wendy pulled the sheet completely over her head, groaning at the noise.  \u201cHere mate, check this out,\u201d Colin pointed to a poster that was hanging on the back of the door.  It was a picture of a tall boy with wildly unkempt dark hair.  He wore no shirt, a padlocked chain around his neck, a rage filled sneer and a bass guitar.  He was also covered with blood.  From his mouth, coating his teeth, to splashes all the way down his chest.  The poster was equal parts fascinating and unsettling.  \u201cSid Vicious, the bass player for the Sex Pistols.\u201d  Colin answered Jasons unspoken question.  \u201cThat is exactly how you looked the first time I saw you in that holding cell.  Covered with blood and still looking angry enough to tell anyone that got in your way to go fuck themselves like you meant it.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn\u2019t sure what to say.  Finally he asked, \u201cWas he a good bass player?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin laughed out loud and thumped Jason on the shoulder.  \u201cNo mate, he was bloody awful.  He even had the master himself try to teach him how to play and he couldn\u2019t get it right.  Didn\u2019t matter though, he had the attitude, he had the look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe master himself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, Lemmy Kilmister, the bass player for Motorhead.\u201d  Colin pointed to a picture hanging on the wall near the door.  This one had the same dark haired boy with the same lack of shirt and same chain and padlock, though this time he was wearing a leather jacket.  He was standing between a blonde girl with a ridiculous amount of makeup and a long haired man with an impressive handlebar mustache.  \u201cIt\u2019s ancient history mate,\u201d Colin laughed easily and lit a cigarette.  He moved across the room and opened the window before turning back to look at Jason.   Jason realized he was standing next to the poster of Sid Vicious and that Colin was comparing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta admit,\u201d Jason pulled out a cigarette of his own and lit it.  \u201cYou\u2019re creeping me out a little.\u201d  Colin laughed again and flicked ash into an ashtray that was sitting on the corner of his computer desk.  Jason walked closer so he could do the same.  \u201cNot to mention the fact that I REALLY know nothing about music.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin shook his head, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.  I got that part covered.  All you have to do is choose an instrument and learn enough to be able to fake it.  Music is just as much about the showmanship as it about the skill.  The Sex Pistols knew that, or at least their manager did.  It\u2019s why Sid got in, he looked the part, he attracted female fans, so what if his playing was rubbish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want a no talent punk band?\u201d  Jason could feel his interest fading by the second.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re taking this too literally,\u201d Colin sighed and tried again.  \u201cAll bands are rubbish when they first start, it\u2019s fact.  And if you worry about not wanting to be rubbish before you start you\u2019ll never start, because people learn by doing.  I think you\u2019ll do well in a band; you just need to decide what instrument you want to play and start learning.  You LOOK like a badass, when you\u2019re focused you look like you\u2019re capable of anything, I\u2019ve seen it, fans will see it, and that\u2019s the sort of thing they\u2019ll react to.  Here, let me show you some stuff that I think might help you decide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin spent about an hour going through various bands that he liked with Jason.  Explaining the type of sounds and music he was looking to create and how the various bands were related to his artistic vision.  Jason had to admit that Colin seemed to understand pretty well what it was he was trying to accomplish and he certainly didn\u2019t lack enthusiasm.  \u201cListen to the bass track on this one,\u201d Colin urged, playing a snippet of a bass solo.  \u201cEarly bay area crossover thrash, nearly the perfect tone.\u201d  Colin shifted through genres and sub genres of heavy metal and punk that Jason hadn\u2019t even known existed and they all had the same elements in common, speed and aggression.  Colin would stop to point out specific guitar and bass pieces until Jason had completely lost track of what he been listening to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds way too complicated to play,\u201d Jason said at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not really that complicated, it sounds complicated because it\u2019s fast.  Here, check this out.\u201d  Colin picked up a guitar and began playing a slow off tempo rhythm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what they were just playing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is, it\u2019s called a gallop and it\u2019s what makes a lot of these songs sound faster than they really are,\u201d Colin slowly increased the speed of what he was playing and shortly Jason could see that it really was the same thing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t look hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not, try it,\u201d Colin handed Jason the guitar and he took it awkwardly.  \u201cHold down these strings here and here like this.\u201d  Colin helped Jason position his fingers then walked him through the strumming, within a few minutes he could play almost as fast as the song Colin had just imitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spent a little bit of time messing around with both the bass and the guitar, trying to figure out which one he wanted.  By this point he was either amped up on the unusually aggressive music he been listening to, Colin\u2019s enthusiasm or both but he could suddenly picture himself doing this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich will it be mate?  I\u2019m only asking a hundred for either one and that includes an amp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at them both again.  On the one hand he liked the rumbling of the bass and the fact it only had four strings made it look like it would be easier to learn faster.  On the other hand he really liked the sense of speed that the guitar seemed to produce.  He had tried the gallop Colin showed him on both and it just sounded faster on the guitar.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was interrupted from what he was about to say by his phone chiming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki had texted him, \u201calmost noon, you ready for lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna take off Colin, my girlfriend is getting antsy because I\u2019ve been ignoring her.\u201d  He was texting her back as he spoke, \u201cmeet me at bus stop in ten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirlfriend?  Not the cute little redhead from the mall yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason actually found himself blushing.  \u201cYea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to keep her waiting either if I were you,\u201d Colin said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here you pig,\u201d Wendy snapped, a pillow flew across the room and hit Colin squarely in the head, his only response was laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason picked up his new acquisitions and headed for the door, Colin waved goodbye before he charged his bed with the pillow held high.  Jason closed on the door to the sounds of all out pillow warfare and laughter.  The sounds were a marked contrast to the sound of crying that was coming from behind Monica\u2019s closed door.  Jason was torn, he really wanted to get back to Nikki but at the same time he was curious about what could have broken Monica\u2019s ice cold demeanor.  He stared at her door wondering if he she knock or just keep walking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally he turned and walked away.  He didn\u2019t think there was hope there, if things really were going to come to a crashing halt when his body finished growing (if it really was growing) then there really didn\u2019t seem to be much he could do about it.  He may as well enjoy what he had while he had it.  Nyah turned to look over her shoulder when she heard Jason enter the living room on his way to the front door.  \u201cHey,\u201d she said softly.  So softly that he wasn\u2019t sure at first if she had actually said anything or if he had heard something from the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said, pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really am sorry about before, I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong impression of me,\u201d her voice was soft and she spoke with a hesitant subdued tone.  Jason could only detect the faintest trace of a London accent in her voice, another thing that reinforced his suspicion that Colin played his own accent up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn\u2019t sure how to react, admit that he had been staring?  Ignore her?  He settled for the fairly passive, \u201cApology accepted.\u201d  Nyah continued to stare at him so he added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.\u201d  The ghost of a smile appeared and she turned back to the TV.  Jason let himself out the front door but as he did he was sure that she had turned to look at him again.  He left without looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jason walked to the bus stop, carrying his new toys and trying to decide how he would spend the rest of the day.  He was firmly sold on his, \u201clive life to its fullest until it blows up in my face,\u201d plan and he couldn\u2019t stop smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seriously bought a bass guitar?\u201d Nikki asked incredulously as Jason loaded the bass and amplifier into the trunk of her car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d he closed the truck and jumped into the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBand or not, no groupies you hear me?\u201d  Nikki gave him a kiss before putting the car into gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, but you\u2019ll have to come to our shows to bet them back with a stick,\u201d Jason teased.  His mirth vanished as he noticed two figures standing on the side of the road, both of them had ghostly afterimages around their bodies like he had seen on Monica.  One was a girl, he couldn\u2019t see her face but based on her size he assumed it was Laura.  The other was Terry.  Terry had been obviously modified by the app to be taller and more muscular.  He glared at Jason as the car went past, Jason could see that someone had also used the app to repair the ghastly wound to his scalp but their was something else about the pair Jason could see but couldn\u2019t understand.  Their entire bodies shimmered and swirled with some sort of aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?  You look like someone walked over your grave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stared straight ahead and tried to suppress the suddenly uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach.  \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said finally, \u201cjust a chill.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were spending most of their time at Colin\u2019s where Jason and Colin practiced together and searched for a drummer.  When he wasn\u2019t there Jason spent a lot of time scouring the internet for tutorials, you tube videos, anything to help him learn his new instrument.  What little free time he had left after those activities vanished when he decided to get a membership at the local gym.  He was pretty sure that Monica had at least been right about his body growing at a slow but steady rate and if that was the case it wasn\u2019t just his imagination, Nikki was noticing the gradual changes and was more than enthusiastic about them.  In addition to the exercise time itself Jason also found himself doing a lot of research on dieting and exercise, especially for Nikki\u2019s benefit because she insisted on going to the gym with him, and she was vocal about her goals.  \u201cScrew, toned and fit,\u201d she declared.  \u201cI want to be big and buff, maybe steal some of Laura\u2019s thunder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Laura was another issue.  Jason had been doing whatever he could to avoid her and her crowd but he was still seeing people with the unsettling auras.  Brad and Jim in addition to Terry, definitely Laura and another girl he didn\u2019t recognize.  He thought a few times about talking to Monica about the auras but she was studiously avoiding him, probably with as much effort as he was putting into avoiding Laura.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was a Friday.  Jason\u2019s ears were ringing from the jam session he and Colin had just finished and as he packed up his bass he wasn\u2019t sure he heard Nikki correctly at first.  \u201cYou want who to come with us to the gym?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNyah,\u201d Nikki repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but why?\u201d  Nikki and Nyah had either hit it off fairly well with each other or they had found friendship born of the fact they were the only two people in Colin\u2019s house (not counting the absent Monica) who weren\u2019t involved in the music making.  Wendy recorded everything and ran the mixing board while Jason and Colin played which at first Jason had found odd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen her?\u201d  Nikki continued before Jason had the chance to open his mouth and say something along the lines of how hard Nyah was to miss.  \u201cShe eats horrible and she\u2019s so skinny.  A proper diet and exercise would do wonders for her and her self image.\u201d  Nikki lowered her voice, \u201cShe practically starves herself because she wants her boobs to shrink, she\u2019s kind of self conscious about them.\u201d  Jason shook his head, Nikki didn\u2019t seem to see anything wrong with the fact that she appeared to be far more mature and well centered than a girl three years her senior who theoretically should know better.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, she can come along, it\u2019s fine.\u201d  Jason was curious to see how this would play out, as far as he could tell Nyah never left the house.  He wasn\u2019t surprised to see her dressed in bulky sweats even though they did little to hide how well endowed she was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason is really good at this,\u201d Nikki was telling Nyah as they drove to the gym.  Jason was leaning back in the passenger seat with his eyes closed, letting the air wash over him.  He loved Nikki\u2019s convertible.  Nyah was leaning forward from the back seat, her face almost at Nikki\u2019s shoulder.  \u201cHe\u2019s gained so much muscle in the last two week it\u2019s unbelievable, what is it honey?  Twenty pounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s only sixteen or seventeen,\u201d Jason felt awkward about being praised for his bodybuilding prowess when he was pretty sure he would be making the same gains if he sat on his ass and did nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to gain a lot of muscle,\u201d Nyah said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can decide that after you get in better shape, you\u2019re practically skin and bone right now, but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll help you.\u201d  Nikki had approached exercise with the same no holds barred enthusiasm she seemed to approach everything with.  Nyah offered a tentative smile in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had his doubts about how this was going to turn out but he was pleasantly surprised.  Nyah allowed Nikki to lead her through her the same arm routine Nikki was doing.  Nyah did a good job ignoring the others in the gym and Nikki encouraged her whenever it looked like she might be losing motivation or was getting to self conscious.  Jason went quickly through his own routine, making sure he kept the correct form and lifted enough to get a good pump.  He raised his eyebrows when the girl with the aura he didn\u2019t recognize came into the gym as they were wrapping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNikki, why don\u2019t you and Nyah hit the shower?  I\u2019ll finish cleaning this stuff up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Nikki said slowly, she glanced around.  \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d  She didn\u2019t appear to recognize the girl either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jason lied.  \u201cBut I\u2019m kind of in a hurry to get my cute girlfriend to a nice restaurant.\u201d  He smiled and Nikki smiled back, giving him a peck on the cheek before gathering up her gym bag and heading towards the shower with Nyah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason finished putting away the weights they had used and gathering their towels when Brad walked in followed by Terry.  Despite the fact that Terry\u2019s scalp had obviously been fixed by the app he scratched at the afterimage of the scar while he looked at Jason and grinned wickedly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brad and Terry spread out as they both moved in Jasons general direction; far enough apart that he couldn't track them both at the same time.  The girl found an empty weight bench and began studiously loading plates on the empty bar.  So far no one had said a word but the body language and expressions spoke of barely subdued anger and impending violence.  Rather than attempt to reach the showers Jason stopped by an empty weight bench, setting his gym bag down and resting his hands on the empty bar.  The pose may have looked casual but Jason was already calculating how he could use the bar as a weapon, choosing where he placed his hands with balance and leverage foremost in his mind.  He glanced between the two boys, letting his focus drift from the girl but keeping track of the methodical clanking of steel as she continued to add plate after plate on the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey nerd,\u201d Brad sneered, finally stopping just an inch or two out of kicking distance.  Jason could see Terry opening the gym bag he had slung over his shoulder and taking something out of it.  He stole a glance and tensed up to see it was a glass root beer bottle.  \u201cLook at me when I\u2019m talking to you nerd,\u201d Brad snapped.  Jason turned deliberately to face him while still attempting to keep Terry in his peripheral vision.  More plates clanked and Jason absently wondered how much weight was being loaded on that bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to see you\u2019re walking again,\u201d Jason said finally.  \u201cBoth of you.\u201d  He could see Terry taking a swig of the root beer.  Jasons whole body relaxed when Terry lowered the bottle without throwing it or taking a swing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like how you\u2019re trying to play the tough guy routine, nerd,\u201d Brad said.  \u201cTrying so hard not to act scared.  You\u2019ll think you\u2019ll get with Laura if you act hard enough?  Is that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck Laura,\u201d Jason said reflexively, immediately regretting the word choice when both of the jocks laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you\u2019d like to,\u201d Brad leered.  \u201cShe\u2019s way better in the sack than the slut you\u2019re going with now, and I should know.  Does Nikki still like getting her scalp massaged?  Have you tried sucking on the insides of her thighs yet?  She really gets off on that.\u201d  Jason\u2019s stomach crawled and his knuckles creaked as he gripped the bar tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want Brad?\u201d  Jason said, refusing to give them the satisfaction of seeing or hearing him either angry or afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you credit nerd, you have fast reflexes.  And I underestimated you, not a mistake I\u2019ll make again,\u201d Brad continued, ignoring Jason\u2019s question.  Brad made a fist and loudly cracked his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason saw Terry raise the bottle and anticipated more than saw the throw, already ducking and lifting the bar, arcing the bar towards Terry\u2019s projectile.  The spinning bar caught the bottle in midair shattering it but Jason was shocked at the speed it had been thrown, broken glass sliced his cheek and the empty weight bar vibrated in his hands from the impact.  The bar was knocked from his hands, more by accident than design as Brad ran into its continued arc.  Losing his grip on the bar Jason elbowed Brad hard in the gut and winced as it felt like he hit a brick wall.  Before he could do anything else Terry and Brad each grabbed one of his arms in a viselike grip and shoved him down on a weight bench, holding him in place.  He struggled against them but it was like struggling against iron.  They were far stronger than they looked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle bitch,\u201d Terry spit.  \u201cI wanted to slice your fucking head open but you broke the bottle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to make an observation about being outnumbered (again) when Brad and Terry roughly jerked him into a sitting position.  \u201cPay attention nerd,\u201d Brad sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs nerd really the only insult you know?\u201d  Jason\u2019s voice trailed off as he realized they had lifted him up enough so he could watch the unknown girl finish loading plates on the bar.  There was a ridiculous amount of weight on it, so much so that the Olympic sized bar was drooping comically from the middle.  If he had to guess Jason would have estimated the weight currently on the bar at over a thousand pounds.  The girl reached out both hands and with a smooth motion curled the bar up off the support.  She stood there, facing Jason with a feral smile plastered across her face as her arms visibly thickened.  Her entire torso swelled with muscle until her previously loose fitting t shirt began to tear around her delts and lats.  The aura surrounding her swirled angrily and she began to walk towards Jason, still holding the overloaded bar to her chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing you\u2019ve been working out nerd, now let\u2019s see how good your one rep max is.\u201d  Jasons skin crawled as all three began to laugh.  Brad and Terry forced Jason back down on the weight bench and jerked his arms roughly into a ninety degree angle.  Jasons vision was suddenly eclipsed by the girl who was placing the bar in his hands.  \u201cCatch,\u201d Brad said laughing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason tried struggling but he had no leverage, his mind frantically ran through his options as he felt the weighted bar settle into his hands.  The girl let go and Jasons arms collapsed painfully under the weight, he realized after a moment of intense fear that he hadn\u2019t been crushed to death and saw that the girl had caught the weight bar just before it would have impacted his chest.  \u201cThat\u2019s no good, nerd.  You\u2019ll have to do better than that,\u201d Brad laughed as the girl raised the bar again.  Jason\u2019s arms ached and he winced as Brad and Terry forced him to extend them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you broke my elbow,\u201d Jason hissed as he jerked his right arm ineffectually against Terry\u2019s grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSucks to be you don\u2019t it?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, it does,\u201d Jason said through gritted teeth.  \u201cAnd you assholes set me on a giant piece of broken glass, fucking pricks\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlass?  Give it here,\u201d Terry jerked Jason up into a sitting position and let go of his wrist to sweep his hand over the bench.  Whether it was to get his hands on the (non-existent) glass so he could carve Jason up with it or whether he was actually concerned for Jason\u2019s comfort Jason was unsure.  But Jason didn\u2019t hesitate to drive his (unbroken) elbow into Terry\u2019s crotch as hard as he could.  Terry let go of Jason\u2019s shoulder to grasp his wounded manhood but before Jason could do anything else Brad pinned him back down to the bench.  The girl stood immobile, apparently waiting for Brad to get Jason back under control and move out of the way so she could drop the weight bar on him again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d  Jason tried to see who was talking but they weren\u2019t in his currently limited field of vision that mostly consisted of Brad\u2019s armpit and the girl looming above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, helping spot my friend while he works out,\u201d Brad stood up and let go of Jason.  Jason coughed and rubbed his throat, doing a double take at the girl who had racked the ridiculous weight and now looked like she did when she first entered the gym.  Terry limped and shuffled away from the owner who was glaring at the group with an air of righteous indignation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis equipment is not a playground and the weights aren\u2019t toys.  I catch you horsing around in here again and you\u2019re banned, and no, membership dues will not be refunded.\u201d  The ex bodybuilder with the buzzed hair cut an imposing figure but Jason was pretty sure that these three could use him to mop the floor with little effort.  Jason was surprised but they allowed themselves to be stared down.  Muttering under his breath Brad exited the gym and the other two followed him.  Jason tried to slink towards the showers but the owner stopped him.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that was about but the same goes for you, I don\u2019t need anyone causing trouble here understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded his head.  \u201cI just want a place to work out and not get in trouble,\u201d Jason offered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll get along fine,\u201d the owner turned on his heel and stalked back to the front desk.  Jason showered as quickly as possible but Nikki and Nyah were already waiting for him when he got back to the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, I was just about to text you to see where you ran off to,\u201d Nikki gave him a peck on the cheek and he tried not to cringe back.  He couldn\u2019t help but think of her being with Brad and it made his stomach turn.  He was making it up Jason told himself, he was making it up to fuck with me\u2026  Nikki interrupted that morbid train of thought, \u201cWhat did you do to your face?\u201d  She poked at the cut the flying glass had inflicted on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut myself shaving,\u201d Jason said.  Nikki frowned at the extremely obvious lie but let it pass without comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s drop Nyah back at her place and go get some food like you were talking about.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Um,\" Jason forced himself to bury his revulsion at the thought of Brad and Nikki together and his fear at the recent attack in an attempt to focus, \"Mickey's?\"  He said it more as a question than a statement as he held open the door for the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki wrinkled her nose as she walked past, \"A burger joint?  Really?  Try again Romeo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...\"  Jason trailed off as his attention shifted to a unique spectacle.  Almost directly in front of the gym was a pickup truck that had literally been ripped in two, the halves stacked on top of each other and then impaled with what looked like a lightpole.  For a moment Jason wanted to believe it was some kind of performance art or sculpture but then he noticed the gym's owner standing near it, screaming into a cell phone.  He couldn't make out what he was saying but did it really matter?  Jason didn't even look twice at the bizarre scene, he was instantly certain it had been caused by Brad and company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think happened there?\"  Nikki wondered aloud as they walked past to reach her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it doesn't concern us and that I want to keep it that way,\" Jason said.  He frowned, that had come out much more coldly than he had meant it to.  \"It just looks really fucked up and I don't want us to get involved,\" he clarified as he glanced around the parking lot for any sign of Brad, Terry or the mysterious girl.  The coast looked clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Jason,\" Nyah said softly, surprising both of the others.  \"It freaks me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I can't argue with that,\" Nikki said as she unlocked her car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason climbed into the passenger seat, still wracking his brain for a place to go out for dinner with Nikki, anything to take his mind off of the night he had been having so far.  Italian seemed too cliche, \"Chinese?\"  He said, now just throwing ideas at a mental dart board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried not stare at the destroyed truck as Nikki pulled out of the parking lot, \"Sure,\" Nikki agreed, \"which one?\"  Jason groaned inwardly, he just wanted to shut his brain off and stop thinking about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you guys tried the place over near the mall?  Not the one right at the Mall, it's about a mile away, I can't remember what it's called.  It's near that old record shop Colin goes to when he wants to buy something on vinyl.  It looks like a hole in the wall but the food is really good.\"  This may have been the most Jason had ever heard Nyah say at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Jason said, just wanting to get the choice made so he could try to shut off his brain and relax.  He was so relieved when Nikki agreed as well.  He almost immediately zoned out, barely even noticing when Nyah said good bye to him when they dropped her off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to at least guide me to the record store Nyah was talking about,\" Nikki said, breaking into Jason's thoughts.  He groaned with displeasure.  \"Are you OK?\"  Nikki asked, a note of concern in her voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.  Just head towards the mall for now,\" he directed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  A moment of silence crawled by.  \"Are you going to tell me what really happened to your face now that Nyah is gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason groaned again, \"I got into another fight with Brad and Terry again.  And some other girl I didn't recognize,\"  He had momentarily debated lying about it again or just leaving Nikki in the dark but he hoped that getting it out in the open would allow them to get through this and behind them quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fought a girl?\"  Nikki looked away from the road to give Jason the full force of her glare.  \"What did we talk about before?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began laughing which visibly annoyed Nikki even further.  \"It wasn't much of a fight, they held me down to a weight bench and were going to kill me by putting more weight on me than I could lift.  They were also going to carve me up with a broken glass bottle as revenge for what I did earlier, the gym owner broke it up though, he probably saved my life.  I'm guessing that's why they trashed his truck while I was in the showers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how can you sound so calm about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged.  \"I don't know I have other things on my mind I guess,\" like the thought of you fucking Brad, he almost said but didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Nikki said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like sex with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was momentarily stunned speechless.  \"Oh,\" she actually blushed.   \"OK then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn left up here.  The record shop is a couple blocks over on the right, not sure where the Chinese place is,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you think they trashed that truck?  How on earth would they be able to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged, \"I''m not really sure, just a feeling.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese place was only a few doors down from the record shop and they easily found it.  It did look like a hole in the wall and the interior was sparsely decorated and dingy looking.  The food was very good however, better than Jason was expecting though he had to concentrate to actually taste it.  His mind kept drifting back to the thought of Brad screwing Nikki.  \"It doesn't matter,\" he kept telling himself, \"she's with me now, so even if it is true he's probably just jealous.  He's probably lying to piss me off anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're OK?\" Nikki asked after their attempts at conversation stalled out again as his mind drifted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to be.  I made a promise to myself recently that I'm going to live life to the fullest no matter what happens because I don't know how long I have left.  I'm not going to waste any of my time moping around if I can help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds pretty bleak, it's not like you have a terminal disease or something,\"  Nikki stopped eating for a second, \"You don't do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed, \"no, nothing like that.\"  Well it was sort of like that if Monica hadn't been lying about what was going to happen when his body finished syncing with the paradoxed app profile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something you're not telling me isn't there?\"  Nikki accused after swallowing a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down at his plate for a moment before replying.  \"Yea, there is.  It's hard to believe and it will lead to a very long conversation I don't feel like having right now.  So right now I want to finish this food then go park somewhere and have wild crazy sex in your car like I know you like.  It's not that I don't trust your or want to hide things from you, I have my reasons and I'll explain them, I just really don't want to get into it right now because tonight has been rough and I want to have something good happen sooner rather than later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA range of conflicting emotions passed over Nikki's face, for a moment Jason was sure this was going to lead to an argument.  Finally Nikki spoke, \"OK, but you better know a good place to park that's nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled.  \"I think I know a spot,\" he signaled for the check.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short time they were parked in the alley behind the record shop, tucked out of sight between the blank back wall of the building and a row of dumpsters.  Jason had his seat slid back and reclined as far as it would go while Nikki straddled him.  They were progressing quickly past making out, Jason was unusually aggressive, trying to work past the recurring images of Brad and Nikki having sex with each other, feeling more and more frustrated as everything he did to try to push the image out of his head only seemed to make it come back again quicker and with more intensity.  Nikki gasped with pleasure as Jason pulled her shirt and bra up and began licking and sucking at her nipples.  \"Wow,' she breathed, starting to undo his pants and pull up her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, I want to try something first,\" Nikki squeaked with surprise as Jason cradled her head and leaned her back, with a little maneuvering he had her laying with her legs hooked over his shoulders and her head down near his ankles, he surprised himself with his own strength, holding her waist towards his face as he teased her with his tongue.  She moaned with anticipation.  <i>\"Have you tried sucking the inside of her thighs yet? She really gets off on that,\"</i> Brads words echoed in his head, part of him didn't want to see whether or not it was true, part of him wanted to just assume that Brad was lying to him to piss him off.  But the other part was never going to stop wondering.  Jason locked his mouth around the inside of Nikki's creamy thigh, as high as he was able to and sucked at it.  She squealed and bucked with obvious delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Jason that feels so good,\" she purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt like crying but he continued anyway.</span></div></div>",

He was surprised because the times he had gone down on her before she hadn't responded anywhere near as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, that was amazing,\" Nikki said after catching breath.  \"I never thought I'd ever have so much fun while staring at the underside of a dashboard,\" she giggled, \"now please help me up, I think the blood rushing to my head is making me loopy.\"  Jason helped her back into an upright position, straddling him, and again he was surprised at his own strength.  \"Now where were we?\"  Nikki mused out loud, \"Oh yea, I was about to ride you until one of us can't handle it anymore.\"  Before Jason could protest, and tell her that he really wasn't in the mood anymore she had his penis free and had slid onto it.  No matter how his mental state might be his penis hadn't ignored the grinding of a pretty girl against it for the last 20 minutes or so and it was ready to go.  \"That feels so good,\" Nikki cooed in his ear, putting her arms behind his head and nuzzling his neck.  Jason grunted and just tried to get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was really his own worst enemy, focusing on Nikki made him think of her with Brad so he found himself paying attention to the oddest things.  Trying to guess how much loose change was sitting in the cup holder, wondering what stores used the dumpsters they were currently parked behind because the lack of rancid smell led him to guess none of them were restaurants or food related, wondering where Nikki had picked up her preference for vehicle based, borderline exhibitionist sex, and thinking of Nikki and sex led him back to Brad again and the cycle continued.  Nikki began moaning softly in his ear and he realized she was working herself towards another orgasm.  In a few minutes she had come a second time and she let her body go limp against Jasons.  \"Jason, that was so good,\" she said finally, \"I didn't know you could last thing long, it is incredible.\"  She began to twitch her hips again but Jason shook his head and began to lift her off of him.  \"Jason, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at her, trying to find the words.</span></div></div>",

Do you want me to get you some Tums or something?\"  Nikki dismounted and maneuvered to her seat as she pulled her clothes mostly back where they belonged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take me home,\" Jason said softly.  Nikki leaned over and put a hand to his forehead as she studied his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but zip up your pants or I'm going to be too distracted to drive,\" she backed out of their hiding place and pulled out of the alley onto the main road.  \"Shit,\" she muttered under her breath.  As she turned out of the alley a police car was turning off the same road into the alley, the cars passed each other slowly.  Nikki kept driving while sneaking glances at her rear-view mirror and after a moment she cursed again.  The police car had turned out of the alley and was now behind them.  \"Fuck,\" she slapped the steering wheel with the palm of her hand.  \"Someone must have reported us,\" she blushed.  \"I got pretty loud didn't I?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Jason said, fixing his seat and zipping up his pants.  \"Fix your skirt and your bra, let me do the talking.\"  The words were barely out of his mouth when the police squawked their siren and flashed their lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pulled over, straightening her clothing the best she could, Jason scrounged in her purse and found a small spray bottle which he squirted into his mouth.  \"What the fuck are you doing?  That's perfume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grimaced, \"I thought it was breath spray, I didn't want my breath to smell like your...\" he waved towards her crotch and coughed.  \"So problem solved I guess.\"  He coughed again.  \"Let me do the talking,\" he repeated as a police officer got out of the car and began walking towards them.   </span></div></div>",

The police officer walked slowly along the length of the drivers side, making a show of leaning over to peer into the backseat before he finally approached Nikki.  \"License and registration?\"  Nikki handed them over without a word.  The officer looked them over, comparing Nikki's face to her picture on her license.  \"Do you two want to tell me what you were up to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumpster diving officer, there's not a problem is there?\"  Nikki was barely able to restrain herself from whipping her head around to ask Jason what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumpster diving, huh?\"  The cop directed his attention from Nikki to Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Jason said, with a hint of enthusiasm in his voice.  \"The record place will toss out stuff all the time that my friend and I will get usable parts from, like you can get replacement tubes for old guitar amplifiers from some of the stereos they'll trash.  We've even pulled some records that were mostly playable, only a few scratches, some collectors online will still give you something for some of them,\" the cop looked uncertain but Jason continued.  \"My girlfriend wasn't too crazy about the idea though, so we kind of argued about it then decided to leave.  It was a dumb idea, I probably blew my chance for getting laid tonight.\"  Jason gasped out a lungful of air as Nikki elbowed him fiercely in the ribs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop sighed, \"We got a report of someone yelling or shouting so the next time you two have a quarrel, keep it down.  And son, don't be stupid enough to drag your girl to a damn dumpster again.  This will be a warning, next time it will be a charge for disturbing the peace, now get out of here,\" the cop shook his head as he handed Nikki her things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and started the car as soon as he walked away.  \"Dumpster diving?\"  She hissed at Jason as she pulled back into traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colin told me it's where he's picked up some of his sound gear from,\"  Jason leaned his head back and closed his eyes.  Now he really did feel sick to his stomach, probably from the shot of perfume he had sprayed in his mouth.  \"Seemed like a reasonable excuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reasonable excuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want to tell him we had been having sex in public did you?  That is probably something we wouldn't have gotten away from with just a warning.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shook her head.  \"Jason, don't take this is a compliment because it's really not.  In fact it actually kind of scares me.  But I couldn't tell you were lying back there.  I mean I knew you were because we were definitely not dumpster diving but I couldn't TELL you were.\"  Nikki looked away from the road to look at Jason.  \"It scares me,\" she repeated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head, \"would you rather be getting charged for something right now?  Or maybe spend some time in a holding cell?  It sucks.  I certainly don't want to do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not, but...\"  Nikki frowned in silence for a moment as she drove.  \"But I don't like this feeling that you're that good at lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason honestly had never thought about it before, he had never considered himself a gifted liar, until this whole bizarre situation with Laura's phone he had never really felt like he had much reason to lie.  He watched the scenery pass by and tried to think of something to say.  \"Did I tell you we have our first show in a few days?\"  Jason said finally.  \"Tuesday night.  Opening for a local band at the Chiller.  Colin got the gig confirmed for us this morning, someone else backed out and they probably would have taken anyone wiling to stand on stage for forty minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't have a drummer yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're pretty sure we got one, we'll be spending the next couple of days practicing our asses off to get him broken in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it then,\" Nikki said after a moment.  \"You're not going to talk about your scary good lying skills, you aren't going to talk about whatever big secret thing you haven't been telling me, you're going to talk about your band.  OK.\"  Nikki was obviously growing angry with Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about, \"Nikki, I would never lie to you?\"\"  She barked.  \"Not that I'd freaking be able to tell,\" she barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it,\" she interrupted him.  \"You're home, hopefully you'll feel better.  If you're even telling the truth about being sick,\"  she was gripping the steering wheel hard enough that her knuckles were white and she stared straight ahead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened and closed his mouth a few times, trying to think of something to say that wouldn't ring hollow in his own ears, much less hers.  \"I'm sorry tonight turned out the way it did, I really am.  But I hope you enjoyed at least some of it.\"  He got out of the car and almost instantly dropped to a knee as an overwhelming wave of nausea overcame him.  Whether it was the perfume, the stress he had been under all night, or whether it really was the food he ended up puking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Jason.  Are you OK?\"  Nikki started to get out of her car but he waved her back as he struggled to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" he said as he walked to his front door without looking back.  This time she actually was pretty sure he was lying.</span></div></div>",

Finally he rolled out of bed and forced himself to eat some kind of breakfast.  He was in the process of packing up his gym bag and bass before heading to Colin's for practice when his phone buzzed.  He assumed it was Nikki wanting to talk and a quick check verified it was her.  He waited until he had walked almost all the way to Colin's before responding, \"At Colin's practicing, I'll call you later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let himself in when he reached Colin's and was surprised to be greeted by Nyah, \"Hey Jason,\" she turned away from the TV as he walked in.  \"Did you guys try that Chinese food place?  How did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yea.  The food was really good, thanks for letting us know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you guys liked it.  Are we going to the gym again tonight?  Nikki said you work out almost every day, a different muscle group each time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was slightly surprised by her enthusiasm, \"Yea, that's the plan.  Not sure what time yet but I'll let you know, I'll probably be here most of the day practicing with the new drummer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spud?  I don't think I like him, he was staring at my boobs when he showed up,\" Nyah said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had no response to that observation so he just awkwardly mumbled, \"later,\" and headed back towards Colin's room.  As he passed Monica's room her door clicked shut as though it had been partially open, he frowned at it as he walked past and shouldered his way through Colin's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mate!\"  Colin waved to Jason as soon as he realized he was there, \"come meet our new drummer.  Spud this is Jason, Jason this is Spud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook the hand of the gruff looking young man Colin was introducing him to.  He was short, probably not much taller than five foot three or four and had a short unkempt beard and shaved head.  \"Spud?\"  Even as Jason said it he realized that with his stocky build and hairstyle choice his silhouette resembled a Mr. Potato Head, it was probably even more pronounced when he was hunched over his drum kit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave,\" he said with a shrug, \"but everyone calls me Spud, it's cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Spud,\" Jason said, shaking his hand again.  \"So what's the plan?  Work out a set list then practice our asses off until the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" Colin said with a laugh.  Wendy shot him a glance that seemed to indicate she was anything but amused by the time crunch they found themselves in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe late morning quickly turned into early afternoon before they arrived at a set list of songs they all knew and figured they'd be able to play together.  \"Our set is for 45 minutes but we really only need 35 to 40 minutes of music, there has to be some time for audience patter and such,\"  Colin explained as he smoked a cigarette.  \"We're not going to have the time to get anything original competently written and rehearsed before then so we'll be sticking to cover songs for now.  It's not terrible because you get a certain guaranteed audience reaction with songs they already know.  It's not something we want to rely on though, by the next show we do we need to have at least a few originals or we'll be stuck in people's minds as a cover act.\"  Jason and Spud nodded in agreement as Colin continued.  \"The Chiller is primarily a metal venue but we can get away with a lot of cross genre stuff if it's fast and heavy enough, I'm thinking primarily punk and grunge because it's more to our current skill level.  The two biggest songs I think we'll get reactions from are \"Smells like Teen Spirit,\" and \"Blitzkrieg Bop,\" both are high energy and well known.  I think we'd do best opening with Blitzkrieg to get people's attention and close with Teen Spirit because the guys we're opening for have a young fan base, they'll be more likely to know Teen Spirit and most of them should be at the show by that point, any chance we have to grow our fan base by leeching from someone else's we take, yea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyah surprised everyone by sticking her head into the room, \"Jason, Nikki is here to take me to the gym, you're coming right?\"</span></div></div>",

A lot happened last night, I'm not positive what caused it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Nyah looked unsure of how else to respond.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt surprisingly uncomfortable upon entering the gym.  The brutalized pickup had been removed since last night but the combination of the owner giving Jason the stink eye as soon as he saw him and just the smell of the place gave Jason the chills.

At first Jason didn't think he'd be able to handle it, laying on the bench with the feel of the bar in his hands and remembering what had almost happened to him last night, it took a tremendous effort to unrack the weight and begin his workout but once he did he was like a man possessed.  \"More weight,\" he rasped after quickly pushing out a handful of reps.  It felt too easy.  His spotter obliged and Jason did another rep.  \"No, I need more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, slow down bud, don't overdo it,\" his spotter cautioned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I drop it that means I overdid it, give me more weight,\" Jason snarled.  Jason went through set after set like this, adding more weight after every few reps until he was frankly amazed that he was able to keep lifting.  His last rep of his final set was shaky and he was barely able to complete it but he felt enormously satisfied when managed it.  This had been the most grueling and taxing workout he could even imagine and his spotter was in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be feeling that in the morning pal,\" he said, slapping Jason on the shoulder.  Jason only grunted and made sure he thoroughly stretched his muscles before hitting the showers.  His timing was perfect, he ran into Nikki and Nyah in the lobby as they left their own locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, honey, you look good, you look REALLY good,\" Nikki purred, running her hand over Jason's chest.  \"You look bigger than yesterday, how is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's just a good pump, when you exercise enough you engorge the muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what a pump is,\" Nikki stuck her tongue out at Jason, \"I just didn't realize they could be that extreme.  Looking really good,\" she repeated again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your and Nyah's workout?\"  Jason asked as they walked towards Nikki's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good, probably not as good as yours though,\" Nikki giggled as her hands went back to Jason's chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki is a really good teacher,\" Nyah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you decide what your goals were?\"  Jason asked Nyah.  His intention was to make sure she didn't feel left out, he was surprised by the enthusiasm of her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have a few.  I need to work on my shoulders, um... delts and traps I think?  Along with my back and lats to help with my posture, and a lot of squats and other leg exercises I can't remember to help with my legs and butt to balance out my...\" Nyah trailed off but Jason assumed she was talking about balancing her lower body and upper body proportion a bit better.  \"And some tone in my arms so they don't look like \"pipe cleaners\" anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed, \"I said my arms were like pipe cleaners, I never said that about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyah shrugged. \"My arms are skinnier than yours,\" she observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a little bit of everything then?\"  Jason asked.  Nyah nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here we are,\" Nikki announced as they pulled up to Nyah's place.  \"Are you coming with me Jason or do you have more practicing to do tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice,\" Jason said, \"the only thing we've done so far is pick out a set list.  Can we meet up later tonight?  Or you can stick around and watch the practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shook her head.  \"Not tonight, I have things to do bright and early tomorrow so I'll be calling it a night early.  So if you want any time,\" Nikki glanced up to make sure Nyah had already left the car and walking towards her house before running her hand down Jason's chest straight to his crotch,\" alone, you have to come with me now.\"  </span></div></div>",

And you better work your chest again tomorrow because I expect your pecs to be just as pumped, if not more so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, ma'am,\" he said with a laugh.

Colin wasn't quite as satisfied however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, you can't just stand there mate, you have to move around, jump up and down or something, have a stage presence for Christ's sake!\"  Jason tried playing a riff while bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet and quickly lost his place on the fret board.  \"This is why metal guys grow long hair, they bob their head the slightest bit and hair goes everywhere, looks very dynamic without really having to do anything,\" Colin explained after they finished playing the song yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not going to be able to grow my hair out by Tuesday,\" Jason griped after testing out his ability to walk the length of the tape marks on the floor that currently represented their \"stage.\"  It didn't go much better than his attempt at pogoing had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes practice, you'll get there,\" Colin assured him, \"now once more from the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night passed quickly in that manner, they had played trough the first half of their setlist multiple times and Jason was getting better at moving and playing but Colin still wasn't satisfied.  \"Why bother?\" Jason complained after another series of missed notes frustrated him as he tried to move and play again.  \"The Ramones pretty much just stood there and everyone loved them,\" Jason pointed out, remembering footage Colin had showed them earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the same,\" Colin explained, taking a break to light a cigarette.  He offered Jason one as well and he took it.  \"We're a three piece, they were four and had a great front man in Joey Ramone.  Think of us more like Motorhead, I'm not going to be able to move around as much as you since I'll be singing as well as playing, it means I'm stuck where the mic stand is.  You have to keep the crowd going.  Don't get discouraged, I know you have it in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I need to figure out a different gimmick,\" Jason mused as he smoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but you only have a few days to figure out what it's going to be,\" Colin stubbed out his cigarette and waited until Jason had finished his as well before nodding to Spud. \"OK, one more and we'll call it a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't one more though, Colin drove them through another handful of takes until Jason was exhausted, but as tired as he was he felt sorry for Spud who had been energetically drumming the entire night without complaint.  Jason was pleasantly surprised when Spud gave him a pep talk of sorts when they finally did break for the evening.  \"Don't worry man, you're doing really well, you'll be fine by the show.  Go home and get some sleep so we can hit it again bright and early.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded, \"Thanks,see you in the morning.\"  Jason could barely remember walking home and practically collapsing in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason woke to his alarm going off with a groan and rolled out of bed to shut it off.  He quickly used the restroom and showered.  While he was in the process of rinsing soap off of himself he paused to regard his chest.  His \"pump\" from the previous days workout showed no indication of subsiding  and now that he thought about it he didn't feel sore from the brutal workout he had put himself though which he would have fully expected.  He got out of the shower and dried himself off then spent a few minutes flexing in front of the mirror.  He definitely looked bigger than he had yesterday.  Ever since Monica had told him he was probably gaining about a pound a day of muscle he had been weighing himself every few days and had confirmed that her theory was correct.  On a hunch he stepped on the scale and let out a low whistle.  He had gained just over five pounds yesterday.  It couldn't have been anything he ate since he had barely ate at all yesterday, feeling queasy most of the day from his puking the night before had put a damper on his appetite.  Was it just from his monster workout?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason really wanted to go to the gym and put himself through the proverbial wringer to see how his body would react but decided it should wait until his trip to the gym with Nyah and Nikki later.  But as much as he wanted to really test his limits he also didn't want to let Colin down, and by extension Spud.  He got dressed and headed to Colin's garage where he had left his gear the night before.  Colin was already there, noodling on his guitar and Spud arrived before Jason was even finished plugging in and checking his tuning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright gentlemen, let's hit it, we did the front half of the setlist last night, let's see what we can do with the back half this morning,\" Colin nodded to Spud who started off their next song.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found himself concentrating more on what sort of workout he was going to push himself through tonight than the music.  Oddly enough though that seemed to work in his favor.  Without even realizing it he was bobbing his head in time to the music as he played.  He grew more confident as the morning progressed and even managed to do some light pogoing without losing his rhythm or missing any notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking really good guys,\" Colin said finally as they stopped when Nyah and Nikki showed up in the garage to take Jason to the gym.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that time already?\"  Jason asked incredulously.  Nikki and Nyah both nodded.  They had already played through every song in the latter half of the setlist but Jason really felt like showing off for Nikki now that she was here.  \"We got time for one more right?  Can we do one more take of Smell Like Teen Spirit?\"  Jason asked the guys without even waiting for Nikki to answer.  Colin kicked off the song with the famous opening chords and Jason threw himself into his playing with abandon, headbanging, jumping up and down at the section changes and confidently pacing the \"stage\" during the slow sections of the song.  As the song ended Nikki enthusiastically clapped which brought an irrepressible grin to his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin left his spot at the microphone stand to clap Jason on the back.  \"There you go mate, perfect, now save some of that for the show.\"  He lit a cigarette and laughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason set his bass down and hugged Nikki, she pawed his chest and ground against him for a moment, \"I really missed you last night,\" she breathed into his ear before dancing away again.  \"C'mon, we should be at the gym by now,\" she said loud enough for everyone to hear.  Jason was about to ask Colin what time they should be back to continue practice when Colin waved him and Spud over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, guys, I think we have a really good start here and while we do have more work to do before the show I don't want us to burn out completely either.  I'm thinking we should call it quits for today, then get back tomorrow to try a run through of the whole playlist, unless one of you thinks we should hit it again tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpud shook his head, \"I think you're right, hit it again tomorrow when we're fresh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin nodded, \"Jason?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded his agreement.  \"I think taking the rest of the night off is a good plan,\" he grinned anxious to get to the gym and then get with Nikki later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin nodded again, \"OK, but plan for a late one tomorrow if your playing is bollocks in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed, \"I'm feeling really good about this, don't sweat it.\"  He hurried to join the girls who were already in Nikki's car.  There was some small talk about the upcoming show and how their day had been so far but Jason was primarily trying to decide what he was going to do when he got to the gym.  He had mainly got a membership so his growth wouldn't seem completely unnatural as it occurred.  And he could probably get away with gaining five pounds of pure muscle in one day every once in a while without gaining too much attention but would doing the same thing two days in a row be too much?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason gave Nikki a peck on the cheek and gave Nyah a casual nod when they arrived at the gym, then he practically ran to the free weights.  He remembered his unorthodox workout yesterday where he had steadily increased the weights he was using.  He experimented with a few dumbbells then started out today's workout with the heaviest ones he could barely curl.  After a number of reps he felt like he could paradoxically move up in weight and did, again and again until he finally did reach a set where his arms felt like rubber and he really couldn't lift anymore.  Despite feeling exhausted he switched over to working his legs and steadily pushed himself through a similarly grueling workout.  His shorts actually felt unusually snug around his thighs when he was done and this almost instant sign of results spurred him on to do his back routine in the same manner, then his shoulders and chest, and finally his abs.  He stood next to the free weights dripping with sweat and guzzling water when he realized that while he had just been panting like he ran a marathon a few moments ago he was already breathing normally again.  This defied all logic, conventional bodybuilding wisdom was to split muscle groups across days of the week with occasional days off, he had just done a full five day cycle and was already feeling ready to go again.  He finished his water and tentatively grabbed the dumbbell he had finished with a short time ago and was surprised when it felt too light to be challenging.  He was in the middle of another insanely punishing arm workout when Nikki startled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are.\"  Jason looked up to see Nikki and Nyah both standing behind him, obviously fresh from the showers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm,yea, just finishing up,\" Jason finished his reps with this dumbbell and put it back on the rack even though he knew he could have kept going if he wanted to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki, dodged his attempt at a hug.  \"Not till you take a shower pal,\" her eyes wandered over his body with some surprise as she stepped back and looked at him while he was standing up instead of hunched over doing curls.  \"How did... that is one hell of a pump, wow,\" her face trailed off and she blushed slightly.  \"C'mon, go shower so we can get going, we have things to do tonight,\" Nikki swatted at his butt with her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, I'm going,\" he said, jogging towards the shower.  He stretched out his muscles while in the shower, more out of habit than because he thought he needed to, it really felt like he had already gotten a full day or two of recovery time and he was surprised at how much harder his muscles felt to the touch and how much larger they appeared.  When Jason finished showering he stepped onto the locker room scale and if it was to be believed he had gained just under fifteen pounds of muscle since he had weighed himself this morning.  That seemed very hard to believe but he paused in front of one of the over the sink mirrors and flexed his chest, it did look noticeably more muscular than it had this morning he concluded.  If all this was because of only one monstrous full body workout he wondered how much further he could push himself if he really wanted to and and the time.  Nikki had interrupted him but he really felt like he could have gone for more if he had wanted.  He pulled his t-shirt on over his head and noticed how tight it now fit across his chest.  Maybe it was a good thing he had stopped when he had, any larger and it would be very difficult for anyone to laugh off his transformation as natural.  He had the same though moments later as he finally joined the girls in the lobby and Nikki gleefully accepted his hug this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" she exclaimed, obviously startled as she rested her head against his chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you told me to get pumped to make up for practicing last night, I just want to make sure you're happy,\" Jason said, trying to deflect the question he knew was incoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pumped?\"  Nikki poked and groped at his chest, \"holy shit,\" she repeated.  \"OK,\" she blushed and stepped away from Jason.  \"Um, let's drop Nyah off and get to our,\" she stopped herself from saying something, \"plans.  We had plans,\" she finished lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we did,\" Jason agreed putting his arm around Nikki's waist as they walked to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone home at your place?\"  Nikki asked after they dropped off Nyah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head, \"nope, my mom is working tonight.\"  Nikki drove as fast as she thought she could get away with to Jason's and the two dashed inside as quickly as they could while kissing and groping each other.  Jason locked the front door behind them and Nikki tossed her purse aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" she declared...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki literally launched herself at Jason and he caught her, gasping with surprise.  She took advantage of his open mouth and kissed him deeply.  He reacted quickly, returning her kiss and their tongues touched.  Nikki tugged anxiously at the hem of Jason's t-shirt trying to pull it up and he was forced to break off their kiss to attempt to get his shirt off.  As difficult to get on as the shirt had been it was virtually impossible to remove and Jason finally gave up and ripped it from his body, tearing it apart like tissue paper to expose his chest.  Nikki actually cried out in response, \"Oh my God,\" before pawing at him again.  They aggressively made out, in an odd almost dance where they slowly shed clothing a piece a time while trying to remain in full contact with each other.  A lot of their clothing was getting destroyed in the process, Nikki grunted as she tugged at Jason's boxers and they tore loudly, then she gasped as Jason literally tore her bra in half to get it off.  He clamped his mouth over one of her nipples and simultaneously licked and sucked causing her to cry out again.  He roughly tugged at her pants, succeeding at pulling her zipper down but tearing the top button entirely off.  She windmilled her legs awkwardly for a moment while she clung to his neck, trying to get her pants off.  When she finally succeeded she wrapped her legs around his waist and buried her face his in his neck, kissing and sucking passionately, fully intending to give him a hickey while she was at it.  She never felt this primal and sexual before, she felt like this was her man and she had to mark him.  Jason grunted as her nails raked his back and he tried to fully get his own pants off, finally giving up and let them remain around his ankles while he leaned them against the nearest wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grunted as the air was forced from her lungs with the impact of her back against the wall.  Pictures rattled along the wall and somewhere something loudly fell and broke.  Jason glanced in the direction of the wall but Nikki growled, \"no, fuck me now.  Now,\" she repeated.  Jason thumped her against the wall again as he adjusted his grip on her and his stance.  She cried out as he plunged into her and she slid down the entire length of his shaft.  Somewhere something else fell off the wall and broke but they both ignored it this time.  Nikki panted as Jason flexed and unflexed his legs over and over again, pumping quickly in and out of her.  More confident now in his stance and grip on Nikki, Jason began to pump even harder and she cried out convulsively.  All around them pictures rattled on the walls and a shelf fell, striking Jason on the shoulder.  He merely grunted and ignored it, they ignored everything but each other until the drywall began to crack around Nikki and suddenly there was a Nikki sized crater in the wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood up, supporting Nikki by her buttocks, momentarily too stunned to move.  \"Don't stop,\" Nikki panted into his ear, \"we're not done yet.\"  She gyrated her hips on Jasons cock to stress her point.  Their mouths met again and Jason lowered her to the floor where they continued their frantically intense lovemaking.    With Jason on top, with Nikki on top, from behind, they tried everything they could think of and then repeated their favorites when they ran out of new ideas.  From the floor to the couch, a kitchen chair, the stairs, and another wall until finally they made their way to Jason's bed.  \"Fuck,\" Nikki finally exclaimed, flopping down on the bed next to Jason after another orgasm.  He grabbed her breast and put an arm around her waist, pulling her closer to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we've been doing,\" Jason said with a grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki chuckled.  \"I know,\" she swatted as Jason's hand wandered downward, \"and I didn't think I'd say this but I think I've had enough for one night.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Jason flopped over to lay on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get discouraged big guy,\" Nikki said, rolling over on top of him, \"I'll finish you off.\"  Before Jason could respond she wrapped her breasts around Jason's cock and worked her way up and down his shaft, flicking and sucking at the tip with her mouth when she reached it.  Jason quickly came and when he was done she lay next to him, wrapping her arms tightly around him.  After she had a moment to catch her breath Nikki ran her fingers across Jason's chest and arms.  \"You know we really need to talk about how on earth you grew so much muscle in the last couple days.  I thought your progress the last couple weeks was impressive but this is just insane.  What's going on with you Jason, the temper and now the muscles?  You're not doing steroids are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason laughed at Nikki's question. He hadn't meant to and he could feel her body tense up in his arms but the thought of doing drugs actually surprised him. Steroids would have been so simple; he actually would have loved for his situation to be as basic as steroids. He hugged Nikki close with one arm while he lifted the other and flexed his bicep. He regarded the baseball sized lump that sprouted atop his arm like some alien that had taken up residence in his body. He tightened his grip and felt the power crackle within the hard muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he said at last. \"I\u2019m not doing steroids. Though I understand why you would ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it wouldn't be the worst thing if you were. I know it can be relatively safe if done right.\" She paused then slid a hand down his hard chest towards his crotch where she gripped his relaxed penis. \"I would just hate for this little monster to shrink any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was reminded of their conversation about his uncanny ability to lie from two night ago and wondered if Nikki thought he was being dishonest now. Perhaps she was trying to pull the truth from him or maybe she really was okay with the idea of him juicing. Either way the truth was much more complicated and Jason was not excited about the idea of getting into it; at the same time, though, he knew he couldn't avoid it forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute passed and Nikki realized Jason wasn't going to say anything further without prompting she spoke again. \"This is related to that something that you're not telling me, isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It is.\" Jason said quickly hoping that the speed of his reply would give weight to its truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I ever get to find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just\u2026 it's hard-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was reaching her limit. \"Hard? As hard as watching you suffer in silence half the day? As hard as being shoved aside and told to blindly trust a man who is physically changing on a daily basis? As hard as giving yourself over emotionally to someone who gives almost nothing back? Tell me, Jason, what's harder than that? Because I love you but if this goes on much longer you won't have to worry about Brad killing you, I'll just do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harshness with which she tossed Brad's murder attempts around stung. Jason tried to get angry that she would be so flippant with something so painful and scary but then realized that she was probably just as scared about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed, his anger quickly fading. \"You're right. The problem is that the truth is impossible, but it's still the truth. I'm just afraid that you won't believe me. Hell, I'm worried that you <i>will</i> believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki broke out of his embrace then climbed on Jason's body straddling his stomach. Instinctively his hands went to her perfect thighs but it was clear that she wasn't interested in his touch as much as his words. \"Just tell me. We can figure it all out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Okay, but I just want to say one more time that I know how stupid this all sounds. It started a few weeks ago with this strange iPhone app\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason told her everything: the skinny and awkward Laura he was familiar with, his hulk-like transformation, altering Laura, the paradox, beating Brad, getting arrested, meeting Colin, the scary conversation with Monica, getting attacked by Terry and Jim, seeing the auras, watching Brad and his friends get bigger and stronger, the girl with the expanding muscles, being lost and confused, his steady weight gain, his super effective workouts, and not knowing who Nikki was from before all this madness began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done he stopped and waited for a response. He could see tears in Nikki's eyes and desperately wanted her to say something but knew he had to wait for her to process it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an eternity, she spoke: \"I believe you're telling me the truth.\" Nikki said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Jason was actually surprised. His story was insane, why would anyone believe it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, I mean it's so crazy but so is your weight gain. And it explains why you've been so different lately.\" She sighed then rolled out of bed. She began gathering her clothes and getting dressed. She picked up her torn bra and frowned before tossing it into a small trash can in the corner of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Jason asked though his voice held no protest to her departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished putting her clothes back on and looked at him. \"This is a lot to take in. I need time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and let Nikki's eyes take in his body. His physique was further proof that his story was true and he intended to leave the image in her mind. He stifled a grin as he watched her nipples harden through her shirt. She approached him and placed her hands on his shoulders. She squeezed his muscles while looking over his pumped up chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're going to get bigger?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot.\" He said then the memory of his all too brief time as a muscle giant came into his mind and he added, \"Gigantic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shook her head. \"This is crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't disagree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to leave the room. Just before she stepped out she glanced back at Jason and said, \"I'll call you. Just give me some time to digest all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled warmly. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left Jason, still naked, went to the bathroom and stood before the mirror flexing his muscles. It was shocking how much his body had grown in the last two days. Because of his tall frame he wasn't looking like a bodybuilder just yet, but he didn't think he'd look out of place along side some pretty strong track and field athletes. He flexed his chest and lats giving his pecs a feel with one hand. It was amazing just how hard they were and his penis rose to attention fueled by excitement of his bigger and stronger body that was on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically Jason knew that he needed to slow down. He should stop hitting the weights so hard and just let his size come slowly as he had been doing for the last few weeks but the feeling of strength was so intoxicating he didn't know if he'd be able to help himself. The way he was able to just keep adding weight to his lifts and recover nearly instantly was impossible to resist. Already he was tempted to throw on some clothes and go to the gym and see what he could do but he knew that would be a mistake. He had to be smarter; he couldn't tell everyone the truth like he'd told Nikki. There was a good chance that he actually would have to lie about being on steroids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day at a time,\" he told his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason returned to his room and climbed into bed. He expected that he'd be awake for a long time since all thoughts of Nikki were swirling around his head. Instead, however, the fact that he had finally bared his soul to her was a weight lifted from his shoulders and very soon he was drifting away. It was the best sleep he'd gotten in weeks.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't tell if Colin was actually angry or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punk rockers don't give a fuck about authority, or society, or their bodies.\" He was pointing squarely at Jason's chest but Jason still wasn't catching on. \"Punks are skinny gits with track marks on their arms not buff athletes that look ready to run a dozen marathons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down at his body which was clothed in black jeans and a plain white t-shirt, both of which were tight enough to show off the definition of his ever enlarging muscles below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, shit Jason,\" by now Colin was beginning to chuckle and it was clear that he wasn't really mad. \"You look incredible but we've got an image to uphold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled and began setting up his bass. \"You said it yourself, man. We're playing for a younger crowd. What's wrong with giving the ladies in the audience something nice to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a quiet voice spoke, \"I think the girls will go crazy, Jason. You look really big- uh, I mean good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Colin both spun to see the source of the new voice and both were shocked to see Nyah pulling up a chair and sitting on the far side of the garage as if she were in the audience. She was still wearing her usual baggy clothes which did nothing to hide her enormous bosom, but something was different about her. It took Jason longer than it should have to discern but he finally realized it was her smile, rather the fact that she even had one. It was slight but it lit up her entire face and Jason couldn't help but wonder just how beautiful she would be with a full smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Knives!\" Colin said with a smile. Jason hadn't ever heard Colin use this nickname for his sister but he also hadn't seen them interact all that much since Nyah preferred solitude. \"What brings to out of your cave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyah blushed. \"I wanted to watch you play. Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a definite shift in Nyah's comfort zone, she typically hung out only in her room or the living room ignoring the world around her but now she was actually making an effort to be around other people. Especially considering what she said about Spud recently and how he was staring at her boobs. Jason glanced back at the drummer who was a bit too intent on keeping his eyes down while he tightened the skin on his toms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah,\" Colin said. \"We're always happy to have more groupies. Or any groupies, really.\" Jason was taken aback by how nonplused Colin was to see his recluse of a sister suddenly appear but finally decided that it was for the best. The quickest way to make Nyah recoil and go back into hiding was to make a big deal out of her emergence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the trio set about practicing their set list. They launched into it and played through it from start to finish taking only small pauses between songs for Colin to jot down some notes. Once done they went back to the top and played through again, then again. Before they launched into their fourth play through Nyah stood up and said spoke for the first time since arriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026 I have an idea. Why don't you switch the order you play 'Anarchy in the UK' and 'Search and Destroy,'\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that, love?\" Colin asked a bit more defensively than he likely intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyah crossed the garage and pointed to the list of songs he was holding. \"The way you guys play 'Search and Destroy' is fast and really high energy. It means you're changing gears a lot, look.\" She pointed at the songs as she went through the middle of the pack. \"You go high energy, then high, low, high, low. If you flip those two then you'll go high, low, low, high. You'll get a better rhythm going, you guys can rest a bit more, and you get more bang for your buck when you kick back into the high energy stuff again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin looked at the list for a while running through the music in his head. Finally he laughed, \"You know, I think you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right, she's right,\" Wendy shouted from behind her ancient and dilapidated soundboard. \"Good ear, Nyah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 also,\" she added, \"I think Jason should take his shirt off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed and turned a light shade of red. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right away, but maybe a little into the set take it off. It'll have a great effect; on the girls that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin ignored this second comment. \"Alright, gents. Let's do it again with Nyah's change. In fact, Spud, take Anarchy down tempo a little more so we can really drive it home then kick some teeth in when we speed things up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpud nodded and the three of them launched back into the set once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lost count of the number of times they played through the songs, but he was amazed at how tight the band was feeling. Before he knew it Colin was calling it a night. Jason set his bass down and gathered his things. He checked his phone and saw that he still hadn't heard from Nikki. He supposed that she was still trying to figure out how to deal with everything he told her. It was quite a bit to take in, he just hoped that he hadn't pushed her away completely. A voice in the back of his mind told him not to worry about her, that she would still love him in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Nikki coming so we can go to the gym?\" Nyah asked looking positively excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Jason said. \"She wasn't feeling too well last night. I think she's taking a day off. That can be good for you, you know. A rest day is a good way to help your muscles grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would know, I guess.\" Nyah said looking at Jason's chest and shoulders. \"I didn't know someone could grow so big so fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, um\u2026 most people can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to the gym do you think I could tag along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was glad that Nyah was actually excited about exercising and it really seemed to be helping her come out of her shell. He supposed it would be good to get her out in the world and continue to encourage her to have a good time. At the same time he wasn't sure if he wanted to babysit her at the gym. Should he even go to the gym at all? He had a feeling that if he did he wouldn't be able to resist another grueling workout and his expanding muscles would only get harder and harder to explain. Still, the thought of more power and more size was causing a excited buzzing in his stomach.</span></div></div>",

Alright then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to leave Jason told her that she could get some aerobic exercise in at home really easily. Her mood lightened a little at this thought which allowed Jason to head home without feeling too much like he had crushed Nyah's hopes. Jason rode the bus home and changed out of his clothes into gym shorts and a loose t-shirt. Well, it should have been loose but his physique filled it out pretty well. It wasn't tight but snug for sure. He realized that pretty much all of his clothes were cut to fit someone who was very thin, which he had been up until very recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why I need to stay away from the gym,\" Jason told his reflection as his flexed his chest and felt his shirt tighten. \"Another workout like the last few and I wont have anything that fits me anymore.\" He pumped his arm a few times smiling at the way his bicep filled up the sleeve. He'd weighed himself and found he was up to 192 pounds which meant he had grown by 40 pounds since arriving in this reality, and nearly half of that was the result of the last two trips to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason checked his phone again. Still no word from Nikki. He wondered if he should send her a message but figured he'd wait until tomorrow at the earliest. So instead he turned on his TV and began flipping through channels looking for something to watch. It only took a few minutes for his mind to return to the gym and his desire to pump his body even larger. He tried to refocus on whatever show he'd landed on but his desire to hit the gym was turning into a need. Real strength was within his grasp and he could have it. He remembered how good it had felt to lift heavier and heavier weights and then come back for more. To hit a barrier and push through it then go further. To feel the power in his body rage like a fire that could forge muscles of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't noticed it until now but one of Jason's hands was inside his shirt feeling his chest and stomach while the other was rubbing his huge erection through his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed. \"Maybe a good workout will help me blow off some steam.\" He knew this was a terrible idea but also knew he would probably go through with it anyway. What he really needed was something to preoccupy himself, he just didn't know what that something was. He tried to burn off some energy by doing pushups but the ease with which he blew through them just made him hungrier for more strength. And he could have it if he just gave in to his desires.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason entered the gym muttering to himself about what a bad idea this was. He had intended to merely jog the 4 miles from his home to the gym but instead had run at top speed. Even with the long sprint behind him Jason hardly felt tired and dove directly into his workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery set, every rep he told himself to take it easy, that this was not a good idea, that he would regret this at yet he continued to pile the weights higher, lift more, push his body harder than ever. He worked his way around the gym working his legs, back, chest, abs, arms, and shoulders all within two hours. After he stood panting with a dull fire burning in his body from the neck down. His shirt was now clinging to his body tight enough to show off the separation between his growing pecs and when he pumped his arms the sleeves responded with tiny snaps and pops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sucked down a bottle of water and could already feel his fatigue fading. He looked around the gym and noticed that the place had nearly cleared out, there were only a few people left. He nodded. \"Good. There aren't too many people to see me really go nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began a second cycle adding even more weight to his exercises. The burning in his body become a fire and it seemed as though he could actually feel his muscles getting bigger. And he was loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the conclusion of his second trip around the gym Jason lay on the bench press completing a set of 10 reps with 390 pounds on the bar. He didn't have a spotter and knew that was a bad idea, but tonight was the night of bad ideas. Besides, there wasn't anyone else around to spot him anyway and the idea of just stopping and heading home was far from his mind. Jason racked the bar and sat up, it wasn't enough. No one his size should be able to bench this much and yet he needed more. He got up and added a 25 pound plate to each side then lay back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath. \"There are full blown bodybuilders, huge ones, that can't bench this much. Okay, 440. Here we go.\" Jason extended his arms and the bar lifted out of its cradle. For a moment he held it in place getting a sense for just how heavy it was. It's like I'm holding two of me in my hands, he thought. Slowly he bent his arms and brought the weight down towards his chest. For a moment he thought he'd made a big mistake as the bar didn't stop going down when he wanted to stop it but a moment later he caught himself and began pressing it back up. Slowly but surely he extended his arms once more the, before he could think better of it, he went for a second rep. As had been the pattern of the night the second one was easier. And the third easier still. By the time he got to 10 he felt he could add more weight, not a lot, but he was sure he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe racked the bar and let out a sigh, his arms dangling at his sides. He closed his eyes and let the heat of the lift seal more super powered strength into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really dangerous, you know.\" A deep voice spoke from very close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's eyes shot open and he spotted Brad standing right above him in a spotter position. At least it looked like Brad's head, the body was something else entirely. Swirls of multicolored auras danced around more muscle than should have been possible. Brad's pecs were so engorged that he had to lean forward to see where Jason lay. His tank top and shorts were painted on so tightly that every nook, cranny, bulge, and vein was clearly visible as if he wore nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that weight and no spotter. I figured a nerd like you would be smarter.\" A nasty snarl curled Brad's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt panic sweep over his body. Visiting the gym had gone from bad idea to fatal mistake. His first instinct was to run, put the gym equipment between himself and the giant above him but before he could even move he heard laughter from below him. A quick glance revealed Jim and Terry, both of whom were also much larger now, though Brad put them both to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, nerd, you've grown a bit since the last time I saw you,\" Brad said. \"Of course, so have I.\" Brad flexed an arm that was bigger around than a basketball. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tilted his head back and surveyed Brad's new body. \"Yeah, pretty impressive.\" He pointed at Brad's thighs. \"This thing is pretty huge, and so is this one over here. This one in the middle, though, leaves a lot to be desired.\" Jason's finger hovered inches from the meager bulge in the crotch of Brad's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had been hoping to catch Brad off guard and find any kind of opening but the giant simply laughed off the insult. \"What can I say, I'm not shower. I'm a grower.\" He flexed his quads and they swelled more than Jason thought possible. Each thigh bulged bigger around than his own chest and they began angrily pressing into each other as the muscles flexed. The girth of his thighs forced his shorts to slide up his legs bunching up just below the waist. Then Brad grunted and flexed even harder and to Jason's dismay his quads flared out even further, additional muscles extending to the sides like wings. The sheer mass was incredible and Jason guessed that just one of Brads legs weighed about the same as Jason's whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad released his flex and examined the weights that Jason had been lifting. \"Hmmm,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. \"440 is a pretty solid bench, nerd. I can remember struggling to push this much iron around. Well, you know, before this happened.\" Brad waved his hand over his chest and stomach. Then Brad grabbed the bar with one hand and curled it to his chest in a quick easy motion then continued to hammer out rep after rep. After about a dozen or so curls he shook his head. \"Yeah, I'm just not feeling it. What do you guys think?\" He casually tossed the bar 10 feet through the air to Jim who caught it one handed and copied Brads exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim wasn't as big as Brad but he handled the 440 pounds just as easily. \"Feels like a baby toy.\" He grabbed the bar with both hands and began slowly bending the steel until the ends were touching. He tossed the mangled weight back at Jason who had to roll away to keep from being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry clicked his tongue and frowned. \"Guys, I think we just have to accept that we've outgrown this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed. \"I think you're right, Terry. Do you boys think you could escort our friend outside with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could even react Terry and Jim had grabbed him and lifted him off the ground. Each man had one of Jason's feet and one hand and they carried him through the gym towards the locker room in the back. Jason fought as hard as he could but he could feel absolutely no give in their grip. What he did feel, however, was the burning sensation return to his muscles. He realized that this could be the perfect workout and perhaps his only way to escape. All night every time he had come up against a weight he couldn't lift his body responded by getting stronger, maybe if he fought hard enough he could gain the strength he needed. He tensed every muscle in his body all at once and pulled against Terry and Jim. The heat in his body became a raging fire burning like a star in his chest and radiating out to every fiber of his being.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason struggled against the iron like grip of Jim and Terry, it seemed like the harder he pulled against the more fiercely the fire inside him seemed to burn.  The two were carrying towards the locker room while Brad followed behind them, continuing to drone on about the horrible things he planned to do to Jason.  Truth be told, Jason had stopped paying attention to him as what was going on with his own body demanded his attention.  Jason suddenly felt as though the last few days of insane workouts had primed his body for this moment and despite the fact that he probably should have been terrified he instead felt euphoric.  It felt as though some massive power source was coursing through his body and his ability to fully tap into it was almost within his grasp.  Jason vaguely noticed that they were almost at the entrance to the locker room but he ignored the implications, focusing instead on resisting Jim and Terry in the most concentrated flex he could manage.  Brad said something else and his lackey's laughed but Jason couldn't understand them over the sound of his own blood pounding in his ears.  It felt like the tendons in his arms and shoulders were going to tear and his entire body ached with the exertion but he continued to redouble his efforts.  The edges of his vision began to blur and every sensation faded from his body except for the now painful ache in his muscles and the ever intensifying burning sensation in his body.  Jason grunted as the heat dramatically intensified and his tormentors finally seemed to notice something was happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" Terry suddenly let go of Jason's arm, \"what the hell, it feels like he's on fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stumbled as the tension on one arm was released but he quickly regained his feet and pulled against Jim's vice like grip with renewed determination.  Rips and pops sounded out as Jason's straining arm and shoulder muscle began to swell larger than his already tortured t-shirt could handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?  He's not supposed to be able to grow!\"  Jim sounded startled but still didn't release his grip on Jason's wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt like he was riding on the biggest adrenaline rush of his life, and he had a momentary flashback to his first fight with Brad.  \"I should have fucking killed you when I had the chance,\" Jason snarled at Brad as Brad reached for him.  Brad actually flinched back from Jason's obvious rage, then swaggered towards him again as Jim jerked Jason's arm hard enough to make his sneakers squeak across the tile floor of the locker room.  With what felt more like operating on pure instinct than rational thought Jason stopped trying to have a tug of war with Jim and instead stepped into the larger boy and grappled with him, lifting him bodily off the ground.  He grunted with the effort  as Jim wailed with surprise, then he hit Brad with Jim, swinging him overhead by the arm and bringing him down on Brad like a hammer.  Both cried out in pain as they collided with each other and Jason jerked Jim up by the arm again and roared as he repeated the hammer like body slam again, and then again.  Each time the almost herculean feat became easier and as Jason raised Jim over his head a fourth time his shirt finally fell away in an explosion of tatters from his muscles.  This time instead of bludgeoning Brad with Jim yet again Jason swung him wide like a baseball bat and swatted Terry off his feet, smashing him against the wall of the locker room.  Jason let go of Jim's ruined, twisted and obviously broken arm and turned back to Brad, savagely kicking him in the face as he tried to regain his feet.  Brad's head snapped back and Jason' grabbed him by the hair, yanking his head back and punching him hard in face, smashing his nose flat in an explosion of blood.  \"I would have just left you alone but you had to keep after me didn't you?  You fucking prick!\"  Jason screamed as he punched Brad again.  Brad shook his head, sending blood flying everywhere, and surged to his feet, catching Jason with a glancing blow to his own jaw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a step back and reassessed the situation, his head ached with the impact of Brad's fist and his gut told him that if it had connected more solidly Jason may have ended up with a broken jaw or worse from the impact.  As much as he hated to admit it Brad was still stronger than he was.  Jason had gotten lucky catching them by surprise but he wasn't sure if he could actually beat him, especially as he noticed Terry crawling out from under Jim, who appeared to passed out from the pain and shock of Jason's attack.  Brad grinned as though he could read Jason's thoughts.  \"That's right nerd, you're not making it out of here,' Brad sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt a new rush of rage overwhelm him.  \"Stop calling me that,\" Jason shouted as he turned to grab hold of one of the wooden benches bolted to the floor in front of a bank of lockers.  Jason tugged and with less effort than he would have expected it pulled free from the floor.  The rush of heat through his body intensified once again with the momentary resistance it offered and he swung the bench with all the strength in his entire body, catching Brad square across the face with the unexpected attack.  Brad flew back against the wall as the bench shattered with a deafening crack upon impact.  Jason easily sidestepped a punch from Terry and tore a locker from the wall with a shriek of metal and another rush of internal heat.  He brought the locker down over Terry's head and then kicked Terry squarely in the gut, pushing him backward where he fell over the immobile body of Jim.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad struggled back to his feet, blood dripping from his face as it streamed from his nose, his mouth and a deep gash on his forehead.  He spit a tooth out where it rattled across the floor and came to rest next to Jason's foot.  \"That's it Jason, no more teasing, no more screwing around.  Now I'm going to kill you.\"  Brad's voice was flat, cold and matter of fact.  It was completely absent of the mocking tone he usually had for Jason and it made Jason's blood run cold.  Terry struggled back to his feet again and took a place next to Brad where he only nodded silently in agreement. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To his dismay Terry and Jim didn't even notice the force Jason was attempting to apply and by the time they were exiting the rear of the gym into the back alley he was feeling drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was set down on his knees in a puddle. He assumed they did this on purpose since it was the only bit of water in the whole alley. For a brief moment Jason thought he saw some of the water evaporate when it touched his skin, but it was probably a trick of the mind. Jim or Terry, he couldn't see which, stood behind Jason with a hand on his shoulder keeping him in place. Brad stood in front of Jason and was joined by someone new. Jason's heart sank further when he quickly recognized the mysterious growing girl that had dangled the giant weight over his chest a few days earlier. Today she was clad in a grey hoodie and matching sweatpants. Both garments were vastly oversized and hung loose on her skinny frame. The hood was up and all Jason could see was her face which looked as pissed off as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some bad news and I've got some good news, nerd.\" Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the good news that you're going to stop calling me nerd?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad chuckled but continued his speech as if he'd prepared what he was going to say ahead of time. \"The bad news, <i>nerd</i>, is that we're not going to kill you. Not yet, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How terrible for you. You must be so disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Terry here was especially upset.\" Jason felt the hand on his shoulder tighten. Brad continued, \"But our\u2026 benefactor must have had a change of heart. I'm sure it won't be long before it changes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason raised his eyebrows, \"Benefactor, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, a smart guy like you probably figured out that there's someone out there that gave us these bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for sure. I was just surprised that a dumbass like you knew the word 'benefactor.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed at the insult. \"Which brings us to the good news. The guys and I have a new pal to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, another musclebound asshole? You know the fear factor wears off after the first three or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA calmness washed over Brad. He spoke slowly, \"Have you heard from Nikki today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's stomach dropped. \"You lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded to Jim who shoved a cell phone in Jason's face. On the screen was a picture of Brad with one of his giant arms around Nikki's waist holding her in a tight bear hug. His other arm was across her chest and his hand was squeezing her breast roughly through her shirt. Brad's tongue was extended and was just centimeters from Nikki's ear. She looked like she was screaming and struggling but Brad was just smiling and holding her in place. Then the cell phone was gone and Jason was left staring at Brads smug grin. \"Not feeling so smart now are you, nerd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's head was swimming. What was he going to do? What could he do? At the moment survival was the only thing that mattered. He could figure out a plan later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since you were so concerned about the size of my equipment earlier I think I'll show you what Nikki has in store for her if you don't get with the program.\" Brad slid his hands into his shorts and pulled out his penis. The tiny, soft dick looked even smaller in his big hands. But once he gave his tool a soft pump it instantly began filling with blood and fast. Inflating like a balloon his cock got longer and longer until it dwarfed his hands. By the time he was fully erect Brad's cock had become a monster standing 16 inches long and as thick as a beer can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" Brad said squeezing his cock and pointing it at Jason, \"I'm a grower. Do you think Nikki will like it? How much of this bad boy can I squeeze into her before she begs me to stop? Or what if she just keeps begging for more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't take anymore. He tried to get to his feet and charge Brad but he was driven back to the ground before he could even get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shook his head. \"Don't even think about it, nerd. You've seen what we can do, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw what you did to that truck the other day.\" Jason spat his words, his anger was practically uncontrollable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I had nothing to do with that.\" Brad said. \"That was all Brittany here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin girl smirked and stepped toward Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad got out of her way. \"I'm getting stronger and stronger everyday,\" he said, \"but I still don't think I could do what she did to that truck. And it was easy for her. She can get as big and strong as she wants and I'd bet that if she tried she could have put that truck into outer space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany shot a death stare at Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big man returned the look with a nervous chuckle. \"Sorry, Britt. What I meant was she definitely could have put it into space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany nodded slowly then turned her attention back to Jason. She shook out her arms and legs then sucked in a deep breath through her nose. With a grunt she tensed her body and curled her arms inward in front of her stomach. The loose sweats suddenly weren't so loose anymore. Jason couldn't make out the details of her form through her clothes but it was clear that her mass was incredible. A moment ago she probably weighed 100 pounds but now she had more than doubled that and she was already sucking in another breath ready to expand her body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she filled her clothes to the max and Jason got a perfect view of the physique beneath. She still wasn't up to Brad's size but she was easily bigger than any woman the world had ever seen. Brittany raised her arms into a big double bicep pose. The seems of her sleeves began to separate which only spurred her on. She turned to look at one of her arms and squeezed down even harder forcing both her biceps to grow larger. Her arms were already over 20 inches around but now they were adding additional inches by the second. The sweats peeled away from her arms leaving them bare and still she squeezed out more and more size. Her arms were well out of proportion for the rest of her body but she showed no sign of slowing down. The giant bicep pressed against her forearm forcing it to extend slightly but still it grew, the peak raising higher and higher until the top of the giant muscle was even with her clenched fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last she stopped and let out a soft moan as though her growth had somehow pleased her sexually. She let her arms drop to her sides, though they lost no size when relaxed. She approached Jason and pushed him so that he fell onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a little carried away there, Britt?\" Brad asked which elicited another death stare but this one had much less bite to it. \"Like I said, nerd, we're not going to kill you. But that's the bad news since you'll probably wish you were dead in a minute. Brittany here is going to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an evil sneer Brittany put her hands on Jason's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard that the femur is the strongest bone in the body.\" Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were a doctor,\" Jason said trying to ignore the pressure that Brittany's slender fingers were putting on his quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany squeezed and twisted and Jason felt the bone in his leg snap. White hot pain rocketed through his body and he let out a loud scream. He felt her hands now grasping his other thigh and he tried to beg her not to do it but words wouldn't escape his lips, only sobbing breaths and cries of pain. This time she slowed her movements down and began slowly applying more and more pressure forcing more screams from Jason's lungs. Finally his other femur snapped but Brittany didn't release the pressure. She just dug her fingers in more mashing his muscle fiber into mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was too much for Jason and the world began to go black. The last thing he saw was Terry's huge body standing over him with what looked like a piece of broken glass in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to he was in a hospital bed and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason opened his mouth to offer up an idea but he was hit with an image of Nikki and Brad locked in a kiss. His stomach turned and he looked away. His eyes fell on the giant weight that was used to nearly crush him. This was all too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Jason said turning back to face Nikki but not looking at her. \"I'm not feeling well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Nikki said. Jason didn't see her face but he could hear her frown. First the lie about the cut on his cheek and now he was ditching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I was feeling dizzy in the shower and I think I should go home and get some rest. Probably pushed myself too hard today, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jason knew she wasn't buying his story but at the moment he didn't care. He felt betrayed and disgusted. <i>Have you tried sucking the inside of her thighs yet? She really gets off on that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to draw this out any further Jason turned and walked out of the gym towards Nikki's convertible. Outside he saw the gym owner once more he was screaming into his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TOLD YOU ALREADY, I DON\u2019T KNOW!! JUST SEND SOMEONE, ANYONE!\" Jason looked beyond the big man and saw what must have been his truck, or what was left of it. The giant Chevy was now in two pieces stacked on top of each other. A nearby lamppost had been removed from its place at the side of the road and used as a skewer running through both chunks of vehicle. The gym owner continued to claim ignorance regarding how he had become the owner of a Chevy kebob to the police or his insurance agent or whoever he was  yelling at but Jason knew exactly what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder Brad and didn't mind slinking away, he still got his revenge. Jason wanted to throw up. As if he needed further proof of what had transpired he found a torn t-shirt a few dozen yards from Nikki's car and recognized it at the one the mysterious girl had been wearing. In his minds eye he saw her easily holding the 1000+ pound bar to her chest, her trim arms and chest swelling with muscle. The wild, terrifying look on her face as she gleefully tortured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason strode past the mayhem as well as the small crowd that was gathering and slunk into the passenger seat of Nikki's car. Nyah and Nikki joined him and Nikki sat looking at him for a long time as if there was some answer she could discern if she stared hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you guys think happened?\" Nyah asked from the backseat, her voice as soft and unsure as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki didn't break eye contact with Jason who still refused to look her way. \"I don't know. Do you know, Jason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio rode in silence. Jason made a mental wish that Nikki would drop him off first but he had no such luck. They dropped Nyah off who told Jason she hoped he felt better before exiting the car. Jason wanted to be impressed that her social skills were improving, albeit just a little, but he was too busy being miserable. When Nikki pulled up to his house Jason was out of the car and up his driveway before she had even made a full stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed the door to his room behind him and locked it before slumping down onto the floor where he began shaking uncontrollably. These maniacs were going to kill him. He'd been lucky so far and been able to surprise or outwit them but his luck would only last so long. Today he'd only survived through his tormentors desire to watch him squirm coupled with good timing on the part of the gym owner. There was no doubt in his mind, though, he was going to get very hurt and probably killed. He wasn't safe anywhere not when someone, probably Laura, had imbued them with super strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason calmed his nerves and stood. There was a small mirror above his dresser which he approached and admired his reflection. Impending karmic cataclysm aside he should feel pretty good, he was nearing 170 pounds of lean muscle and getting bigger every day. Already his overly skinny frame had taken on the look of a swimmer and he was stronger than he'd ever been in his life but it wasn't near enough. Would he even be strong enough once he reached his final weight of 370 pounds? Probably not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lay on his bed watching the shadows move across his room while the sun dipped low over the horizon. He did his best to shut his brain off and just sleep but anytime he would close his eyes he heard something that he interpreted as his impending doom and shot back awake. Eventually he stopped caring and welcomed Brad, Terry, Jim, or the mysterious, silent girl but even then sleep was elusive as now when he closed his eyes all he saw was Brad with his face buried between Nikki's creamy thighs sucking away while she thrashed about in ecstasy. She clawed at his scalp and wrapped her legs around his head and screamed out demanding more, more, more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was morning and Jason was feeling even more miserable after a night filled with fear, anger and not a bit of sleep. Nikki must have had trouble sleeping as well because shortly before 7 she sent Jason a text message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Feeling better?</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed. Clearly this wasn't just going to go away. He reluctantly responded:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">Not really.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Are you ready to tell me what's going on?</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">Did you fuck Brad?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't normally like to use the f-word when talking about sex but in this case he felt it got his level of vitriol across. He expected her to call him then so she could yell at him instead of simply texting but his phone didn't ring. In fact nothing happened for over a minute which he took as an answer to his question. Finally he received a response. One word, three letters, a \"y\" on the front end, a \"s\" on the back and a big ol' \"e\" in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded at his phone. Then he asked another question he shouldn't have to, but things being as they were he needed to know:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">Did I know that already?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time his phone did ring. He answered it and waited for Nikki to speak. It was obvious that she was crying. \"What kind of question is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason held his voice steady, though he felt it could crack at any moment. \"A strange one, I know. But an honest one. Is this something that I already knew? Have we talked about this before?\" <i>Thank you very much shifting realities</i>, Jason thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think you knew. We've never talked about it. I don't know if anyone else told you. It wasn't a secret but it was a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that things were out in the open Jason was actually feeling a little better about it. He was still a bit disgusted but not as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, what's really going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad, Terry and another one of Laura's pals, some girl, attacked me again yesterday. Also Brad said some\u2026 things about you that I didn't enjoy hearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Nikki paused for a while then responded with a surprising amount of anger. \"They can't keep doing this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we call the cops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason though of the mangled Chevy on the pike. \"No, I don\u2019t think it'll do any good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to make a call,\" he said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. Then, \"What about\u2026 you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason did know. \"Nikki, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have reacted like I did. I'm still very upset but I'll get over it. You and me, we're going to be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's voice was still sad but Jason could hear relief and hope in it as well. \"Okay, Jason. Call me when you're ready. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Nikki.\" He said and was happy to find that he meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ended the call with Nikki then dialed\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura was the last person in the world that Jason wanted to talk to. In fact he'd be perfectly fine with never speaking to her again as long as he lived which made him sad since Laura used to be his best friend. That he was the one to turn her into such a monster only added to his desire to never deal with her lest he be reminded of what his overzealous libido had done. However this was a call that had to take place. Things were getting dangerous and Laura was the only one in the world that could put a stop to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dialed and waited. His stomach twisted into a knot, tightening with each ring. Just when he feared his call was going to go to voicemail he heard Laura pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause in which Jason wondered if he should talk first. Finally she spoke, \"You've got a lot of nerve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, even her voice was sexy. Jason had really done a number on her. He knew he'd have to act quick before things got heated. \"Laura, listen I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! You listen! I don't know who the fuck you think you are! You are determined to ruin my life!! You ruin my party, put my boyfriend in the hospital, but his friends in the hospital, steal one of my best friends away from me, and now you have the balls to call me and expect to listen to what you have to say? FUCK YOU!!\" Clearly it was too late to avoid anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, you've got it so rough.</i> Jason had to concentrate to control his temper as well. He was just about to begin pleading his case when Laura interrupted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you even calling me? You want to gloat? Do you want to rub my face in the mess you've turned my life into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason waited. He wanted to make sure he wasn't going to be cut off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL?!?\" Laura demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a truce.\" He said as calmly as he could. \"We leave each other alone from here on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And everything you've done to me? I just let it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't believe how self centered Laura was. Did she really believe that she was the only one wronged here? \"Everything you've been though, everything I've been through, we call it a draw and leave it behind us. You never have to see or hear from me again and you call off your attack dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What attack dogs?\" Laura sounded hurt by the accusation which Jason found odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad and his pals. The only reason they ever got hurt in the first place was when they were attacking me. Self defense, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura scoffed at this but Jason didn't let it get to him. There was another demand he had to lay out and he already felt like he wasn't getting much traction in this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another thing,\" he continued, \"I would really appreciate it if you were to remove any crazy powers you've given them. Just to make sure they don't come after me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. Lots of it. Then: \"What are you talking about? Do you hear yourself? What powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know about the app on your phone, the one that can change people. I know you gave Brad, Terry, and Jim abilities with it. You even adjusted yourself and that girl I've seen you with, I don\u2019t know her name though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're insane.\" Laura said. \"I don't know why I'm surprised, after the way you acted at my party beating Brad unconscious and daring me to kill you it should be obvious that you're nuts. But a phone that gives people powers? Really Jason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been so sure that Laura had been the one making Brad and his cronies bigger and stronger but there was something in Laura's voice that told him she wasn't lying. She really didn't know about it. That wasn't possible, was it? Who else could have done it? Who else would want to hurt Jason? Suddenly an image appeared in his mind, his first memory of this twisted reality: him standing in Laura's house looking at photos of her prom dates through the years holding her phone, her old Nokia phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could he have forgotten? That was the crux of this whole mess in the first place, the center of the paradox he was trapped in. Of course she wasn't the one who had the app, if she did he wouldn't be in this fucked up world at all. Someone else was making his enemies grow bigger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Laura said, \"What do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackpedaling, Jason frantically thought through his options. If it wasn't Laura then he guessed it could have been any of her crew that had found the app and were using it to torture him. He would just have to figure out who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he said, \"it's not your phone doing it. But don't you think it's funny that Brad has gotten so much bigger these last few weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cackled. \"Now I get it. God, you're so pathetic. You think you're going to convince me that Brad is on steroids and that I should dump him, right? Is that your latest plan to fuck me over? Well guess what, I know he's on steroids. He told me all about it, showed me his stacking cycle. He's on more gear than I've even heard of before: test, anvar, HGH, masteron, you name it. And it's working. He's getting bigger every day and so much stronger it's crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, crazy alright,</i> Jason thought. <i>So Brad is lying to Laura about his growth, huh?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued, filled with righteous indignation. \"And before you ask, yes, he told me that Terry and Jim are on the same plan and yes I'm okay with all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Jason had to hope for a long shot on this one, \"well then how about that girl I've seen around with them? Have you noticed that she seems to be able to grow superhuman muscles out of nowhere then just shrink right back again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany? You've been reading too many comics, Jason. That girl is a weakling. She can hardly lift a sandwich to her mouth to eat and I've never seen an ounce of muscle on that twig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. Of course, if Brad was lying about the source of his muscle they wouldn't reveal Brittany's secret. Time for the last ditch effort. \"Look, Laura. You don't need to believe me about them, that's fine. Can you please just ask them to leave me alone? I'm tired of looking over my shoulder, worrying about them hurting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rich. You put them in the hospital, not the other way around. Now you're worried about getting hurt?\" Laura sighed. \"I don\u2019t even know why I'm still talking to you. Brad doesn't want to have anything to do with you, okay. You're just being paranoid. Goodbye, Jason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're lying to you, Laura!!\" Jason shouted but the line was dead. And that was just how Jason felt too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a full ten days before Jason even set foot outside of his house again. During that time hardly slept and he ate very little, instead he just spent his time sitting by the window waiting for Brad and his gang to arrive and rip him apart. When he did sleep he had dreams in which 20 foot tall musclebound bullies chased him and toyed with him. Sometimes he even dreamed of Laura, not the big and sexy one but the one from his reality. He always felt such relief when he saw her because he knew that meant that things were back to normal but before long she would groan and begin to burst out of her clothes turning into the busty amazon from this reality. Then she would toss him like a doll at the feet of his giant tormentors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five days of seclusion his mother began to worry and asked Jason to come down and spend more time with her and his sister. Jason acquiesced deciding that he was feeling pretty lonely and that he could cower with dread just as well surrounded by his family just as well as he could alone. So, while he still spent most of his time in his room he would come downstairs in the afternoons and sit in the living room with Jasmine while she watched TV. In this reality his twin sister was just as much of a jock as she was in his own and watched UFC and Sportscenter pretty exclusively which Jason didn't care for but he wasn't really paying much attention so it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day he came down he was actually pleasantly surprised when Jasmine payed him a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Looking buff, bro,\" she'd said as he entered the room wearing shorts and a tank top. It was true that Jason was looking stronger than ever, his body was now 25 pounds heavier and all of it was muscle. His achingly thin body now had the sleek form and hard definition of a runner with cut abs and clearly outlined pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you're doing keep it up,\" Jasmine told him. It was the first encouraging thing she had said to him in his entire life and while it felt good it was overshadowed by the threat of Brad and his pals who were much, much stronger than he would ever be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he remained locked away from the world Jason did stay in communication with a few people in the outside world, primarily through text messages. Colin was very distraught that Jason wasn't coming to any band practices. Jason promised that he was still practicing, though that was initially a lie. By the end of the first week, though, Jason actually did return to his bass which he found comforting. He could just lose himself in the rhythmic strumming and actually found himself experimenting more and more. He began trying whatever came into his mind and seeing how it sounded. Most of it was terrible but occasionally he would stumble across a lick that resonated and he would work on nailing it down over and over again. Once he felt good about what he'd created he would use his phone to record it and send the file to Colin who would send back words of encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason also kept in contact with Nikki, or rather she kept in contact with him. He was still feeling odd about her past with Brad but even more odd with how much it bothered him. He hated himself for being so freaked out by it but he couldn't help it. Every other day or so he would receive a text from Nikki just checking in with him. He would always respond and keep a brief back and forth going for a while. As days passed he found himself missing her more and more and in the end it was his desire to see Nikki again that got him beyond his fear and back into the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey agreed to meet on the beach near Tower 17 which was close to the pier. He hoped that after an initial chat they could head to one of the restaurants that lined the pier for an impromptu date. Tower 17 was also close to the outdoor gym where the biggest and strongest bodybuilders in town went to pump and flex their muscles for an adoring public. Jason had a hunch that at least one of Brad's crew would be there, though he wasn't sure where this feeling came from. Jason's best attempt at a plan was to begin gathering whatever reconnaissance he could on his would be attackers, but he had to do so in public places where they were much less likely to come after him. He figured they probably weren't too afraid of the repercussions of beating him to a pulp, but so far they had worked to keep their super strength a secret so Jason figured they would continue to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after noon Jason as approaching the agreed upon meeting spot. He saw Nikki standing in the shade of the lifeguard tower and his heart leapt into his throat. She wore a bikini with green and white stripes that accentuated her fair skin and red hair wonderfully. She she spotted him she dashed to meet him and jumped into his arms wrapping her perfect legs around his middle. Jason caught her, at first afraid that her momentum would bowl him over, he found that his new muscles weren't just for show. While he was nowhere near strong enough to make a truck-kabob he was happy to know that he could carry his girlfriend in his arms without much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason embraced Nikki tightly and gave her a long kiss. She pressed herself against him as tight as she could mashing her ample breasts against his hard chest and digging her fingers into his scalp. When their kiss was done she leaned back and smiled at him, it was as bright and wonderful as Jason remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened his mouth to return the sentiment but Nikki's eyes went wide and she gasped before he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness you're looking strong,\" she said running her hands over his pecs. He'd intentionally avoided wearing a shirt specifically to show off his torso, so he was glad she'd noticed. \"It looks like you've been working out nonstop since the last time I saw you.\" She crawled out of his arms and bent down to get a close look at his washboard stomach. \"So sexy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was glad that Nikki wasn't dwelling on the past and instead was just sliding right back into their old relationship. \"Thanks, I've been pumping a little iron here and there,\" he lied. He noticed that Nikki's body had changed a bit as well; she looked like she'd tightened her figure up a little. Her arms were slightly slimmer, specifically her triceps had lost the bit of fat that had hung from her arm. Her stomach, too, had lost the tiny pooch she used to have and it was now a flat surface perfect for painting a new set of abs upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking amazing too,\" he said. \"Very trim. Have you been in the gym a lot this past week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned red and looked down. \"Well, yeah,\" she said then quietly added, \"and I haven't been eating very much so I've dropped a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Jason was sorry that he'd mentioned her appearance and was even somewhat embarrassed that he was so turned on by the body she'd gained by starving herself over him. \"Well, let's fix that. How about some lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned. \"Sure, let's eat. I'm going to need some fuel if I'm going to start building up these muscles like I said I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked arm in arm to a diner that was perched atop the pier just above where the waves were crashing on the shore. Jason sat in a booth that overlooked the sand on the far side of the pier where he could see the raised platform of the gym with two dozen or so meatheads pumping and flexing for an audience that surrounded them on all sides. Jason ignored that scene for the moment, though, there'd be time for that later. He looked instead to Nikki who was sitting with her hands laid across the table. Jason placed his own hands in hers and returned her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for this past week,\" he told her. \"I just got so freaked by the realization that Brad is probably going to kill me when he gets the chance. I've been cowering in my room ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's expression turned to worry. \"You can't live like this. What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a thought about that. We need information about them and what they are capable of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean capable of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused. He knew that if he told her they Brad's gang had super strength she wouldn't believe him, this was actually a part of his plan to have someone neutral witness their enhanced abilities. \"Just trust me, we need info. That means someone to collect that info.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have someone in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Jason said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During his time alone Jason had lots of time to think. This was usually bad since his thoughts frequently returned to Brad and company and just how close he had come to being killed on more than once occasion. However, there were times that he was able to get his head together enough to focus on solutions. At first he saw no way out; Brad, Terry, Jim, and the girl Laura had identified as Brittany had superhuman strength and for all he knew could be getting stronger by the day. Once he was able to ignore the terror of his impending doom he realized that he didn't need to defeat any of them, not really. He had to find the source of their power: the person who had given them the strength to rip trucks in half and skewer them with telephone poles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he told Nikki that he wanted to find out what Brad's gang were capable of he was mostly lying. He knew very well what they could do. What he needed was information on how they did it. The bad news was that he couldn't just ask them since he'd never live long enough to do anything with the information. His was going to need a spy and Jason's list of allies was short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki seemed like the most obvious choice since she and Brad apparently had history. She could run back to him and say that Jason had broken her heart and earn their confidence that way. Jason actually spent a whole day of his solitude trying to convince himself that this would be the only way but in the end he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. After the things Brad had said and the torment Jason had put himself through he wanted to keep Nikki and her ex as far from each other as possible. Besides, they might just hurt her or hold her hostage to get Jason to come to them and that's something he could never allow to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis next thought was actually Nyah. She was obviously attractive and could likely seduce information out of Jim or Terry since neither was all that bright. They would probably sell their own mothers for a good look at her enormous breasts. Jason quickly dismissed this idea though for several reasons. First Nyah was far too shy and would never let them talk her into it in a million years. Secondly Jason feared what those brutes would do to her with raging libidos and the strength to take whatever they wanted from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he would have to be smarter. He needed to find someone no one would suspect; someone he shouldn't have any ties to whatsoever. Someone who could be places that Brad was without raising an eyebrow. Jason had practically given up when it hit him: Greg. The more he thought about it the more he liked the idea. Laura's bodybuilding brother was someone that Jason didn't really have ties to, though they'd been friendly in the past. He was the sort of person that could be around Laura and her boyfriend without people wondering why. Finally Jason realized that if Brad, Terry, or Jim were going to keep up their lie about juicing they'd have to spend some time in the gym, heck they'd probably go anyway just to show off how strong they were and intimidate everyone they could. Greg's lifestyle meant he would fit in perfectly at the gym. He didn't even need to hang out with them, just near enough to pick up some info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the idea struck Jason rushed to his computer to find what he could about Greg. He was very aware that history had changed and he hoped that Greg was still into bodybuilding and still nearby. A quick Google search brought a jackpot of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Jason sat back in his computer chair as the reality of what he had done with Laura's phone became even more evident. \"Whatever I did to Laura must have become a genetic mutation that she shared with her big brother.\" The first picture that had come up was of Greg standing on a stage in what was clearly a bodybuilding competition. He was flanked on both sides by the likes of Phil Heath, Dennis Wolf, Dexter Jackson and a dozen others that Jason had never heard of before. Greg dwarfed them all. The closest in height anyone else came was a full head shorter than Greg and no one could come close to his bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Jason had discovered that most of Greg's insane size was actually accredited to what was known as The Friedman Flex. Though he was clearly taller in this world, a full 7 inches taller, in fact, most of the time Greg was apparently no more muscular than any other heavyweight bodybuilder. He was actually only slightly larger than the Greg in Jason's reality. However, Greg could make his muscles swell by insane amounts just by flexing. Clearly the expansion ability Jason had bestowed upon Laura was shared among siblings (Jason had briefly wondered what Laura's sister Vanessa looked like in this reality but stopped himself from checking lest he get distracted). In fact, from what Jason had read it seemed that Greg's expansion ability was far more effective than Laura's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you just can't help but get overshadowed by your brother, even when things are stacked in your favor, eh Laura?\" Jason said. He eventually found a few videos on YouTube of Greg demonstrating his sinewy pliability. Jason watched as Greg flexed a bicep that some unseen pair of hands measured at 21 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, right?\" Greg asked in the video. \"Well watch this!\" He extended his arm and flexed again with a deep grunt. It was like a bomb went off inside his arm blowing it up to impossible girth. \"What's it say now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman's voice dripping with awe spoke, \"Uh\u2026 wow. Ok, looks like you're just a hair shy of 32 inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Greg sounded disappointed. He squeezed harder and roared louder. \"AAAAHHHHH!!! How about now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"32 and a quarter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, baby. Now we're talkin'!\" He turned his head and kissed the enormous peak just as the video ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the guy I need to help us.\" Jason had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> - - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg? Why do you want to talk to Greg?\" Nikki asked between bites. Their food had just arrived and she was stuffing her face with both hands. Jason guessed it was really true that she hadn't eaten much recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the only person I can think of that can get close to Brad and his douchey pals without them immediately assuming I sent him.\" Jason said. His attention kept getting pulled to the outdoor gym on the beach. A larger crowd was gathering around the raised stage and something about it made him worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at Nikki who was deep in thought. Finally she nodded. \"Okay, I'm in. I know where he likes to hang out and I still talk with his girlfriend from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I don\u2019t think you should get too involved in th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason,\" she cut him off. \"Greg hardly knows you. He and I get along a heck of a lot better. I could probably even get him and Sara to meet me for a few training sessions. Maybe I'll get some honest to goodness pointers in the meantime, huh?\" She smiled seductively and ran a food up Jason's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wanted to say something else in protest but Nikki was already lost in new thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki flexed her arm revealing a surprisingly plump little bicep. \"Can you imagine if I had a body like Sara?\" She shivered with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like this, it wasn't what I had planned. I wanted to keep you and Brad away from each other.\" Jason regretted the words the moment they were out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what this is about? You still think I've got a thing for Brad? Don't you trust that I love you? Do you think I'm just some horny bimbo that'll drop you the moment Brad asks me to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dropped his head. \"That's not what I meant. It's just\u2026 he's dangerous, Nikki. Him and his buddies. Brittany especially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany? A strong enough breeze could knock that girl over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason saw her in his mind with arms bulging as she easily lifted a thousand pounds, the insane, gleeful look in her eye as she moved to crush him beneath it. \"She's gotten tougher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sighed. \"Look, I appreciate that you're worried about me but I can't just sit here while they look for new ways to kill you. Besides, I'll have Greg with me for protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs big and strong as Greg was, Jason was sure it wouldn\u2019t be enough. But since he had no choice he gave in and agreed to do it Nikki's way. Meanwhile on the beach the crowd around the platform broke into loud applause. A loud speaker announcement echoed across the beach that someone had broken an all time lifting record. Jason had 3 guesses as to who it could have been.</span></div></div>",

He desperately missed his enormous muscles which would have given him more than enough strength to level these two jokers. Instead all he had was a glass bottle and a desire to live to see those giant muscles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he raised his drink to his lips one of the assholes lunged at him with knife extended. Jason was prepared for this and he sidestepped the blade easily. He adjusted his grip on the glass bottle and swung with all of his might aiming for Asshole No. 1's skull. He made perfect contact and the bottle shattered across the jock's head leaving a deep gash that instantly overflowed with blood. Asshole 1 fell to the ground so hard and fast that Jason wondered for a split second if he had killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason started to turn towards Asshole No. 2 when he realized that the broken pieces of glass in his hand were too small and useless as a weapon. He looked down to verify this and then realized his mistake. He saw Asshole 2's hand speed towards his side then make contact. The knife went in so fast Jason could hardly feel it. He even had enough time to convince himself that he wasn't going to scream which made him glad; he didn't want to give this bottom feeding shit stain the satisfaction. Then Asshole 2 turned the knife and white hot pain erupted through Jason's entire torso. He screamed out so loud he thought his vocal chords would rip apart. In the end, however, it was the scream that saved his life because several people in the buildings that lined the alley called the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took more punishment but he didn't feel it. Shortly after being stabbed he blacked out and fell to the ground. The next thing he saw as a television screen. It was mounted high on the far wall which instantly informed him that he was in the hospital. He didn't feel like moving and didn't for a very long time. He just stared at the screen watching some daytime talk show where vapid people discussed what kind of lettuce various celebrities preferred on their salads. Jason stared at the screen for a while without really watching and before he knew it he was watching some small claims courtroom show. For a long time he refused to move but then Jason realized that the channels were changing. Someone was channel surfing which meant he wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason flopped his head to the left and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there was any indication that Monica had been watching the television or changing the channels Jason couldn't find it. She sat in a chair facing Jason's hospital bed with her face buried in her phone. Upon seeing Jason move she glanced at him for a scone before her eyes returned to whatever she was doing. She wore denim pants rolled up to her shapely calves, a pink button up shirt and Converse low tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, you're awake.\" Monica said with a combination of sarcasm and disdain that could only come from a teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been here?\" Jason asked. His voice was weak, but he was relieved to find it wasn't painful to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long enough to get bored and sneak a peak at your big ol' cock.\" Monica leveled her eyes at Jason and shot him a devilish grin then slipped back into bored teenager mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part Jason was too exhausted to feel violated, but he reminded himself to be outraged later. \"Is that all you did?\" He laid back and stared at the ceiling. He'd never considered himself to be well endowed. He'd always assumed he was average, and since he was never confident enough to get with a girl much less get naked in front of one, he had never received the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say, it's really nice. I don't know what it is, but it really turns me on. I mean I've been with a guy twice your size but he was an Alterator, that's what we call ourselves, so it wasn't real. And it's not like there's anything I could do with something that size anyway. But yours is natural, you know, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Monica?\" Jason couldn't take any more of her rambling. \"Because if I have to sit here and listen to a 16 year old girl go on and on about my penis I may just jump out the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica was quiet. Jason was afraid he'd pushed her over the edge so he turned to face her again and looked her in the eye. \"Look, I'm sorry. I'm just in a lot of pain and I wasn't prepared to see you. Much less to learn you were.. you know.. looking at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica rolled her eyes. \"You are waaay to uptight about your body.\" Jason could see just a hint of a smile on the corners of her mouth that told him she forgave his outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of bodies,\" Jason said, \"you've made some more changes.\" He hadn't noticed at first, but when he focused more he could see the changes she'd made like double vision. Her lips were fuller and her neck a little longer and more slender. Her bust was slightly more rounded and fuller while her waist curved in slightly more. Every one of these changes was visible to him in both their new and old state like she was two people occupying the same space. No more was this more apparent than her knees. Instead of two it was as though she had four. One pair of knees was a good two inches offset from the other. It was clear that she'd made herself taller, but it looked as though it was only in her legs. He had to stop looking for changes and relax his eyes because he was getting dizzy seeing double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah! They've announced that unless the 'technical issues' they're experiencing are solved they're shutting down the servers is less than a week. I've had to speed things up a bit while still trying to be believable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how is growing...\" Jason paused and looked her up and down, \"what, four inches taller in a few days? How is that believable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm some amateur? I've been wearing lifts and high heels for months now.\" She held up the flat soled sneaker for Jason to see. \"If anything people will think that I've shrunk. Now I've got to find a way to squeeze another two inches in before next Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you got it rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica crossed her arms tightly across her chest. \"I'm not the moron who ruined the whole thing, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jason's turn to be silent, but he knew no apology would be forthcoming from Monica. Finally he decided he would have to speak first. \"If it makes you feel any better I got stabbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica broke eye contact and looked off into space to her right. \"Actually you were stabbed five times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Jason looked at his chest and stomach still covered by the sheets of the bed and realized that he really didn't want to see what was causing the constant dull throbbing down there. \"So, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was doing a little research on your problem. It may be possible to fix everything, but you have to tell me exactly how you got here. What did you do that caused your paradox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat for a moment in thought. He wasn't sure he could trust Monica, but he also felt as though she was hiding something. He was sure she had personal motives in wanting to repair things so she could continue using the app, but it felt like there was something bigger going on. Why would she go to the trouble of tracking him down after showing so much disdain for him the last time the met?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica was clearly getting impatient. \"Come on and spill it, your girlfriend has been coming by and checking on you everyday. She could be here any minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My girlfr-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The redhead with the nice legs,\" Monica said. Then she grinned and crossed her own insanely long pins, running her hands along her denim wrapped thighs. \"You know, relatively speaking. So spill it!\"</span></div></div>",

How can you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica sighed and stared at him, deciding, apparently, just how much she wanted to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for one thing, those of us who have real access to the ap are limited to a small community and the makers have already cut back on our options.  But if they are going to shut it down, some people are prepared to make some bigger changes, disregarding the written requirements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked confused.  \u201cSo?  While I understand your own desire to be a supermodel, do the makers of the ap have control over the users?  Can they cancel everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica let out a frustrated sniff.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know.  But if I can give them information about your paradox, then maybe everything will go back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica paused as she sized up Jason again.  \u201cAnd besides, who said anything about just being a supermodel.  I\u2019ve seen your friend Laura Friedman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted.  \u201cShe\u2019s not my friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica rolled her eyes.  \u201cSure she\u2019s not.  But tell me, if she\u2019s not an Alterator, how did she get to be so big and so hot?  I mean she\u2019s got sponsors lined up based on her incredible strength, muscles and beauty.  And the way her biceps grow when she flexes them\u2026.  It seems a bit unreal.  Was that her phone you used to change yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to maintain a blank expression and not give anything away.  Monica seemed to know more than she was letting on.  He knew clearly that it was when he changed Laura and hit historical that the paradox kicked into gear.  If he admitted it to Monica, what would she do?  What would the makers of the ap do?  If his profile were unlocked, could he become massive again?  The biggest problem was he didn\u2019t trust her.  He hoped Nikki would return soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura has just grown that way for all I know.  Maybe someone else tried to change me at the same time I was working myself and caused the paradox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica leaned forward; her sexy cleavage spilling ever so slightly forward against the shirt, stressing the buttons.  Her gaze became more focused, giving Jason an uneasy feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we can either do this the easy way or the hard way.  I know the person you wanted to be, the guy with the huge muscles.  And it\u2019s clear that you knew Laura Friedman.  I\u2019m thinking after you changed yourself you changed her to be your big beefy girlfriend.  Or was it the other way around?  Now why don\u2019t you just step me through it so the paradox can be fixed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s pulse raced and he now felt very uncomfortable and had a growing sense of fear.  He had to wonder just what this girl was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you know so much, why do you need me to admit to anything?  What difference could that make?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica leaned back slightly and seemed to be tensing her muscles as her expression remained hard.  Jason could have sworn her shirt looked tighter than it did just minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you had a special version of the ap.  There were rumors of ones with historical buttons, ones that could slip into a paradox with one simple change.  If someone used the button correctly nobody would ever know things changed.  Paradoxes can still occur if a person makes dramatic, instantaneous changes, but it\u2019s harder.  So Jason, which one was it?  What did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was starting to feel a bit queasy.  Maybe it was the drugs.  Being stabbed multiple times certainly could be a factor.  But the probing questions from Monica were definitely contributing.  He wanted her to leave.  Hell, he wanted to leave.  He glanced around for a button to summon a nurse saw it hanging between him and Monica.  Monica saw him glancing up at it and quickly reached forward and pulled it toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to hide this.  I would assume you want the paradox fixed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica stood up and stepped toward the bed until her firm, silky thighs were touching the bed.  She kept her eyes on Jason as her gorgeous face lit up with a soft smile and her eyes sparkled with mesmerizing blue tones.  Monica slowly pulled her right arm up and tugged the sleeve up to her shapely shoulder with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m also quite sure that you find female muscles alluring.  At least that\u2019s what Laura seems to think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nearly choked.  \u201cYou, you spoke to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica simply held her smile as she brought her right arm into a classic bicep flex with her forearm at 45 degrees and her lower arm parallel with the ground.  She tensed her fist and Jason\u2019s eyes widened as he saw her firm, yet thin arm start to bulge with expanding muscles as her bicep balled up and pressed outward across her arm and upward as her peak arced.  Within moments Monica was flexing up a bicep that had to be 16 inches around, looking completely out of place, yet perfectly suited for her frame.  Jason gulped as his face flushed and despite the pain medication, caused his member to twitch and slightly tent the sheets.  Monica licked her lips, glanced at the motion of his sheets and giggled gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell what you like.  I also can tell you that despite your claims of self defense that you may not remain a free man.  Despite the resources of your girlfriend I\u2019m the only one you know who can fix things.  But unless you start talking, I can be the one to make things worse.  You think you were pretty tough beating up that big bodybuilder and standing up to two men with knives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica pumped her right arm a few times, causing the bicep to jump and solidify larger, harder and with scary definition.  With her left hand she gripped the side rail of his bed and squeezed down hard, noisily crunching the metal.  She released her flex and her grip and looked down at the metal rail.  Jason did the same as his jaw dropped open.  The outlines of her fingers were clearly seen on the hard metal from where she had compressed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had quite a while to play with the ap Jason.  I know what I want and how to hide things from most people.  I\u2019m also willing to do about anything to get what I want.  Don\u2019t make me do things to you that you won\u2019t like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Monica straightened her right sleeve, the door to the room opened, and Jason sighed with relief.  Jason and Monica looked over toward the door and saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

Laura had blossomed into probably the sexiest woman who had ever lived which apparently had caused her to stop being friends with him.  Probably because their lives diverged drastically with her new body and popularity.  He rubbed angrily at his lips where he could still feel the \"I'm glad we stayed friends\" kiss she had given him right before he gave her her new body.  Apparently if he wasn't there to talk her into getting an iPhone then she never got one... \"She never installed the app... so I never changed myself or her... but the historical change means that she changed regardless?  Fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was starting to understand the \"paradox\" warning.  As though on cue his iPhone buzzed in his pocket and it brought up his email when he unlocked it.  \"Apps you may be interested in\" The sender field was empty.  The email itself contained only a short message and a link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a problem you need fixed?  We have an app for that.  'Alterations.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS.

He was shocked at how quickly it installed, given how much it was capable of he had assumed it would be an extraordinary size.  A small box appeared on the screen when he started the app.  Below it were the words \"PRESS THUMB TO BOX.\"  Again without hesitation Jason pressed his thumb to the box until a new message appeared.  \"THANK YOU, JASON.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered involuntarily. If he wasn't desperate to try to repair what he had inadvertently destroyed this app would creep him out.  He shook off the vague unease and quickly brought up his profile.  He was shocked to see that his profile still showed him as the muscle-bound behemoth he had turned himself into.  He felt increasing frustration when a pop up warning appeared when he tried to move the muscle slider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***This profile is currently read only.  This profile cannot be modified due to an unresolved paradox***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" Jason fumed as he backed out of his profile and searched for Lauras.  \"C'mon, c'mon...\"  Laura's incredible new body appeared on the screen and he flicked his thumb across the breast slider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:\"FUCK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***This profile is currently read only.  This profile cannot be modified due to an unresolved paradox***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is your problem nerd?\"  Jason spun around to see Brad Taylor, the star quarterback for the High School foot ball team who had graduated a couple years ago.  He had been in one of Lauras prom photos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Nothing, I was just leaving,\u201d Jason muttered as he moved past Brad, realizing that he was still standing on Laura\u2019s front porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I don\u2019t want to have to kick your ass again punk.  Leave Laura alone.\u201d  Brad turned his back on Jason and swaggered up to the door where he let himself with his own key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glanced down at Lauras profile.  In the \u201cRelationships\u201d list was a LOT of guys, most were listed as \u201ccasual sex,\u201d even a couple of the girls Laura apparently hung out with now fell into this category.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason walked slowly back to his house, brooding on what his next step would have to be.  If directly modifying himself or Laura wasn't an option then he wasn't sure what he was going to have to do.  He'd have to gather info on Laura, spy on her, figure out who her close friends now were and how he might be able to leverage that to fix his problem.  He cringed inwardly, remembering Laura's accusation that in this reality he was a stalker.  By the time he reached his room he had grudgingly accepted that becoming a stalker may be one of his only options to get the information he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted with surprise and frustration when his bedroom door resisted his efforts to open it.  \"Locked?  Why they hell would I lock my room when I'm not home?\"  He dug through his pockets and pulled out his key ring.  Same Batman logo key ring (The iconic 70s style yellow oval with Black bat) same house key, the spare key to his moms car that she never let him drive, what were these other keys?  Jason usually only had one other key on his key ring, the key to the lock his desk drawer.  There were a handful of other keys he didn't recognize and he tried these in his door until one managed to unlock it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt like he was stepping into an episode of the Twilight zone.  \"God damn.... I AM a stalker,\" he breathed as he quietly closed and locked the door behind him.  His walls were covered with pictures of Laura.  Some were cut out of magazines or newspaper, most were photos that had been printed on computer paper.  A breathtaking shot of a topless Laura framed by a willow tree by a small pond was over his bed.  This picture of Laura had been blown up to poster size and was on glossy paper.  She was looking off in the distance, her face turned mostly away from the camera with one arm crossed over her breasts, the other pointing at something out of frame.  Despite her face being in profile her body was facing the camera and she was standing relaxed, a tight pair of jeans unbuttoned and pulled open to reveal a hint of lace panties underneath.  One of her nipples was partially visible despite her token effort at modesty.  Jason strongly suspected he had taken the photo and that Laura wasn't aware he had taken it.  He felt like an awkward voyeur and shifted uncomfortably.  He was even more uncomfortable when he noticed a bottle of lotion and box of tissues sitting on the headboard under the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason cleared his throat and turned away from the poster, pointedly ignoring his stiff member.  He did a double take when he realized what he was looking at now.  There was a large corkboard that now took up almost the entire wall above his desk.  A picture of Laura dominated the center of the board and around it were pictures of who Jason assumed her friends and family were.   Hand drawn arrows swirled around them, all eventually connecting back to Laura.  Post it notes clung to many of the pictures and some had notes scribbled directly on them.  The question to where the extra keys came from was answered when Jason saw that every drawer on his desk had a padlock affixed to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I hiding from the world?\u201d He muttered as he unlocked the drawers.  Each drawer was stuffed full of spiral notebooks and Jason groaned as he flipped through them.  \u201cIsn\u2019t it bad enough that I\u2019m a stalker without being a crazed journal writer on top of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused to read an entry about Laura and her sister going shopping, then another, and another.  \u201cHuh, Laura and her sister were never this close in my reality.\u201d  Another entry talked about Laura and her \u201cbest friend\u201d Nikki.  \u201cWho the fuck is Nikki?\u201d  Jason glanced up at the corkboard and quickly found Nikki, a cute girl with a big smile, curly going on frizzy red hair and a light dash of freckles across her nose.  A great many of the arrows led back to Nikki before connecting to Laura.  \u201cRight, hi Nikki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason slapped closed the notebook he had been reading and lay back on his bed.  He was startled but not entirely surprised that another poster quality shot of Laura was staring down at him, this one was probably taken with her swimming in the same pond that was in the other poster.  She was standing in water up to her bust with her enormous breasts cradled in both arms, creating mind boggling cleavage almost up to her chin.  Her smile was stunning and droplets of water sparkled around her head.  \u201cThis is making it REALLY difficult to concentrate.\u201d  Jason sighed and reached for the bottle of lotion.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Jason was done admiring \"Ceiling Laura\" he returned to the trove of research his stalker self had compiled.  Jason quickly discounted using Lauras friends to get to her, if the paradox WAS resolved and she went back to having few (almost no) friends it might create another paradox right?  So that meant focusing on her family.  But what was he really trying to accomplish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a few minutes away from reading to try sketching out the paradox as he understood it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura and I used to be best friends,\" Jason started by drawing a straight line from the word \"Friends.\"  \"This went on for literally years until she downloaded this app on her iPhone.\"  He placed a question mark on the line and labeled it \"App.\"  After thinking he went back and marked \"iPhone\" on the line as well, between \"friends\" and \"app.\"  He frowned.  \"I don't know if she ever used the app before I found her phone.\"  He thought about the scrawny frame and abysmal body image he could remember Laura having before he found the phone.  \"Probably not,\" he decided.  But he put another question mark next to \"App,\" this one he labeled \"Lauras uses app?\"  He tapped the notepad with his pencil and leaned his head back to think then scowled when he realized he was staring at \"Ceiling Laura\" again.  \"You're not helping,\" he growled, returning to his sketch.  \"What about Greg or Vanessa?\"  Jason stacked two more question marks over Lauras and added \"Greg or Vanessa use app?\"  Greg and Vanessa were nigh legendary pinnacles of development, it seemed much more likely that one or both of them got their hands on Lauras phone and App before Jason did.  But if so there was no way of knowing.  He racked his brain, struggling to think of any way he could know for sure if they had.  Finally he pulled up the app on his own phone and opened Vanessa\u2019s profile.  He momentarily pondered the irony that Vanessa, who he had lusted after for her raw sex appeal as far back as he could remember now did almost nothing for him.  He studied her profile in detail, trying to figure out if there was a way to tell if she had been previously modified.  Not seeing anything overt he swapped over to his own profile and studied it.  \u201cAha,\u201d he muttered, noting a tiny notation next to his name.  \u201cRevision 1.\u201d  He went back to Vanessa, then to Greg.  \u201cRevision zero.  Damn, you two really did win the genetic lottery didn\u2019t you?\u201d  Going back to Laura he verified she was also at Revision 1.  \u201cSo if she did use it before I did it wasn\u2019t on herself.  Interesting.\u201d  Jason put a notation under the stack of question marks.  \u201cNot on selves.\u201d  \u201cAnd here\u2019s where it gets crazy,\u201d  Jason drew a loop back over the timeline and labeled it \u201cI use the app.\u201d  \u201cBut I didn\u2019t wreck anything until\u2026\u201d Jason added another loop that diverged completely from the timeline that he labeled \u201cI use the app on Laura.\u201d  So if I get her past to change so that she buys an iPhone instead of sticking with her ancient Nokia it fixes everything right?  He drew \u201ciPhone\u201d on the new timeline then linked the two lines together with a question mark.  \u201cThis is giving me a headache,\u201d Jason tore the timeline sheet out of the notebook and put it over the picture of Laura that was in the center of the corkboard.  \u201cBut I think I got it.  I need to somehow alter someone in Laurra\u2019s family in a historical way such that it would cause her to buy an iPhone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pored through more entries detailing shopping trips with Vanessa and eventually work out trips to the gym with Greg.  He looked around at the pictures of Laura, noting again the muscularity he had given her on top of the generous bust line.  It made sense she would get training tips from her brother.  \u201cMaybe I\u2019m being selfish here,\u201d Jason said out loud, addressing \u201cCeiling Laura\u201d.  \u201cI mean look at you, you\u2019re gorgeous, your relationship with your brother and sister is better than it ever was in the other world.  You have a lot of friends... and fuckbuddies...  Maybe I shouldn\u2019t mess with it.  I mean I can take this App and make any woman just as hot as you or even hotter (even as he said it he doubted it was possible) and hell, I can even make her madly in love with me.  Jason closed his eyes and massaged his temples, trying to wish away the stress headache he was getting.  \u201cI just don\u2019t know,\u201d he said finally.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jason wasn't surprised to find that each drawer only actually had a handful of notebooks.  The initial impression of the drawers being stuffed full was simply due to the fact that under each stack of notebooks were all sorts of fun tools and gadgets.  Cameras,(some of which had thermal imaging and night vision capabilities) microphones, it was mind blowing.  As Jason marveled at how much this must have cost him he came to realize he didn't see any of his movie collection.  Or action figures.  Or comics...  He spent a few minutes frantically digging through his closet and under his bed and came to the realization that he had not apparently bought a comic book since his freshman year of high school and that he had likely sold of large portions of his collection to finance his obsession.  \"You have to be kidding me,\" he groaned before returning to reviewing notebooks and the information he could glean from the App.  Even if he couldn't modify Laura the info in her profile was useful though apparently he had already figured out most of it on hs own anyway.  Vanessa and Greg's profiles also were interesting to review.  Like Laura, Vanessa had a lot of friends and she appeared to be sexually active with many of them (though she didn't appear to be bi-curious like Laura apparently had become.) though none of them had any sort of deep connection.  Greg surprisingly had not been as active.  He was ranked nearly to fianc\u00e9 with a girl named Sara Auster.  Jason could remember seeing her around, she was a cute gym bunny type but not as busty as he preferred.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearest Jason could theorize Laura had identified closer with her sister when she began \"developing\" as compared to \u201creal Laura\u201d who really didn\u2019t have much in common with her.  And Vanessa was very much a girly girl.  This would explain how Vanessa\u2019s increased influence in her life caused Lauras shift from her geeky side.  Laura appeared to get closer to Greg when her interest in bodybuilding developed but that seemed to have happened later.  Jason had already convinced himself that the key to solving his problem lie with altering Greg or Vanessa or both, the question was which one should he start with and what should he do?</span></div></div>",

Then she would relate to Laura better I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused.  But that wouldn\u2019t affect Laura\u2019s body change would it?  Perhaps then Laura would relate even closer to Greg.  So what if Vanessa were more of an influence with her body?  That would be enough to pull her away from Greg and not so much into the man lust.  He paused again; concerned that anything he did to Vanessa would lock him out from Vanessa if the paradox remained in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he decided to adjust Vanessa anyway.  Perhaps making Vanessa as big, or better yet, more muscular than Laura.  That way hopefully Vanessa would outshine Laura again and push Laura back to her old ways and get her iPhone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled up Vanessa and her beautiful; 5 foot 10 inch body glowed in front of him.  Focusing on his task, Jason flipped over to the muscle mass tab that he was painfully aware of and began increasing her physique. He started to push her musculature, watching her weight increase from 145 pounds to 180 and then up to 210, then finally up to 230. The model version of Vanessa had gained massive muscles across her frame, pushing her breasts out away due to her expanding pectorals but still retained incredible feminine curves. Her outfit changed to a tight athletic top that clung like a second skin to her muscular torso and a pair of tight athletic shorts hugged her thick thighs. Those thighs bulled their way forward with full quads and large, tight calves. Remembering what he had done to Laura, Jason zoomed in on Vanessa\u2019s arms and began to add more mass to them separately from the rest of her body. He increased their size by another 10 inches making them almost ridiculously disproportionately large, forcing them to stand out from the rest of her body. She had the size and shape of what had to be the most massive female bodybuilder ever, while her arms were now larger than any man. Jason then adjusted Vanessa's muscle density. As before, as he moved the slider her appearance didn't change at all, increase strength without increasing size. He pushed the slider up to 60%, making Vanessa far stronger than anyone else her size, with the thought of ensuring she was much stronger than Greg. Then he moved to the menu called \"expansion ability\u201d as before. When he tapped it a drop down asked for specific triggers. Jason selected \"flex\" and was then prompted to dial in her expansion factor. This he set to 60%, once again ensure Vanessa\u2019s superiority to both Greg and Laura.  Jason blinked as he thought about Vanessa flexing up her biceps.  With arms that had to be around 30 inches, she could flex them to nearly 50!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made sure the changes were set to historical then clicked \"Apply Changes.\"  He stared nervously at the still glowing oversized Vanessa closed his eyes hopefully and pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt dizzy and fell back onto the bed.  He slowly relaxed; keeping his eyes closed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was waked by the sound of his phone buzzing with the theme from TV show \u201cBatman\u201d.  He reached over in a haze and picked it up.  It was Laura!  He cleared his throat, hopeful that everything was back to normal, or at least the paradox was corrected and he could work on Laura and himself.  Laura spoke with a friendly tone, which was a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, are you coming over or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped.  That must mean they were friends again!  He paused as his pulse raced.  \u201cUh, sure.  Just give me a minute to get ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled.  \u201cStill in bed huh?  Well hurry up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hit the end call button and bit his lower lip.  Was the paradox fixed?  He pulled up the ap and quickly found that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing he did was look up to see if Ceiling Laura was still there.  A large print of Laura was there alright, only the pose was quite different.  She was looking at the camera and Jason deduced she knew he was taking the picture.  Laura was flexing up a killer double bicep pose in a tight white bikini.  Her biceps were flexed up into twin female mountains kicked up with her 30% bonus and looked to be 26 inches around!  His member grew stiff as he stared.  The picture was of her upper body and his eyes shifted over to her massive, barely covered chest that appeared to be sticking straight ahead as the tit flesh spilled out away from the undersized top.  The smile was angelic across her beautiful face.  He gulped as he forced himself to turn away and look around his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crazy pictures were down except for a small cork board.  He walked up to it and saw another picture of Laura in the center, and to the side a picture of Laura and Vanessa each flexing up a bicep.  He gasped as he looked at Vanessa\u2019s arm.  To call it huge did not do it justice.  He moved closer and stared with awe at the sheer volume of muscle Vanessa was flexing forth.  He gulped at the fact that it looked nearly TWICE as big as Laura\u2019s.  And it looked like a drawing or possibly a tattoo of a mushroom cloud was on Vanessa\u2019s bicep, which caused Jason\u2019s breath to shorten and his member press out harshly.  The other pictures were mainly of Laura and a question mark was next to a picture of him.  Was he still out of place in this reality?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing himself away from the photos, he looked around and spotted several Batman posters on the wall and a pile of comic books and Amine movies on his desk.  He nodded with some feeling of satisfaction.  At least things appeared better than before.  No locked drawers, no fanatic wonderings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping into the shower he got ready as quickly as he could and jumped into his car to head toward Laura\u2019s house.  He pulled into the driveway and walked nervously up toward the front door.  The same door that just last night almost got his ass kicked by some jock that Laura was \u201cdating\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit the doorbell and absently scratched his Batman shirt in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and there standing in the doorway was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura stood at the door with a sweet looking face, long brown hair, and a solid physique tightly wrapped around a Captain America t-shirt and jeans.  Her chest was large and muscular, pressing the shirt out dramatically, but the boobs he had programmed appeared to be gone.  Well, not gone, but reduced.  He thought back to the pictures in the room, was her chest this size now different?  A quick sharp migraine like pain hit his head and quickly went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a quick sigh and smiled as collected his thoughts to again to remember that she was still a 5 foot 11 beauty with big, bulging muscles and had been for a while.  But even with the beauty and brawn on her side, she didn\u2019t look as confident as when they last met.  In fact she almost looked nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jason, are you ready to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused.  It certainly seemed as though she wanted to get out of the house.  Jason, however, wanted to get a quick look at his handy work with Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure, but do you mind if I use the bathroom first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shot him a nearly frightened look.  \u201cAre you sure it can\u2019t wait.  I want to get out before\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA commanding, super sexy voice echoed from upstairs.  \u201cLaura, where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave her a curious glance.  That didn\u2019t sound like her mother.  It sounded like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s shoulders slumped and she whispered.  \u201cSo close.\u201d  She sighed and turned to look back into the house.  \u201cJust heading out to the comic shop with Jason, Vanessa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then heard faint footsteps approach and he soon saw the drop dead gorgeous face of Vanessa over Laura\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell invite him in for a moment.  Maybe he would like to join me down at the beach for the video shoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn\u2019t always someone to take clues, but it was very apparent that Laura wanted nothing to do with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uh, sorry Vanessa, but Laura and I have plans.  I\u2019m sure we can make the next one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was now at the door and Laura moved out of the way so Jason could take her all in.  His eyes widened as he got a look at the muscle goddess before him.  Vanessa had on a barely legal string bikini and a body that looked ready to win a beauty contest, a Mr. Olympia and weight lifting event all at the same time.  Standing behind her was Greg, looking meek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nonsense.  The shoot isn\u2019t until this afternoon.  You can run your errands and get back in time.  I\u2019ll be breaking some of my lifting records and should be ready to break some records in the measurement department.  Would you like a sneak peak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to control himself he was now beginning to sense that Vanessa didn\u2019t take no for an answer.  And that she used her incredible strength, dominating personality and muscle size to control her family and likely anyone else she encountered.  She was being nice to him, but then again, he hadn\u2019t done anything yet to really upset her.  And he already knew that he and Laura would be at the shoot or there would be consequences for Laura, and maybe him as well.  Just what had he done?  Smiling carefully, he took a step into the house and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, that would be cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa snickered.  \u201cCool?  I love your nerdiness Jason.  Now let\u2019s see what these guns are up to, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura closed the door behind Jason, she stayed put as Vanessa\u2019s raw energy pulled Jason in a bit further.  Vanessa shook her thick blonde hair, flipping the long strands over her broad shoulders and cocking one hip out to the side.  She planted her manicured right foot forward and gently flexed her thighs, ballooning up her quads to large, angry masses of she-beef, big enough and detailed enough to challenge most male bodybuilders and likely win.  Vanessa pulled in her tight abs and the deeply cut 8 pack abdominals of a goddess shined as though they were covered in a light application of posing oil.  She jutted her chest in and out a few times, pressing forth large, menacing pectorals and causing her mouth watering breasts to sway slightly and then snap to attention as though they too dared not disobey their master.  Vanessa licked her sensuous lips and wiggled her fingers out at the end of her outstretched arm.  Massive, hamhock triceps curved dangerously low and incredibly, seemingly impossibly, her outstretched biceps expanded up a good nine inches above the plane of her arm, pushing up over the top of her thick, striated shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was now staring at her arm in anticipation.  Vanessa\u2019s body clearly matched the program he had set, looking even better than he had imagined or what he saw on the pictures in his room.  Now up close she appeared even bigger, better balanced and with harder muscles.  As he began to imagine her flexed bicep he thought about how big those muscles were, and for a moment, he even thought about what they would look like even bigger.  A soft glow appeared around her arm and Jason\u2019s vision blurred for a moment, momentarily disorienting him.  Unsure of what to make of that, Vanessa looked at arm that appeared somehow even\u2026.bigger?  Just like he had been thinking?  Jason shook off the feeling as Vanessa looked at her massive arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working out extra hard recently, making sure there is no doubt who the strongest person on earth is.  And I\u2019ve loved working my arms the most.  They are my pride and joy, the muscles that pay the bills.  And they\u2019ve been growing Jason.  Oh, how they\u2019ve been growing.  Let\u2019s start with a simple flex first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa slowly pulled her hand into a fist and pulled her forearm up, Greg quickly came up from behind her with a tape-measure and as if he\u2019d done this many times, quickly wrapped the tape around her arm perfectly to measure her muscles at the peak.  Jason moved a bit closer to look at the numbers as Vanessa purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm.  So strong, so big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s forearm reached a bit beyond vertical and Vanessa\u2019s incredible bicep consolidated into a hard mound of muscle bigger than anything Jason had ever seen.  The tape pulled tight and measured 32 inches around.  Jason\u2019s breath quickened and he looked on with curiosity.  He had programmed her bicep to be 30 inches around without he expansion ability.  Was she already utilizing her expansion to gain a few inches?  Or had his short blurred episode really changed the programming?  He tried hard to focus, staring at her rippling, massive muscle as though he were studying a map.  Vanessa smiled at Jason\u2019s wide eyed stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger than ever, hmmmm.  Well let\u2019s see what happens when I flex a little harder\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason knew what was coming next but the sight still caused his mouth to open as Vanessa\u2019s bicep expanded in every direction like a strange 3-D movie.  Detailed muscle fibers multiplied and the tape moved quickly, passing 40 inches in moments, on to 50 inches and then with one last tense, bulged up to 54 inches of raw power as her bicep peak pulsed up to near the top of her fist!  Jason gulped again.  He had programmed the expansion to be near 50 inches and she was flexing up a muscle much bigger.  Jason shook his head, for fear of causing even more changes.  Vanessa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at that!  A new record.  How do I do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shot a glance over her shoulder and Greg removed the tape and Vanessa released her flex.  Her sexy posturing quickly changed to a more thoughtful, business like stare.  One that indicated she was clearly in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg needs to start setting things up down at the beach and I have some business calls to make.  I WILL see you two before the event.  Don\u2019t be late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could only nod and Laura let out a weak \u201cYes Vanessa\u201d as Vanessa turned and Greg gave them both a pained look before following Vanessa out the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stared for a moment at Vanessa\u2019s sexy, muscular backside and let out another breath before turning back to Laura and her defeated, slumped shoulders.  He gave her a soft smile and walked toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Laura, I didn\u2019t mean to feed her ego.  But she\u2019s like an enchantress or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura opened up the door and nodded.  \u201cYeah, or something all right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked toward his car, Jason began to wonder.  What had just happened with the migraine and the blurred vision?  Was this warped reality really that unstable?  Could he really affect things?  As they climbed in the car, Jason wondered if he could test that on Laura.  After all, he had caused this and his plot to make Laura his friend again had resulted in her being miserable.  Knowing he needed to mine Laura for information, he looked over at her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, Laura, let\u2019s head to the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason glanced over at Laura, who looked relieved to be away from the clutches of her big sister.  At least for a few hours anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know she wants me there just so she can be compared herself to her little sister and maintain her dominance.  She\u2019ll have several large men there as well.  At least she hasn\u2019t made me her personal assistant like Greg.  I really feel sorry for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  He really had messed things up.  But maybe he could fix them.  He at least wanted to try his theory out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we head to a gym instead of the comic book shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slowly turned toward Jason with a curious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gym?  Why would you want to go to the gym now?  I\u2019d rather lose myself in the comic books for a while before the afternoon show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason bit his lip.  \u201cI have a, uh, theory I\u2019d like to try out.  Can you indulge me for a short time?  I promise if nothing happens then we can leave right away and head to the comic book store.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled.  \u201cWell aren\u2019t we mysterious today.  OK, take the next left up ahead.  We can head to my sister\u2019s gym.  It will be closed today, so we can have it all to ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a sigh of relief.  He was happy he got Laura to chuckle.  For the first time since he started messing with things, she reacted like the old Laura.  Jason bit his lip, wanting to know more about this reality without asking something he should already know.  Sighing and figuring there wasn\u2019t really much harm, he glanced over at Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how have things been with Vanessa recently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \u201cWell, you know, more of the same I guess.  Every since she turned 17 and started working out with Greg she\u2019s continued to grow stronger.  Funny how Greg was condescending toward her back then, making fun of her little fitness muscles and girlish strength.  Boy does he regret that now.  It was pretty incredible back then to watch her grow stronger and see her confidence grow as well.  I still remember the day Vanessa invited me out to the gym to watch her out lift Greg.  And that was the day she showed everyone how she could flex up her muscles with her expansion ability.  Her arms were huge even back then.  I remember being so proud of her, even if she did give Greg a hard time.  If we only knew what was coming\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused as turned to look out the window.  Jason was about to say something when Laura continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all knew Vanessa was very pretty, but it was as if lifting weights and growing more muscular only made her more beautiful.  And while her grades in high school were OK, during her physical transformation she turned into a genius.  She started marketing herself and was soon running fashion, work-out equipment and other on line businesses.  The more Vanessa put everything together with her beauty, body and intelligence, the more arrogant she became at home.  Soon we were all working for her, our parents, me, and especially Greg.  She never forgave him for his earlier actions and after breaking his records, his ego and several bones, he\u2019s given in and is now practically her slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked ahead to point to Jason where to turn before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I thought she would have been excited for me when I started to show the same abilities at 17, just like her.  But she saw me as a threat I guess.  When my breasts grew larger than hers, she had me get them reduced.  When my hair lightened to a golden color, she made me color it back to brown.  I grew prettier and smarter as I grew stronger, but not quite in her league.  And unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem that I will ever to get to her strength or expansion abilities, not that I haven\u2019t tried.  My expansion ability seems pretty fixed, which keeps it well below Vanessa\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they pulled into the empty parking lot, they got out of the car and headed toward the door.  As Laura pulled out the keys she turned to Jason to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working out hard, Jason.  More than you, Vanessa or anyone knows.  Yet it seems that while I can still grow stronger, I\u2019m not even keeping up with Vanessa\u2019s gains, much less catching up.  I increase my best lifts by ten or twenty pounds and she increases hers by a fifty.  Today I expect her to bench over two tons and curl more than 1500 pounds, with one arm no less.  How do you keep up with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason followed her into the gym, she gave him a sad looking smile.  \u201cBut for you Jason, I can at least show you what my gains have been.  They\u2019re actually quite impressive, although I tend to lower them around Vanessa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood at the curling station as Laura headed for the locker to change.  He stayed there for a while taking everything in.  How close were they now?  She seemed willing to give the kind of quick summing up he wanted.  Surely he should have known much of this, shouldn\u2019t he?  As he continued to think, still wondering if his plan or at least his thought that he could possibly alter things would work, Laura came out of the locker room.  Jason gasped as Laura was sporting a gray athletic bra, tight gray biker shorts and white athletic shoes.  Her long muscular legs, hard 6 pack abs, broad shoulders, wide lats, thick bodybuilder pecs and meaty, bulging arms made her look every bit the high end super athlete he had originally envisioned and programmed into the phone, even without the oversized breasts.  At 5 foot 11 and nearly 200 pounds of large, lean muscle she actually looked better proportioned with smaller breasts and her body looked harder and a bit larger than he thought it would, including the oversized arms.  Laura smiled at his slack jawed stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.  You haven\u2019t been to the gym with me in like forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to Jason, Laura crossed her large arms under her thick chest and tensed her biceps, causing them to expand up to their programmed 20 inch circumference.  Or were they bigger?  Before he could contemplate that, Laura noticed him staring and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem, my arms are now nearly 21 inches around thanks to my work-outs and can expand up to 27.  But now that you know that, why did you want me to come to the gym?  What is this theory of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blushed for a moment as he stared into Laura\u2019s eyes.  He weighed his options and decided to start with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas anyone come up with a logic explanation as to just how Vanessa or you for that matter, can be that strong and expand your muscles like you can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura unfolded her arms and cocked her head slightly.  \u201cNo, not really.  I can\u2019t speak for what they\u2019ve told Vanessa, but I\u2019m definitely stronger than someone with my body type should be.  The doctors simply have given in to some type of genetic mutation.  Seeing as we\u2019re both healthy and haven\u2019t asked for further tests I guess nobody else is curious enough to try and force the issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sniffed.  \u201cLike anyone could force Vanessa to do anything anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned and scratched his head.  \u201cWell maybe the explanation isn\u2019t all that easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura narrowed her eyes.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a long sigh.  \u201cDo you have a tape measure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \u201cAre you kidding?  Vanessa has them practically everywhere.  There\u2019s one on the bench behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned, nodded his head and picked it up.  \u201cOK, can you do some alternating bicep curls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \u201cYou don\u2019t start with your arms for a work-out.  Well, unless you\u2019re Vanessa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his arms out to try and explain.  \u201cWell, this is an experiment after all.  If this doesn\u2019t work right away we can do something different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could tell Laura was suspicious, but she walked toward the rack of weights along the wall and picked up two rather large ones.  Jason glanced on down the line to see that the rack actually moved out and even had larger weights at the end that read 2 tons.  Those must be for Vanessa he mused.  Was Vanessa already anticipating curling that much weight?  As Jason walked over toward Laura he noticed she was holding 350 pound weights in each hand and his eyes widened.  Laura smiled at him as she turned toward the full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, no?  I\u2019m stronger than any man now.  Yet I\u2019m a distant second in my own house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked on as Laura readied herself to curl the weights.  He took a few breaths and started to concentrate.  What if Laura were as strong as her sister?  Stronger.  What if her muscles were as big and her expansion ability was even greater?  Could he really affect Laura as he thought he did for Vanessa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura pulled the weight up with her right arm, Jason found that..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanessa opened the door and Jason\u2019s eyes widened as he got his first up close look at the Vanessa he had created.  She had on a thick athletic outfit that looked stressed against a tidal wave of muscles and apparently rock hard breasts.  She smiled at Jason and chuckled at his expression.  Her blonde hair was long and hung over her massive shoulders and across the exposed sinews of her pectoral cleavage.  She looked as beautiful as ever, contrasting the gigantic muscles across her still femininely curved body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?  It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t normally see me dressed like this.  After all, as the strongest person in the world four years running I need to keep up with appearances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then casually flexed up her right arm and her massive arm exploded upward as muscles stacked upon muscles in an impossible display of mind blowing expansion.  And for added effect, the oversized biceps not just expanded visually, but audibly with what sounded like leather stretching.  The peak settled up to the top of her fist and pulsed with raw power.  There was no mushroom cloud on it, the one in the picture was drawn on for effect he guessed.  But damn, she was flexing by far the biggest bicep ever flexed by anyone.  As Jason\u2019s jaw dropped, Vanessa ignored his shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not as if anyone except Laura can get this kind of muscle expansion.  So sleeves haven\u2019t been an option for years either.  Want to know what I\u2019m curling these days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough Wonder Woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had reached the door and stood off to the side with a proud yet jealous expression.  Vanessa released her flex and looked a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that Jason is all over that kind of stuff.  Most guys are scared shitless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smirked.  \u201cYeah, including Greg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled wickedly.  \u201cWell payback is hell.  To think you and had to buckle under his rule when he was the big strong one in the family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded with a softer smile.  \u201cThose days are long gone.  You could be a bit nicer to him you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa turned and walked away giving Jason a look at her thick traps, strong rippling shoulder, wide, thick back, that tapered dramatically to her thin waist, her bulbous behind, strong hamstrings and killer calves.  \u201cWhatever.  Like I\u2019ve said before, you don\u2019t like The Vanessa, get the hell out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed as she watched Vanessa turn a corner and out of sight.  \u201cImagine being THAT strong and powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his eyes back toward Laura.  She was wearing a tight blue Superman shirt that did well to accentuate her own large chest.  And just as Vanessa had alluded to, the shirt was sleeveless, exposing Laura\u2019s own muscular arms.  He smiled absently and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well you\u2019re pretty big and strong yourself you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \u201cYeah, but not in her league.  It was pretty rough growing up with a sister stronger than any man with arms like that.  My muscle expansion is better than anyone else I have ever met, but it\u2019s still nothing compared to Vanessa.  And hell, I can curl hundreds of pounds with each arm.  She can curl over half a ton.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped at the thought of Vanessa curling that much weight.  But he now knew that by creating this super Vanessa that Laura\u2019s self confidence had taken a hit and had brought her closer to the old Laura.  He needed to find out more so he gave Laura as warm a smile as he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what did you have in mind, seeing as I must be running late?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled like he remembered before she became the 5 foot 11 muscle filled beauty in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the comic shop silly.  We need to go get the comics pulled for us before they put them back out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded his head.  Just like old times.  If that were the case why is the paradox still in place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Supergirl, your chariot awaits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura guffawed.  \u201cChariot.  Good one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed over to the comic store and were soon back the car, sitting there in the parking lot reading and talking.  After a while, Jason looked at Laura as she read the latest Wonder Woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, Laura, have you downloaded any new aps on your IPhone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up with a furrowed brow.  \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?  You and I were going to look at IPhones today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s heart skipped a beat.  He cursed himself for not asking the question differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh right.  Sorry.  Ready to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \u201cSure thing, I\u2019ve been saving up for months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  If she didn\u2019t have one now, how would buying one solve the paradox?  Still mulling over the current state he pulled up to the phone store and they walked in.  Most people in the store stared at Laura with varying degrees of shock.  A young woman walked up and Laura smiled.  Jason knew what she wanted and hung behind as the saleswoman went through all of the options.  After nearly an hour, Laura and Jason left the store with Laura giggling with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we can stay even closer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded as an idea came to him while they sat back in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s this ap that I think you might enjoy.  Why don\u2019t you see if it\u2019s still available?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded.  \u201cSure.  Let me pull up the store.  What\u2019s the name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlternations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura typed it in and found that..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Go ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head in thought as she did so and watched it download.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is this a pretty cool ap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed.  \u201cYou could say that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled.  \u201cOoooooh, mysterious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason thought about telling Laura what he knew.  Or what he thought he knew.  Would she believe him?  Would she be able to fix the paradox and perhaps bring them back to what he remembered as \u201cnormal\u201d?  Laura smiled as the phone pinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, download complete.  Let me open this puppy up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s soon looked confused.  \u201cWhat is this supposed to do?  It looks like I can pull up different people.  I entered my old contacts and it looks like I can pick one.  Hey, how about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura did so as Jason craned his neck to look at the picture.  It was him as he was now.  Different than the one on his phone in which he was the large man he had once been, but on hold by the ap due to the paradox he created.  Unfortunately, the same warning soon popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***This profile is currently read only. This profile cannot be modified due to an unresolved paradox***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot!\u201d  Jason cursed in frustration as Laura looked at him funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParadox?  What\u2019s going on?  You must have this ap.  Is there some sort of problem with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason paused.  He didn\u2019t want to go back to the beginning and explain that it was Laura\u2019s own IPhone back in his old reality that started this, seeing as he borrowed it to change himself and change Laura without her permission.  The fact that the profiles weren\u2019t in synch only seemed to make things worse.  He wasn\u2019t sure things could ever be fixed.  As he looked up after staring at the phone while thinking, Laura was still staring at him and was looking impatient.  Jason sighed, putting his thoughts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d believe me if I told you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura crossed her sizable arms across her sizeable chest, not helping Jason\u2019s concentration.  \u201cTry me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason cleared his throat.  \u201cYou and, uh I and well Vanessa aren\u2019t the same from where I started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kept her arms firmly crossed and her tone remained even.  \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason scratched his forehead.  \u201cUh, yeah.  Really.  I tried messing with myself and then, well changed you, or at least your body with the ap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s eyes narrowed.  \u201cYou changed me without my permission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pushed his arms out and lied.  \u201cNo.  No.  You were cool with it.  But once I did so, you didn\u2019t remember anything and were really weird.  You didn\u2019t like me and were, well promiscuous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura raised one eyebrow.  \u201cOK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  This wasn\u2019t getting any easier.  \u201cBut when I tried to fix things, it said our profiles were locked due to a paradox, just like your phone said when you tried to change me.  So.  So I changed Vanessa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nearly growled.  \u201cYou changed Vanessa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was the only option I could think of at the time.  You have to realize this is all very strange.  It kind of fixed things, but not enough I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at him skeptically.  \u201cSo what were the old Vanessa and I like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to continue, but figured there was no real reason to lie even if he did risk making Laura mad.  \u201cYou were shorter and much smaller.  No real breasts, skinny.  I had made myself bigger and we, uh wanted the same for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a short laugh, which to Jason indicated she still didn\u2019t believe him.  \u201cFunny, I don\u2019t remember that at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.  Think how I felt when we were no longer friends.  So in my attempt to correct the paradox I changed your sister.  She used to be curvy and build like a supermodel.  She didn\u2019t have any muscle to speak of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grunted.  \u201cSo first you make me stronger than Vanessa and as strong as Greg, except for my arms with are stronger.  Then you make Vanessa bigger and stronger than me.  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed with frustration.  \u201cTo try and fix the paradox.  But it didn\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you want me small and weak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  \u201cI don\u2019t.  But I can\u2019t affect myself to at least be your equal in size.  And you can\u2019t either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s arms dropped and her expression softened.  \u201cWell you do have to understand if this all appears to be unreal.  But having read enough sci fi through the years, it certainly has been written about.  And the phone does say paradox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded, happy that at least she wasn\u2019t going to toss him out his own car.  He moved his eyes back her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you tried Vanessa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head and pulled up Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***This profile is currently read only. This profile cannot be modified due to an unresolved paradox***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason cursed again.  \u201cDamn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cursed too.  \u201cSo much for making her a bit less, you know, uber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shot her a sly grin.  \u201cJealous much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura snickered, reached out her muscular arm and pushed her hand playfully against his chest.  However, even a playful push by this Laura against his thin form shoved him back harshly to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw.  Stop it Supergirl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \u201cYou should talk.  You want to be all full of muscle yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded.  Laura then pulled up her own profile.  When she did she found.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, Laura\u2019s profile came up.  And it was of her current form.  Jason was a bit crestfallen, but wasn\u2019t terribly surprised by that.  But why would her profile be available?  It didn\u2019t make sense.  Laura stared at the perfect image of her that had on the same outfit of the stretched out Superman t-shirt and the red spandex athletic shorts.  Laura then hit menu and purred when she saw all of the options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you say I can fiddle with things, to, you know, change stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted.  \u201cSure, but things can work out different than you intended.  We should be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sniffed as she pulled up the muscle mass tab.  \u201cSays you.  You don\u2019t have a sister who\u2019s stronger and more muscular than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grit his teeth.  Having Laura bigger and stronger would only make things worse he thought.  But how would making her smaller really do anything?  He was torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re still awesome right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled without taking her eyes off the phone.  \u201cYou\u2019re sweet.  But I saw the way you were looking at Vanessa.  You may be my man, but I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s still in your dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a hard breath.  \u201cYou know I\u2019m not even sure what my dreams are like right now, but you\u2019re my girlfriend.  And remember that this history is all messed up for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s tongue stuck out to the side as she changed the profile and Jason could see the form on the phone changing.  Jason moved his head to check out what she was doing but Laura gently pushed him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh, uh.  These changes are top secret.  Now what else did you change on Vanessa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to answer as he sunk back into his seat.  \u201cI changed her muscle mass, then her arm size, density and expansion ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up for a moment with a strange look.  \u201cWhy did you change those things?  Did you change that on me too, you know, originally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn\u2019t want to explain everything so he nodded.  Laura looked at the phone and then narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at her and stared.  He knew he had to answer and just figured to spill at this point.  \u201cMass up to 230 pounds, arm size I added an additional 10 inches, density for strength up 60% and expansion while flexing up 60%.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked back at the phone.  \u201cThat explains a lot, even if it all seems normal to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finished her own changes and moved away so Jason couldn\u2019t see her profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it mean historical or instantaneous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason snorted.  \u201cWell historical can mess up the time line.  But instantaneous would mess up the present with lots of questions.  So if I were to choose\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ignored him.  \u201cHistorical it is.  I want to re-live growing up with these settings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned toward her quickly.  \u201cNo, it may change more than you think, trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.  Oh, silly warning.  OK, here goes, I\u2019ll just hit apply and\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason reached out vainly to try and stop her and once she hit apply his vision went fuzzy and with a strange shimmer came back.  He blinked his eyes slowly and stared at the beautiful face of..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Things are, uh, definitely different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at her and once he focused he had to agree.  Laura looked as beautiful as ever, but her body was something from another world!  The seat was shifted back so her muscle loaded frame could fit.  And he noticed that his small car was now an SUV.  Upgrade!  Shaking his head, he quickly checked his profile and found the \u201cParadox\u201d block was still on.  He then looked back up at Laura and her smiling eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Supergirl, what the hell did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled wryly.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason felt his stomach settle down from the shift he was ready to see what had happened, starting with Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you change history?  I mean, you look bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blinked at him as if she were trying to process everything.  \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure.  I do seem to know that we should head over to the gym that I work out at.  We were definitely going to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at her and down at her enlarged chest.  The blue Superman shirt was now pink and as he twisted his head he saw that it had \u2018Laura Friedman is\u2019 over the Superman logo and \u2018Supergirl\u2019 under the logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.  Check out your shirt.  What\u2019s up with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura again seemed to struggle to get a grip on what was happening.  \u201cI, I\u2019m not quite sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to change the mood Laura licked her lips seductively.  \u201cLet\u2019s head to the gym so I can at least show you my upgrades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jason\u2019s attention successfully diverted, he started up the car and followed Laura\u2019s directions.  He tried hard to keep his eyes on the road and not on Laura.  Laura was remaining relaxed, not willing to give anything away.  She stared at the road as she attempted to sort out what had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn here so we can pull into the back lot of the gym off the alley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason did so and the backs of businesses soon followed until Laura pointed to a narrow entryway that was fenced in.  He turned in and pulled into a small empty parking lot.  Jason put the car in park and killed the engine.  He turned toward the still confused looking Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Supergirl Laura Friedman, are you ready to let me know what you did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head to focus, Laura\u2019s smile returned and she turned to reach for the door.  \u201cBetter to show you out of the car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got out of the car and he had to admire the SUV he was now driving.  He also had to wonder where he got the money for it.  As he reached around the back to meet Laura, she was standing there with her hands on her hips, her right leg planted forward on the toes of her white athletic shoes.  It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see just how much more muscular she was now.  Jason paused to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer right calf jumped as Laura pushed her toes to either side, bulging out like a canned ham, but with perfect shape, rippling muscle fibers and incredible definition.  Her thigh expanded to gigantic proportions as she flexed it, splitting deeply into the four quadriceps muscles, each surging forward as she flexed and un-flexed her mighty thigh a few times.  He couldn\u2019t imagine any man having legs to compete against the raging pillars of power Laura was now flexing for him.  Again the muscles were beyond massive but were still incredibly shapely and feminine as the front quad jumped and teardropped perfectly over her narrow knees.  The short spandex athletic shorts seemed to disappear beneath her raging musculature.  He could only imagine the size and strength of her glutes that popped out invitingly on the sides.  As his gaze moved upward Laura giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured if I was going to change that I would make sure to push myself further than you did Vanessa.  You\u2019re looking at a 280 pound muscle beast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura watched Jason\u2019s eyes move up she pulled her right leg back and tensed her abs causing the thick muscles to press out in bold display across her still narrow midsection into inhuman blocks of muscle and an array of pebble muscle obliques running up the side toward her wider than wide lats.  The Supergirl muscle shirt stretched with a groan as she flexed her back and pushed her mighty chest out like a porn star on super steroids!  The shirt held, but a tantalizing inch of the bottom of her chest was exposed.  And those massive pectorals and beyond DD breasts pushed out nearly two feet in front of her!  Laura then slowly pulled her left arm away from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just to make sure I had the arms to die for, I added 15 inches to biceps that already would have been 25 inches around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a held breath as he saw her unflexed bicep bulge outward like a comic book hero.  His eyes widened once her arm was extended and she pulled her small hand into a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as for the muscle expansion, I pumped that up to 100%!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a surprised yelp, causing Laura to chuckle as she slowly brought her forearm up and tensed her fist, causing a seismic reaction across her arms as her bicep blasted upward, building muscle on top of magnificent muscle.  Jason\u2019s eyes followed the mighty peak as it moved up to her fist, passed the top of her fist, then up level with the top of her head and then even higher!  Jason\u2019s knees grew weak from the sight as Laura pumped her arm a few times, adding mind blowing detail all along her gigantic bicep muscle that was flexed up to over three feet tall from her deep tricep belly to the top of her pulsing, super human bicep peak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched as Laura held her flex and bent down, reaching her right hand under the car to grip the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and I adjusted my density up really high too.  Well over 100%.  Guess how strong I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slowly stood back up and the back of the SUV rose with her!  Laura was casually lifting the back of his vehicle until the tires were over a foot off the pavement!  Now laughing as Jason was ready to tilt, Laura released her flex and carefully put the car back down.  She also noticed the large bulge pressing against his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo stud, I take you like the improved me, huh.  Even if the phone did warn about an additional paradox, I\u2019m pretty happy with the results.  And it\u2019s time you got to check this body out further too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head, momentarily ignoring her comment about an additional paradox and watched her open up the back of the SUV.  He looked inside to see that the back seats were down and some padding was covering the seats and trunk space.  As Laura pulled him in and casually tossed him down she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll take care of everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura carefully climbed in after him, she tugged on his jeans and grinned as she unleashed his quivering member.  Smiling, she tugged down on her tight spandex and within moments the back of the SUV was rocking.  Jason did his best to keep up with well, a Supergirl, and to his delight, Laura was making sure Jason wasn\u2019t crushed while still getting the tactile pleasure of her firm breasts and her rock hard muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward Laura rolled onto her side as Jason panted.  Both were sweating from the experience but had a post coital glow.  Jason stared at the ceiling of the SUV as he gathered his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Laura, how much of this reality do you remember?  I assume you\u2019re the biggest and strongest person now.  Did Vanessa or Greg change any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura remained silent.  He could hear her breath, so he knew she heard him.  After an awkward pause, Jason tried again softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I\u2019m not sure.  It\u2019s as if I\u2019m missing something really important.  Maybe we need to go into the gym now.  I remember wanting or needing to head here.  I\u2019m still not sure why just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both pulled on their clothes in silence, they got out of the SUV and Jason closed the back and locked the car.

She reached out and held his hand.  \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking forward, she opened up the back gym door and they walked through.

Favorite movies was repopulated from rom/coms and chick fllicks to sci-fi, Anime and horror.  \"Hmm, should she like Evil Dead 2 more or less than Star Wars Episode IV?  Less... but not by much...\"  Interest level went from \"superficial\" to \"intensely detailed orientated.\"  \"That sounds about right, it wouldn't be good to saddle her with OCD or something.\"  And tech savvy went from \"usually overhwhelmed\" to \"gadget lover.\"  \"Yea, riding the bleeding edge of technology gets pricy, she should be fine there.\"  Jason looked it over and liked what he saw.

He was greeted by the \"Profile locked due to enresolved paradox\" error again.  \"What the fuck?\" he finally exclaimed.  He was about to throw his iPhone at the wall when he noticed some thigns HAD changed.  The relationship corkboard was still there but it wasn't cluttered with pictures of Laura or her friends, there was the picture of Laura that had been in the center in a corner, his paradox sketch was still in the middle and a bunch of random crap like articles about upcoming movies and a collection of movie ticket stubs were scattered around it.  \"This looks more like the room I remember.\"  The desk only had one padlocked drawer and it turned out to have a stash of porn and two notebooks that looked like personal journals and not obsessive tracking tools.  It hadn't been updated in over a year.  \"See, this is why I never even bothered starting a diary in the first place,\" he muttered as he put them back.  A few snapshots of Laura printed on computer paper were still on the back of his bedroom door but his shelves had been repopulated with comics and action figures again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it?  Where's the paradox still?\"  Jason hadn't read the journals in detail but they had referred to Laura in friendly terms so they were still presumably hanging out at least a year ago.  \"And I didn't turn into a crazy stalker...  Screw it, my brain is fried, I'm tired, I'm going to bed and I'll deal with this more tomorrow.\"  He lay back on his bed and was startled to see \"Ceiling Laura\" was still there in all her glory.  \"Hell-o, I didn't expect to see you here again.\"  Jason closed his eyes and tried to sleep but gave up and reached for the lotion bottel again. \"You're killing me,\" he muttered before he finally drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was dreaming of himself with huge muscles. He was strutting around the beach bare chested and bulging. There were women everywhere watching him as he passed gazing upon him with longing looks. Occasionally he would raise an arm and flex his 31 inch bicep causing several of his onlookers to swoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a familiar voice from behind him caused him to turn. \"Hey, stud. How about some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found Laura in her enhanced glory. She wore nothing at all, but had her arms surrounding her copious bosom, pressing her cleavage up to her chin just like in the poster sized photo on Jason's ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrimming with confidence Jason grabbed Laura around the waist and pulled her close. She placed her hands on either side of his giant chest and pressed her boobs against him. \"Sure thing, baby. What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin crept across Laura's lips and she slid downward out of his embrace onto her knees in front of him. She ran her hands up his enormous thighs to his tiny speedo swimsuit which was taut around Jason's erect member. Laura pulled his tiny trunks down and released his penis. Then she grabbed it firmly between her hands and guided his throbbing head into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason closed his eyes and was awash in tidal waves of pleasure. He felt, with shocking clarity, the motion of Laura's tongue along his shaft, the tightness of her lips, and the suction she applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his eyes were open and he was in bed gripping his sheets with white-knuckled intensity as his penis began to ejaculate. It was then that he realized that he could still feel all the same sensations on his member; the tongue, the lips, the pressure. He looked down and saw a shape hidden under his sheets that could only be a person wrapped around his middle. He yanked the sheet back and unveiled a stranger with auburn hair that fell down over her face. The mystery woman looked up and pulled her hair aside. She had intense green eyes that seemed to glow with excitement, a dash of freckles across her nose and a smile that warmed Jason's entire being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sleepyhead,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mind was going a mile a minute and a million questions demanded answers, at the same time he was overcome with a flood of conflicting emotions from the disappointment of realizing his muscles were all a dream and lost again, to shock of discovering a stranger in his room, to the giddy excitement of receiving his first ever blowjob. Had he been capable he probably would have blurted out a series of terrifying and confused statements at his guest, but fortunately for him he was still panting from his orgasm. His inability to catch his breath slowed him down enough to collect himself enough to not flip out entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... good morning,\" he puffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl slid off of his bed and stood next to him. \"I hope you don't mind the wake up call. Your mom let me in as she was leaving and I just couldn't help myself.\" Jason took in her appearance now that he could see her. She stood about 5 feet 8 inches tall with fairly long legs well displayed in tight khaki shorts. Her thighs and calves were well toned and gorgeous. She wore a tight, babydoll style shirt that hugged her broad shoulders and decently sized C cup breasts. The bottom portion of her shirt was short and showed off several inches of a slender tummy that was lined with the hint of washboard abs. The shirt itself was black and displayed the Hylian crest from the Zelda games in red across the front. As much as Jason's eyes wanted to linger on her body he kept returning to her face which looks strangely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. I mean, I don't mind at all.\" Jason sat up and turned so his feet were on the floor. His eyes scanned the walls for some clue as to this girl's identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good,\" she purred and advanced on him. \"I always enjoy making you feel good.\" She then sat on her knees straddling Jason. His hands instinctively went to her thighs and he marveled over how incredibly smooth her skin was to the touch. He squeezed gently and was delighted to find behind a thin layer of soft flesh was a firmness of muscle. \"If we had the time I'd spend the whole day making you feel good, but...\" She stood up off of Jason's lap and walked across the room to the window swaying her hips and butt while flexing her calves. Jason's breath stopped in his chest, this girl knew exactly how to get him excited. \"We're already late,\" she finished her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason remembered where he'd seen this girl before. She was in a photo of Laura that had been pinned to his wall the night before. What was her name? It was on the tip of his tongue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki!\" He blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned and gave him another spine melting smile. \"Yes handsome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pulled the shade on his window and sunlight came blazing in. \"It's nearly noon. We've got to meet Vanessa at the tailors by 1 so we can get to the comic shop and back before the big gala this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery little of what she just said made any sense to him, but he figured the only way to fix things was to go along with them and then figure out how to move later. Besides, there was something about this girl that got Jason excited. Perhaps it was simply that he had woken up to her mouth on his unit, but he felt there was something more. She was cute and sexy, a little nerdy but altogether beautiful and the way she looked at him made him feel like he was the biggest stud to ever live. It was clear he was in a relationship with Nikki, but he didn't know how Vanessa or Laura fit into the puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason absentmindedly glanced up at the poster of \"Ceiling Laura\" that was still hanging over his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed, \"Yes, yes, your old pal might be there tonight, too, if she can fit a little party into her Hollywood starlet lifestyle. Now, go! Get in the shower, you slug, we need to get going!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed some clothes and made his way to the bathroom. He tried to take a quick shower but his mind kept wandering to his current situation. He was curious to see how everything was going to play out, but he was also anxious to figure out what \"paradox\" he was trapped in, and the mysterious email he received from the Alterations app team about far reaching effects kind of worried him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was so lost in thought he didn't even notice that part of the shower curtain was pulled back and Nikki was watching him. Finally he felt a waft of cold air on his arm and turned to see her smiling at him. He was so startled he jumped and nearly fell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed. \"I'm sorry, but you know how much l love to watch you.\" Her eyes drifted down to his crotch and Nikki bit her lower lip. Then she shook her head and shoved the curtain closed. Jason could hear her voice as she stomped away, \"God! If only we didn't have to leave soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason finished his shower and got dressed. He and Nikki left the house and Jason didn't argue when Nikki offered to drive. She took them to a small clothing shop. They entered together and Jason was happy to see a familiar face, even if it wasn't Laura's. Vanessa was dressed in black yoga pants and a loose fitting top as though she had just come from the gym. Despite her baggy top Jason could still clearly make out the outline of her DD cup bust. Even though she was slightly sweaty, her hair was tied back and she wore no makeup Jason could see she was as gorgeous as ever. What he did find strange was the bag she carried, it was a black duffel with a huge batman insignia on the side. As far as Jason could remember Vanessa had never shown the slightest interest in anything comic book or superhero related. Then he remembered the changes he'd made to her mental profile and realized he was seeing the results of a more nerdy lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa lit up when she saw Jason and Nikki. She stood and handed them each a garment bag. \"Here, I got the stuff already but we need to try them on before we go. Jason, you're over there. Nikki with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could even say hello to Vanessa she and Nikki were gone into the ladies changing room. He entered the men's changing room and hung up the garment bag. Inside he found his outfit for the apparent gala. It was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unzipping the garment bag he found a black tuxedo with a burgundy shirt inside with a black tie. Jason never enjoyed wearing suites, fortunately he rarely needed to and instead always tended towards his comfortable T-shirt and short combos. But once he slipped into these clothes he found them to be not as bad as he expected, and he felt he looked pretty good when he examined himself in the mirror. He'd never worn a tailored suit, much less a tuxedo, and enjoyed the way it fit him perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went back to the front of the store to wait for the girls to finish trying on their dresses. He felt a little silly standing there alone in a nice tux and old sneakers, but decided not to think about it too much. He pulled out his phone and opened the Alterations app to see if he could garner some information on Nikki while he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found her profile and noted that she was wearing a red cocktail dress. \"Wow,\" he said aloud then looked around to make sure no one heard him. He noticed that she was listed as \"Revision: 0\" so he knew no changes had been made to her, but he also saw just above that a label that read \"Profile Status.\" The status was listed as \"expired\" but that word had a line through it and \"active\" was right next to it. Jason found this odd but then decided to move on as it also seemed irrelevant. He tapped on the \"mental\" tab hoping to get an idea of Nikki's psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first tab was of Nikki's primary likes and interests. It was the same tab he had adjusted on Vanessa the night before. He had no plans to make changes now, but just wanted to see what was there. He found that her primary love was video games. There was a long list of games starting with Zelda and surrounding pop culture as well as Metroid but also went on to current titles like BioShock and Skyrim and even Grand Theft Auto. He scanned down and found her other tastes to he just as nerdy, movies (she loved zombie flicks most of all, but was also in love with Sci-Fi), comic books (Green Lantern was her favorite? Interesting choice.), and Dungeons and Dragons.  But there was one thing that stood out as outside the norm of a geeky gamer girl on her interests list. Not far from the top was a listing for \"bodybuilding/bodybuilders.\" Jason was intrigued by this but in the end wrote it off as a side effect of growing up with muscle heads like Greg and Laura around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then went to a tab titled \"turn ons.\" This list was much stranger and borderline esoteric. There were normal things like \"nice smile,\u201d \"movie lover,\" and \u201ccute butt,\u201d but other ones that almost read as phrases Nikki would have written herself like \u201cI love it when a man rubs my scalp\u201d and  \"the feel of someone sucking on my thighs drives me insane\" even specific turn ons like \"Jason's penis.\" (He took solace in knowing that she really enjoyed his unit.) Then, just like in the interests he saw a pair of similar listings near the top that read \"bodybuilders\" and right above it \"huge muscles.\" Again Jason frowned, but was soon distracted by a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up to see Nikki and Vanessa standing in the doorway to the dressing room in their dresses. Vanessa's was black, strapless, and wrapped tight around her gorgeous breasts. The material of the dress hugged her curvaceous hips like a second skin and the hem was cut high to show off the supple flesh of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason saw that Nikki was wearing the red dress he'd seen her in on the app, but seeing her in the flesh was indescribably better. Thin spaghetti straps slid over her strong shoulders, vanishing amid her deep red locks. The front of the dress had a v-cut that framed her breasts perfectly showing off a fair amount of creamy cleavage. And like Vanessa's outfit Nikki's was hemmed very short to showcase her incredible legs. Jason noticed that both girls were standing in bare feet and while Vanessa had a good 2 inches on Nikki, Nikki's legs were several inches longer than Vanessa's. Right in that very moment Jason desperately wanted to test Nikki's \"thigh sucking\" turn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could only stare at such incredible beauty, until recently the only girl he ever spent time with had been Laura in her previous, plain form. Now that he was not only hanging out with but receiving oral sex from such beautiful women his brain overloaded. He felt a thin line of drool slip from the corner of his mouth and his body went numb. Suddenly he felt his phone slipping from his hands. Terrified that it would break on the hard tile floor Jason tried to catch it and instead bobbled it. It popped up and he tried to catch it again, but continued to knock it one way then the other. After juggling it several times his iPhone slipped through his fingers and towards the floor. Jason dove along with it and just got his fingers around the device inches above the ground before landing at Nikki's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nikki said, \"I think we can take that as a compliment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned the phone over in his hand just in time to see the message \"Alterations Complete.\" In his bumbling of the phone he had obviously changed something, but what?</span></div></div>",

For a brief moment his vision blurred and when it cleared his jaw flopped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Nikki said laughing at Jason\u2019s expression, \u201cdefinitely a compliment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, as he always seemed to, first noticed Nikki\u2019s legs. Moments ago they were definitely fit and toned, but now her muscles had swollen and become athletic. She now had a gymnasts legs, and her quads were thick and strong while still rounded and soft in appearance. Her calves had become even more pronounced, and even though Jason was viewing Nikki from the front her calves were wide and obvious. Jason\u2019s eyes moved up Nikki\u2019s body where he found that her dress had changed. It was still the same shade of red, but now there was a large swath of fabric missing from her midsection. An opening ran from under her right arm across her stomach diagonally down to her left hip. This opening showed the bare flesh of Nikki\u2019s chiseled midsection where tight abs and cut obliques were proudly displayed. Nikki\u2019s shoulders, already broad, were thick with sinew and her arms followed suit. Even relaxed at her side her biceps popped and Jason guessed that she could probably pump them into good sized peaks of 14 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glanced over at Vanessa and found that her body also was more fit, but no where near the level of athleticism that Nikki now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Jason?\u201d Nikki asked, placing her hands on her hips and twisting her body to the side showcasing her outstanding new curves. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me naked a hundred times, why does this make you so speechless?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to answer when Vanessa cut in, \u201cI told you before, the right dress makes all the difference in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed, \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. I mean I still haven\u2019t fixed my hair, put on makeup or even put my shoes on and look at the big lug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls shared a laugh together until the shopkeeper stuck her head out from the back room. \u201cEverything fit okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all perfect!\u201d Vanessa called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly woman looked Jason\u2019s direction, \u201cAnd you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to comment on just how comfortable his tux was when he raised his arms and noticed it didn\u2019t fit quite as well as before. His jacket was tight across his shoulders and chest, even his arms felt a little restricted. Then he looked down and realized why, he was massive! His chest stuck out several inches and his shoulders, from his perspective, looked at least twice as wide as the had been previously. Jason held his arms up and found them to each be giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... well,\u201d he struggled to respond, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good, you know? I mean, still a tiny bit tight, but only in a few places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman seemed mildly offended. She vanished into her office but the trio could still hear her grumbling about Jason\u2019s comment and fitting bodybuilders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice one, doofus,\u201d Nikki joked. \u201cNow get moving, we\u2019ve still got a few more stops before we need to get ready for the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jason was alone in the changing room he fished his phone out of his pocket and checked Nikki\u2019s profile. He opened it to her interests tab and saw no changes, but when he selected her list of turn ons he found out what he had done: now topping her list of turn ons was \u201chuge muscles\u201d followed by \u201cbodybuilders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious to see exactly how dramatic the changes were Jason stripped off his clothes and stood before the mirror in his briefs. He was astounded at what he saw. While he wasn\u2019t as large as he\u2019d been after using the app in Laura\u2019s bedroom he was still one of the biggest, most muscular beings he\u2019d ever seen. He raised his arms and flexed 26 inch guns that looked primed to explode. Then he put his hands on his hips and flexed his chest and thighs simultaneously. His pecs seemed to swell forward and out with abandon while his quads fought for space on his legs. His thighs were so large, in fact, that they pressed into each other even with his feet set fairly wide apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to seeing you like this,\u201d Nikki\u2019s voice came from behind him and Jason saw her in the mirror. She had changed back into her regular clothes which seemed to be exactly the same as before, though now they were painted onto her athletic frame and the sleeves of her t-shirt were missing. Jason watched her incredible thighs flex and harden with each step she took as she approached him from behind. She pressed herself against his back, laid her head on his meaty shoulder, and ran her arms around his waist feeling the grooves of his stomach. Jason felt his tiny briefs getting tighter as his penis woke up and began to harden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how glad I am that I asked you to start working out with me.\u201d Nikki continued. \u201cOtherwise you still be that lanky guy I fell for instead of this monster that drives me crazy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I would still love you no matter how skinny you were, but this..\u201d She ran her hands up to his engorged pectorals and squeezed with all of her might, \u201cThis, is like a dream come true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled to himself. He was glad to have been handed a fairly large chunk of backstory to his life, something that he\u2019d been hoping for all day. Clearly Nikki\u2019s love of muscles had driven her to want to work out more and she\u2019d asked him to join her probably in an attempt to put a little meat on his frame as well. Obviously Jason\u2019s body had taken to it pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to Nikki and admired her muscular figure. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re looking mighty fine yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki blushed a little. \u201cWell thank you, but it\u2019s only because you inspire me; you push me so hard. It\u2019s just so incredible, though, that you\u2019ve done all this in only six months. It doesn\u2019t seem possible. I can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll look like six months from now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had a fairly good idea: 370 pounds, 31 inch arms, it was the body he had programmed into the app. It was the only explanation that made sense. Somehow the enormous body he had given himself was bleeding through to this reality. It must have something to do with the paradox, after all didn\u2019t the app display him as still the giant he\u2019d created?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki released her hug and began to leave the room. \u201cOkay, my big hunk of man, get your clothes on. We still have a few more stops before we head home. And I want to make sure we have time to play before we have to go.\u201d The smile that Nikki gave him then sent goosebumps running all over Jason\u2019s giant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was alone again he began pulling his clothes on (a pair of tight jogging shorts and an Incredible Hulk t-shirt.), all the while his mind was racing. He guessed himself to be around 330 pounds right now, that was an increase from his former size of 170 pounds, doubling his weight. Some quick math in his head told him that over the last 6 months he\u2019d added nearly 30 pounds a month or almost a pound a day. If he was right about his current size and the reason for his incredible growth he only had a little further to go before he topped out. Perhaps another month and a half and Nikki would be saddened to learn that Jason had plateaued, unable to grow any further. Unless that somehow undid the paradox and he was able to access his profile in the app again. But what if that wasn\u2019t what caused the problem? Now his head was beginning to hurt again. He had some answers, but still a lot more questions. Still, he thought as he finished tying his shoes and taking one last look at himself in the mirror, there are worse problems to have than being a bodybuilder\u2019s wet dream. He gave one last flex to his reflection and watched a symphony of bulges exploded across his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason told himself, \u201cI can deal with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the main part of the store Vanessa and Nikki were already waiting for Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shot Jason a sly grin, \u201cTook you long enough. Have trouble tearing yourself away from your own reflection?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second Jason felt the sting of her comment, but then he spoke without even thinking as if the words came from some other source than his brain, \u201cA feeling I\u2019m sure you\u2019re used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed. \u201cWhat can I say, the girls and I like to take our time.\u201d She squeezed her \u201cgirls\u201d oozing cleavage up through the top of her shirt. \u201cI do have quite a few curves to examine. It can take a while.\u201d She moved her hands to her slender waist and thrust her round hips out to one side to accentuate her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you two!\u201d Nikki cut in and Jason detected a hint in jealousy in her voice. \u201cLet\u2019s get moving.\u201d Nikki gave Vanessa a solid slap on her ass that made a sound like a whip crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa just giggled and aimed her round butt at her redheaded assailant. \u201cMmmm, more! Harder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shoved Vanessa towards the door. \u201cMove it you slut!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason followed the girls outside, he was feeling very relaxed in this new environment; more so than he would have expected. Perhaps it was the confidence that came with such a stupendous physique or perhaps it was something about the girls themselves that put his at ease. Or maybe, a voice in the back of his mind said, there\u2019s more bleeding through reality than just your muscles. Regardless he was going to let things play out for a little before reopening the Alterations app or making any more changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason squeezed into the passenger seat of Nikki\u2019s car. Just as he was about to close the door he heard Vanessa ask Nikki about their next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I meet you guys at the comic shop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki thought for a second then replied..</span></div></div>",

We'll see you at dinner tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shook her head. \"You know Trevor is going to kill you.\" Jason recognized this as the guy who ran the local comic shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him to cool it. I'll pick up my stuff tomorrow. One more day isn't going to hurt him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been telling him one more day for a month. That guy is never going to special order anything for you ever again. Just because you can't keep it in your pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shrugged then pointed at Jason. \"Wouldn't you jump that every chance you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa didn't answer but she looked at Jason in such a way that he knew she agreed. Suddenly being a focus of desire not only for this gorgeous redhead but also the smoking hot girl Jason had watched break hearts for years was a major ego boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Vanessa gave Nikki a friendly shove. \"Fine She-Ra, go hump your He-Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki made a face, \"She-Ra and He-Man were twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerd?\" Nikki laughed. \"Answer me this, do you or do you not have a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide in that bag you're carrying right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa appeared to know she'd been defeated. \"Bitch,\" was all she could say but her massive grin told Jason it was all in fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shot Vanessa a wink. \"Don't be jealous. We'll see you tonight, you sexy goddess.\" Then Nikki joined Jason in the car. \"Change of plans, big guy. We're going to my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki lived on her own in an apartment a block away from the beach on what the locals called \"restaurant row,\" a 10 block section of town that packed together a whole host of hole-in-the-wall diners and specialty shops. Nikki's apartment was directly above a coffee shop and though Jason didn't really like coffee the aroma that filled her home was warm and comfy. Her living room was a bit of a mess with an old worn out couch and coffee table but her TV was huge, shiny, new, and surrounded by video game consoles. In the corner a large glass display case held several models and figures of various comic heroes. Jason realized that they were all female: Supergirl, Rogue, She Hulk, Caitlin Fairchild, Catwoman. On the floor by the display case Jason saw some free weights scattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason kicked off his shoes while Nikki hung the garment bags containing their formalwear in the hall closet. She then ran and launched herself at Jason leaping into his arms and wrapping her powerful legs around his middle. Jason held Nikki's body aloft with a single hand and marveled at how easy it was. Nikki leaned back a bit and whipped her shirt off while Jason casually strode down the hall to her bedroom. It occurred to him that he was about to lose his virginity to a girl he barely knew yet had been dating for quite a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, super stud, care to ravage me with my favorite muscle of all?\" Nikki ran her hands around Jason's shoulders and down to his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Jason plopped Nikki down on her bed and pretended to ponder her request while she slid out of her shorts and panties. \"Your favorite muscle of all? Which could that be? Is it this one?\" Jason turned to his side and pressed his foot into the floor. His calf hardened into a 25 inch mass that resembled a canned ham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh,\" Nikki moaned then slid her foot up along the hard cleft of his muscle, \"that is a nice one, but not my favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, how about these?\" Jason turned and lifted his shirt, flexing his abs for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creamy skin of Nikki's cheeks and chest flushed and her hands flew to Jason's deeply ridged stomach. Her fingers ran through the grooves between the bricks of muscle that lined his abdomen then over the piano key bumps of his obliques. \"Those are way sexy, but not what I was looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I think you'll enjoy these.\" This time Jason removed his shirt completely then put his hands on his hips and flexed his pecs. Huge slabs of sinew swelled forward and Nikki visibly shuddered with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sat on her knees on her bed and leaned toward Jason's chest. She placed light kisses on each pec then leaned back. \"These are incredible, but no. There's something I love even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned. \"You're tough to please, but there's no way you could turn this down.\" He held his right arm up and squeezed his bicep into a solid mass measuring 26 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki actually gasped. Then she wrapped her hands around either side of the monstrous muscle Jason offered her and began sucking, licking, and even nibbling on his arm. She slowly began to compose herself and sat back, brushing some red strands from her face. \"You are so close. That is my second favorite muscle, but there's still one that drives me over the edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess there's one more thing I could show you, I really only bring it out for special occasions.\" Jason was talking like he was on autopilot. In truth this was his first sexual experience (excluding the surprise blowjob that morning) and though he was typically shy around pretty girls he instead felt completely in charge. He was deftly bringing Nikki to a fevered state and now he would give her what she was begging for. \"How a about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his shorts down. Intending to remove them entirely he fumbled a bit around his gargantuan thighs. He tried to recover but couldn't seem to manage the bunched up fabric. Finally he slid his shorts over one thigh at a time and the stretched out bottoms fell to the floor. To him it felt a bit anticlimactic, but Nikki didn't miss a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one!\" she shouted. She grabbed Jason's 8 inch cock and pulled him towards herself as she lay back on the bed. She guided the thick head of his penis right into her crotch and before Jason even knew what was happening he found himself slowly entering Nikki as she moaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki wrapped her legs around Jason's waist and tightened in an attempt to force him deep within her. However, in spite of her strong leg muscles, Jason held back and even slid out an inch or two deciding to take it slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned wickedly. \"You fucking tease!\" She slapped Jason's giant thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what was that?\" He asked pulling out even more so that only the head of his penis was inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was squeezing for all she was worth trying to get Jason to fill her up but she couldn't get him to budge. She began to beg, \"Please! Give it to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed Nikki's hips and drilled into her slamming his cock home. Nikki began howling and for a moment Jason thought he had seriously hurt her, but then she locked her eyes on his and growled through gritted teeth, \"MORE! HARDER! You know I can take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, still holding tight to Nikki's hips, pulled out slowly while Nikki moaned. Then he rammed her again causing her to scream again. The third time he did this he was pretty sure he launched Nikki over the edge into orgasm. She bucked her hips wildly and began yelling, \"ohfuckohfuckohfuck\" over and over. Jason's confidence soared, three pumps in and he had Nikki coming. He watched her for a moment as she tensed her muscles across her whole body taking in her sleek and sexy abs, powerful shoulders and bulging arms. He reached down and gripped her large, round breast and squeezed. \"Yeah, it's official\" he thought to himself, \"I'm the luckiest guy around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spent the next few hours releasing years of pent up sexual energy by trying out every position and move he could think of. He climbed on top of her and pumped away for a while then pulled her legs up and bent her in half. This allowed him to suck on her calves while he continued to grind his hips against hers. Suddenly he remembered the turn-on he'd read about while using the Alterations app so he pulled out, lowered himself down, and began sucking on the insides of her thighs. Nikki immediately went crazy and clamped her legs together around Jason's head which only spurred him on. Jason sucked long and hard savoring her perfect skin and the writhing muscles just beneath. Later he stood Nikki up and turned her around taking her from behind while grabbing a fistful of her gorgeous red hair. Later still Jason found himself back atop the gorgeous girl pounding away fast and hard like a jackhammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki kept up with him surprisingly well for a long time, but eventually she began to fade. Sensing her exhaustion Jason finally gave in to the intense pressure in his cock and unleashed a shockingly powerful blast of come. Then he lay down with Nikki curled up next to him. A few minutes later the pair were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey napped for about an hour with Jason waking first. He hugged Nikki close to him enveloping her in his massive muscles. He enjoyed how much greater his girth was to hers. Nikki stirred and then opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get ready?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably a good idea.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki paused a moment, her green eyes locked on Jason as if trying to figure him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you stay with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Suddenly Jason was worried. He was going to have to have a boyfriend conversation with a girl he only just met. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki continued, \"Look at you, you could have any woman on the planet. And I know how you feel about Laura, you've still got her poster on you ceiling. I know she turned down your advances when you were scrawny, but you're exactly her type now and you guys were good friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he even knew what was happening Jason responded without thinking, \"Don't be silly, baby. Laura was my friend and, yes, I got caught up in her looks but you were interested in the real me from the start. Besides, you're the sexiest woman I've ever known, through and through. Now lets get ready and make Laura jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile that lit up Nikki's face dazzled and Jason felt its warmth radiate. She kissed him and leapt out of bed. \"You really think I'm sexy?\" she asked turning her back to him and looking back over her shoulder. She whipped her hair to the side and stood on her toes to flex her calves and make her long legs look even longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without a doubt.\" Jason said. His penis rose to attention proving his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you like my muscles even if they're not as big as Laura's?\" Nikki raised her arm and flexed. Her bicep popped into a baseball sized mass that looked rock hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you love me more if I were as big as she was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's possible for me to love you any more than I already do.\" Jason said and was surprised to find that he meant it. As well as what he said next, \"And I will always love you no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you big softie, let's get moving.\" Nikki grabbed Jason by the hand and led him to the bathroom where they showered one at a time (with Jason's size a dual shower was out of the question). Once done bathing Jason was dressed and prepped within minutes. Nikki told him that with her hair and markup she'd be a little while so Jason sat on her couch and played video games while he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later Nikki emerged from the bathroom and leaned against the doorframe. \"How do I look?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up and felt his breath leave him. Of course she wore the same dress as earlier but seeing her all made up with her hair done, her smoky eyeliner, ruby lips, and black 4 inch heels made her look like a goddess. All of a sudden Jason no longer felt like the confident hulk but rather the shy nerdy kid who was awkward around women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and tried to say something, but could only stutter. Finally Nikki laughed then put on her best sexy strut over to Jason where she pressed her warm body against his. With her high heels on the two were eye to eye. \"You are such a dork sometimes,\" she said. \"But oh my god, do I love you.\" She locked her lips against his and their tongues danced together. Jason wrapped his hands around her slender waist and pulled her even closer to him. Then he slid one of his hands down and gave her tight rear a firm squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pulled Jason's hands off of her then backed up. \"Come on, if we start down that path we'll never leave the house. And we've got someplace to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded his agreement, though secretly didn't give a damn about their dinner. He wanted to rip Nikki's dress off and begin another round of lovemaking. Against his will he followed the gorgeous redhead outside to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later they arrived at a beachfront banquet hall that was surrounded by a throng of screaming people. Jason spotted a huge billboard across the front of the building advertising the evening's event. It was a celebration of hometown hero Laura Friedman and her starring role in the upcoming Hollywood blockbuster based on the character...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Laura is staring in a movie about She Hulk?\" Jason said out loud forgetting himself for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, yeah,\" Nikki said. \"You already knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Jason said, trying to recover. \"I just still can't get used to the idea that they'd even make a She Hulk movie, much less put Laura in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pulled around back and parked and the pair walked around to the front of the building where the large crowd of people tried to figure out if they were famous or not. After an initial spurt of applause and flashbulbs the general consensus was they were no one of consequence and all enthusiasm died out. Jason did enjoy some of the murmurs he overheard. One girl assumed that he and Nikki must have been stunt actors based on their physiques while another commented that she would kill to have a body like Nikki's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Nikki entered the building and checked in at a table where they were given their seating assignment. When they entered the main hall Jason found it filled with people he had never met before. He waded through the crowd with Nikki at his side and quickly realized that the two of them were turning heads all over the place. Considering the incredibly hot girl on his arm he wasn't too surprised, but he soon noticed that many people were sizing him up as well. He smiled and nodded and said a few hellos and before he knew it they were at their assigned table which was right next to the stage though all the way to the left side of the room. It was here that Jason finally recognized a pair of familiar faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason!\" Greg stood and walked around to where Jason stood and shook his hand. \"How are you, man? You're looking huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Jason said sheepishly. He didn't really know how to act around Laura's bodybuilder brother. Were they friends in this universe? Rivals? Either way Jason took a great deal of secret pride in the fact that though Greg had about 2 inches on him it was clear that Jason bulk was greater. Jason was about to say something else, but Greg looked right past him at his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And sweet, little Nikki. You look amazing!\" Greg moved in and gave Nikki a big hug, then turned back to Jason. \"This girl is way too good for you, man. It's not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled nervously. \"You're right, you know. Just don't say it out loud, I think she can hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Nikki started chatting about something that Jason didn't hear because he felt a tug on his arm. He turned to find Vanessa, and even though he had already seen her in her black strapless dress earlier, seeing her now all made up still made his mouth go dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, stud.\" she said adjusting his jacket and brushing some lint off of his shoulder. \"Looking very good. Give me a hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason complied gladly and reveled in the sensation of Vanessa's large, soft bosom pressed against his chest, and Jason had to focus to avoid getting an erection. Vanessa turned her head a bit and whispered in Jason's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for this, big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know exactly what. You haven't seen my sister since she basically ripped your heart out. I just need to be sure there aren't any bad feelings remaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt a twinge of guilt from some phantom source. This did go a ways to explaining Nikki's concerns from earlier. \"I'll be fine. I've got the most incredible girlfriend on the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa released her embrace and looked Jason in the eye. Then Jason felt himself speaking again without knowing where the words were coming from. \"And I've got you,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled warmly. \"Of course you do, you'll always have me.\" Then she leaned in and kissed him on the cheek. The place where Vanessa's lips touched him tingled slightly and Jason was filled with a warmth that made him realize there was no way he was going to be able to stop his erection so he may as well just try and hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately dinner service was beginning and everyone was sitting down. Jason slid into his seat between Nikki and Vanessa where, to his confusion, both girls slid a hand into each of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later a man took the state and introduced himself as the director of the film Laura was starring in. He began singing Laura's praises and talking about what a fortunate find she was and how her incredible abilities worked so well for the role. Jason tried to listen but he suddenly realized just how hungry he was and began scarfing down every bit of food that was delivered to him. Without even being asked both Nikki and Vanessa would shovel their leftovers onto his plate which would promptly vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director, whose name Jason had already forgotten, was finishing his remarks just as Jason was launching into the main course (a steak and lobster combo) when the lights came down and an extended trailer for the movie began to play. Jason was momentarily distracted by the footage when a skinny rail of a girl appeared. It was Laura, but not the one from this reality, his Laura. The original. It took Jason several seconds to realize that the filmmakers had digitally shrunk Laura down in the same way others had for the Captain America movie, but they had somehow recreated the exact girl Jason had grown up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trailer quickly advanced with Laura playing the Jennifer Walters character, all business suits and seriousness until she is shot. Of course Bruce Banner is nearby (Jason noted the cameo by Mark Ruffalo and grinned) to debate the blood transfusion that could save and change her life. There was a quick cut and then Jennifer/Laura was shown waking up in the hospital but now the rail thin Laura was gone and Jason saw the one he had created: tall, perfectly tanned, ridiculously busty with the general physique of a female bodybuilder and disproportionately large arms. Shocked Jennifer Walters examines her new body, feels her boobs then flexes her 19 inch bicep and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a scene where Bruce Banner apologizes to his cousin for doing this to her and Jennifer responds, \"What are you sorry for? Look at me! I'm gorgeous, I healed right away, and I'm really strong.\" To which Bruce replies, \"But there's something else inside you now. Something dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow images of Jennifer, angry and in agony, flashed and the audience around Jason cheered. Slowly the Laura on screen went through her transformation and her skin turned green, her clothes bulged then ripped and She Hulk was born. Jason realized just how perfect Laura really was for the role because Laura's Hulk form was simply her using the muscle expansion ability Jason had programmed for her. The trailer launched into rapid cuts of Laura, big and green, jumping, smashing, roaring, and being a total bad ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything paused and Robert Downey Jr. appeared as Tony Stark talking to Bruce Banner, \"So now there's two green rage monsters. Who's idea was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanner solemnly replied, \"Are you telling me that if Pepper was in trouble, had shrapnel moving towards her heart you wouldn't install an arc reactor in her chest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll sure,\" Stark said cooly, then tapping the circle of light on his chest he added, \"but this thing is really cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice from behind him made Stark spin around to find Laura in her emerald glory. She had on her white suit with the purple highlights much like from the comics, \"I don't know, I think this is pretty cool.\" She raised an arm and flexed her 24 inch gun. \"Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother barrage of quick action cuts then a shot of She Hulk laying on the ground bench pressing some enormous object that was out of view. A woman's voice from off camera yelled, \"How many you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pressed out two more reps, her sizable muscles bulging and flexing. \"Four thousand, eight hundred and forty nine.\" Another rep, \"Forty eight fifty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling any strain yet?\" The mystery woman called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I guess so, a little.\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next shot was from far away which showed Laura and her friend in a dry dock and the object she was bench pressing was an enormous cargo ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's voice came over the speakers, \"Have you got anything bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen went black and the words \"She Hulk\" lingered on the screen while the audience cheered. Then the trailer cut back in and one last scene was shown, Bruce Banner and Jennifer Walters (Laura in her relaxed state) stood facing each other in the middle of an empty street separated by 100 or so feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanner yelled out, \"This has gone far enough. It has to end now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled. \"Cousin, I'm having way too much fun. You couldn't pay me to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have it your way.\" Banner and Jennifer began running at each other then both transformed into their respective jade monsters. As they neared each other they both cocked their fists ready to strike their opponent. Once they were inches from each other the screen went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire audience was on their feet, and the cheers only got louder when Laura emerged and took the stage. Laura looked incredible. She wore a sequined green dress that sparkled brilliantly. The scoop neckline revealed a fair amount of cleavage while the dress hugged her hips and waist like a second skin. The skirt reached all the way to Laura's ankles, but a long slit was cut and every now and then her thick, juicy legs were visible. She looked every bit the movie star and every bit gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason was struck by a feeling of panic. He couldn't figure out where the feeling came from, but it felt like the same source as the \"autopilot\" feeling he'd been experiencing that had been controlling his words and actions from time to time. Something about seeing Laura in person, perhaps the past that Vanessa had hinted at, was causing Jason to freak out. And he didn't know what to do about it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason tried to remain calm but as time passed he realized that this panicked feeling wasn't just going to go away. He had to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Laura began speaking to the crowd Jason stood and excused himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lied. \"Sure. I think I just ate too fast. I'll be right back.\" As he stood Vanessa gave him an \"I told you so\" look that didn't help matters in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside the dining room Jason made for the bathroom. He got some water from the sink and splashed it on his forehead. He found his breathing was getting easier but he was still no closer to understanding what was causing this mess. It was like he was having a reaction to memories he didn't even have. And all the while it felt as though there was something bigger looming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to calm himself he leaned against a wall and, to give his mind something to focus on, pulled out his phone. He opened the Alterations app which launched straight into his own profile. The same familiar message locking him out of changes due to a paradox appeared and he stuck his tongue out at the screen. This at least gave him a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his profile and opened Nikki's. Jason smiled warmly at the rendering of the vivacious redhead and instantly felt the remaining stress melt away. He pulled up her relationship chart and was not surprised to find himself right at the top. If he was reading the figures correctly she was absolutely crazy about him and he knew that he felt the same. Right then and there he decided he wanted to do something for her for being so good to him. He would use the app on her again, but he knew he had to be careful. He immediately found the temporal setting and took them from historical to instantaneous. No more messing with the past, there was too much potential to screw things up even more. But if he was going to change her in the present people would notice, it could raise dangerous questions. As it was he was amazed that no one found it particularly odd that he had apparently grown so big so fast. And that's when it hit him: he'd let her do the same<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason searched through the various menus for a few minutes looking for just the right option. He finally found it under \"aptitude\" in the subheading \"physical.\" There were several options he could play with, and he made a mental note to come back and make more adjustments later. The option he selected was Nikki's ability to build muscle. There was a slider and behind it was a graph showing the average person's muscle building ability. Nikki was actually below average and Jason was impressed that she'd been able to get her body as buff as it was in spite of this disadvantage. Jason slid the indicator higher and higher until her muscle building genetics were second to none. Now she would be able to get bigger faster than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason noticed the next slider down would adjust Nikki's aptitude to build her strength over time. Just as he had a moment ago he set this one higher so that her strength would grow rapidly in a short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tapped the \"apply changes\" button and was returned to Nikki's main profile page. He smiled as he imagined her physique and her power increasing over the next several weeks. It would be a somewhat slow process but he couldn't wait to see how excited Nikki would be when her workouts became so much more effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's stomach sank when he spotted Nikki's profile status as he had earlier in the day. The word \"expired\" was crossed out and \"active\" was next to it. Again Jason wondered how a profile could be expired and what that meant. Something about it seemed very strange to him and though he tried not to worry it kept pulling at his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason locked his phone and checked himself in the mirror before returning to the ballroom where he discovered he'd missed Laura's entire speech. Everyone was now wandering around schmoozing and chatting. He spotted Nikki, Vanessa, and Greg standing around Laura laughing. Jason was very aware of his breathing as he approached and felt no real hint of the panic he'd felt earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got close Laura spotted him and Jason thought her jaw was going to hit the floor. Laura's eyes went wide and she pushed Vanessa and Nikki out of the way to take in the full scope of her formally skinny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Jason?!? How can this be you?\" Laura shouted. Her sequined gown sparkled as she approached him and he had to try very hard not to stare at her soccer ball sized breasts. Fortunately her face was incredibly beautiful and could hold his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They told me I'd be surprised by how different you looked, but I had no idea you'd be this.. this.. big!\" Laura put her hands out and put them on Jason's arms and shoulders feeling his muscles to make sure they were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you, Laura?\" Jason asked hoping his voice didn't give away the fact that he just wanted to take Nikki home and forget this whole night. He felt like he was constantly playing catch-up and off his emotions were annoyingly fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great, but you're amazing. I can't get over how huge you are. I need to see you with your shirt off. Show me. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked past Laura to Nikki. He really didn't have any concerns showing off his body even in this crowded room, he was still excited about his muscles and enjoyed the stares. However he didn't want to make Nikki uncomfortable or make her think he was showing off for Laura's affection. When he met Nikki's eyes, though, it looked as though his concerns were unjustified. In fact she looked practically giddy to show off her hunk of a man. She nodded approvingly and gave Jason a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Laura said. \"Don't be shy. It's not a party until a buff guy goes shirtless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled and slid out of his jacket and tossed it onto a nearby table. Already Laura was getting excited, her eyes locked onto Jason's torso. He fiddled with his tie eventually removing it and beginning to undo his shirt buttons. Once his dress shirt was off Laura froze in stunned silence. Jason pushed the issue further, though, and removed his undershirt as well. Heads turned everywhere and people stopped their conversations to see Laura and this giant man. Jason tensed his chest and arms doing his best to make his massive body look even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura slowly put her hand out and touched Jason's meaty pectoral, first with her fingers, then her whole palm. She ran her hand down to Jason's abs then back up to his shoulders. \"Wow, just.. I don't think I've ever seen anyone this size before. And to think you were once that skinny little rail. Alright, let's compare. Who's got the bigger guns?\" Laura held her arm up and flexed her bicep, but the arm that grew wasn't just the huge 19 inch muscle that she ordinarily displayed but the expanded 24 and a half inch muscle that hid inside. The room went quiet as all eyes were now on Laura. For a moment Jason was taken aback by this muscular woman with the insanely disproportionate arm, even though he had essentially created her to be this way it was surreal to witness it in the flesh. \"Come on, let's see it.\" Laura spurred him on and gave her rock hard peak a few slaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged then raised his arm as well. He pumped his bicep a few times willing every possible inch to materialize. Finally he held his arm up to hers for comparison and, though they were pretty close Jason's arm was visibly larger. He wasn't sure why but this made him incredibly happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, too, seemed excited to have been bested. \"I've never met anyone that had arms bigger than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting bigger all the time,\" he said. \"I'm going to break 30 inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura raised an eyebrow. \"Well, well, well! You put on a little size and suddenly you're not the little geek I knew all those years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled, \"I'm still that geek. I just happened to have also found something else I'm really good at and and can put my mind to, and that's building muscle. I've done the math and I'm almost positive I will get my arms up to 30 or 31 inches. Not sure beyond that, but I'll try. And I don't say any of this to bolster my ego or to show off, it's just a fact. I've done pretty well, I think I look pretty good. My girlfriend is pretty impressed with my development and I'm incredibly proud of hers. But I'm still a geek. Just a very musclebound geek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood in silence for a brief moment then Jason heard a voice from behind him. \"Can I get a photo of you two for our write up of the party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking or waiting for Laura to respond Jason grabbed her around the waist and lifted her onto his shoulder. Even though she was a fairly big girl he found her light as a feather. He turned to find the cameraman with Laura perched on his left shoulder and flexed his right arm. Laura, though surprised for certain, played along well. She balanced easily on Jason's massive shoulder, crossed her legs allowing the slit of her dress to open wide and show off her sculpted thighs, and hit a double biceps pose expanding both of her arms to their maximum girth. The photographer took several shots while cameras behind him flashed off countless more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason set Laura down and was about to return to Nikki when Laura leaned in and whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd really like to talk to you alone.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura leaned in to Jason's ear and whispered, \"I'd really like to talk to you alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stepped back. \"Not tonight, Laura. Maybe you can call me sometime and we can catch up. Tonight I'm going to dance with my girlfriend.\" He found the discarded pieces of his tuxedo and found his bow tie. He tied it around his neck leaving his shirt and jacket behind so he looked like a super buff Chippendale dancer. He approached Nikki, wrapped his arm around her waist, and led her across the room to where there was a dance floor and a large group of people bouncing to the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had never danced in his life and was afraid his awkwardness would show, but he seemed to be doing ok. Girls everywhere were staring at him with hunger in their eyes while they shot Nikki the occasional jealous glance. Jason danced with both Nikki and Vanessa over the next two hours and would have even danced with Laura had she joined them. Instead she circled the room a time to two talking with a few people before vanishing entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were ready to leave Jason and Nikki said their goodbyes to Greg and Vanessa. Vanessa gave Jason a big hug and a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made it,\" she told him. \"You've come a long way. I'm proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said, truly appreciating the sentiment even if he didn't fully understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Jason made their way back to her car. Jason was still bare chested and carried the pieces of his tux in his arms. The cool ocean air felt good on his skin and his chest, back and arms broke out in goosebumps. Nikki saw the tiny bumps on his skin and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold, are we?\" She asked running her fingers over his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed her around the waist and pulled her body close to his. \"Not as long as you're here to keep me warm.\" He planted a firm kiss square on her lips while he sent his hands down her back to her firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki moaned approvingly, \"Thank you for a fun evening. I think you really knocked Laura off balance. She's not used to guys postponing her attention like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leaned against Nikki's car and shrugged. \"It's not a big deal. She's a person like anyone else, she's just got that crazy muscley trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your crazy muscley trick better.\" Nikki put her hands on Jason's pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Jason made his chest bounce up and down to Nikki's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got into Nikki's car and she drove to an old gym that looked like a family owned business. The place was dark and obviously closed for the night. She parked on the street and looked at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again,\" she said placing a hand on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't sure why they were stopping here so he made a joke hoping to find some truth. \"Care for a late night workout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's smile was electric and her green eyes sparkled. \"That's very tempting. I do know the guy who owns the building.\" Her hand moved up to Jason's bare chest. \"I'm sure I could convince him to let us in.\" She paused and her smile faded. \"But I'm afraid I have to work early and I don't have any work clothes at your place. But I'll take a rain check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was watching closely and when she said the words \"your place\" her eyes had darted to the windows above the gym. Jason looked up and spotted what must have been his apartment. Jason's frustration grew a bit; just this morning he had been living at home with his mother, how could he now be living in an apartment above a gym? And did he really own the building? A lot had changed when he'd bobbled his phone at the tailors today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about tomorrow?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jason said. \"I don't think I have anything on my schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed and Jason stepped out of the car. He stood on the sidewalk and waved as Nikki drove away then turned to face the mysterious building. He peered into the gym for a moment but didn't see anything distinctive or familiar about it. Instead he went to the door that led upstairs to the apartments above. At the top of the stairs Jason found four doors. There were two on opposite sides of him by the stairway and two more facing each other at the end of the hall. Jason fished his keys out of his pocket and found two that he was unfamiliar with. One was big and brass and looked too large to fit any of the doors before him. The other was smaller and silver and looked like a house key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood still and tried to will himself to know which door was the one to his apartment but couldn't remember. He supposed if he quietly guessed wrong the occupants wouldn't notice so he crept to the first door on his left and gingerly slid the key into the lock. He practically did a celebratory dance when the key turned and the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later he felt a bit silly because it became very apparent that it wouldn't have mattered which door he had tried. Yes, he must have owned the entire building because where there should have been a wall separating his apartment from the next there was instead open space that flowed right through. Jason walked down and turning a corner found a similar open space connecting the second apartment to the third one which then lead to the fourth. Instead of owning two one bedroom apartments and two two bedroom apartments he instead had one huge six bedroom apartment. The layout of the place meant that he had four separate kitchens (two of which seemed devoted solely to piles of beef and boneless chicken breasts) but to his pleasant surprise he found that two of the bathrooms had been combined so that it now had a giant sized shower that accommodated his enormous frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was filled bursting with everything Jason loved, everywhere there were movie poster and nerdy art all over the walls. Jason found one of the bedrooms had been turned into a reading room with tons of books and comics stocked on shelves from floor to ceiling. There were various figures and replicas including a full sized batsuit. Another bedroom had a massive plasma screen television hanging on the wall with couches and easy chairs spread around. Jason noticed a rather sophisticated sound system had been installed and the closet was packed with movies and video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing Jason didn't find anywhere was any weight equipment. At first he found it strange that someone with a body like his didn't at least keep some weights around. Then he found what looked to be his bedroom and remembered the complete gym below. In the corner opposite his giant king sized bed was an opening in the floor twice as big around as he was and a fire pole that gave direct access to the lower floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason slid down the pole and found himself at the back of the dark gym near a mirrored wall and rack after rack of free weights. He surveyed the place with pride then looked for a way back up to his home but didn't see one. He glanced back up at the opening in the ceiling that led to his bedroom and realized the way. Jason gripped the steel pole and began lifting himself up letting his legs dangle freely. He climbed hand over hand pulling his 300+ pounds with incredible ease until he was back on the second floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where I got the money for all of this, but this is pretty much the coolest life I could imagine.\" Jason told his reflection in a full body mirror that hung from the far wall. \"As annoying as it is to live constantly confused this house, this body,\" he flexed his towering biceps, \"and Nikki way more than make up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason suddenly felt very tired. He slid out of his pants and opted to sleep naked. He approached his bed and noticed a black hardbound book on the nightstand with a yellow post-it note attached to the cover. Written on the note in his own handwriting was a word very familiar to a computer nerd like himself: \"Readme.\" Jason flipped through the book and found it was a journal he'd been keeping. At last this could be exactly what he needed to get some more information about his own life. He was tempted to start reading right away but also felt like he should wait until the morning when he could focus better. But then it was always possible that if he didn't read now something would come up and he'd never be able to get caught up. And of course there was still some paradox looming that could possibly have effects on him and others; he thought back to the email that gave him the link to the Alterations app that mentioned exactly that. Did he still need to fix things? He thought so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's a mega buff hunk to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was going to put the journal down and just go to bed, but something about the post-it on the front made him think twice. \u201cReadme,\u201d it was as if the book was left there for him by someone who knew he would need help. Then he opened the front cover and a handwritten letter fell out that sent a shiver down his spine and led him to believe that\u2019s exactly why the book was there. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear whoever you may be,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last 6 months my life has become exponentially better but it has also become increasingly obvious that it is not my life. I was never supposed to have the body I have nor the fame that came with it. I\u2019m unnaturally strong, even for my size, and that power doesn\u2019t really belong to me. And then there\u2019s Nikki. I don\u2019t think <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom line is that you, whoever you are, have been getting closer and closer. You\u2019re here to take back the life that is yours. I\u2019ve been myself less and less and one day I\u2019ll be completely you. I\u2019ve become alright with that but you need to know that there\u2019s a bigger problem. This world is sick and I don\u2019t know what caused it or how to fix it. I\u2019ve left my journal for you so that it might help you figure out where things went wrong. I put a few notes on important events (and the ones I keep dreaming about) so that maybe you can see where things took a turn. I have my suspicions but I don\u2019t dare make them known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake care of Nikki for me. She\u2019ll need someone strong, both physically and spiritually, to face what\u2019s coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Jason\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason read the note over and over. It felt so impossible but it was clearly in his own handwriting and the description of becoming someone else mirrored the feelings he\u2019d been having of another person taking control. Perhaps it was just the echos of the Jason before fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe read through the journal but nothing really stood out to him as significant. It was clear that he had major crush on Laura, but who wouldn\u2019t with her body and abilities. It appeared that Laura never really returned the feelings and though she and Jason were friends they never dated or even kissed. One major change was the presence of Vanessa; now that she was into the more nerdy side of life she was a major part of their group. Apparently she and Jason had been a couple back when he was 15 and she was 16. A picture of the two of them at some school formal was tucked into the pages of the book and Jason looked at it with a huge smile; in it Jason wore a tux and was painfully skinny. Vanessa was fairly slender as well, not yet developing the juicy muscles that came from her time as a cheerleader or on the track team, though her breasts were already very well developed. Her tight dress accentuated the curves of her chest and put her cleavage on proud display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued to flip through the journal. There were a few spots that had been bookmarked with post-its and he opened to the first of these. Written on the yellow note were the words \u201cfirst meeting.\u201d The entry was from several years ago when he had been 14 years old and Laura 13. It outlined the story of how Laura and Jason had met Nikki. Apparently he and Laura had been walking home when Laura spotted Nikki who had fallen while crossing the street and was about to be run over by an oncoming truck. Laura, without even thinking, sprang into action, her muscles erupting on her tiny frame shredding her pants and ripping through her shirt. Laura managed to scoop up the injured Nikki and carry her to safety. Nikki was fine, though scared, and instantly became a part of their clique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason put the book down. Obviously he had no memories of that event since it had occurred in a different reality to his own but there was a strange familiarity to the story. Suddenly he remembered that when he had been in middle school he\u2019d heard about a girl who\u2019d been killed when she\u2019d been hit by a truck. He\u2019d never known her name but it was obvious that it had to have been Nikki. It was the only way to explain why he\u2019d never known her. He put the book down and rolled over to find his phone. He opened the Alterations app and pulled up Nikki\u2019s profile. He spotted the status once more, \u201cexpired\u201d crossed out and \u201cactive\u201d next to it. He nodded. \u201cHello paradox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spent nearly two hours going through the journal trying to find some sort of evidence that he was wrong, instead he found the opposite. There was another post-it bookmark on an entry dated a little less than a year ago. The post-it had the note \u201cDeja vu\u201d written on it. Jason gathered that by this time he and Nikki were dating and while the two of them were walking around town with Laura and Vanessa Nikki fell into the street and was nearly run over by a truck. Just as before Laura, with her enhanced strength, was able to save the redhead from harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d Jason said aloud collecting his thoughts, \u201cclearly in my reality Nikki was dead but in this one, where Laura was strong enough to save her, she\u2019s alive. That\u2019s not really a paradox though, it is? I mean the coincidence of nearly being hit by a truck twice is clear and perhaps the universe really is trying to correct itself, but that\u2019s still not a paradox. Right?\u201d He looked across the room to his reflection in the floor to ceiling mirror but received no comfort. Each prospect was scary: either NIkki being alive was the problem and he was destined to lose her or there was something even bigger looming. He returned to the book to see if any other clues could be garnered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few entries were pretty bland but then a few days after Laura had saved Nikki for the second time Jason found a page of text that could have only been written in anger. Scratched out words, foul language, and stabbing penmanship let him know that something big had gone down. The only phrase that Jason could make out was \u201cThank god that fucking bitch is gone from our lives for good.\u201d There wasn\u2019t another entry until 5 days later at which point Laura was never mentioned again. It seemed a safe assumption that this was the falling out he and Laura had gone through that led everyone else to walk on eggshells at the gala earlier in the evening, and likely the same one that had caused his strange panic attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ready a little more finding entries from 6 months ago when he and NIkki had started working out together. He smiled to himself as he read, \u201cI know that I probably won\u2019t be able to get very big or strong but I told Nikki that I want to be able to protect her should she need it. I guess every little bit helps and who know\u2019s, maybe someday I can be as big as Greg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that he had received plenty of answers, some of which he could do without, Jason closed the journal and lay down. Images of his beautiful Nikki in various forms of danger floated through his mind and sleep was a long time in coming.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though Jason didn't fall asleep until nearly 3 in the morning he was awake again at around 6:30 feeling refreshed and energized. He leapt out of bed and stood before the large mirror opposite his bed examining his massive naked body in the dim light of early morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter performing a few flexes and verifying that his muscles weren't just a dream Jason spoke to himeslf. 'Surprising that I feel so awake. I would think a body this size would need lots of food energy to power it.' As if in response his stomach growled like a rusty chainsaw. He put his hand on his brick sized abs and felt the vibrations of an empty stomach behind them. 'Very well, then. Let's see what we have.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew what he was doing Jason had walked directly to one of his four kitchens, removed an extra large skillet from a cupboard and placed it on the stove, and fetched a palette containing 3 dozen eggs. His body was on autopilot again but he was aware of it and somehow it was alright. He found that if he concentrated he could regain control but when he relaxed again the other Jason, the one that was becoming an echo, would take over. Jason let his body set to work cracking eggs into a large bowl one after another after another. Soon all 36 eggs were in the bowl and Jason gave them a quick scramble then poured them into the skillet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his massive pile of scrambled eggs began to cook Jason watched his own body return to the refrigerator to get another carton of eggs (this time a mere dozen) after which he got a large glass. With growing dread he watched himself crack all 12 raw eggs into the glass whereupon he lifted the glass to his lips and guzzled the whole gross cocktail down. Once done with that he returned to the stove and finished cooking his breakfast then ate it directly out of the skillet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was just about wolfing down the last of his pile of food a voice spoke from behind him nearly causing him to jump out of his skin. 'You know I love it when you just happen to forget to put clothes on and cook in the nude, but as my employer aren't you afraid that I'll bring some sort of a sexual harassment suit against you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to face the source of the voice and found a gorgeous Asian woman in a light blue suit with a short skirt. The woman stood about 5 feet 6 inches tall in white high heels, her black hair tied in a tight bun on her head and held in place by two ebony sticks. Under the blue jacket she wore a white button up shirt that was open at the top down to her modest B cup breasts and Jason could also see a pretty well developed set of pectorals in the open section of her shirt. Because of the suit she wore Jason couldn't really get an idea of the rest of the woman's upper body physique, but her skirt displayed legs that were insanely developed. Her thighs were probably at least 28 or 29 inches around while her calves, aided by her high heeled shoes, popped to a solid 22 inches. Jason's first thought upon seeing the woman, based on her appearance, the color palette of her clothes and muscular legs, was 'Chun Li;' his second thought was 'just when I think I've got a handle on things another mystery person arrives.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason realized that, in his panic and surprise, he had retaken control of his own body and now had been standing silently for a good 10 seconds or so. The woman was beginning to look panicked at Jason's lack of reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith mounting fear she sputtered, 'I.. You know I'm not really going to sue you. I mean.. it's your home you can be naked.' She was backing up now, her face turning beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was counter intuitive (especially with a gorgeous sexy bodybuilder in his home) Jason relaxed and attempted to switch back into autopilot but found himself unable. Perhaps things were now too 'off the rails' for the other Jason to be involved. Instead he raised his hands to calm the woman. 'You're fine,' he said, 'you just startled me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman continued backing up until she plopped down into an easy chair where she let out a deep sigh. 'I'm sorry,' she said putting her head in her hands, 'I've had a shitty morning. For a minute I thought I was about to get fired to boot. I still wake up not entirely sure why in the world I'm your personal assistant, I can hardly keep my own life in line much less someone else's.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dropped his dirty dishes in the sink then walked towards the woman. 'Would it make you feel better if I put some clothes on?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up with a sly grin and ran her eyes around Jason's naked body. 'Actually, I much prefer you this way.' Then she stood and straightened her clothes, 'However, since you have a girlfriend perhaps you should cover yourself. It'll go a little way to reducing my unrelenting urge to jump your beefy body at every opportunity.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed, 'Sounds like you may end up with a countersuit if you keep things up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystery woman laughed, 'It'll be worth it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went into his room to look for some clothes while his apparent assistant called to him from the other room. 'You're running a bit behind today, aren't you? It's almost 7:45, shouldn't you be in the gym pumping those gorgeous muscles of yours?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at the clothes he had grabbed, denim shorts and a t-shirt, and realized that if he were supposed to be working out this outfit wouldn't do. He tossed them aside and instead fished out some lycra shorts and a tank top. 'Yeah, well, I had a late night.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh right,' she said, 'how was the party? Was Laura there?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason returned to the living room. 'Yeah, but I didn't talk to her much. I mainly just danced with the girls.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's assistant was holding an iPad in her hand and flipping through various bits of information. 'Lucky girls,' she said glancing up. A second later her smile vanished as she got down to business, 'Ok, not a whole lot to do today, just a public appearance at the gym downtown and a photo shoot for Flex. I was able to convince the magazine people to go to the gym and shoot there so you only really have one stop after your workout. You're not due to appear downtown until 1:00, but you'd better get downstairs and hit the machines, your public awaits.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded though he wasn't entirely sure what she meant by 'his public.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sure you remember,' she said just before he turned to leave, 'but today is leg day. My favorite.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're welcome to join me, if you like.' He glanced down at her massive quads which she flexed seductively for him, 'I'm sure you'd have little trouble keeping up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman grinned. 'Wanna see something cool?' Before Jason could answer she kicked off her shoes and stood barefoot before him now. No longer aided by her high heels she stood a slight 5 feet 3 inches which only served to make her beefy legs look more impressive. Then, with her right foot planted firmly on the floor, she lifted her left leg, fully extended, off the ground and slowly raised it to 90 degrees. She held this pose for several seconds before then raising her leg straight up into the air hitting 180 degrees. Her skirt rode up exposing her white lace panties but she didn't mind; and since Jason had just recently been fully nude he supposed it didn't matter much. Her moves were swift and confident and she moved with strength that almost made her look like a machine. Her thigh on her planted leg bulged incredibly but otherwise she held her perfect split with stunning ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her torso and wrapped her arms around her left leg, pulling herself to it and caressing her gorgeous muscles. 'I did ballet for years and years, you know that, and in all that time I could do moves like this but barely. My legs would shake, my balance would be off, it would really hurt. But since I started training here a few months ago my legs have exploded, both in size and strength. I can easily do moves that I struggled with previously.' She pointed the toes of her left foot at the ceiling then, incredibly, stood herself up on her toes on her right foot causing her calf and quads to solidify into steel. While still on her toes she let go of her left leg, tilted her torso downward, then wrapped her arms around her right leg. She slid her hands along the incredible swells of her quads down to the crazy cleft of her calf muscle touring the chiseled contours with her slender fingers. 'Before you hired me I never would have thought I'd be able to do this. Now I feel like I could hold this pose all day.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowed her leg back to 90 degrees and lifted her upper body back up. While still on her toes she swung her leg in and performed a quick pirouette, then bowed for Jason. 'Pretty cool, right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was speechless; the power and flexibility required to do what he had just witnessed boggled his mind. Instead he could only nod vigorously. Finally he got his words unstuck and let out an, 'Amazing!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thanks,' the woman said. 'Now, get downstairs and start pumping your legs. I've got some work to do up here, but you don't want to keep everyone waiting.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason reentered his bedroom and approached the fire pole that led to his private gym. He still didn't know what she was talking about but even more frustrating he still didn't know her name. However the first mystery was solved when he slid down the pole and found....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason landed in the darkened gym ready to test his strength. He knew that his assistant, or whoever that was, had told him it was \u201cleg day\u201d but Jason didn\u2019t know the first thing about working out, much less a leg routine for someone his size. He intended to pump his muscles, move some heavy weights and see if he could wrap his brain around what, if anything, he should do about Nikki. Then he stepped around a corner and was greeted with a roar of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time this morning Jason nearly leapt out of his own skin but he did his best not to let it show. Lined up on the sidewalk outside the gym all along the giant window was a crowd of 50 or more people cheering and applauding his appearance. Most of his audience was female, though a good third was made up of men carrying Mr. Olympia levels of muscle. A handful of people carried signs professing their admiration for Jason\u2019s size and there were even two signs requesting his hand in marriage, both held by gorgeous women who, until very recently, Jason would have given an arm to just speak to. One of these would-be fiances was a statuesque blonde in a skimpy bikini who was pressing her enormous breasts up against the window while giving him a sultry stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed at his own celebrity. Last night at the movie event he was a bit of an unknown to the national paparazzi who were only there to snap photos of Laura, but here in his own gym he was a local heartthrob. With a growing grin he hit a double biceps pose putting his mammoth 26 inch guns on proud display. The reaction from the bystanders was electric. The trouble was that as Jason relaxed his arms he realized that he had no idea what he was supposed to do. His plans to just coast through a fake workout were shot now that he had people watching and besides that was he supposed to let them in or did they just stand outside in the cool morning?  The poor girl in the bikini\u2019s nipples were so hard Jason was surprised she wasn\u2019t leaving scratch marks in the glass. Fortunately Jason began to feel the familiar sense of autopilot in the back on his mind and this time when he relaxed he was able to let himself fall into it. <i>I must be back in my routine enough to fall in line with the other Jason\u2019s routine</i>, he thought to himself. The idea reminded him of the synchronization aspect of the Assassins Creed games he\u2019d played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was functioning on automatic Jason watched with interest as he began his routine. He expected to begin straight away on the machines but instead he found himself moving to a large open area where he began a long series of stretches followed by an intense aerobic set. Though he had relinquished control of his body he could still feel everything that was happening and kept waiting for the strain of fatigue to wash over him but it never did. In fact, the more the moved the more energy flooded his muscles. After 45 minutes of an ever changing mix of squats, push ups, jumping jacks, lunges, dips, twists, sprints and tons of other exercises than he couldn\u2019t hope to name Jason felt like he was brimming power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he went to the leg machines which, he now realized, had been modified from their original design. Standard machines would have a series of cables running to a stack of weights, this one had nine additional stacks behind the first and a complex system of cables and pulleys running among them. Jason sat down, locked his legs into place, sucked in a deep breath and lifted. Out of the corner of his eye he could see six of the ten stacks raise off the floor. His heart soared then the crowd outside the gym cheered his feat and he grew even more excited. He tried to get a look at how much weight he was lifting but he couldn\u2019t without retaking control and he didn\u2019t want to lose the ability to slip back out again. Jason completed several sets with the current setup then got up and added half of the seventh stack before completing several more. Jason watched with glee as his quads ballooned outward to obscene size while his veins throbbed on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the leg curls Jason moved on to the squat machine. This too had been modified to allow for way more weight to be added than normal though Jason still didn\u2019t even have a ballpark figure on how much he was lifting. Jason continued moving from modified machine to modified machine performing lifts that should have been impossible then adding a little more for good measure. This went on for over 3 straight hours and by the end Jason\u2019s thighs and calves were swollen, sweaty, pulsing and pumped beyond belief. Every step, every move sent quivering shockwaves through his quads and for the first time since becoming a beefy hunk Jason felt muscle fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of his spectators had left but those who were committed to the 4 hour show remained as excited as they had been at the start. Jason fetched a tape measure from the decommissioned check-in counter. It was clear that no one had worked there in a very long time confirming Jason\u2019s belief that only he and perhaps a select few others were allowed admittance. He approached the large window and realized that now the gender mix was a bit more 50/50 but the men and women were standing in two separate pods away from each other. Jason approached the group of women where about 12 remained. He got up close to the window where everyone could see him and pulled the leg of his shorts up as high as he could. Then he wrapped the tape measure around the thickest part of his leg and flexed marking the circumference with his thumb. Then he walked up and down showing each person that his pumped up leg measured 36 inches around. He could see most of the ladies beginning to breathe more heavily has he passed them, and he ended with the tall blonde who was still holding her sign proposing marriage. Jason realized that he must show off his measurements often because the woman looked at the tape measure with a grin then pulled an index card out of her bikini that read \u201c36G-28-34\u201d then winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I told you about taunting that poor woman?\u201d A familiar female voice called from behind Jason and he noticed the group of male spectators were pointing into the gym behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason turned and found Vanessa standing on the open aerobic mat with her hips cocked to one side. Her blonde hair was tied back in a pony tail and she wore a purple unitard that covered her torso but was cut like a bikini bottom to show off her long, toned legs. She wore white sneakers which combined with the purple suit made her think of She Hulk. Jason\u2019s mind floated back to the previous night a for a split second he wondered what Laura had wanted to talk to him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of your fans are just that, but I get a bad feeling about that one.\u201d Vanessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d Jason said motioning to the group of men which was beginning to grow. Apparently this was a regular occurrence, perhaps they should look into charging admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be careful, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s not like these jokers know where I live.\u201d She smiled then blew a kiss to her drooling pack of onlookers. Then before Jason could say anything further Vanessa took in a deep breath and closed her eyes. Then she grimaced and stressed her body. Jason wanted to ask what she was doing but remained on autopilot and instead just held his ground. Finally she let her breath out with a frustrated burst and yelled, \u201cDamnit!! One of these days I\u2019m going to figure out how she does that all on her own.\u201d Then Vanessa walked around to a barbell loaded with five huge plates on both sides. She stood behind it and readied herself before bending down and getting a firm grip on either side of the bar. Next she squatted and stood lifting the weight off the ground. As she did her entire body exploded outward in all directions and suddenly she went from being merely toned to a full blown female bodybuilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jason had to exert serious control to keep from freaking out and pushing the other Jason out. Instead he just kept thinking, <i>Holy shit! She can grow like Laura!</i> The men outside the gym were howling with approval while Vanessa dropped the barbell then walked around pumping her freshly expanded muscles. She wasn\u2019t nearly as large as her younger sister but Vanessa had catapulted past Nikki\u2019s mass landing easily in the middleweight bodybuilder class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will never understand how Laura got her muscles to be so pliable that she can just make them shrink and grow like nothing.\u201d Vanessa said flexing 17 inch biceps that minutes ago were barely 13 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jason countered, \u201cjust be glad that the Freaky Friedman Flex was passed to you at all. There are thousands of people out there, women and men, who would kill to be able to do what you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, I know. I guess the grass is just always greener.\u201d She approached Jason then wrapped her arms around him in a big hug. She kissed his cheek then said, \u201cThank you for helping me discover who I really am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jason found himself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you\u2019d better get back upstairs before Chun Li up there spinning bird kicks your ass to China.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jason was fully shocked into silence. He\u2019d only joked to himself that she was Chun Li, could that really be her name? \u201cUh... what?\u201d he stammered no longer on autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Joy? Your assistant? The Asian ballerina with legs beefier than mine? She told me to get your ass back upstairs so you can get going wherever you need to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. Apparently he and Vanessa just had the same sensibilities and humor. \u201cRight, Joy. Ok.\u201d He was also glad to finally have a name for the mystery woman upstairs. \u201cHave a good workout.\u201d He said giving Vanessa a slap on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed the fire pole back up to his apartment while Vanessa began an aerobic routine similar to his own. Once there he found Joy placing a large platter containing a mountain of boneless chicken breasts on the dining room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat quick,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to shower that stink off of you before we get to your appearance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word Jason sat down and began two fisting chicken into his mouth. He watched Joy float around him cleaning and arranging things in his home. She had removed her blue jacket and, though the still had a long sleeved blouse on, Jason could now see that her upper body, while muscular, was nowhere near as developed as her legs. He took great pleasure watching her thighs and calves move and flex as she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe vanished from the room for a moment then returned from Jason\u2019s bedroom holding his iPhone. \u201cHere, you have a text message. Looks like it\u2019s from...\u201d</span></div></div>",

He arrives to see Joy looking through his closet finding, presumably to find an outfit for the shoot.  He couldn't believe his luck.  As he stood there staring at his assistant's calves bulging while she was on her toes, he began to doubt whether he should even consider fixing the paradox.  Who would benefit?  Laura is a movie star, Vanessa seems happier than ever and he's surrounded by the most gorgeous and muscular women in the world.  Not to mention Nikki is alive and he gets to be in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis deep thought is broken by Joy turning from the closet to catch him staring.  She smiled and looked him up and down in turn, settling on his now thick erection. \"You know I'm flattered, and I have you to owe for this,\" She flexed every muscle in her legs hard, making them appear even bigger than before, \"But you have got to get moving.\"  She threw him his clothes and a wink before exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Jason slides into autopilot.  Time seems to fly as he gets dressed, gets into Joy's car, then walks into the downtown branch of his gym.  He made his pleasantries with people as he made his way through.  There were people of all kinds, but most were of the hardcore bodybuilder variety.  As he made his way to the area set aside for his photo op, he finds...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The crowd parted as Jason made his way to where the magazine photographer had set his lights for the shoot. Jason found himself face to face with a familiar buff beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there stud muffin.\" Laura said with an enormous smile. She wore super tight Lycra shorts and a tank top that would have been loose were it not for her enormous breasts which were crammed in. The lower part of her top hung like a curtain occasionally flapping one was or another just enough to show off her shredded abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Jason asked with more contempt than he intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to see your personal appearance. I even bought a ticket. See?\" She held her ticket up for him to see then proceeded to seductively slip it into her cleavage for safe keeping. \"And I'd still like to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed. \"Right, look I don't have time right now I'm on the photographers time. You know how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do! I've been in my fair share of photo shoots; you go get to work. I'll just stand here and drool. We'll talk another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason left Laura and found the photographer. They talked for a minute or two about the sort of shots he was going for then a nervous young girl approached to apply makeup to Jason's body and fix his hair. He removed his shirt and for a moment thought the makeup girl was going to faint. As she went about her job Jason talked with her to calm her nerves. By the time she was finishing with him she was all smiles. He asked her name and she glowingly told him it was April. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next half an hour Jason followed the direction of the photographer while they took more pictures than he ever imagined could be taken. Nonetheless he was feeling good, his body was super pumped and he was eliciting a steady stream of cheers from the gathered bodybuilders and fans. By this time Laura had made her way right to the front of the crowd and was standing right behind the photographer. At one point she said something to him and he spun around, his face lighting up when he spotted the movie star. Jason heart sank when he realized that Laura and this man, who's name was Jerry, had worked together several times in the past. Seconds later Jerry was insisting that Laura join Jason in the shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura playfully denied the opportunity but only halfheartedly and only for a moment. When she agreed and thunderous applause washed over the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh.. didn't bring any posing suits for a woman.\" April, who was also apparently in charge of wardrobe, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, sweetie.\" Laura said. \"I'm prepared.\" She slid off her shorts to reveal a green thong bikini beneath. Then she pulled the front of her tank top forward and peered down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh!\" Laura announced playfully. \"Looks like I only wore my bottoms today. Oh well, I guess you'll just have to get creative, Jerry.\" She whipped her top off then quickly scooped one arm around her enormous bosom and squished her boobs so tight that they were spilling over her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't just angry, he was livid. But he refused to let Laura know it. He knew she was trying to get back at him for snubbing her last night but he wouldn't give her the satisfaction. He continued the shoot following Jerry's every command. They went through every pose twice, once with Laura in her bodybuilder size then again in her expanded size. Jason was doing everything he could to keep his erection in check and his anger helped him through much of this, but towards the end he was asked to pose with Laura in front of him with his arm wrapped around her otherwise naked breasts. As he held her close to his chest Laura subtlety ground her butt into his crotch. Then after a few pictures were snapped she expanded her body still wrapped in his arms and Jason nearly came in his shorts. The feeling was so incredible, so erotic that he could hardly stand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done Jason promptly excused himself and absconded to his private workout area in the back of the gym. Here there was some random equipment intended to give him a bit of a pump but it was nothing like what he had back at home. He expected it to be empty so he was a bit surprised to find Joy sitting in a chair with a beefy hunk on his knees next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had lifted the hem of her already short skirt up to her white lace underwear and had one of her insanely muscular legs straight out with her quads and calf fully flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so thick,\" the man was saying while planting kisses on her thigh. \"And hard. They're like steel.\" He squeezed her calf as hard as he could, the entire muscle filling up his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was purring, her eyes closed and her head back. \"Mmmmmm, I know. I love them so much.\" She slid her fingers through the grooves and around the swell of her other thigh. \"I just want them bigger and harder and stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular man's excitement increased and he began biting and sucking on her massive quad causing Joy to moan louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to be alone, please.\" Jason said startling Joy and her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian beauty stood and slid her skirt back down. \"Come on, we'd better go. The boss is pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was alone Jason picked up a weight bar and quickly removed the plates from either side. He then used the whole thing like a staff and began beating an old weight machine in the back of the room. The clang of metal to metal was deafening with every strike but he didn't care. He kept swinging until the bar in his hands was bent in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking in a deep breath and letting it out slowly he felt a little better, enough to face Laura again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason exited the back room to find...</span></div></div>",

Jason made his way back over to the photographer to find out where Laura was.  He figured he might as well get this conversation out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, man.\" The photographer apologized. \"You just missed her.  She batted her eyes at the biggest dude she could find and they hurried out of here.\"  The guy looked impressed that she could landed whoever she wanted in a heartbeat and a little jealous that it wasn't him.  \"Lucky guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was kind of annoyed that she would speed off, but was mostly relieved.  It was probably for the best to avoid her right now anyway; he was still a little heated.  He headed out to the car to head home.  On his way to the door, he caught a glimpse of himself in a full length mirror, still bare chested from the photo shoot, and had no choice but to cheer up.  A couple of days ago he was a scrawny nerd that could barely function socially, now he was a veritable god walking among the beautiful people that he used to be terrified of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see through the window that Joy was in the car already.  Although she was the only person he could see, she clearly wasn't alone in the vehicle as she seemed to be... enjoying herself quite thoroughly. Her head was back and she was sucking on her lower lip hard. The bun in her hair had been loosened and she ran one of her hands through her scalp grabbing fistfuls of hair. When he realized her other hand was inside her own shirt tweaking her nipple he began to feel a little too much like a peeper and turned his back to the window.  Being in a considerably better mood than earlier, Jason decided that he'd let her finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Jason spotted the same guy she was with earlier get out of the car and head to his own.  Jason gave her a little while longer to come down from her high before going out and dropping down in the passenger seat.  \"Looks like you got to have some fun.\" He said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was fixing her hair, her bun fully ruined she was settling for a loose ponytail. She let out a burst of laughter, \"Saw that did you? I couldn't help myself.  That shoot you two did got me all hot and bothered.\" As she spoke she kept her eyes locked on Jason's enormous chest. \"I caught that guy staring at my legs and had to act on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool.  And I don't blame him!\" Jason stated as he grabbed her thigh. Joy flexed for him and he squeezed her ultra shredded quadriceps. They was harder than he had expected, much harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy blushed nervously and started the car. He realized his hand had started to linger, but he didn't move it.  What was he doing? Was he flirting?</span></div></div>",

Actually he found himself rubbing it more intensely attempting to dig his fingers into the thick cords of sinew beneath her smooth skin and finding no give whatsoever.  He then had an amazing realization.  Unlike Laura, Vanessa, Nikki, and himself, he had never altered Joy.  The massive shredded quads under his fingers had been built completely of her own ability. This turned him on even more and he gave her a hungry look that she returned. Joy realized what that look meant and without a word she started the car and raced back towards Jason's home. The whole way Jason felt up her thigh occasionally sliding his fingers in between her legs and under the hem of her skirt teasing at her crotch. Joy would growl angrily when Jason would invariably move his strong fingers back down away from her sex towards her knee but Jason only laughed at her frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home Joy leapt from the driver's seat and practically climbed over the hood to get at Jason. The big man scooped her up and she wrapped her powerful legs around his middle. Deciding his apartment was too far away Jason kicked the door to the gym open, not bothering to open the lock, and carried the Asian beauty through the rows of modified equipment as they made out furiously.  Pinning her against a mirror over the free weights, she tightened her massive thighs around his waist and began to squeeze.  Jason's body was augmented by a magic device and superhumanly strong, yet somehow, her naturally muscular legs were beginning to squeeze his air out.  And she did it with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that grin for?\" He asked between vicious kisses and bites to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.  Just that I'm so powerful that last squeeze winded you a bit.  Don't deny it, I noticed.  I barely even tried.\"  With that she growled and gave a quick scissor to his midsection at full strength that caused him to stand straight up and stagger to a nearby bench.  Joy rode him the whole way and pushed him flat onto his back when he landed. She reached behind herself and pulled the waistband of his gym shorts down then she reached into his underwear deftly removing Jason's gargantuan member.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joy touched squeezed his pole Jason suddenly remembered Nikki; she was his girlfriend but here he was having sex with another woman. Guilt washed over him and he was about to stop but what kept him going was the feel of autopilot that had been guiding him all day. Oddly it was egging him on, sex with Joy was the natural choice. So, instead of worrying he spurred her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe aimed the head of his penis at her hot snatch where it was quickly made clear that she wore no panties beneath her skirt. Jason assumed she had removed them for the friend she'd made at the gym earlier. Joy wasted no time pressing herself down onto Jason's giant shaft and and riding him intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, for his part, was having the time of his life. Considering his new size and strength he had never expected to be dominated by a woman like this, but as his hands roamed the clefts in the gorgeous legs that had pinned him down he realized he also didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy reached up and grabbed the bar above the bench to get added leverage on her thrusts and it worked, throwing her into superhuman orgasms within moments. Jason grabbed her white blouse and ripped it apart sending buttons flying all over the place. As he'd suspected her upper body was rife with muscular development but only a fraction of that of her lower body. He grabbed her bra (the other half of the white lace set) and ripped the cups apart freeing Joy's modest B cup breasts then grabbed them roughly. She began to writhe side to side on his crotch, the feeling was so incredible that Jason's penis erupted within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy laid her head down on Jason's heaving chest and rested for a moment. After a few minutes of shared bliss, Joy climbed off of her stallion and Jason allowed himself to close his eyes and bask in the glory that was his new life.  When he opened his eyes and sat up he found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason snapped awake. He was still lying prone on the bench press with his shorts around his thighs. He sat up and gathered his thoughts spotting the remnants of his lovemaking session with Joy scattered on the floor: a torn shirt, buttons, a bra, Joy's skirt. He didn't remember removing that last one and assumed that she must have taken it off after they were done and he'd fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long had he slept? Must have been at least an hour or two considering the soreness in his back and shoulders. The weight bench did not make for a comfortable bed, especially when your frame was as wide as Jason's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and pulled his shorts back up before stretching his aching muscles. The stiffness melted away quickly and he surveyed the gym for Joy. Considering her lust for bigger and bigger leg muscles he half expected to find her grinding out squats or leg curls but she was no where to be seen. Jason made his way to the fire pole that led to the second floor and climbed up savoring how effortlessly his pulled his giant body up. Just days earlier Jason had been in gym class struggling to perform a single pull up and now he was a super powered dynamo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his bedroom he noticed that out the window the sun was just sinking below the horizon leading him to believe that he'd napped for several hours not just one or two. Perhaps Joy had left for the day, he couldn't very well expect her to just hang out all night waiting for him to come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason heard a loud voice from somewhere in his oversized apartment causing him to jump. Someone was yelling and it sounded like Nikki, though he couldn't make out what she was saying. Perhaps Joy was still around. Perhaps she was still naked and Nikki figured out what they had done. Now the guilt that Jason had pushed aside earlier came flooding back. How could he even look his girlfriend in the face after fucking another girl? He didn't deserve her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exited his own bedroom and began stalking through the house trying to find the source of the yelling while not really wanting to. Another burst of words shot through the air and though he still couldn't make them out but there was no mistaking it was Nikki's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the darkening apartment Jason spotted a door that was cracked open and light was pouring out from inside. As he got closer Jason spotted shadows inside dancing back and forth. Then Nikki's voice rang out loud and clear, \"COME ON!! YOU THINK YOU'RE SO STRONG? WHERE'S THAT POWER NOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were fighting. Jason knew that this was all his fault and he would never forgive himself if either girl got hurt. Knowing he had to put a stop to their fight and take whatever punishment he was due Jason rushed forward and pushed the door open. He expected to see Nikki and Joy with their hands at each other's throats, instead he found Nikki on her back in bed with Joy's head buried between her legs. Both girls were completely naked and Joy was licking Nikki's vagina with intense fervor. Nikki wrapped her legs around Joy's head and bucked her hips wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON!!\" Nikki shouted, \"USE THOSE MUSCLES!! MAKE ME COME!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy wrapped her strong arms around Nikki's thighs and hugged her hips pressing her head harder into Nikki's crotch. Nikki responded to the extra effort by grabbing fistfuls of Joy's dark hair with both hands and guiding her to all the right spots. Jason watched dumfounded as Nikki continued to writhe around, her breathing getting faster and faster. Finally Nikki arched her back and let out a massive scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!!\" A few moments later Nikki relaxed her legs and released Joy who collapsed on the bed. Nikki continued to pant, \"Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki moaned and rolled onto her side finally spotting Jason who was still frozen in the doorway. She laughed and flopped onto her back again. \"Uh oh, we've been discovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked back and grinned at Jason. \"Hey boss. Nikki was feeling a little left out so I took it upon myself to help her out. You know, since you were otherwise indisposed. Hope you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look how hard his dick is. He doesn't mind at all.\" Nikki sat up and put her hand on the side of Joy's face and looked into her eyes. \"You deserve a bonus.\" Nikki planted a long hard kiss on Joy's lips then leapt out of bed. The hardbodied redhead strode over to Jason and pressed her naked body up against his and began kissing his chest. It felt as if Nikki were radiating heat and it only turned him on further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking Joy out to dinner tonight.\" Nikki said. \"Then the three of us are going to go dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" Jason moaned more than spoke. Nikki was now grinding her rock hard stomach against his erection and even though he didn't care much for dancing his will had turned to mush. <i>Besides</i>, he thought, <i>I had a pretty good time dancing with Nikki and Vanessa last night.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading his thoughts Nikki said, \"Perhaps I'll give Vanessa a call and see if she's up for meeting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason was cold since Nikki spun on her heel to face Joy. \"Come on, thunder thighs. Let's go get ready.\" The girls left the room arm in arm and Jason made his way to the extra large bathroom to clean himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after he stepped into the shower he felt something along with the hot water on his body: a pair of hands. No two. He turned to find that he'd been joined by Nikki and Joy and the trio spent the next few minutes wordlessly soaping each other and rubbing their bodies together. Jason's lust was bordering on out of control and just as he was about to lose it and push one or both of the girls agains the wall for a hard fucking Nikki turned the water off and vanished with Joy still at her side. Just before she left the room she glanced back and shot Jason a sly grin that said she knew exactly what she was doing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found some clothes laid out for him on his bed, a pair of gray slacks and a white button up shirt, both of which fit over his massive muscles snugly. He finished getting ready and plopped down on the couch in the main living room to watch TV and wait for the girls. He very quickly got impatient and began wandering around the giant apartment continuing to take in his strange, new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite by accident he came across Joy and Nikki. The redhead was in one of the smaller bathrooms where she apparently kept makeup and various other styling implements while Joy was just across the hall in a bedroom getting dressed. Jason decided to just remain where he was and listen to their conversation; the more info he could glean about this reality the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad we can take you out, Joy.\" Nikki called across the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Joy said. Jason could just spot her through the cracked door as she sorted through a surprising selection of clothes. \"Oh! This will be a great chance to wear my new pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy pulled a pair of black leather pants out of the closet. \"That's the one problem with my figure,\" she said, \"I have to get everything tailored to fit a 30 inch waist and 27 inch thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki let out a burst of laughter. \"Are you actually complaining?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy slid into the pants. \"Are you saying you don't have trouble finding clothes that fit your body?\" Jason could see her checking the fit of her new garment in the mirror and frowning. \"Oh no.\" She pulled at the fabric around her thighs and found the pants a bit loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh... yeah.\" Joy was glancing around. Even through the cracked door Jason could see the gears turning in her head. He could tell she was going to leave the room and he didn't want her to know he'd been listening so he moved swiftly back to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Joy emerged from the hall just behind him and crept across the living room. Jason pretended to be watching TV as Joy entered his own bedroom then came back out seconds later only to return to the bedroom she'd been dressing in. Curious about what was going on Jason returned to his spying spot. The door was almost entirely closed but he was still able to see inside if he got close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's heart leapt into his throat. <i>Is that my phone?</i> Sure enough Joy was holding onto an iPhone tapping away quickly at the screen. A moment later she turned her attention away from the phone and onto her legs. Jason spotted motion and realized that she must have grabbed his phone because her spectacular legs were expanding even further filling the space in the ill fitting pants. The sound of Joy moaning with pleasure mixed with that of stretching leather as Joy's quads took up the last bits of room and the pants became tight enough for Jason to make out every bulge  and valley in her incredible thighs through the thin material. She gave her thighs a few cursory flexes and though they protested her pants held together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy turned and examined her backside then her calves. She shook her head then returned to the phone. A moment later Jason watched as her behind swelled in conjunction with her calves taking the leather garment right up to the breaking point. Joy gave herself a hard slap on the ass then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mind was unhinged. <i>She knows about my phone? How often does she use it? Who else knows? What do I do now?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason entered the changing room and hung the bulky garment bag on the hook by the mirror. Taking a step back he regarded his reflection with a sigh then opened the bag. A pair of bright red boots came tumbling out and landed at his feet. Jason's stomach sank as he looked from the boots on the floor to the bright red \"S\"  surrounded by yellow and blue staring at him through the opening in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Jason was hardly in the mood for this. This reality was just confusing and frustrating and he really didn't feel like playing dress up right now. Of course the most frustrating part was that he knew he had to play along. Well, he technically didn't have to but it really was the best option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another sigh, a deeper one this time, Jason pulled the Superman costume out of the bag and regarded it. It was strangely bulky as it it already had a body in it, yet it didn't weigh very much. Stretching the suit out Jason realized what was going on, this costume also included padding to give the illusion of muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason rolled his eyes. As much as he loved the idea of looking muscular again these suits only ever looked like someone stuffed a bunch of pillows in their clothes and never looked real. And, having actually had a super muscular body at one time, this only reminded him of what he had lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sense in stalling, I guess.\" Jason said then stripped off his clothes. The Superman suit had a zipper in the back which Jason pulled down and then began sliding his legs into each side. As soon as he got the lower half of the costume on he could tell this was not some cheap, off the rack, costume. The material was soft and stretchy but also thick and good quality. But even more than that the fake physique he had been concerned about moments ago proved to be incredibly effective. And thick. Now that his leg was inside the suit the full bulk of the padding became apparent and it went beyond any other off-the-shelf costume Jason had ever seen. Most of the time these suits went for the appearance of buff, this one was going for massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe padding surrounded his entire upper thigh giving him defined quads, hamstrings and glutes while the lower portion of the leg had a caned ham sized bulge giving mass to his calves. The reflection that stood before him was two different people, it seemed. His top half was scrawny and weak, his lower half was a champion level heavyweight bodybuilder. Jason ran his hands over his fake thighs and marveled at the detail of them. The padding was molded beautifully to include thick ropes of sinew with deep valleys between and even a network of veins all visible through the material of his super-suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the biggest I've looked,\" he said aloud thinking back to his very brief time as a complete muscle monster, \"but it still looks good.\" He pulled the rest of the costume on, no longer annoyed at his situation but now interested at how the rest looked. Moments later the illusion was complete: Jason looked like a bodybuilder version of Superman. The definition and detail on the rest of the suit was just as incredible on the upper portion as it was on the lower. Thick pecs looked ready to burst through the front of the costume and even distorted the trademark \"S\" a bit while Jason's stomach was now lined with a crazy number of abdominal muscles both on the front of his stomach and up his sides. Once again there were even visible veins right at the bottom of his abs leading down to the red \"underwear.\" Thick arms lead to thicker shoulders and even pronounced traps and a thick neck hidden in a turtleneck-style collar so the muscle went all the way to Jason\u2019s ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had been sliding his arms into the suit Jason found not just padding but also some tubing leading to a small lever at his wrist. Playing with this lever seemed to move air around in the arms of the suit filling some bladder somewhere. It was difficult to tell exactly what was going on or what this lever was for so he ignored it for now. Instead he took in his full appearance in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d he said twisting one way then the other. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d really believe I was buff.\u201d He raised his right arm and \u201cflexed\u201d his bicep. To his shock a flexed peak actually appeared. It took Jason a moment to realize what was going on but as he moved his arm back and forth he figured out the illusion. The \u201cbicep\u201d had been built with an air sack that, when pressed upon from the sides by his forearm and shoulder, squeezed the air up making it look like his bicep was expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d Jason said now flexing both of his pretend arms watching them grow to 20 inch guns. Remembering the strange lever at his wrist Jason pulled it while fully flexed and watched as his arms expanded several inches further and a thick vein appeared atop his might peak. The lever and tube must have been pulling air from somewhere, perhaps his forearm or even chest or shoulder, and filled his arm up giving him some of the biggest arms in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed a hand zipping up?\u201d Jason jumped at the sound of the new voice. He was almost embarrassed by his pretend muscle display. He spun to find Nikki except he hardly recognized her since she was also wearing a costume but the thick mane of wavy red hair that fell down over her shoulders clued him in as to who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was dressed as Batgirl, the mask and cowl nearly obscured her face completely but her pert lips and dazzling green eyes gave her away almost as much as her hair. Just like Jason\u2019s costume hers gave her a radically enhanced figure with muscles so large she looked ready to step on stage and compete with the biggest ladies around. Nikki\u2019s suit also gave her an expanded bust, her C cups had ballooned several cup sizes up to maybe an F, but Jason wasn\u2019t really a good judge of what letters should be assigned to such large breasts. He just knew she was insanely curvy, her broad shoulders and huge boobs leading to her naturally slim waist (lined with defined abs just like his own) that then gave way to rounded hips that he was pretty sure were also enhanced with padding. Jason could feel his penis waking up and beginning to swell; a dangerous proposition in a skintight Superman suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuscles really look good on you.\u201d Nikki said sauntering over to Jason on long and thick legs that were made even longer with bright yellow high heeled boots that brought her height nearly equal to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stopped and cocked her hip to the side placing one hand just above her yellow utility belt and pumping her free arm a few times. Jason saw a similar set-up in her costume caused her pretend bicep to pop, growing to a good 17 or 18 inches. She pumped her bicep a few times then feigned a slow hard squeeze pretending to grunt and strain out one last flex. Jason assumed she must have activated a similar air pump to what his suit had because this time her arm expanded well beyond its previous size surpassing 20 inches and nearly matching his own insane pipes. She held her 22 inch monster high and examined it closely with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah they do!\u201d She said with confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m going to be this big for real one day. I don't care what it takes, I love how this looks. I can only imagine how it feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki moved the rest of the way to where Jason stood and gently turned him around to face the mirror. He could feel her sliding the zipper up his back, tightening the suit around his shoulders and neck completing the illusion that these muscles where all his and not pretend. He could see her face over his beefy shoulder in the reflection, her eyes met his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to get big for me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't know how to answer and was just about to blurt something out when he could see Nikki's expression soften a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she said, \"I'm sorry, baby. You know how excited I get when muscles are involved. I get carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused long enough for Jason to want to fill the empty space with something but words just wouldn't come. His frustration with his situation began to return making his face feel hot. Suddenly he really wanted to get out of this stupid costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Nikki's eyes returned to his once again. \"You know I love you no matter what. Big and beefy, slim and nerdy, you're my man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason softened. He could see the affection in her look and it warmed his heart. Sidestepping backwards around Nikki he grabbed her roughly by the waist and hugged her to his body then slid his hand down to her round firm ass and squeezed hard (hoping what he was holding was all her and not padding).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'd love to be big,\" he said. \"I mean look at us.\" He fully flexed his free arm. Nikki purred and slid her hand across his chest and one leg up his thighs then lay her head on his shoulder. \"This would be a dream come true. I just worry that my body wouldn't respond to exercise and I'd always be a wimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked longingly at their reflection together. \"As long as we're together. Nothing else matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to this girl that he just met today realizing that he was crazy about her. \"We'll always be together.\" He put a hand under her jaw and guided her face to his and kissed her long and firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki moved her hand to Jason's crotch and giggled. Pulling away from their kiss she said, \"You'd better be careful, stud. This muscle is very real, very big, and very obvious in what you're wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled. \"Then you'd better stay the fuck away from me because it's going to stand at attention whenever you're around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki winked then pulled herself out of Jason's embrace. \"C'mon, Superman. Get your boots on. Vanessa's waiting for us and she's already in a foul mood considering what she's been asked to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his red boots on (finding even they were padded, adding at least 3 inches to his height) grabbed his phone and followed Nikki back out of the dressing room. Just before he got outside his phone chimed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason walked out of the dressing room right on Nikki's heels, his eyes fixed on her enhanced butt and legs, when he felt his phone buzz and ring with an alert tone he'd never heard before. Stopping to look he found it was a notification from the Alterations app. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">PARADOX ANALYSIS COMPLETE<br>\r\nALTERATIONS WILL ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE LOCAL UNIVERSE CONFLICTS<br>\r\nSTAND BY FOR PARADOX RESOLUTION ATTEMPTS<br>\r\nTAP FOR DETAILS</span></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to tap on the alert to figure out just what it meant but before he could a very distressed voice distracted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO! NO NO NO. Where's his cape? He'd better have a cape with that outfit, I'm not going to be responsible for messing this whole thing up. If I have to wear all this ridiculous crap so does he.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked to the sound of the voice and nearly dropped his phone. It was Vanessa and she was dressed as Power Girl. Just like with his and Nikki's costume Vanessa's contained a few enhancements to her body but considering the skimpy nature of Power Girl's suit the options on what to enhance were limited. In fact, at first the only thing Jason noticed was Vanessa's boobs. The customary \"boob window\" of Power Girl's suit was tightly packed with Vanessa's DD breasts but then below that was an insane amount of padding making it look like Vanessa's breasts had expanded to the size of basketballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason only just managed to tear his eyes away from the enormous globes that were bursting out of the skintight suit to find Vanessa looking very cross. She put her hands on her fake breasts and held them up for Jason to see. \"Go ahead, stare all you want. This is so fucking stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great,\" Nikki said. \"And besides, this isn't about us but Laura. Just wear it for a few hours and then you never have to deal with this again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed. \"I know, I just hate these monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason used the few moments that the girls were in their own conversation to take in the remainder of Vanessa's outfit. It was a perfect replica of Power Girl's costume complete with blue gloves and boots and even the flowing red cape attached at her left shoulder by a gold broach and rope that went under her right arm. The suit itself fit like a one-piece swimsuit but with sleeves under which Jason saw Vanessa had also been given a little muscle enhancement but not nearly as much as he or Nikki. Below her obscenely large boobs Jason could also see a ripped washboard stomach. Vanessa's hips and legs were bare but her natural muscle tone completed the look. It was only then that Jason realized just how statuesque Vanessa was. Nikki's 4 inch heeled boots brought her height all the way to 6', and Jason's boosted his to 6' 3\". Vanessa's boots were a combination of platform and high heel that made her taller than both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 6' 5\" amazon turned her attention to Jason and smiled realizing that she was looking slightly down at him. \"Where's your cape, Super Nerd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began to stammer out an answer when he felt Nikki take his hand. Looking to her she smiled through her mask and said, \"It's probably still in the bag. Go get it, we'll wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave a quick nod and left. He still wasn't used to being around Vanessa and her attitude toward him was strange. She seemed both like a friend and rival at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jason was back in the dressing room it was a quick matter of finding the cape and attaching it to his costume. Catching his reflection in the mirror yet again he was surprised by the fact that he had missed it before. The costume was so very incomplete without the cape. \"I must have been distracted by the muscles,\" he said as he put his hands on his hips and really felt like Superman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit complete he now turned his attention back to his phone. The notification was still on the screen. Tapping it opened a page of information:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Alterations has detected a possible Paradox caused by the historical alteration function.

Inside, however, he had a pretty good idea what it all meant. A paradox had been caused when Jason had changed the past and now the app was going to begin changing things so that the universe didn't end, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he'd better get going Jason left the changing room again and rejoined the girls. Vanessa was primping her golden blonde hair while Nikki was telling her that if she really wanted to go for the perfect looks she should cut it short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very aware of what Power Girl looks like, thank you. And I'm not cutting my hair. Power Girl also doesn't have tits out 'til next week. And Batgirl isn't built like a Mack truck either.\" Vanessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spoke to Vanessa as if his mouth were on autopilot. \"You know, you're sexy when you're pissed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" Vanessa spat back but Jason could see that she was smiling and that her anger was mostly in jest. \"You'd better watch your mouth or I'll crush you with one of these things.\" She thrust her chest forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged. \"There are worse ways to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio laughed and left the costume shop. Vanessa went to her own car and looked back to Jason and Nikki before she climbed in. \"I'll see you guys there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki called back. \"Sure thing.I hope you can fit behind the steering wheel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Vanessa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Nikki got into her car. \"Alright, Super Stud,\" she said putting her hand on Jason's thigh. \"You ready for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason said he was but his mind was stuck on what the Alterations app had in mind in its efforts to undo the mess he'd made. As Nikki pulled out into traffic he could only sit and wait to see what lay ahead.</span></div></div>",

Every summer the local comic shop had a sale on back issues.  He and Laura had never missed a sale since Junior High and the shop opened at ten.  \"I'll get dressed and be right down,\" he said, frantically trying to pull a shirt over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, we're in your driveway right now, hurry up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right, I'm on my way,\"  Jason was in the process of yanking a pair of pants on when his brain caught up with the conversation he had just had.  \"Wait a minute, who's we?\"  But Laura had already hung up.  Jason shoved the phone in this back pocket, grabbed his wallet and keys and dashed out of his room.  \"Seriously, who's we,\" he mumbled to himself and he pulled his shoes on and ran out the front door.</span></div></div>",

Jason waved back and jogged to the car.  Vanessa was wearing a black t-shirt with the Punisher skull logo and her hair was pulled back in a pony tail.  Jason couldn't ever remember seeing her wear ANY t-shirt before, much less a comic themed one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon sleepyhead, get in the car,\" Vanessa shouted.  Jason was so busy trying to spot other differences with Vanessa that he literally did a double take when saw Laura.  \"Holy shit,\" he muttered under his breath.  Laura was still her improved self which Jason should have expected but once again he wasn't prepared for the sight in real life.  A red t-shirt with the Flash logo was stretched over her gargantuan breasts, tight as a drum head and leaving no curve to the imagination.  It was either a size (or two) too small or she had cut it off short but either way the shirt left her magnificent abs exposed.  It was either sleeveless or she had cut the sleeves off to showcase her buff arms.  Jason hadn't realized that he had stopped to stare until Laura snapped him out of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?  Sit down you goof.\"  Jason nodded his head and sat.  After a moment he remembered to close the door.  A minute or two after that he remembered to breathe again.  He sat in the back seat taking in the comic book chatter between the two girls and couldn't help but smile.  This was amazing, it felt like a dream come true.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't take All Star Batman and Robin seriously,\" Vanessa was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But \u201cI\u2019m the goddamn Batman\u201d is so much fun to say,\u201d Laura laughed as she said it and Vanessa laughed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, don\u2019t piss off our resident Batman fanboy,\u201d Vanessa said in a mock serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t piss me off,\u201d Jason stated with the sternest scowl he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at each other before Vanessa asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m the goddamn Batman!\u201d  They all laughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived Vanessa and Laura piled out of the front seat and Jason darted for the comic shop door.  \u201cWhoa buster, hold on a second where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d  Jason turned to see Vanessa standing behind him with her hands on her hips and a pout on her face.  Now that she was standing up Jason could see she was wearing a denim mini skirt that showed off her stunning legs well to full effect.  \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to hold the door open for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d  Jason regretted the question as soon as he asked it and Vanessa was quick to shoot back an answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vanessa was chattering about specific back issues she was hoping to pick up and Jason was able to numbly keep up with the conversation.  It was surreal, she was talking about specific writers, artists, story lines, complaining about executive meddling and how it was ruining the industry.  \"I mean really, wanting to trash the decades of canon between Peter and Mary-Jane just because an exec thought Spidey would more \"hip\",\" she let go of Jason\u2019s hand to make quote marks in the air then grabbed it again as she continued, \"if he were single?  Please.  Their marriage was a defining aspect of his character.  Sorry, I'm ranting,\" she apologized with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I hated the whole idea.  It made the earlier storyline where Aunt May gave her, 'I lived a full life and am ready to die,\" speech pointless,\" Jason answered automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right,\" Vanessa surprised him with a kiss on the lips, it was over before he realized it had started and his lips tingled where he had felt the tip of her tongue.  \"You always understand me so well, it's why I love you so much.\"  Jason glanced over at Laura who was watching them with an enigmatic smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they were done shopping, talking with Vanessa had become eerily easy and comfortable.  If it wasn't for the stunning beauty of Laura drawing his gaze like a moth to a flame he would have been completely at ease.  He wasn't sure how he should be feeling.  He had grown up having only talked to Vanessa a handful of times and that was a few sentences at most.  Suddenly a light bulb went on in his head.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating for about a year right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea\u2026\u201d Vanessa said, looking at Jason oddly.  \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t miss our anniversary did I?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you feeling ok?  We celebrated that three weeks ago,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I just wanted to make sure\u2026 never mind,\u201d he finished lamely.  Dating Vanessa must have coincided with why he had stopped maintaining his journals somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at him with a raised eyebrow when he didn\u2019t offer anything further.  \u201cSpaz,\u201d she said with a giggle as they walked to the car.  Jason remembered to get the door for her this time and Laura climbed into the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead Romeo, sit next to your woman, she\u2019s possessive if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous,\u201d Vanessa stuck her tongue out at her younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked momentarily wistful then shook her head.  \u201cNo, you guys are so happy together I can\u2019t be jealous.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who else is ready for lunch?\u201d  Jason said before the sudden silence could drag on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh me,\u201d Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re always hungry you beast,\u201d Vanessa said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m always consuming protein for my workouts,\u201d Laura said with a self righteous smirk.  She punctuated it with a flex of her bicep that would have left Jason weak in the knees if he hadn\u2019t just sat down.  He had already forgotten the 30% \u201cflex bonus\u201d he gave her muscles and the surge from \u201cbigger than average\u201d to \u201cmonstrous\u201d took him by surprise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, we\u2019ll go get lunch.\u201d  Vanessa put the car in gear and drove while Jason pulled out his iPhone.  He pulled up Vanessa\u2019s profile and his heart almost stopped when saw that her relationship list was drastically smaller than it had been the night before.  It wasn\u2019t hard to find his name \u201cJason Sullivan \u2013 Soul Mate.\u201d  He stared at that line as he replayed the events of what he had done last night.  He had changed what she liked and disliked, he hadn\u2019t messed with her personality in any way, he certainly hadn\u2019t set himself as her primary love interest.  He had just tried to make her tastes as similar to his own as possible so Laura would get an iPhone in the past\u2026. his thoughts trailed off for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, do you have an iPhone?\u201d  Jason just asked it point blank, he couldn\u2019t think of anyway to ease the question in casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I do, what sort of question is that?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, no reason,\u201d Jason was at a loss.  Why hadn\u2019t the paradox been resolved?  Were all these efforts a waste?  What was he doing to do next?  He looked over to see Vanessa smiling at him and he smiled back but he felt cold and empty inside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He alternated between being ready to put her on a pedestal and worship her to feeling crushing guilt because he knew this would never had happened if he hadn't adjusted her likes and dislikes.  And of course there was Laura.  They were still best friends, that much was obvious, but the dynamic was so much different now.  Laura and Vanessa were now intensely close, like sisters he supposed.

Look, this Barbarian warrior looks sort of like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Barbarian warrior might look like you when she grows up if she's lucky,\" Vanessa snorted.  Jason had to agree, though impressive her bust and musculature were definitely outclassed by Laura.  Laura was greatly amused by Vanessa's observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA set of dice caught Jasons attention, they were faux crystal and the same color as Vanessa's eyes.  \"Hey,\" he drew Vanessa over to them.  \"These match your eyes, I should get them for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet honey but I would never use them.  I've had the same crystal blue set since junior high, all my luck is in them.  Besides I don't really play anymore anyway.  Fourth edition pisses me off.

She tells it every time she watches this movie,\" Laura was sitting on the floor, her back leaning against the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam Raimi the director had mounted the camera to the handlebars of a motorbike and drove through the cabin, when he went through the last door he drove straight into Bruce.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean he hit him with a motorcycle?\"  Jason was incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, here watch it again now that you know that,\" Vanessa rewound the sequence and they watched it again.  The look of terror on Bruce Campbell's face just before the screen went black now made Jason cringe slightly.  While Jason was thinking of crazed directors driving motorcycles into their actors Vanessa grabbed his hand and moved it so it was resting directly on her breast.  His crotch stirred which she was well aware of since she was leaning against it.  He looked down to see her grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood up and stretched, \"I'm gonna go find Greg and then get my arm set out of the way for today.\"  As though on cue Greg walked into the living room, obviously on his way to the basement for a workout.  Jasons eyes widened.  Greg was noticeably more muscular than the Greg he was used to.  \"Hey Greg, I was just going to go look for you.  You ready to spot me?  I'm doing arms today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, get changed and meet me down there.  Hey Jason, how's it going man?\"  Jason instinctively started to pull his hand off Vanessa's boob but she held it firmly in place.  Jason was afraid he was starting to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great Greg, how about you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shrugged.  \"Good, I'm doing good.  I had thought I hit a plateau but every time I think that Laura helps me bust through it, she's a natural and the best workout partner I think I could ever have.\"  If Greg noticed that Jason was groping his sisters boob in front of him he at least didn't acknowledge it.  \"Take it easy guys,\" Greg waved as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason realized that he and Vanessa were now alone in the living room and that he could feel her nipple stiffening under his fingertips.  He tentatively squeezed her breast with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa wriggled around so she was looking up at him.  \"It's not fragile,\" she was grinning and her eyes sparkled in the light given off by the TV.  Encouraged, Jason rubbed his thumb across her nipple and she arched her back, pushing her breast harder against his hand.  \"C'mon,\" she said, suddenly sitting up.  \"Let's go to my room, you got to do what you wanted last night, tonight it's my turn.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason froze for a moment as Vanessa stroked his member through his pants with one hand while she turned off the TV and tossed the remote aside with the other.  \"What are you waiting for?\"  She asked when Jason didn't get up right away.  \"This?\"  Vanessa stood up and leaned over Jason, pulling her shirt up over her breasts to show her off her cleavage and a very sexy black and red lace bra.  \"C'mon,\" she said again, pulling her shirt back down and grabbing his hand.  \"You get all this and more as soon as you move your ass off the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was feeling very conflicted.  He didn't know how to feel about sleeping with someone who obviously loved him when he knew he didn't feel the same way about.  Well it sounded like in this reality he WAS in love with her but... this logic loop was going to make his head hurt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason took Vanessa's hand and they made their way to her bedroom.  Vanessa closed the door behind them and locked it before turning to face Jason.  \"Get the condoms, I'll light the candles,\" Vanessa grabbed a lighter out of her dresser drawer and went around the room lighting various candles, it looked like there were five or six scattered around.  Jason gaped dumbly at the bedroom, trying to guess where the condoms would be.  Finally he moved to the nightstand next to the bed and sighed with relief when they were in a box in the second drawer.  His eyebrows raised slightly at the array of lotions and other things also in the drawer.  He turned and found himself face to face with Vanessa after he had closed the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, the whole box, you must have plans for tonight,\" Vanessa teased.  Jason was about to say something in his defense but was stopped by Vanessa kissing him passionately.  He wrapped his arms around her and she ground her body against his, her hands roaming all over his body.  Before he completely understood how it had happened they were laying entwined with each other on the bed shedding pieces of clothes seemingly at random, first his shirt, then hers, pants and underwear disappeared.  His hands were almost shaking as he undid her bra, he sighed when it came off with a minimum of fumbling, he had been under the impression it was difficult.  Vanessa pushed him down on his back and straddled him as she tossed her bra aside.  His hands went to her bare breasts almost of their own accord, rubbing the nipples, cupping and caressing the breasts, kneading them gently, marveling at their perfect tear drop shape as Vanessa moaned with pleasure.  \"You always know how to touch my breasts,\" she breathed, \"I love it.\"  Her hand wrapped around the shaft of his penis, stroking it and teasing the tip before slipping a condom over it.  His hand moved to her hips as she eased herself onto his shaft, they both shuddered with pleasure and Jason felt like he was on the verge of exploding already.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't come yet,\" Jason told himself firmly.  It was obvious that in this reality Vanessa had made love to him numerous times but this was technically him losing his virginity, he was desperately anxious about disappointing her and he bit his lip, fighting back the need to orgasm as Vanessa slowly increased the speed of their love making.  Her hands ran across his chest and he alternated between grabbing her hips and butt to caressing her breasts, he wanted to touch her everywhere, to feel everything.  \"I love you,\" he blurted suddenly.  His face burned, why had he said that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do baby, I love you to,\" Vanessa leaned down and kissed him deeply, rubbing her breasts against his chest as her rhythm continued to build.  Jason wrapped his arms around her and clung to her desperately tight, still fighting the urge to orgasm.  Vanessa firmly unwrapped his arms and sat up straighter, her breath was coming in short gasps now and her body was becoming slick with sweat.  Jasons hips began to buck with his orgasm becoming impossible to hold back just as Vanessa went over the edge herself.  \"Oh my god,\" she moaned, \"that is soOO good.\"  Jason lay back, completely speechless as Vanessa continued to move and pump until he had completely softened.  His mind was spinning as she dismounted and collapsed on top of him, wrapping her arms tightly around him, he instinctively hugged her back and they lay their in silence.  Jason was trying to take in what had just happened all the while nearly overwhelmed by the feeling of her body against his, her breasts crushed up against his chest, the feeling of her heart beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go,\" she said softly after what felt like an eternity went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go Jason, don't leave me.  Sleep here tonight.\"  She wriggled to her side, propping herself up on one elbow.  \"Don't go.\"  Jason looked back at her unsure of what to say.  \"You didn't stay last night.\"  She left the statement hanging there and Jason tried to figure out what she was talking about.  Last night he fallen asleep contemplating \"Ceiling Laura\" after sketching out paradoxes and reading stalker journals.  The look she was giving him was heart breaking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I have to go,\" Jason said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked pained but resigned.  \"It's your mom isn't it?  She's gonna freak if you're not home at a decent time?  Because I'm fucking up your life?  Never mind, just hold me a little longer alright?\"  She buried her head in his chest and held him so tightly his ribs began to ache.  He held her and closed his eyes, trying to figure out if she was crying or not.  He didn't think he'd be able to stand it if she were crying.  Eventually she unwrapped herself from him and kissed him softly.  \"You do what you have to babe ok?  You know I love you no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" he said, kissing her back.  She sat up and stretched and he stared at her body until she pulled her t-shirt over her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work tomorrow so I won't be able to see you until late, I'll call you or text you when I'm free,\" she said, watching him as he got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Jason got dressed slowly, hating to leave but feeling in his gut that he had to work more on solving the paradox.  When he was dressed Vanessa gave him another passionate kiss before saying good night to him and closing her bedroom door after he left.  He was positive now that she was crying and he felt awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two, what are we going to do with you?\"  Jason turned to see Laura standing in the hallway.  She was drenched with sweat and toweling off, probably on her way to take a shower after her workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... I...\" Jason began eloquently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, it's not like it's a secret or anything,\" Laura smiled warmly.  \"Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?  I'm free pretty much all day and I just picked up that one new Anime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, which one?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged.  \"The one where the girls dress in pleated skirts, there's unnecessary panty shots and the boobs are drawn like poorly formed footballs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for narrowing it down a little for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has zombies to, I'm sure you'll love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that does sound good.  I'll be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned and turned to walk towards the bathroom.  \"Good night Jason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, good night,\" Jason waved to his friends retreating back then let himself out of the house and walked home.  No one seemed to be home at his house and he wondered absently what the issue between his mother and Vanessa might be.  The knob to Jason's door turned easily and he let himself into his room without having to use any keys.  He stood in the doorway for a moment surveying the room before closing the door behind himself.  It was subtly different again.  How could it have changed again when he hadn't done anything with the app since last night?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night.  He wondered again at Vanessa's insistence that he had been with her last night when he definitely remembered drawing the paradox sketch and messing with the app.  Maybe because the new time stream would have had Jason in two places at the same time everyone remembered what should have happened?  He had no idea.  The pictures of Laura that had decorated the back of his bedroom door was now a mixture of pictures of Laura, pictures of Vanessa and pictures of him with each or both of the girls.  \"Ceiling Laura\" seemed to be gone, in her place was a poster sized picture of Vanessa kneeling on her bed, naked but for a pair of black lace panties, one arm crossed over her breasts and the other beckoning towards the camera.  Her \"come hither\" smile made Jason's penis stand to attention almost instantly.  \"Down boy, you've had enough for one night,\" Jason turned back towards the corkboard and verified that the paradox sketch was still there, he pulled it down and sat at his desk, unlocking the desk drawer and pulling the notebooks out to read through more thoroughly this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off...\" he said regarding the paradox sketch, \"I have no clue what the fuck is up with you.\"  He scribbled out the question mark he had used to link the two timelines then marked a spot on the alternate timeline and labeled it \"used app on Vanessa.\"  Then he drew a loop back on the alternate timeline and made sure he noted that Laura now had an iPhone.  After a moments hesitation he also put a spot near the start of the alternate timeline and labeled it \"friends.\"  After a moments hesitation he also noted \"Vanessa loves me\" below it.  He sat there staring at that line for a long time before he finally put the sketch back on the corkboard and picked up the notebooks to read them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the notebooks didn't reveal a whole lot he hadn't already gathered on his own.  They started sometime during Junior High and left off just before Junior year of High School started.  The short story was that in this reality Vanessa had been much closer to Laura, especially from Laura and Jason's Freshman year of high school where Vanessa had been an almost omnipresent guardian angel for her younger sister, keeping the lecherous older boys away from her.  The by-product of this and the fact that the trio shared similar interests was that they did almost everything together.  The subtext read that Jason was crushing hard on Vanessa since early on.  He wondered why he stopped keeping his journals updated since before the period they had started dating.  He also wondered why he had hooked up with Vanessa instead of Laura?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tore a blank page out of the last notebook and locked everything else up.  \"I wonder if this will work?\"  Jason wrote on the page.  \"My best friend is Laura Friedman.  My girlfriend is Vanessa Friedman.\"  He hesitated then wrote.  \"My mom doesn't get along with my girlfriend.\"  Then he put the notebook page next to the paradox sketch and started getting ready for bed.  He literally jumped when he found \"Ceiling Laura\" on the inside of his closet door.  \"What are you doing here?  Does Vanessa know I'm keeping you around?  Why am I keeping you around?  Who took this picture in the first place and how did I get it?  You do realize I'm still going to call you \"Ceiling Laura\" because \"Closet door Laura\" doesn't sound as catchy right?\"  He stared mutely at this highly sexualized image of his best friend then slowly closed the closet door and went back to lay on his bed and look at the picture of Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I get myself into this mess and how am I going to fix it?\"  He pulled up his profile on the app and once again verified that he was still trapped in a paradox.  He felt like the app was mocking him, because his profile still showed the enormously muscled version of himself he had only briefly been.  He sighed and tried to figure out what his next step should be.  \"I could change Vanessa so she doesn't love me anymore, that would probably be more fair to her because I'm not sure I DO love her.\"  Vanessa stared silently down at him.  \"And she would never remember having loved me so it wouldn't be like it would hurt her feelings or anything.\"  He felt a pang of guilt remembering how she hadn't even wanted him to leave for the night.  \"On the other hand the me in this timeline seems like he does love her.  But if that's the case why keep that poster of Laura laying around?  And I don't think that messing with my love life is going to fix the paradox anyway, once I can use the app on myself again I can fix all of this right?  Or will I create more paradoxes?\"  Jason turned to look at the paradox sketch and tried to think of what it was exactly he was trying to fix.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The app,\" he whispered finally, staring back and forth between the original timeline and the new one.  \"Friends, she buys an iPhone, she installs the app, I use the app,\" he said reading the original timeline before it looped back on itself.  \"She never installed the app in the new timeline.  She never had a reason to because she's perfect.\"  The elation at possibly solving the puzzle was quickly replaced by a crushing realization.  \"What can I possibly change that will make her install the app on her phone if her profile is locked because of the paradox?\"  Vanessa continued to stare silently down at him without offering any advice.</span></div></div>",

He pulled up her profile and once again went to the mental aspect of her profile.  \"I can't make you hate me, that would probably keep Laura and I from ever being friends and I don't want that.  And I don't want to change any of your likes or dislikes because that might skew Laura back into not getting an iPhone.\"  Jason frowned.  \"But maybe somehow our relationship is screwing up the timeline?  Hell I don't know, I'm making this up as I go along.\"  Jason went into her \"sexual attractors\" and weighted \"muscularity\" much higher on the scale than it currently was.  \"There, now you're primarily attracted to buff guys, which I'm certainly not.  Sorry Vanessa, I think I could have loved you but the time stream is sort of a big deal.\"  He hesitated before applying the changes.  Going back to his note about his life status he added a line \"I rate my life a scale of 1 to 10 a ???\"   He put the pencil back down on the desk.  \"Let's do this,\" he pushed the \"apply changes\" button then passed out as an extreme wave of dizziness overtook him.</span></div></div>",

He did a double take when he looked at his arm to see what was wrong with it.  \"Holy shit I'm huge!\"  Certainly not to the extent of his currently locked profile or even Greg but with a guess Jason estimated he probably had about forty pounds of extra muscle on his frame.  He attempted to flex and winced slightly.  He rubbed at his sore muscles and looked around his room.  It looked nearly identical to what it had when he passed out.  New additions were a full length mirror on the outside of his closet door, a small assortment of dumbbells in the corner by the closet and a handful of supplements and vitamin bottles next to a big tub of protein powder on his desk.  Apparently he was taking a serious run at body building.  He glanced at the note next to the paradox sketch.  According to the note Laura was his best friend, Vanessa was still his girlfriend, his mom liked his girlfriend and he rated his life a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.  \"Huh, I didn't think that would work.\"  He also confirmed that \"Ceiling Laura\" was still in his closet and Vanessa was still displayed proudly on his ceiling.  \"Good morning girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason groaned as his phone rang and his muscles protested his reaching for it.  \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bud, how are your arms feeling?\"  Jason looked at the phone to see who was calling, the voice sounded familiar but he couldn't place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea man, it's me.  I bet you're hurting.  You were really pushing yourself last night.  I just wanted to check in and see how you were doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sore,\" Jason admitted, \"sort of stiff.  I think I'll be ok once I start moving around a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful bro, you have damn good genetics but you're not gonna do yourself favors by overdoing it right?  Legs this afternoon, don't forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, legs, sure,\" Jason hesitated, \"your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed.  \"Man, we don't have enough plate at our place for Laura to break a sweat with on leg day.  The gym downtown.  See you there.\"  The line went dead and Jason looked around his room again.  Hoping against hope he opened his and Laura's profiles and groaned.  Still locked under the paradox error.  He shook his head and gathered some clothes then hit the shower.  Out of curiosity he weighed himself on the bathroom scale before stepping into the shower and let out a low whistle.  He weighed sixty pounds more than he was used to and it was all muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot shower did wonders for the ache in his arms and he actually felt upbeat when he was done showering.  \"Well, let's mosey over to Laura's and watch zombie panty flash anime,\" he said as he pulled on a tank top and shorts. \"And maybe get some food.\"  His stomach growled and he felt ravenously hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA detour in the kitchen in which he demolished most of the contents of the fridge was made easier by the fact he had apparently posted a diet schedule on the side of the fridge.  \"Stay away from the junk food\" was scrawled at the bottom of the schedule in what he recognized as his own writing.  \"Who would have thought I would have become a health food expert?\"  Jason mused.  \"I bet Greg made this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura answered her door almost as soon as Jason knocked.  She looked unchanged, which was to say still unbelievably busty and built.  \"Hey you, I was wondering when you were going to show up, how are the arms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The arms are good,\" Jason said as he stepped in.  \"They were a little stiff this morning but a hot shower worked the kinks out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \"You're a glutton for punishment, just be careful, Greg and I would hate to see you hurt yourself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just took the fact that he was now apparently workout buddies with Greg in stride.  \"So what are we watching?\"  Jason asked as he flopped onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High school of the dead,\" Laura tossed him the box to look at as she turned on the TV.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Jason grunted.  \"I'm surprised I haven't heard of this yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me to, it's right up your alley.  Maybe you're letting Vanessa distract you from the finer things in life.\"  Laura dragged her sisters name out into a sing song and Jason wasn't sure how much bite was intended to be behind the teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"  Jason asked guardedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just that you two screw like jackrabbits.\"  Jason could feel his face burning.  \"Oh don't be embarrassed.  It's nothing to be ashamed of.\"  Laura sat down on the floor with her back against the couch.  \"Jason, I know how much you love my sister and I can't think of anyone I'd rather see her with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-hmm,\" Jason said non-noncommittally.  Not for the first time he felt frustrated that he was hearing about his own life experiences second hand without being able to remember them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours went by quickly until Jason's phone buzzed that he had a text.  \"On my way home from work, are you already there or do you need me to pick you up?\"  It was from Vanessa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already here.\" He texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple seconds later the phone buzzed again.  \"Good, I love you, be there in a few minutes.\"  Attached to the text was a close up picture of Vanessa's cleavage obviously taken with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa's on her way home,\" Jason told Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood up and stretched, \"I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go greet your woman Romeo, I'll pause the movie for you,\" Laura said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could feel himself blushing again.  He was anxious to see her again, the memory of last night still burned bright in his mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was waiting outside by the front door when Vanessa pulled up, the car had hardly stopped before she jumped out and ran straight him.  He was startled when she jumped up, throwing her arms around his neck and wrapping her legs tight around his waist, he had to take a step back to keep from falling over and he cupped his hands under her butt to support her weight better.  She laughed and kissed him, her tongue probing deep in his mouth and he eagerly returned the gesture.  After a moment his arms began to ache again and he set her down, both to give his arms a rest and to get a better look at her.  He was curious to see if his latest change had any other unexpected side effects.</span></div></div>",

From the high heels, up her long sensuous legs to a conservative skirt (though tight enough to show off her hips) to the sleeveless white button up blouse (unbuttoned enough to show off her generous cleavage).  She didn't look any different, her breasts may have been SLIGHTLY larger but that could just be the particular bra she had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon stud, you don't have to undress me with your eyes, I want to get out of these clothes anyway and put on something more comfortable.  You're more than welcome to help me out of them.\"  She winked seductively, undoing another button on her blouse as she ran her fingertips slowly down Jason's chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and swept her up into his arms, \"If you insist.\"  She squeaked with delight as he carried her up to her bedroom and her clothes were off before they had even gotten the door closed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis love making session was different than the one he remembered from last night, it was faster and far more intense.  It was like his body knew what it was doing on its own he and Vanessa changed positions multiple times, he felt confident and strong, and was able to lift and move her with little effort.  The feeling of power was a rush all on its own, to say nothing of the vigorous participation of his partner.  When he finally came he was shaking from the intensity of the experience and emotion.  Vanessa unwrapped her legs from around his waist and he eased her hips down to the bed.  \"Wow,\" he breathed, collapsing on the bed next to her and putting his arm around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow is right,\" she purred.  She kissed him then sat up.  \"C'mon get dressed and I'll drive you and Laura to the gym.  If you don't get started on your leg workout now you won't have time before you go to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes silly, your job.\"  Vanessa kissed him again and started getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged and began getting dressed himself.  \"Where do I work again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at him with an incredulous grin.  \"All the blood must still be in your other head, you work at...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You left this one here a few nights ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason finished getting dressed.  Vanessa was now wearing a pair of cut off denim Daisy Dukes and a Batman t-shirt that looked like it was meant for a grade schooler.  A deep \"V\" had been cut into the neck to show off her cleavage and it was short enough to display her shapely abs.  Jason didn't think her abs had been quite that defined before, maybe dating a bodybuilder had some effect on her after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back?\"  Laura asked with a raised eyebrow as Vanessa and Jason came downstairs together, Jason knew his face was getting red.  Laura was carrying a gym bag and she tossed another bag Jason, \"C'mon we're gonna be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Vanessa said, grabbing her keys off the table next to the front door.  \"We had something we had to take care of first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Laura said with a dead pan expression.  Jason didn't know what to say so he kept quiet, though he could feel his face burning.  Laura nudged him in the ribs with her elbow.  \"Relax, you make this way too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Laura tossed their gym bags in the trunk of Vanessa's car.  He noticed a third gym bag that he assumed was Vanessa's before he closed the trunk.  Jason felt contemplative as he climbed into the front seat.  He couldn't even begin to describe the way he was feeling, the last few days had been a complete roller coaster for him and he felt like he was just along for the ride.  But if this was the reality he was going to be stuck with it really didn't seem all that bad.  After all, on a scale of one to 10 he had rated it a 7, that was above average.  He pulled his phone out and brought up the app.  But what if he could make it an 8 or an 9?  There was still room for tweaking wasn't there?  He glanced over at Vanessa, he had become pretty comfortable with the idea that they were a couple now but what if he could make her better?  What if he could make her more like he had made Laura?  He wrestled with the thought and the related fear of making the paradox worse.  Every time he used the app felt like he was gambling with fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vanessa had adjusted very well to being in Lauras shadow, he didn't think he needed to make her bigger than Laura or even equal to her.  But he felt guilty every time his gaze drifted from the woman who loved him with all her heart to her younger sister.  That was how he justified it to himself as he modified Vanessa profile.  He didn't want to be greedy, he feared that too drastic of a change might risk screwing everything up or even causing another paradox.  No, he would be moderate with his changes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made her a couple inches taller, equal to his own height, and he put all the new height in her legs remembering how it felt when they were wrapped around his waist during their love making.  Still on the legs he increased their girth slightly, adding some muscular definition and making them much stronger.  Meticulously tweaking made sure the swell of her thighs into her already shapely hips was flawless.  He firmed her butt, lifting and rounding it but leaving the slightest layer of fat over it, he could only imagine how it feel to wrap his hands around those cheeks.  He pinched her waist in slightly and accentuated her abs further.  The overall effect was to make swell of her bust even more dramatic.  To further enhance her hourglass shape he widened her shoulders a tad and gave her well rounded delts.  He stripped away almost every ounce of fat in her arms and increased her arms to high end fitness model/low end bodybuilder size.  Finally he selected her breasts and slowly nudged them upward in size until they were \"G\" cups.  He compared the Vanessa he had created with the current Vanessa and then Laura.  The virtual Vanessa was proportioned very similarly to Laura, just not to the same scale.  His member stirred at the image on the screen.  She was breathtaking but he didn't think she was different enough to change anything for the worse.  At least he hoped not.  \"Heh, maybe it will even fix the paradox somehow,\" he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that hon?\"  Vanessa asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just talking to myself,\" Jason said as he pressed the \"Apply changes\" button.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason blinked twice, very slowly.  A palpable wave of disorientation had swept over him for a moment then was gone.  He looked hesitantly to his left, Vanessa was still driving, still wearing the same clothes and still carrying on the same conversation with Laura as though nothing had happened.  But the changes had taken effect and they were even better in person than they had been on the small screen.  Jason let out a sigh of relief then squirmed in his seat, trying to adjust his suddenly hard member.  He looked back at the app and confirmed he could still modify Vanessa's profile if he wanted to, so no new paradox.  He frowned as he brought up his own and Laura's profile.  Still locked.  Same old paradox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything ok hon?\"  Vanessa asked, noticing his frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I'm fine, it's just my arms are still stiff from my workout I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, they'll be fine when we get back to working them again,\" Laura thumped Jason's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the gym and found Greg was already there.  It didn't matter that Jason had no idea what he was doing, Greg was a detail orientated trainer and walked everyone through their sets from the weight to use, to how many reps and how long to rest between exercises.  Watching Laura with Greg in the gym was like watching a completely different person.  Her focus was incredible and they both pushed each other hard.  Jason instinctively reacted to that energy and the grueling but efficient workout session passed quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More weight,\" Laura gasped, pushing out another rep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah sis, you're fine.\"  Jason stood off the side as Laura was finishing her last set.  His legs felt like rubber bands and he alternated between feeling like he was a beast of a man to feeling as though he may puke from the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More weight,\" Laura gritted out as she slammed the leg press up hard enough to make the machine rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, put 50 more on your side for her,\" Greg said, picking up another plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason set down his water bottle and grabbed his own weight, putting it on the machine as Laura reached the bottom of this rep.  She grunted with the exertion as she finished out the set.  Greg helped her up when she was done, her legs quivering from the workout.  \"I'm just not feeling the same burn anymore,\" she said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shook his head, \"Sis, you are freakishly strong, I don't know what else to tell you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" she actually sounded dejected.  \"Makes it way harder to get a good workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed, \"Girl, if you wanted to compete you'd blow them all away.  I'm not sure how much bigger you expect to be able to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged as she sipped from a water bottle.  \"Just bigger, does there have to be final goal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have to keep your proportion.  In fact you may have to ease up on your arms a bit until your legs catch up,\" Greg pointed out.  Jason eyed Laura, he liked the way she looked with her big arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's so much harder for me to get a good leg workout,\" Laura pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, you and your sister are both the same.  Arm fiends,\" Greg tussled Lauras hair and headed for the shower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea but I like how my arms look,\" Vanessa joined the conversation and flexed to punctuate her statement.  Jason grinned and Vanessa grinned back.  \"So does my man.\"   She gave Jason a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but you have it easy, your legs look great and all you do is run,\" Laura took another gulp of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa shrugged, \"We have different goals sweetheart.\"  Vanessa turned to Jason, \"I'll be back to pick you up when your shift if over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded and headed to the shower.  When he was done he clocked in.  Apparently he helped out by spotting people who didn't have workout partners and overall helping keep the place clean.  Weights back in the rack, that sort of thing.  According to the Calendar on this iPhone he was scheduled to work a few hours every afternoon this week, he was closing the place tonight and tomorrow was his only day off.  He hadn't had a part time job in his reality, he absently wondered why he had one now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shift went by without incident and the manager said good night as he left.  \"Don't forget Jason, lock up ALL the doors.  That other moron I got working for me can never figure out the back door counts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Jason locked the front door behind the manager and clocked out.  He was about to lock up the back door and leave when he was surprised to find Vanessa standing outside the back door when he opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, is he gone?\"  She asked, stepping into the dimly lit gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, he just left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Vanessa wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him deeply, Jason like the feel of her now much larger breasts rubbing against his chest and he kneaded them gently as the kiss dragged on.  \"Mmm, you're do know you're very good at that don't you?\"  Jason nodded silently as Vanessa began stripping.  \"Time for more cardio baby,\" she giggled.  If the sex he had with her this afternoon was fiery this was mindbogglingly incendiary.  Jason would never look at a weight bench the same way again.</span></div></div>",

He put one of his arms behind his head as he stared at her face, her eyes were closed and she had a contented sleepy smile on her face.  \"Was this what love felt like?\"  He wondered to himself.  He brushed the hair back from her face, and she stirred.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I love the nights when you close,\" she purred, kissing him softly without opening her eyes.  He let his fingertips drift down the back her neck, following the curve of her back towards the swell of her buttocks.  He could feel her body shiver slightly and he stopped.  \"No honey, don't stop, that feels nice,\" she murmured.  So he continued, tracing every contour of her body he could reach, using his fingertips, his hands, stroking, massaging and he could admit it, groping.  Finally he brushed the hair back from her face again and kissed her.  She smiled and opened her eyes.  \"I hate to say it but we can't lay here forever, let's get cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded.  They reluctantly got up from the weight bench, gathered their clothes, took a leisurely shower at the gyms expense then let themselves out.  Jason even remembered to lock the back door as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late stud and I have to work early tomorrow.  You ready for me to drop you off at home?\"  Vanessa asked the question but what Jason heard was the Vanessa of the other night clinging to him and whispering \"Don't go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She cleared her throat.  \"Want to grab some food first though?  I know I could eat and if I had to guess, you're starving as usual.\"  Jason's stomach audibly growled to punctuate her comment.  \"Dinner it is then,\" she said with a laugh as she put the car in gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate at a small Italian place which apparently was a favorite of Vanessa's.  They even saved Jason the trouble of trying to puzzle out what healthy food he should be eating by giving him his \"usual\" without even being asked.  They talked in low voices throughout the meal, leaning close over the table so their voices didn't carry and so that their lips remained in convenient kissing distance.  When the meal was over Vanessa drove Jason home where he grabbed a change of clothes for tomorrow, his toothbrush, deodorant and for reasons he couldn't explain the note from his corkboard which had changed to rate his life a nine on a scale of one to ten.  He folded the note and put it in his pocket with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are smiling about?\" Vanessa asked as he got back in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever had the feeling that your life really couldn't get much better than it already is?\"  Jason asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only every day I'm with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sneaked quietly into Vanessa's dark house, making it to her bedroom without waking anyone.  Jason stripped down to his boxers and Vanessa put on a pair of cotton panties and pulled an old oversized t-shirt on before climbing into bed next to him.  He lay on his back and she snuggled up next to him with her head resting on his chest.  He put his his arm around her shoulders.  \"Good night,\" Jason said finally, kissing her on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Jason,\" she said after kissing him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you to.\"  Vanessa seemed to drop off to sleep immediately but Jason just lay there in the dark, listening to her breathe, feeling her body against his, feeling her heart beat.  It didn't help that he suddenly thought he had the paradox figured out.  He couldn't wake her up just to mess with his phone though.  It would have to wait until morning.</span></div></div>",

After a minute Jason could hear the shower running down the hall.  He made his way to the downstairs bathroom to relieve himself and brush his teeth, then he got dressed and bumped into Vanessa as she was leaving the bathroom.  True to her word she gave him a kiss worth waiting for.  \"SOOOOOO tempting,\" she said again.  She shooed him out of her room so she could finish getting dressed.  \"Not that I care if you see me naked but you're distracting me.\"  He stuck his tongue out at her as she closed the door, she laughed and pouted, \"Promises promises, maybe later when I get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vanessa was getting dressed and doing her hair Jason was searching the App Store for \"Alterations\" and not finding it.

He hadn't pictured anyone making a skirt suit combo look that sexy but she pulled it off beautifully.  After she drove away Jason went back to trying to find the app in the app store then gave up with frustration.  How were you supposed to download an app if it didn't seem to exist?

He looked in vain for what would have been ideal, Laura's hand dangling conveniently off the side of the bed in his direction.  No such luck.  Her left hand was under the sheets somewhere, her right arm was resting on her stomach, cradling her breasts.  At least it was on top of the sheet.  He wasn't sure if he'd be able to get the app to read her thumbprint without poking her boob with the phone which he was pretty sure would wake her up.  He stood silently hovering over his sleeping friend, judging angle of approach, how much pressure he would have to use and anything he else he could think of to delay having to do this.  Finally he began moving the phone slowly towards her hands, lining up the screen with her thumb.  As he suspected, the corner of the phone began to push into her breast before it made contact with her thumb, he grit his teeth and continued until he had the screen pressed against her thumb, he jerked it away and verified that the screen said, \"THANK YOU, LAURA,\" before ducking down next to the bed.  Laura's breathing shifted pitch and she stirred, Jason held his breath and crossed his fingers.</span></div></div>",

Jason retreated out of Laura's room and back to Vanessa's.  He locked himself in and contemplated the message on the phone again.  It looked like to activate the app on Laura's phone he would have to deactivate it on his own.  His thumb hovered over the Yes/No buttons.  Was there anything else he wanted to do with the app on his phone before he turned the app off?  Maybe he shouldn't even do this, there was no guarantee it would fix the paradox.  Hell, he wasn't even sure that the paradox was even that bad a thing.  This life seemed pretty good.  He pulled out the note and looked at it again.  Nine out of ten, that was damn good.  He pushed the \"yes\" button and his phone buzzed.  He opened it to the app.  \"ANOTHER USER WISHES TO ACTIVATE THIS APPLICATION ON ANOTHER DEVICE.

A message popped up, \"CHANGES DETECTED, RESYNCING\"  His breath forcefully exited his lungs, he felt like he had been punched in the gut.  An intense wave of heat was building in his chest and he looked at his reflection in Vanessa's dresser mirror with incredulity.  He was growing he realized with elation.  His muscles were swelling with power and he fought back the urge to roar with pleasure.  His shirt began to tear away from his expanding chest and he gleefully flexed with all his might to watch it disintegrate.  He flexed his bicep hard, watching it reach a mountainous peak, then flexed it again and again, grinning as it grew larger and thicker each time.  His pecs surged forward and his shoulders widened, broader and broader.  He was slightly concerned as he continued to grow past the size he remembered being days ago.  His shorts gave up trying to contain his tree trunk like thighs and fell to the floor in fragments of tortured cloth.  When his growth finally stopped he was clad only in his boxers which were painfully tight.  Every time he moved he could feel stitches popping loose.  He inhaled and let out a shaky breath.  When he was sure he was done growing he pulled up his profile on Laura's app.  \"Four hundred and thirty pounds?\"  He gasped.  Apparently the app had just added the three seventy he had specified before the paradox onto the sixty he had earned himself in the meantime.  He looked at his profile for a minute before making one little tweak.  \"That shouldn't hurt anything,\" he told himself.  He noted that Vanessa was listed as his soul mate in his profile.  He smiled, then jumped over to her profile and confirmed he was still hers.  Laura's profile was exactly as he had left it.  The note laying on Vanessa's dresser caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My best friend is Laura Friedman. My girlfriend is Vanessa Friedman, My mom gets along with my girlfriend.  On a scale of one to ten I rate my life an eleven.  (The eleven was written in red pen and circled).  I don't work but I make a ton of money endorsing workout clothes and equipment.  I love Vanessa.\" (And it was underlined, circled and surrounded by hearts and stars.)   Jason let out a sigh of relief.  Then jumped as Laura's phone buzzed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANOTHER USER WISHES TO ACTIVATE THIS APPLICATION ON ANOTHER DEVICE.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason firmly pressed the \"Yes\" button and watched with satisfaction as the app disappeared from Laura's phone.  A moment later his own phone buzzed.  He opened a new email titled \"Nicely done.\"  He wasn't surprised to see the sender field was blank.  The contents were short and to the point.  \"Nicely done, Jason.  I didn't think you'd be able to pull it off.  And with a complimentary end result as well.  Very nicely done.  I hope you enjoyed the time you spent using our product.\"  He read the email then deleted it and the original one with the link to the app.  While he had Laura's phone he deleted the email he had sent her as well.  He felt limp with relief, like he had run a marathon and came in first place.  He opened Vanessa's door intent on sneaking the phone back to Laura's nightstand but instead ran right into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Jason, put some pants on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I spent the night with Vanessa and forgot to bring a change of clothes,\" he improvised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \"You two, I swear I don't know what we're going to do with you.  There was some of your stuff in the laundry the other day, it's in the linen closet I think.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, here's your phone back, I had to text Vanessa and mine was charging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not be using my phone for any sexting you big perv,\" Laura took her phone back as she delivered her mock scolding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, scout's honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were never a boy scout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honorary Starfleet cadet's honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wrinkled her nose at him, \"You are such a nerd.  Let me take a shower, we'll get something to eat.  You don't have anything going on today do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason checked his calender.  The only thing on his schedule for the whole week was some sort of photo shoot tomorrow afternoon.  He'd have to figure out that was about before he had to be there.  \"Nope,\" he said finally.  \"Nothing today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Laura ducked into the bathroom.  \"Be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason rummaged in the linen closet until he found a pair of cut off shorts and a tank top that were so huge they could only be his.  He got dressed and watched TV until Laura joined him.  They spent the day talking and playing video games.  If he closed his eyes he could pretend that nothing was different at all.  It was comfortable, it was the life he hadn't realized how much he enjoyed living until he had almost irrevocably destroyed it.  In the afternoon Vanessa got home from work and the three of them watched movies together.  Jason realized that Laura now habitually sat on the floor and used the couch as a backrest because the couch groaned alarmingly if they tried to sit on it.  So they sat, Vanessa wrapping herself around him (the best she could manage given his size) and Laura leaning against his other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Vanessa finally asked Jason as he continued to mull over the events of the last few days.  \"You look so serious.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged, \"What if you had the ability to change anything about yourself or anyone else, but if you did it carried the risk to destroy that persons life and your own as you know it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you say anything what do you mean?\"  Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything,\" Jason clarified.  \"Any aspect of their body or personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would depend on a few things I guess,\" Vanessa said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"  Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like risk vs. reward for one thing.  If your life was good the risk wouldn't be worth it, if it was horrible I would take a chance to make it better.  Like us?\"  Vanessa gestured to the trio, \"I wouldn't change anything about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" Laura agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" Jason echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night when Jason and Vanessa were in Jason's room (he was glad he had her drive him home, he now lived somewhere else apparently, a big condo a couple blocks over.  It sounded like he had moved out from his mom's place.) she questioned him more about the \"change anything\" conversation.  \"What brought that on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  Nothing I guess,\" Jason was walking through his new room, checking out the differences without trying to be obvious about it.  \"I had read a short story on the internet about something like that and it got me thinking.\"  Other than being in her newer upgraded body the poster of Vanessa was unchanged over his bed (which was now a king sized bed instead of the twin he was used to, it made it easier to understand Vanessa's insistence that they go to his place.  There were still random candid photos of him and the girls scattered around.  His movies, comics and action figures were still present.  Maybe there was more bodybuilding paraphernalia.   He paused by a framed magazine cover that featured both he and Laura.  The headline \"Maybe it's the water?\" was subtitled with \"Amazing young amateurs live in same town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't regret anything about your life do you?  And why are looking in your closet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned away from the \"Ceiling Laura\" poster that was still on the inside of his closet door.  It was the exact same picture of Laura but it was framed differently.  Laura was no longer the central focus of the picture, in the foreground was Jason lifting Vanessa out of the water with one arm around her waist while he flexed the other arm for the camera.  Vanessa was kicking and screaming despite obviously enjoying it.  The spray of water droplets coming from her feet were the source of the sparkling highlights around Laura's face.  The Jason in the photo was grinning ear to ear, Vanessa was falling out of her swimsuit top and the near complete nipple slip on the breast facing the camera drew his eye.  \"I love this picture,\" he said ignoring her first question.  She moved to his side, wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head against his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that is a good one.  Thank you for not having it in the middle of the living room so everyone can see my boob.\"  She kissed his cheek, \"And you dodged my first question bucko.  Nice try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regret?  No,\" he answered truthfully.  \"But do you ever start something where you intend to have one result but then you end up with something completely different?  You don't dislike the new result, you may even think it probably turned out better than the one you originally intended but you still wonder how it would be if it turned out the way you planned in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, all the time baby.  It's called life,\" she kissed him deeply.  \"If you don't stop being moody and philosophical I'm going to cut you off from reading stuff on the internet.\"  He laughed and picked her up, she squealed happily as he dropped her on the bed.  \"That's more like it baby,\" come here and I'll make you forget all about whatever it is you've been moping about the last few days.  He happily complied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment Vanessa gasped.  \"Baby, not that I'm complaining but you seem, bigger, your dick I mean.\"  She gasped again, \"Never-mind, definitely not complaining.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason thought about his situation. \"Perhaps the issue isn't so much to get Laura to buy an iPhone but to keep me in her life. And since we drifted apart because she was more like Vanessa and Greg and no longer in their shadows perhaps I need to reinstate the differences between them. He looked at one of the pictures on his wall. It showed Laura and Vanessa together on their patio waving to someone out of frame to the left. Vanessa was wearing a tiny string bikini while Laura had on a slingshot swimsuit. Jason couldn't believe how incredible she looked, her boobs, her muscles, her legs, her face, hair, everything. Vanessa, once the standout beauty, now faded into the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it then,\" he told the photograph. \u201cI need for Laura to feel out shined by her siblings again. If I can't make Laura less beautiful I'll have to make Vanessa more beautiful. Then the guys will flock to more and there's a better chance that Vanessa will not bond with Laura as much and she'll have more time for me. And if Greg is bigger Laura may feel a bit more insecure,\u201d Jason sighed, this was no small task. Not only did he have to somehow amp Vanessa's sexuality into the stratosphere but he was doing so to drive a wedge between the two sisters. And he wasn\u2019t excited about making Greg so big that Laura felt tiny, but he comforted himself by reminding himself that he was just returning all of their relationship to the way they had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took his phone and flopped down on his bed. He opened up the Alterations app and pulled up Vanessa's profile. He looked from her to \"Ceiling Laura\" and back again. \"Well, here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he upped Vanessa's height from 5 foot 10 inches to 6 foot 3 inches. He then dramatically increased the length of her legs as well as the width of her hips to a round 44 inches. Then he slimmed her waist down to a narrow 20 inches making for a ridiculous juxtaposition. Jason spun the virtual model around and began working on he rear. He inflated its size while maintaining its firmness and perfect round shape. Jason then took the opportunity to plus up Vanessa's overall muscularity, but only a little. She grew just enough to take her from toned to very fit. Jason figured this would give her a broader appeal while keeping her body strong enough for what he was he was about to do for (to?) her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason zoomed in on her chest. The breast slider was already sitting at DD cup, but he knew he would have to outdo Laura's incredible I's, so he quickly slid his finger across the screen to the right. Within moments Vanessa's boobs swelled to and then beyond the size of Laura's massive mammeries. Jason stopped when the readout listed Vanessa's cup size as MM which put them slightly larger than basketballs. He made sure to keep them firm to prevent drooping. He zoomed out and admired her figure as a whole. She looked like a live action Jessica Rabbit, but with bigger boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason did his best to ignore his throbbing penis and went to work on Vanessa's face. He made several tweaks and shifts to make her the pinnacle of beauty. He gave her hair a healthy shine and reddened it very slightly. When he zoomed out again the screen read \"Updating...\" then Vanessa's clothes changed from a casual shirt and t-shirt option to a barley there halter top and a black mini skirt. Her shoes also switched from flip-flops to a pair of knee high leather boots with a 4 inch heel. Jason knew a handful of tall women and most were a bit shy about their height; that, however, did not seem like a problem for Vanessa. With her high heels she would tower of almost anyone else she came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then pulled up Greg\u2019s profile. These changes were much easier, he upped Greg\u2019s height by 3 inches to make him 6 foot 5 inches. The Jason began adding muscle to Greg\u2019s 225 pound frame. Jason thought of just how insanely disproportioned he\u2019d had to make Vanessa as he pushed Greg about as far as any human had ever been able to develop their muscularity and beyond. Jason turned Greg into a muscle god who tipped the scale at 300 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked back up at \"Ceiling Laura\" and took in a deep breath. \"I really hope this works. I want my friend back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he tapped the \"Apply Changes\" button. The iPhone processed the changes for a few moments then finished. For a brief moment there was a slight shimmer that surrounded Jason. When it cleared he saw that the walls of his room were still papered with photos and his drawers were still held closed with padlocks. But the subject in the pictures had changed. Now they showed....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason's walls were still covered with pictures of Laura, but Laura had exploded. \"Ceiling Laura\" was still there, but she was no longer pictured swimming, now she was standing on the shore of the same lake clad in only bikini bottoms that were being dwarfed by her massive thighs and glutes. Her torso was completely bare and her breasts, still large as ever, stood atop a tectonic shelf of muscle. Her chest was bigger around than the tree she was standing next to, and the tip of her nipples were over 2 feet beyond the tip of her chin. She was flexing her arm which looked like a mountain, the peak of her bicep extended higher than the top of her head, and veins as thick as garden hoses were pushed to the surface of her skin. Laura was holding her impossibly large arm up for another girl to touch. Jason recognized the girl by her fair skin and red hair. It was Nikki. Nikki's hands were groping the basketball sized muscle atop Laura's arm. The girl's slender fingers were positively dwarfed by her hulked out friend. Nikki had an expression of wonder and excitement on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got out of his bed and began to examine the other pictures he had apparently hung. Most appeared to have been torn from magazines, there were still plenty of voyeuristic shots, but the need had apparently diminished with Laura's increase in published photo shoots. Several of the pictures had Laura posing in very sexy and provocative ways, mostly in swimsuits that hardly fit her giant frame. One had a naked Laura lying on her side in a huge pink bed. The pink sheets were sandwiched between her enormous thighs so that her crotch was just barely hidden but her right leg was completely exposed so that it was obvious that she didn\u2019t have any clothes on at all. One big arm was draped across her right breast while the other arm held a tiny teddy bear covering her left. Laura\u2019s muscles looked swollen and curvy, not necessarily hard. Her curves were inviting but above all else smile was incredible. Jason spotted a whole spread with Laura working out in a gym lifting massive weights. In each picture her body was pumped to the extreme making her look much much larger than she had in the bedroom photo. Here she was shredded, hard as granite and covered in sweat. Jason looked closely at one photo where Laura was holding an enormous barbell over her head with both hands, the thick bar was bending from the strain of the massive plates at each end. He could tried counting the total weight she was holding and guessed it to be approaching 2 tons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Jason backed up and spotted a magazine on his desk. It was an issue of Flex from about 2 months ago. The cover showed both Laura and her brother Greg facing each other and flexing titanic crab flexes. Greg was larger than just about any other man in the world and was somehow a little bigger than Jason had programmed. Despite his size, though, Greg was dwarfed by his younger sister in every way but height. Large dynamic letters appeared above the pairs heads that read \"The Real Story of the Friedman Siblings!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason flipped open the magazine and found the cover story right away. It was bookmarked, in fact, and many passages and quotes were underlined while numerous notes had been scribbled in the margins. The first start of the story was a full page photo of Greg and Laura. They'd been dressed in business wear, a grey suit and tie for Greg, and a black skirt with a matching blazer for Laura. Each item of clothing was clearly too small, though, because both siblings were flexing right out of their outfits. Greg had his hands on his hips and was flexing his chest, the white shirt had split open down the middle exposing mighty pectorals and his pants where shredded over giant quadriceps. Next to him Laura had her arms raised in a double biceps pose that had utterly destroyed her sleeves. Only a few scraps of fabric remained around her elbows, wrists, and a few small strips around the peak of her mountainous biceps. Under her arms her lats had spread right through the sides of her shirt and jacket. Her stance was wide and her awesome thighs had torn the skirt asunder. The title of the story was printed at their feet and read \"Exposed: The Secret Identities of the World's Most Powerful Siblings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason skimmed the article. It was clear that before he even started that he'd been successful in driving Laura and Vanessa apart and in doing so had brought her closer to her brother. Even with Greg being as big as he was Laura was very close to him. The story detailed how from a very young age it was obvious that Laura possessed a muscular anomaly. When she flexed muscles appeared from nowhere. Greg described a 10 year old Laura with stick thin arms flexing an apple sized bicep from thin air. Jason knew this to be the expansion ability he'd given her. She'd been studied as a child and it was found that not only could her muscles expand by a good 30%, but they were a lot denser than normal muscle tissue. When she was 13 she'd begun strength training with Greg and exploded in no time flat. By the time she was 15 she had not only grown as big as any male bodybuilder ever, but her density and expansion ability had increased as well. Now, at 18, her muscle fibers were 30% more dense than normal and she could expand to 50% additional size. To drive this point home the next page featured a pair of pictures with Laura and Greg sitting opposite each other at an arm wrestling table. The top panel showed Greg winning, but Laura, though appearing to fight and strain, was not flexed to full potential. The lower panel had Laura dominating Greg with an arm that had swelled from the 28 inch cannon pictured above to a 42 inch monster. The poses Greg and Laura had assumed in the pictures were obviously staged, but the point was valid nonetheless, Laura was huge to begin with and could flex up half again as big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason closed the magazine and sat down on the corner of his bed. This wasn't what he'd expected at all. Suddenly his phone rang. He checked the caller ID and saw it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNikki?\u201d Jason said aloud. He looked at one of his surveillance photos that showed Laura sitting at a restaurant eating an enormous meal. Just next to her was the mysterious red head taking a sip of what looked like a fruit smoothie with a huge smile on her lips. Jason studied her closely. \u201cWhy are you calling me?\u201d he asked her image. \u201cClearly I know you well enough to have your number stored in my contacts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took in a deep breath and answered the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there,\u201d an excited voice spoke. \u201cIs the coast clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason glanced out his window at the beach. The sun was beginning to set over the water. \u201cThe coast?\u201d What was she talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, can I come over? Is it clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason rolled his eyes at his stupidity. \u201cOh, sorry. My mind was wandering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA melodious laugh floated through his phone\u2019s speaker and into his ear, it was warm and inviting. He actually found the hair on his arms standing up. \u201cOh, you\u2019re not thinking of another girl are you? Should I be jealous?\u201d She giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s eyes roamed the hundreds of Laura Friedman photos that papered the walls of his room. \u201cHeh, of course not.\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I\u2019d hate to have to give a beat down to some other girl who caught your eye.\u201d Nikki giggled again. \u201cSo, you never answered me, can I come over? I have a few gifts to give you. I think you\u2019re really going to like them.\u201d The way she spoke the last sentence caused Jason\u2019s penis to stir and swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason weighed his choices. On the one hand he wanted to see if he could repair the latest damage he\u2019d caused in the timeline which had turned Laura into a mega sized muscle babe. He could sure use some time alone to figure out his next move. On the other hand he found Nikki\u2019s voice to be strangely alluring. He really wanted to meet her and see how she fit into all of this. Maybe he could even get some information about Laura from her since it seemed that the two were pretty close friends. He looked again at Nikki in one of the pictures of Laura. And how often was it that a really cute girl wanted to come over to see him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason knew that he should probably work on fixing the timeline, but he was intrigued by the prospect of meeting Nikki and finding out how she fit into all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coast is clear,\" he said. \"Come on over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" she said. \"I'll be there in 5 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hung up his phone and slid it into his pocket. Then he went downstairs to the living room to wait for Nikki. He made sure to lock his bedroom door behind him, no sense in letting this girl in on his apparent obsession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jason got downstairs he heard a car parking outside. He glanced out the window and saw a brand new BMW convertible. Nikki stepped out and came up the driveway. He opened the front door for her and she shot him a dazzling smile that sent butterflies fluttering through his stomach. In the photos he'd seen of her he'd identified her as cute. In person she was downright hot. She stood about 5 foot 5 with her dark red hair pulled back in a ponytail. She wore tight denim cut-off shorts that showed off strong, sexy legs. Her shirt was a pink, collard polo that was taut across her wide shoulders and framed her C cup breasts very well. Her arms, much like her legs looked fit and strong carrying a gymnasts muscle tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki must have noticed Jason checking her out because she stopped on the porch and put her hands on her hips. \"How do I look?\" She pushed on hip to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Awesome.\" Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's green eyes flashed and her ruby lips parted in another exhilarating smile. \"Aw, thanks, stud.\" She entered Jason's house and wrapped her arms around him in a big hug. Her embrace was very tight and just as Jason was thinking about just how strong she must be she picked him up off the floor and carried him to the couch where she tossed him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Jason said as he flopped down onto the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Daddy says everything went even better than he expected. He was worried that the process would shrink me down which would have left me in containment several more days while he pumped me full of protein to get me back to normal, but as you can see I came out the other end slightly bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProcess? Containment? Jason had hoped to get answers from Nikki. Instead he was getting a million new questions. In the meantime he just smiled and nodded and hoped that things would become clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here earlier than expected,\u201d Nikki continued. \u201cDaddy said he was amazed with how well things went. My density was increased 15 times. You should have seen it, he put me through some tests today and I bench pressed 1,500 pounds! Can you believe it? And I\u2019m pretty sure I could do more. It\u2019s so incredible. And it\u2019s all thanks to your intel.\u201d She sat down next to him and threw her arms around his neck while hanging one of her legs over his. Jason\u2019s hand instinctually went to her thigh and he marveled at how incredible her smooth, soft skin felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled that incredible smile at him again. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to show you just how strong I am. In the meantime, though, Daddy sent over a few things for you. He was so pleased with your information that he wanted you to have these.\u201d She reached into her back pocket and pulled out a slip of paper. \u201cFirst there\u2019s this. He said to consider it a success bonus. He said that he just needs a little more from you to complete phase 2, and once done he\u2019ll make this look like pocket change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took the paper from her which turned out to be a personal check. When Jason opened it and saw how much it was for his mouth went dry and his heart nearly stopped. \u201cSa... see.. Six million dollars!!!??!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed, \u201cI know! And Daddy said he\u2019s so close to completion of phase 2 he can taste it. It\u2019s all so exciting! Which brings me to gift number two.\u201d Nikki held up a small vial containing a few ounces of liquid. \u201cHe wanted me to give you this. He said you had asked for it. I have to admit I was a little surprised, I\u2019ve been around for nearly two years of testing on this formula and I don\u2019t think anyone has ever asked for a second dose. I mean you were above average before the first and that one took you to really big. This one will make you a giant.\u201d She slid her hand down Jason\u2019s chest to his crotch and gave his penis a firm squeeze. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pulled the stopper from the top of the vial and held it out. Jason began to reach for it and she pulled it back again. She gave him a stern look and said, \u201cI want you to understand how big a deal this is. Daddy never just gives these out. The fact that he\u2019s give you two shows just how much he likes you. There are millions of guys who would kill to get their hands on just one dose of this penis enlargement formula. I just don\u2019t want you to take for granted that you now have access to the most advanced bioengineering lab in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Jason said. His mind was reeling. The money, this girl\u2019s strength, penis enlargement formula, it was all too much. And somehow it was tied to information that he had been gathering. He thought to his room. Had he been spying on Laura for these people? Had he supplied information that had led to Nikki gaining super strength? It was the only thing that made sense. He must have provided intel that allowed Nikki\u2019s father (some sort of scientist) to give Nikki enhanced muscle density similar to Laura\u2019s. That made Jason wonder what \u201cphase 2\u201d was all about. In the meantime Nikki was holding up the tube of formula and moving it towards his lips. Had he really already had one of these? Her other hand was still on his crotch and Jason had to admit that his bulge felt a lot more substantial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen wide, honey.\u201d Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn\u2019t quite sure he wanted this, but he had to play along lest this super strong woman get suspicious. He opened his mouth and allowed her to pour the formula in. The liquid was tasteless but everywhere it touched was set aflame. It was all he could do to keep from coughing it right back out again. He choked it down and felt the burning spread along his esophagus and into his stomach. Then the fire continued to move downward through his body like acid eating away at his insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH! I can\u2019t wait, don\u2019t move!\u201d She ran to the hall closet and reached up to a high shelf to grab a toolbox. Jason was first surprised at how well she knew her way around his home but then was distracted by her thighs and calves as she reached for the high shelf. She grabbed a tape measure from the toolbox and returned to where he sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki knelt on the floor at his feet. She ran her hands up his thighs to the waist of his pants where she undid his belt and pulled open his fly. Jason sucked in a breath as Nikki reached into his pants and pulled out his member. Yep, he thought to himself, definitely bigger. As Nikki had alluded Jason had always had an above average penis in terms of size, though how she knew that was a mystery to him, but the one she held in her hands was already larger than his familiar 7 inches and still getting hard. Nikki began playing with his cock, stroking it, pulling gently, even teasing it with her lips. Jason reached full erection in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, there\u2019s the giant I love.\u201d Nikki said then kissed the head. She grabbed the tape measure and laid it across the length of his pipe. \u201cEleven and one half inches,\u201d she announced. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re about to start growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gasped, the fire in his crotch was now all over his dick and he could feel it beginning to work, pushing him longer and thicker. \u201cHere it goes.\u201d he said through sharp breaths. The feeling was painful and incredible at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can feel it!\u201d Nikki shouted squeezing her hand around his shaft. He was already thick enough that her fingers and thumb just met when wrapped around his girth. As soon as he started growing, though her digits could no longer touch and they kept spreading further and further apart. Jason watched as the tip of his penis crept along the underside of the tape measure, slowly at first, then at a quick surge of a full inch, then another. \u201cGrow, baby. Yes! Well over a foot now! That\u2019s so hot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt his cock surge one last time, then the fire began to fade and his growth came to a stop. He began catching his breath as Nikki took his measurement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful girl at his feet looked up with a grin and said. \u201cFifteen and one quarter inches.\u201d She then slid her lips around the giant head and took as much of him into her mouth as she could. The remainder of Jason\u2019s exposed cock was enough for her to work with both hands, and she did so with gusto. Between the excitement of growing into a porn stars dream and the gorgeous girl with super strength sucking him off Jason was coming in less than 2 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t last long-\u201c Jason began but was cut off by Nikki shushing him. Then she sat with him and curled her body around his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries at all. You lasted longer than I thought you would. I know that\u2019s an intense feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. He finally felt like he was getting his thoughts back in order. He was still mesmerized by this strange girl and was beginning to feel very strong emotions for her, or was that just the cock talking? The important thing was that he was pretty sure his earlier hypothesis was right, that just left \u201cphase 2\u201d and his role in it. And how did this all fit in to the paradox and his path to fixing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured his best bet was to get some additional information out of Nikki, but what to ask?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason felt like he was living in a strange dream. His best friend Laura was now a gigantic mountain of muscle, he was relaxing in the arms of a strange and beautiful girl who was also infused with super strength had just given him a spectacular blow job on his newly expanded 15 inch cock. Oh, and she had just handed him a check from her father for 6 million dollars for providing information on his best friend. Yeah, it was nuts but it was his life for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats on your mind, baby?\" Nikki asked. \"You look miles away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to smile. \"I was just thinking about how lucky I am.\" This was partly a lie, but there was a lot of truth in there as well.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I'm the lucky one. Everything my father has been able to accomplish has been because of your help. You have no idea how incredible it feels to be so strong. I just wish Daddy could figure out how to make his process work for men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe someday. I'm just glad I could help you. And now we have phase 2 to look forward to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW!!\" Nikki nearly jumped with excitement. \"That's the best part. Daddy says that even though Laura can only get about 50% expansion he should be able to get me to at least 200%. And, even though Laura doesn't get any stronger when she expands all the expanded muscle I get will be just as dense and strong as what I have now. Can you imagine it? My strength will blast through the roof. I'll be able to rip tanks apart with my bare hands! Daddy says he just needs a few more samples and he'll be able to calibrate his machines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was now becoming clear. Nikki's father was using samples that Jason gathered to recreate the genetic gifts that Jason had granted her with the Alterations app. Clearly he'd already been successful on one front, now he was forging ahead with another.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, looks like someone is getting excited about my transformation into a superhuman.\" Nikki motioned to Jason's crotch where his penis was in fact beginning to swell once again. Jason had to admit that the power that Nikki was describing was very erotic.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki slipped her shoes and socks off and stood up, \"Do you have some clothes I can borrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because these old things have been torn to shreds.\" Before Jason could question further Nikki grabbed the collar of her polo shirt and ripped it apart as if it were made of paper revealing a perfect pair of C cup breasts in a pink bra. Her abdominal muscles were just visible etched into her tight tummy. She tossed her ruined shirt to the floor and took hold of the waistband of her denim shorts and pulled. Again her super dense muscles overpowered the fabric with a loud popping sound. She grunted and roared slightly before holding up two separate halves of her former shorts for Jason to see. Nikki was now clad in a matching bra and thong panty set.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's penis had leapt to full attention and was throbbing in all its new 15 inch glory.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like what you see.\" Nikki said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so beautiful and so powerful. You're just amazing.\" Jason said. He didn't know what was happening to him. This girl was taking over his mind. She was incredible and sexy and strong. He'd just met her but when she smiled he felt like he would do anything for her. And she was smiling now.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said. Once more she took hold of the few remaining. Her right hand grabbed her bra right between the two cups while her left hand wrapped around the front of her panties. In one quick motion she was completely naked. She then practically leapt onto Jason's prone body and straddled him. Her perfect teardrop breasts hung right in his face and he leaned forward to tease her nipples with his tongue. Nikki giggled and wrapped her arms around the back of Jason's head. Then she shoved his face into her cleavage taking care not to crush him with her superior strength. Jason pretended to struggle and even gently pounded on her butt a little.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and hit me as hard as you want, baby. You can't hurt me.\" Nikki said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead his slid his hands around her gorgeous rear and began massaging her sex. Nikki squealed with delight and removed Jason's head from her bosom so she could lock with him in a deep, passionate kiss. Then she took one hand and guided the huge head of Jason's cock into her vagina. She lowered herself slowly taking care to allow herself time to adjust to his girth. Jason felt himself sliding into her achingly slowly, inch by inch, for what seemed like forever. Finally Nikki stopped, she could take no more. Jason glanced down and saw that there was still a good 4 or 5 inches of his penis left that would not fit. He didn't have time to consider this though because Nikki began pumping herself up and down, riding his enormous shaft. Jason ran his hands back up Nikki's thighs, over her hips and waist to her breasts which he squeezed roughly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, that's right baby. Hard. Make me feel it.\" She encouraged as she continued to pound up and down. \"You feel so good inside me, I've never been so filled in all my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for nearly an hour. Nikki continued to speed up and slow down to keep Jason from coming before she was ready, all the while she reached orgasm about every five minutes or so. Jason was astounded at her ability to keep riding him for so long, he credited her super strength for keeping her going. At long last, after coming 18 times Nikki sent Jason over the edge and he blasted her insides with a torrent of come.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair collapsed on the couch together huffing and puffing, their bodies slick with sweat.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.... that.... was........ insane!\" Jason said through gasps.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was only the tip of the iceberg. The best is still ahead.\" Nikki had already regained her breath, Jason was becoming jealous of her powers. \"I have to go, lover. Thank you again for everything. I'll email you in the morning what Daddy needs. I'm meeting Laura and some friends for dinner tomorrow night. Perhaps you can get the samples then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded as Nikki turned to the front door and began to leave. \"Wait,\" he said, \"don't you want some clothes. I can grab something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki glanced back over her shoulder and smiled that incredible smile again. \"No thank, baby. I changed my mind. I feel too good right now. I think I'll just go like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word Nikki opened the door and stepped out into the world completely nude. She slowly strode to her car and slid in behind the wheel. She blew Jason a kiss then started the engine and drove away.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason cleaned up the remains of Nikki's clothes then made sure to grab his 7 figure check and made his way back upstairs to his room. He lay in bed staring at \"Ceiling Laura\" being felt up by Nikki. He was truly torn. He wanted to set things right with the timeline, but at the same time he had something real good going here. His only concern was what he would have to do to \"get a sample\" of Laura. Clearly he'd done it before, so it was both possible and did not interfere with Laura's life too much. But was it right? He felt like he was betraying his friend by doing so, even if they weren't really friends in this reality. Jason pulled out a pile of notebooks and began going over them until he fell asleep. By morning he had decided what he would do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason awoke fairly early and the first thing he saw when opening his eyes was \"Ceiling Laura featuring Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello girls,\" he said before stretching and letting out a great yawn. He got up and went through his normal morning routine then got dressed and drove to the bank to deposit his 6 million dollar check. He still couldn't believe that he had that much money. As he drove his old clunker he eyeballed car dealerships and thought to himself that he could just stroll in and buy whatever new car he wanted, just like that. He smiled when he realized that he could do the same with a new house of his own as well. And, from what Nikki has said, if he could do this one job he would be paid much, much more.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got him thinking about the job and what he had read the night before. From what he could gather he and Laura had ended their friendship about 3 years ago when Laura had started really getting attention for her size and strength. Jason wrote in his journals that as big as her muscles got Laura's head was always a hundred times bigger. Jason also suspected there was a lot of jealousy on his own part, though not having lived through it he couldn't be sure. Apparently Jason, Laura and Nikki were all friends together but when Jason and Laura had their falling out Nikki tried to remain friends with both separately. Even now she was still meeting each independently of the other to maintain relationships. It seemed to Jason that the two had gotten pretty serious about each other nearly 2 years ago and she had been his girlfriend since. It wasn't until 6 months ago that the pair had launched their plan to work with Nikki's father to replicate Laura's genetic abnormalities in others. Jason tried to decipher just who had come up with the idea, but it wasn't clear in the notes he'd read.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading everything and realizing the truth behind his relationship with Nikki he decided that he really wanted to help her. She seemed genuinely excited about gaining new powers and, though he probably wouldn't admit it, he was falling for her pretty hard.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked into the bank and approached the teller with his check. He couldn't remember feeling so good. Maybe it was the millions of dollars or the enormous cock or the super powered girlfriend, but he could really get used to this reality. Sure he missed Laura, but she seemed plenty happy being the strongest human being to ever live.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teller gave Jason a strange look as she saw how much he was depositing, but completed the transaction and handed him his receipt. \"Your new balance, once the check clears, is six million eighty-five dollars and eleven cents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" he said and gave the teller a quick wink. She smiled and even blushed a little. Yeah, he was feeling pretty good. As Jason was leaving the bank he felt his phone buzz. He checked it and saw that he had an email from Nikki outlining what her father needed. Jason sat in his car reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hey baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaddy says he just needs 2 more samples of Laura's muscle tissue to finish calibrating his equipment. He says he needs one of her muscles in a relaxed state and one in their flexed and expanded state. He also said they both need to be from the same location, preferably the same spot. I'd recommend her bicep since she's flexing those to the limit about every 15 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have a dinner reservation at Chapman's tonight at 6:00, so you could either go with the waiter disguise of the super fan. I think the fan will work better, but you're the professional.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, be are to wear really right pants. I'm sure she'll be distracted by your enormous package. I know I can't stop thinking about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove ya!<br>\r\nNikki</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded to himself. He had a feeling he would need to do something like this, but he didn't know how to feel about \"going undercover\" in a disguise. He had read in one of the notebooks about a device that Nikki's father had designed for him to wear on his hands to collect the muscle samples, so that part, at least, should be easy. All be had to do was touch her arm twice in the same general area once when it was relaxed and once when it was fully flexed and expanded.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason closed his email and returned his iPhone to the home screen. He noticed the Alterations application icon and wondered if it would be easier to just use that to give Nikki what she wanted. He could use the instantaneous feature so he didn't create a new paradox or make the current one worse. The problem was trying to explain the app to Nikki, and what if her father found out about it? As nice as it would be to avoid his muscle tissue collecting mission perhaps it would be best to keep the number of people who know about the app to a minimum.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason looked at his watch. 5:30, he had half an hour before Laura, Nikki and their friends would be at Chapman\u2019s. Jason looked around. He still couldn\u2019t believe where he was. He was in a huge warehouse filled with all sorts of different clothes and disguises. It was like a massive wardrobe and prop room for a major movie company or stage production. Jason had read about this place in his notebooks, and had apparently used it on several occasions. Apparently Nikki\u2019s father assembled it so he could send people out to collect samples from people all over the place undetected. And there were plenty of outfits and equipment here to help get that job done on a massive scale. Actually, it was pretty scary. Jason couldn\u2019t help but wonder just what Nikki\u2019s father was up to at his facility. Ultimately this was the reason he\u2019d decided against using the Alterations app on Nikki. He was far too scared to use the historical option again, and the instantaneous changes would raise too many questions, especially with Nikki\u2019s father. He was working to create muscle expansion in his lab, Jason was pretty sure he would notice if his daughter just spontaneously gained the ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at himself in the mirror. He had decided upon a waiter\u2019s outfit, but figured he would go with the big fan ploy that Nikki had mentioned. He would approach Laura and ask let her know he loved her work and always dreamed of being able to feel her biceps. As Nikki had suggested he had found a pair of black pants that fit him very snugly and made it very obvious that he was hung like a horse, and a well hung horse at that. The clear outline of his penis ran down his right pant leg halfway to his knee. Jason had also applied a fake beard to his face which went a very long way to changing his appearance. He almost didn\u2019t recognize himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis disguise complete Jason began applying the collector mechanisms to his fingers. These were pieces that were made of translucent latex that fit over his digits. Each one had receptacles in the fingertips that would penetrate the skin and scoop out sample muscle tissue cells. They even had a slight numbing agent that would allow the ultra thin needles to do their work painlessly. All Jason had to do was prime them by squeezing the sides of his fingertips then touch the collection area. Easy as pie. The hardest part was attaching the pieces to his fingers since he had to use spirit gum to glue them down. It wasn\u2019t easy since he\u2019d never worked with it before and he could only use one hand at a time. After fumbling for nearly half an hour he finally got them attached so that they were invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took one last look at himself in the mirror and left for the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there he entered quickly through the back and, keeping his head down, went straight for the dining room. He tried to make it look like he belonged there and just kept moving. With luck anyone who saw him would just think he was new. He made it out of the kitchen and began moving through the rows of tables looking for the one that Laura and her friends had been placed at. He rounded a corner and spotted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Laura that first caught his eye. This was the first time he\u2019d seen her in the flesh in this reality and his jaw nearly hit the floor. She was immense. She wore a black halter top that was molded around her enormous chest and back. Her shoulders were left almost entirely bare and looked like she\u2019d stuffed bowling balls under her skin. She had her left hand raised holding a piece of bread; the arm was completely relaxed but her bicep was still clearly defined and bulging. Even in its unflexed state her arm measured a good 24 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sat with six other friends, all women. Most of them were incredibly fit, but only two were muscular enough to look like a bodybuilder. And even the two of them combined didn\u2019t come anywhere near the same size as Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spotted Nikki sitting to Laura\u2019s right. She had straightened her hair which now hung down just below her jawline and framed her face. She wore a little red dress with a plunging neckline that revealed the top of her perfect C cup breasts and several inches of cleavage. Even from across the room he could see her green eyes sparkle and her smile made his penis stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took in a deep breath. He knew what he needed to do. Now he just had to make it work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jason approached Laura's table he kept his eyes on Nikki. He wanted to make sure she knew he was there. Once he was about 30 feet away she finally looked up and he was able to catch her eyes. She did a tiny double-take but recognized him. She smiled and gave him a quick wink.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began to doubt his disguise. If Nikki could identify him so quickly surely Laura would as well, right? He thought back to the previous night and his love making session with Nikki and remembered what he was working for. He would go through with it, he had to.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched as Nikki leaned over and whispered into Laura's ear. Laura's eyes began scanning the room near where Jason was before coming to rest on him. Jason's heart sank for a moment before he realized that Laura wasn't looking at his face but his crotch. Her eyes went wide and he noticed her mouth the words \"oh my god.\" Jason relaxed a bit and went to work.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's eyes followed his clearly displayed penis until he was behind her. Then he waited about 30 seconds for her to settle back into her conversation. Jason primed the cell collectors on his index finger and approached the massive girl on the side where Nikki sat. When he was right behind her he reached out and touched his hand to her right bicep pressing his index finger against her skin praying she didn't feel the tiny needles searching out and scraping muscle tissue away.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, \"I'm so sorry to bother you, but I'm a huge fan of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned and looked up at his face for a moment. She smiled when she realized it was the same waiter she'd been eyeballing a moment before. Her eyes quickly returned to his giant cock then back up to his face again.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"That's very sweet of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't believe this was working. It was time to go for broke. \"I don't want to sound like a creep or anything, but I would really love it if you would be willing to flex your arm for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will. I love to show off my giant muscles for my fans.\" She slid her chair back a little to give herself room and raised her right arm. She flexed and her arm swelled into a mass of muscle of insane size. Her skin was stretched thin over the bowling ball beneath. \"That's 29 and one half inches around. I'll be able to get it up to 30 inches in a few weeks. That's without my special.... ability, of course. If I really flex hard it gets a lot bigger. Do you want to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason noticed that Nikki's eyes were locked on Laura's incredible arm anxiously awaiting its upcoming expansion. Jason had to admit, he was incredibly turned on himself and really wanted to see that muscle grow even more. \"Absolutely,\" he said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and flexed even harder. The peak of her already huge bicep blasted upwards, her arm adding more and more mass almost instantly. Jason used the distraction to retract the collector on his index finger and extend the ones on his middle finger.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grunted with satisfaction. \"Rrrrrraaaaaa, and that there is an arm that measures a little over 44 inches around. Most bodybuilders work hard to get 22 inch arms and are super proud. Mine are twice that. Pretty awesome, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. He'd never seen anything so amazing. He held his hand up. \"Uh.. may I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason planted his hand on the peak of her bicep. He tried to approximate the location that he had touched before, but the landscape had changed so dramatically that it was impossible to tell for sure. He pressed his middle finger down then squeezed with all of his fingers. Her muscle was as hard as steel.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think? Was it everything you hoped it would be?\" Laura asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, very impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. And speaking of impressive,\" her eyes returned to Jason's crotch and she spoke directly to his penis, \"now that I've let you touch my huge muscles perhaps you'd let me touch a huge muscle of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura!\" Nikki slapped her friend on the thigh.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Laura looked surprised. \"Wow, girl. You have been working out, haven't you. That kind of hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Nikki looked sheepish. Clearly she was still getting used to her super strength and hit Laura harder than she'd intended.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked back to Jason, well, his penis anyway. \"So, what do you say, stud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was flustered but he tried to play along as best he could. \"Well, I can't do anything until I'm off shift, but maybe when I'm off. It would be a dream come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Why don't you just come by my place when you're off. Here's my address.\" She reached into her purse and pulled out a card. \"I can't wait to see you.\" Again she spoke directly to Jason's penis.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. For everything.\" Jason turned and left, heading quickly for the kitchen. He retracted the collectors on his middle finger and prayed he'd gotten what Nikki's father needed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason made it back to his car without incident. Breathing a sigh of relief he climbed in behind the wheel and drove back to the costume warehouse. The entire way he was taking care not to mess with the fingertips on his right hand. The collectors should be secure, but he was still paranoid.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back at the warehouse he secured the cell samples in a specially designed container and proceeded to change back into his own clothes and removed the fake beard. Then he set about figuring out where to transport the samples. He realized that he actually had no idea where to take them. He could always go home and see if there were any clues in his notebooks, but that would take a while. Instead, after much debating, he decided to text Nikki.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out his iPhone he tapped out a message, \"Hey baby, did your dad mention if there was anyplace special he wanted me to bring these samples?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he waited for a reply Jason gathered up his things and the sample case and made his way out to his car. Once there a reply came in.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you asked. Originally he wanted them taken in the normal way, at the lab. But this morning he said to bring them right to the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit,\" Jason said. At least that was sort of an answer, but where did they live? He was afraid to ask in case he'd been there many times before, it would seem like a very strange question. Just as he was about to give up and ask another message came through from Nikki:\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're finishing dinner. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt a glimmer of hope to his situation. \"I'm still at the disguise house.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response came back right away, \"Don't move. I'm coming for you! ;)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason relaxed and leaned back in his seat. Crisis averted.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later a dark green Jaguar pulled up and parked next to him. Jason's first thought was to wonder where the BMW from the previous night had gone. Then when he realized that both probably belong to Nikki his second thought was about just how much her family had. The Jaguar's door flew open and Nikki leapt to her feet. Now that she was no longer sitting at a table Jason was able to see Nikki's whole body, and the sight caused his penis to jump to attention and begin filling with blood. Her tight red dress was cut very short and ended just a little below the curve of her behind. Her long, sculpted legs were bare and she wore black high heels that added 3 inches to her height and caused her calves to bulge as she walked. Jason got out of his car just as Nikki got close. She threw her arms around his neck and pulled him into a kiss. His hands ran down her sides to the curve of her hips.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki finished the kiss with a tug on Jason's lower lip. \"Hi, baby,\" she said. \"You were awesome. How'd it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason motioned to the sample case on the seat of his car. \"Good, I hope. We'll just have to wait and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you get in my car. We'll take it to daddy together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Jason retrieved the case and climbed into the passenger side of Nikki's car. As they pulled out of the parking lot and onto the street Nikki took Jason's hand and placed it on her thigh near the hemline of her dress. Jason squeezed the supple flesh and once again marveled at just how smooth it was. As they drove Jason felt emboldened and slid his hand higher on her leg so that he was touching the fabric of her dress. Then he went even farther so that his thumb and first two fingers were under her dress. Then he slid his fingers around the curve of her thigh towards her sex. He continued slowly until he realized that she wasn't wearing underwear. He looked at her face and saw that she was smiling her gorgeous smile.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bad we're almost home. I'm really enjoying your touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed and squeezed her thigh one last time before sliding his hand back down toward her knee. Nikki let out a disappointed sigh as she pulled into a driveway with an automated gate. She clicked a controller on her dashboard and the gate opened. They drove up a long road through a small forest until they arrived at the front of the biggest house Jason has ever seen. He still didn't have an exact answer to his earlier thought regarding Nikki's family wealth, but he knew one thing for sure: they were VERY rich.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki parked her car and a valet came over to park it for her. Then she and Jason climbed the steps to the house. Once inside Jason was in awe of the architecture. The sculptures and paintings lining the walls made the foyer feel like a small museum. Nikki quickly led them upstairs and down a long hall to a large study where Nikki's father sat.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled and greeted them warmly. He was tall, a few inches over Jason's head, and very handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You made it!\" He wrapped his arms around Nikki in a loving hug.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi daddy. This is Jason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's father's eyes lit up. \"Jason! I'm so glad to finally meet you!!\" He extended his hand and shook Jason's. \"James Richards. No more emails or phone calls. How are you, son? I can't thank you enough for your help. We're moving faster than ever making breakthrough after breakthrough as a result of the information you've provided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged, \"Well, thanks. I'm happy to help.\" He held up the case for Dr. Richards to see.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Richards said. \"Excellent. I'm going to bring these straight down to the lab right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I was able to get what you needed. If not I'm happy to try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear boy. You've done more than enough. I'm sure we have plenty of viable cells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki approached her father, \"Daddy, would it be okay if Jason stayed here tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. We'll have one of the guest rooms made up for him right away. Jason, you're welcome to stay here as long as you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was a little surprised by Nikki's request, but excited as well. \"Thank you,\" he said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Richards gathered his notes and the sample case. \"Now you two have some fun tonight and I'll have the results from these collectors in the morning. Oh, and Jason, if you were as successful as I hope I'll have a very substantial sum of money for you in the morning as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nikki and Jason were alone she took his hands and guided them around her waist. \"I hope you don't mind staying here. We're getting so close to the final procedure I'm getting a little nervous. I just want you close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \"I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, what should we do. We could go down to the weight room and I could show off my power for you. Then we could take a dip in the hot tub. Or, if you're tired we could cuddle up and watch a movie and see what happens.\" Nikki turned her head sideways and leaned it on Jason's chest. \"So, what's it going to be, baby?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI am intrigued by your strength. And if we get in the jacuzzi does that mean I get to see you in a swimsuit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed. \u201cMaybe.\u201d She released him from her embrace and started for the door. \u201cBut first we need to get you changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki led Jason down a series of hallways to a large guest bedroom. She then showed him the huge walk-in closet that was filled with clothes of all sorts and sizes. It was like a much smaller version of the warehouse he\u2019d used for his disguise earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will be your room, and you can feel free to help yourself to any clothes in here. That drawer over there has swimming trunks in it. Find some you like and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Nikki gave Jason a quick kiss and left him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sorted through a few options until he found a pair of blue trunks that were his size. Once he'd changed Nikki returned. She had traded her red dress for a white robe that reached all the way to her ankles. She had the front of the robe cinched tight hiding her skin. Her reddish hair was now pulled back in a tight ponytail. Once inside she closed the door behind her and leaned against it sliding her left foot up the wood and exposing her leg through the opening in the front of the robe. At the sight of her incredibly sexy thigh Jason\u2019s mouth began to water and he felt his cock begin to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki slid her hand over the skin of her exposed leg and smiled at Jason. \u201cAre you ready to see what my body can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded emphatically and the pair left the room arm in arm. Nikki once again led Jason through a maze of hallways (he was already hopelessly lost) until they arrived at a home gym unlike any other he\u2019d ever seen. The far wall was one giant window that opened on the grounds behind the huge house. He saw a long patio with a pool and behind that was a walkway that led down to a large open field with a pond and some trees. In the distance beyond that the field ended at the edge of the forest. Jason entered the room further and saw that the two walls leading up to the window were made of floor to ceiling mirrors much like a dance studio. The center of the room was filled with very advanced strength training equipment. Most of the machines didn\u2019t even have plates or resistance bands and instead used hydraulic pressure to set the weight. The machines along the wall to the right looked much more like traditional gym equipment which also included a whole supply of free weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki strode through the room with confidence and picked up a comically large looking barbell from a rack along the wall. She turned back towards Jason and curled the weight a few times with ease, then she tossed it into the air flipping it as if it were some oversized coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said returning to where Jason stood, \u201cwhich body part should I work first? My arms?\u201d She held the barbell up so that he could see that it was labeled as weighing 300 pounds. Then she dropped it to the floor with a loud thud. \u201cMy legs?\u201d She pulled the white robe open like a curtain showing off her lightly muscled thighs and rounded calves for just a moment before hiding them again. \u201cHow about my chest?\u201d Nikki pulled the top of the robe open revealing her upper chest but keeping her breasts covered teasing Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see your bench press.\u201d Jason said trying to sound calm. The truth was his heart was racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d Nikki approached one of the newer pieces of workout equipment and began pressing buttons on the side to power it up, then she turned a large dial and Jason watched as a screen displayed a number that quickly grew the more Nikki turned. She stopped when the screen read 1,500 pounds. \u201cSo, this is what I lifted yesterday and it was kind of easy. Let's try more.\" Nikki turned the dial further until the resistance was set to 1,800 pounds. She turned to face Jason and untied her robe. She opened the garment and slid it off her shoulders revealing that she was completely naked underneath. She dropped the robe to the floor and put her hands on her hips angling one leg forward. \u201cI know you were looking forward to seeing me in a swimsuit, so I hope you\u2019re not upset. I just prefer the feel of lifting massive weights in the nude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to make do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my baby, such a trooper.\u201d Nikki turned and got into position on the bench. She gripped the steel bar and pushed up slightly to unlock the weight. Then Jason watched with wonder and excitement as she lowered the bar slowly toward her chest, held it about 5 inches above her erect nipples, then slowly pushed it back up. She grunted as her arms straightened out then she performed the motions again. She continued to press the immense weight up and down until she\u2019d completed 20 reps. Then she twisted the bar slightly to reengage the lock. She looked at Jason. \u201cImpressed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s incredible. Can I see you do some curls next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled and stood up. \u201cThank you, sweetie. Curls it is.\u201d She began walking towards the older equipment on the side of the gym passing Jason on the way. She made sure to sway her hips and put on the sexiest walk she could as she brushed up next to him. He looked down and marveled at her incredible body and wondered just how it was possible for so much strength to exist in such a compact package. Watching her from behind Jason watched the twist and shake of her gorgeous, round naked butt. He desperately wanted to reach out and grab it and squeeze it, but he also wanted to see her work her arms so he held off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an old bench press set up that already had a bar racked with several large plates on either side. Nikki approached and stood behind it as if she were about to spot some unseen person. She did a quick count of the weight. \u201c1,200 pounds,\u201d she said. Nikki then lifted the weight up off the rack and curled it to her chest. She took a step back to give herself room then lowered the bar slowly and curled it back up again. She did this ten times with grace and relative ease. Then she turned to face Jason. \u201cYou have no idea how amazing this feels. I feel like I could orgasm just by lifting weights. Just think about how much more powerful I\u2019ll be when I can expand my muscles too!.\u201d She held the weight up to her chest and took in a breath. Then she started grunting with effort. At first Jason wasn\u2019t sure what she was doing, but he knew that whatever it was took enough of her super strength to turn her face bright red, then he saw it: the bar Nikki held was bending. It went slowly at first, then as the metal softened and her leverage got better the bar bent quicker. The motion spurred Nikki on and she poured more strength into her effort until she had bent the weighted bar into a large \u201cU\u201d shape, then she pushed further criss-crossing the ends. She let out her breath with a deep roar then tossed the 1,200 pound weight aside not even flinching as it crashed to the floor with an ear splitting din.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I had plans to do all sorts of exercises for you and show you just how strong I am but I\u2019m way too turned on right now. We\u2019re going to skip right to the end.\u201d She walked up to Jason and pulled his shirt apart with her bare hands. Then she did the same with his shorts exposing his fully erect 15 inch cock. She then stood up and took Jason\u2019s hand leading him through a door to a small room with a large jacuzzi already foaming a bubbling. This room also had a large picture window just like the last, but there was also a defrosting system to keep the steam from building up. Nikki led Jason into the warm water where he sat and she straddled him. She slid herself down on his mighty penis and rode him. She was screaming in ecstasy a few minutes later, but they did not stop making love for over 2 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason awoke in the guest room with no real memory of how he got there. He assumed he\u2019d passed out last night and Nikki had carried him back here. She wasn\u2019t with him, but there was a note on the nightstand inviting him to the breakfast nook for some food. He sighed with relief when he saw she\u2019d included a hand drawn map on the back to guide him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled on some silk shorts that had been left out for him as well as a shirt (strangely it was already monogramed with his initials) then followed the directions to the dining room. He found NIkki at a table eating some fruit and wearing pink pajamas. She smiled her incredible smile when she saw Jason, but then put her finger to her lips in a shushing motion and pointed to the other side of the room. Jason spotted Nikki\u2019s father pouring himself a cup of coffee. He nodded his understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Richards turned around and saw Jason standing in the doorway. \u201cAh! There you are. Please help yourself to some breakfast. I have the results from the samples you brought.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Dr. Richards stood over the pair of them and beamed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, last night I was hoping to find a dozen or so of each cell; that is a relaxed and an expanded sample. What I got was nearly a hundred of each! I was able to pool more data last night than in the past month. Very well done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at Nikki who reached across and took his hand. She looked excited and nervous at the same time.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Richards continued, \"I'm very confident that we can reach a base level of two hundred percent expansion with a potential ceiling nearly twice that. That means that Nikki could potentially flex her arms to a circumference of 70 inches while still maintaining the density throughout the expanded tissue. She'll be, quite literally, the strongest being on the planet. And it's all thanks to you. Oh, which reminds me.\" He pulled an envelope out of his pocket and handed it to Jason. \"Here's the remainder of what I owe you. I added a little more since you did even better than I'd hoped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wanted to open the envelope right then and see how much the doctor had given him, but he thought it would be rude. Instead he said his thanks and put the slim parcel on the table.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you two, I'm off to the lab,\" Dr. Richards said. \"Have fun. Nikki I should be ready for you at one o'clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay daddy. I'll be ready.\" Again Jason noticed that she sounded nervous.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Dr. Richards was gone Jason turned to Nikki, \"Today? You're starting the treatment today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled and nodded.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that fast? He just got the new information last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shrugged. \"Daddy's nothing if not efficient. How much did he give you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tore into the envelope and pulled out a check. He stared at it for nearly a full minute taking in the amount. He simply couldn't let himself believe it, his brain wouldn't process the information.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed. \"C'mon, out with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... If I'm reading this right it says five hundred and eighty million dollars.\" Jason handed the check over to Nikki.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what it says, Rockefeller. Congratulations.\" Nikki walked around the table and sat on Jason's lap. She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. \"You earned it. Now I get to reap the benefits of your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everyone keep saying that? It's your dad who's doing all the work. I just stole some cells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's plenty important. If you hadn't told my father what you knew about Laura's condition in the first place he never would have even gotten started on this research. You did more than you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wondered what she meant by this. He had no memories of his actions in this reality before 2 days ago. \"I guess,\" he reluctantly agreed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled. \"Now I need you, baby. I'm starring to get nervous again. I have to go in that machine for a few days. It scares me a little. I know I'll be asleep, but that's kind of nerves racking too! Will you just hold me for a while. We can watch a movie or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Jason said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki hugged him tightly forcing the air from his lungs. \"Oh, sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent their morning watching Galaxy Quest in Nikki's room while Jason held the redhead in his arms. He found it strange that someone with such astounding, superhuman strength would need his comforting.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one o'clock arrived Nikki kissed Jason deeply. \"I have to go to daddy's lab. Could you please stay here at the house until I get out. It could be a few days. Is that okay? I just want to know you're close and that you'll be there when I get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'll stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She stood up and started to leave. Then she stopped and turned around. \"Just think, the next time you see me I'll have the power to grow into the biggest, strongest, most beautiful woman in the whole world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled. \"You may still need this treatment to become the biggest, but you're already the most beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's gorgeous smile spread across her face. Then she turned and left Jason all alone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason\u2019s time without Nikki in the large house was nerve racking.  He would have much preferred to go to his own house than be a stranger in Nikki\u2019s mansion.  He was taken care of well enough and was getting lost less frequently, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki promised that her Dad would text him to keep him up to date on her progress.  He wasn\u2019t sure how long he would have to wait and as the hours went by he became worried.  Just when he was about to call Dr. Richards against Nikki\u2019s request, a text finally came in from Dr. Richards that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is going well.  Nikki is in the chamber and her body is absorbing the proteins at the expected level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason scrunched his face.  That wasn\u2019t much information.  He supposed that Dr. Richards was busy so he brushed it off.  But that night was long and fitful as nothing came thru.  The next one came in the morning as he laid in the bed staring at the ceiling, strangely missing his own bedroom and \u201cceiling Laura\u201d.  As he read the text the hair on the back of his neck bristled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad to increase protein intake.  Nikki\u2019s muscle density increasing at higher levels than expected.  Muscle expansion capability is unknown, but with the increased intake the level is expected to raise that ability closer to the ceiling than not.  Muscles appear to be growing larger in neutral state also.  Everything is still within expected parameters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to imagine her strength growing to incredible levels and her muscle expansion meeting and then eclipsing Laura\u2019s.  His large penis rose and hardened out of respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got up and paced a bit, finding his way to the breakfast area and munching on a few things.  He looked at his phone constantly and finally decided to head toward the theater room to watch movies that afternoon.  But even the distraction of the Kurt Russell version of The Thing wasn\u2019t enough to keep his concentrating as he continued to pause the movie to stare at his phone, waiting for the next update.  He knew that Nikki was expected home tomorrow afternoon, but that seemed like eternity right now.  When the phone buzzed at 2:12 he almost fell out his chair reaching for the phone.  His hands shook as he opened the text from Dr. Richards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad to increase protein intake again.  Nikki is still doing well, but has expanded a bit more than expected at this phase while in her relaxed state.  With the increase in protein intake we are re-calculating the expected muscle density and potential expansion capability.  Nothing to be worried about.  Nikki is a remarkable girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped at the thought.  Just how big and strong would she become?  How much would she be able to expand her muscles while flexing?  If his ceiling was 400%, was that now a reality or would she be able to go bigger?  He found himself reaching toward his throbbing cock and stroking it faster.  Closing his eyes he soon climaxed thinking about Nikki lifting tanks over her head and tossing them easily to the side.  Sighing, he smiled a bit as his tension was abated for the moment.  He cleaned up and went back to the movie.  It wasn\u2019t long however that he was staring at the phone again, waiting for the next update.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued to watch movies late into the night and he nodded off in the large leather seat.  Even so, he had a hard time sleeping, waiting nervously for the next text.  He finally fell off after 2:00AM and jumped when the phone buzzed.  He grumbled and quickly woke up, looking up at the clock on the wall.  It was 7:14.  Jason bit his lip, hardly wanting to read the text.  He just wanting to read everything was OK and that Nikki would be back this afternoon as originally promised.  He picked it up and read slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNikki needed yet another protein intake increase which is driving the updated calculations.  As we feed her results back into our computer model we are re-adjusting our expected output.  She is now exceeding even my greatest expectations.  We are unsure of what the final result will be at this point, but her vital signs indicate she is in no pain as her body continues to transform.  We expect no more than 6 additional hours in the chamber.  I will text again when the process is complete.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out the breath he was holding while he read.  He could now only wonder what exceeding his greatest expectations meant.  Jason licked his lips and looked around.  He needed to find some breakfast and shower.  He wanted to be ready for Nikki when she got back.  He shook his head as he headed in the direction of the nearest bathroom he remembered.  He paused as he stumbled forward.  How do you get ready for a Supergirl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason only got lost once in walking the mansion and was relieved when he found the kitchen again.  He ate, took a shower, got dressed and paced the hallways.  They had agreed to meet outside by the pool.  He hung out in his room, figuring once he got the next text he would have plenty of time to head toward the pool.  Trying to relax, he channel surfed with the TV in his bedroom.  He now felt he knew how an expecting father must feel.  When his phone finally buzzed again, it was after two.  Trying not to hyperventilate, he closed his eyes, opened them again and read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood news.  Well, better than good.  The process is complete.  As you likely expected, Nikki exceeded even my wildest expectations.  As we finished the process we woke Nikki up and I was able to talk to her as the protein bath drained.  We should have her dried off soon and we\u2019ll be driving back.  Nikki asked that she fill you in on everything.  She wants to surprise you.  We\u2019ll need her for tests later, but I agreed to let her go home first to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a \u201cHoly crap\u201d and put the phone in his pocket.  What could exceeding his wildest expectation possibly mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and looked at himself in the mirror.  He was wearing a set of custom fit dress pants he never remembered getting sized and a monogrammed short sleeve silk shirt.  The leather shoes were casual, but he couldn\u2019t imagine how much they cost.  He figured the least he could do was look good for Nikki.  As he walked down hallways he fortunately remembered how to get out and was soon by the pool.  He was happy it had only taken a couple of minutes.  The pool was off-set a bit away from the house as there was a large concrete party area with enough space for a band and plenty of tables and chairs.  Several large grills were off to the side.  The backyard was surrounded by large trees and he could see several large structures a bit away from the pool.  He figured at least one was for the various garden and pool tools and another was some type of steel support structure that he couldn\u2019t quite figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he headed toward a poolside chair he felt a strong breeze push against him from his right and he turned to figure out what had caused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw opened involuntarily as his eyes focused.  It was Nikki!  And she was naked.  Her hair was wet but wild and her body was something out of a wet dream.  Jason blinked as he tried to process the fact that he was looking at Nikki.  She cocked her head to side and thrust out her right hip in a knee weakening sexy move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there stud.  Miss me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could only continue to stare and blink.  For not only had Nikki somehow made it back home faster than should be possible, but she was now sporting a body with enough muscles to blow away the best\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason unlocked Laura's iPhone again and found the Alterations app was still on his own profile. He had intended to make some changes to Laura, but now that he looked at himself again he decided he could afford to make a few more changes to himself first. After all, he hadn't really had the opportunity to change anything but his own muscles, so why not see what else he could do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason examined the 3D model of himself with glee. His massive muscles looked incredible from every angle, and he felt so strong and powerful. He knew that he was already bigger than any other guy around, but he couldn't help but want a little more. The trouble was that his frame was packed pretty tight already. So the first step was an obvious one, he had to be taller. Jason touched the height slider and moved it slowly upward. He stretched his body further and further until the numbers along the top told him he was 6 feet 10 inches tall. He still looked huge, but there was a little more room for additional muscle. Jason hungrily beefed himself up even further. By the time he was satisfied the rendered avatar was projected to be 485 pounds. Jason shrugged and pushed the slider a little further to make himself an even 500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jason took his finger off the muscle slider the phone paused for a moment then showed the new enlarged Jason wearing a tiny yellow speedo and nothing else. Jason gasped at the sight of the giant pictured and his disregard for clothing. Before today Jason would have never dreamed of wearing anything so skimpy, but with the body he was about to build he could completely understand the desire to show it off in such a manner.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tapped through other options to see what else he could do. Near the muscle mass slider was another slider for muscle density. Jason adjusted that one but did not see any physical difference. He assumed this was a way to increase muscle strength without adding more size. With an excited tingle in his belly Jason pushed the slider to the halfway point. He didn't know how much stronger than normal that would make him, but he was excited to find out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason zoomed in on his own face and made a few adjustments to make himself more handsome. He'd never considered himself to be good looking so a chance to make himself undeniably sexy was one he couldn't pass up. When he zoomed back out he decided there was one last thing he wanted to change. He'd always had an above average penis, but now that his body was so much bigger his unit looked tiny. When he was done with his adjustments his flaccid penis was 9 inches long and 3 inches in diameter while his erect member was 17 inches from base to tip and 5 inches across. He even made his testicles bigger so that they were as big around as kiwi fruit. When he zoomed back out to look at the full image again it paused and updated so that the speedo was slightly bigger, but it was still packed tightly with a massive unit that looked like it could break free.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked his digital self over. Was there anything else to add? He'd made himself taller and more handsome with more muscle, superhuman strength and a massive cock? Sounded like a pretty complete list. Hands trembling with excitement Jason tapped the \"Apply\" button.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warning box appeared on screen with a message: \"Warning! Due to extreme historical adjustments other profiles will be affected by these changes. The greatest changes will affect the following profiles:<br>\r\n-Friedman, Laura<br>\r\n-Friedman, Vanessa<br>\r\n-Friedman, Gregory<br>\r\n-Richards, Nicole<br>\r\nMinor changes will occur on [893] additional profiles. Please select \"See More\" for a complete list of profiles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the \"See More\" button were choices to cancel or continue. Jason thought for a few moments.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the changes to me are so extreme that others will be changed too, maybe Greg sees my huge body and works even harder... or gives up all together.\" Jason laughed to himself. \"But who the heck is Nicole Richards? And why is she affected as much as Laura, Vanessa, and Greg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged. It didn't bother him that others would be changed along with him, in fact it seemed only natural. He figured he could fix anything that was too strange with the app and no one would be the wiser. He tapped the \"continue\" button and instantly the phone became hot in his hand again. He dropped it to the couch next to him and eagerly awaited his bigger, stronger body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt an explosion inside himself as his strength shot off the charts and his muscles began to rapidly expand and harden. Jason looked down and saw that his shirt was gone. He couldn't see beyond his expanding chest, but a quick feel told him that he was wearing nothing but a tiny and strained speedo. Jason was about to stand so he could enjoy his new height and overall gargantuan size when things around him began to shimmer and he got very dizzy. His eyes wanted to close and he could feel himself passing out, but he forced himself to stay awake. The room around him was changing. Despite his attempts to stay conscious Jason's eyes closed and he passed out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he regained himself Jason realized he was...</span></div></div>",

He didn't think he'd been out long, perhaps only a few seconds, but it was hard to tell since the room around him looked different. He felt almost like he had slept for a decade and the decor had naturally adjusted around him. He was about to try and pick out the details of what was different when something on the tv caught his attention: himself.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason realized that he was watching a news story about himself and he turned up the volume to listen. He couldn't believe the sight of his own body on the television, he dwarfed everyone around him. The Jason on the screen stood surrounded by military personnel on a field next to a huge M1 tank. He was wearing black spandex shorts that formed to his massive thighs and glutes (and did nothing to disguise the enormous penis within) and a black shirt that molded itself to his chest. People clapped for Jason who smiled and flexed his upper body causing the shirt to rip open in several places which he then pulled off revealing his bare and pumped chest.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile these images played the reporter spoke, \"Worlds strongest man and self proclaimed '\u00fcber male' Jason Sullivan made good on a promise he'd made to bench press an M1 tank for charity. Sullivan toured the country getting people to pledge money to his Strong Arms group, a muscular dystrophy non-profit organization. Sullivan said he was able to raise 2.3 million dollars which billionaire Dr. James Richards said he would triple if Sullivan was able to complete 5 bench press repetitions with the 65 ton tank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image on screen switched to Jason in position under the tank. He placed his hands on the steel structure and pushed. To everyone's shock and amazement the enormous steel tank lifted off the ground. Jason's arms were pumped to insane size and his face was red and shaking from the effort of bench pressing over 65 tons.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason sat on the couch he couldn't believe his eyes. He felt like he was one of the spectators cheering himself on, hoping to see the Jason on tv succeed. And succeed he did, for a moment it looked as though he wasn't going to make it; after finishing 3 complete reps he was sweating and his arms looked to be shaking. Jason slowly pushed the tank up a fourth time and nearly faltered when lowering it. Jason sucked in a deep breath and, to the uproarious cheers of the spectators, lifted the tank up one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went nuts and Jason stood back up next to the M1 where a man handed him a check for 7 million dollars. Jason took a deep breath and struck a victorious double bicep pose flexing his gargantuan 40 inch arms.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter had been speaking over all of this, but Jason was so wrapped up in the drama of his own story he didn't hear anything until now. \"To celebrate his victory Sullivan proposed to his long time sweetheart-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe television was turned off before he could hear more and a voice spoke from behind him. \"Don't you ever get tired of watching yourself on tv?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned and saw....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason\u2019s eyes nearly bugged out at the sight before him.  It was Laura.  But not the same Laura he knew, but an amped up, buffed out Laura!  She was fricking huge!  She had on a very pretty red athletic top with blacked trimmed that hugged her massive upper body like a thick second skin.  Her chest pushed out generously with bulging pecs and large breasts.  Her large arms hung away from her wide back and even relaxed, large boulder shaped muscles twitched and veins snaked their way from her wrist up to her football sized shoulders.  She was standing behind the couch so he didn\u2019t get a chance to pull in just how tall or big she really was when his attention was pulled back to the TV as the announcer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura Friedman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward to watch as the Laura on the screen practically skipped forward.  She was wearing a similar styled top, but this one was pink with dark red trim.  She had on matching spandex shorts and pink athletic shoes.  Her long brown hair was in a pony tail and when she reached Jason they embraced and kissed.  The crowd cheered even louder as Jason blushed as he stared at the scene.  Laura placed her hand on his massive shoulder behind him and leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I do love seeing this nearly as much as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned his head to smile at her and Laura leaned in to give him a kiss.  He returned it gently and was once again pulled back to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just to show that she\u2019s more than capable of holding on to a super strong man like Jason, Laura is about to attempt to squat the same tank Sullivan just bench pressed!  Can you believe it folks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Laura snickering over his shoulder as he leaned in again to see the Laura on TV head under the tank and position herself with TV Jason following behind to spot her.  He could tell that Laura had to be taller than she was from before he played with her phone, but not by a lot as he looked be a good foot taller.  Jason watched with fascination as a camera zoomed in on Laura as she took the huge bar off the rack and slowly stood up!  Her face was showing the effort as she pushed out labored breaths.  But with the Jason on TV encouraging her she was able to squat the incredible weight three times before setting it back down.  Her thighs ballooned with massive muscles from the effort, although once again, he had a hard time knowing just how big they from watching it on TV.  As the crowd went nuts again, the Jason and Laura walked away from the tank, waving to the cheers.  The narrator broke in again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there goes the strongest couple on the planet, waving to the excited fans as they head off to plan what will likely be the biggest wedding of the year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura reached out to the remote and turned the TV off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard to believe that was just last week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, lost in his own history, nodded weakly.  \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura snickered.  \u201cAnd to think you were worried that I\u2019d be able to squat that weight.  Just give me enough time and I\u2019ll be able to bench press that sucker too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked around the couch to sit down next to him.  She was barefoot and had on matching spandex in a similar style to that she had on TV.  Her legs were ripped and huge, yet flowed with a sexy, animalistic presence into her narrow, muscle filled waist.  Her hair was long and thick hanging across her broad shoulders and bouncing as she walked.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few things to do before we hit the gym today.  I think Vanessa wants to meet to discuss marketing her line of athletic wear.  I always knew she had an eye for fashion, but I had never thought she\u2019d have such good business sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded dumbly, trying to remain calm and hoping Laura would keep talking so he wouldn\u2019t do or say something that would give anything away.  Things were certainly looking like a dream come true right now and he didn\u2019t want to blow it.  Laura apparently didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then you agreed to stop by and visit Dr. Richards at his office today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and smiled at him.  He had to blink as her sunny disposition made her practically glow in front of him.  He was having a hard time not getting lost her eyes.  Once again, Laura continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I was thinking, we could both see Vanessa at her shop or I could see Vanessa so you could go see Dr. Richards.  That way we can get to the gym even sooner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way she said \u2018sooner\u2019 he knew what she wanted to do.  And keeping her happy seemed like a great idea.  But on the other hand if they separated he\u2019d be lost in this new history.  This time he knew he couldn\u2019t just nod dumbly.  She was waiting for him to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo clearing his throat he decided to..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason wanted to keep Laura happy, especially now that she was apparently his fianc\u00e9, but he really didn't think he'd be able to function without her. Better to stick with his bride to be; besides, he was really enjoying watching her move with her new body. Just watching Laura smile at him was getting Jason turned on and he could feel the stirrings in his loins.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's smile widened as Jason continued to stare at her. \"Well? What do you want to do?\" she asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off by a quick ripping sound. He and Laura looked down to the source of the notice to find that Jason's penis had been quietly hardening and his tiny yellow speedo could no longer take the pressure. Now Jason's enormous member stood tall, well on its way to its full 17 inch length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cocked an eyebrow at Jason. \"Oooh, is that what you want to do?\" A sly grin slid across her lips. \"Do my huge muscles get you hard?\" She raised her right arm and flexed an insane 29 inch bicep then took hold of his fully erect penis and gave it a good squeeze. \"Mmmmm, I should say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could feel animalistic urges overtake him. He now had the power to take what he wanted and he wanted Laura. With a low growl he scooped her huge body up in his arms and took her upstairs to her room. Jason quickly tore Laura's athletic outfit off of her rock hard body, then the few remnants of his speedo.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura squealed with delight as Jason began sucking on her nipples and bitting her neck and shoulder.\u00a0Jason rammed his massive cock into her (or as much as he could) and began pumping away, doing his best to reign in his titanic strength. Within moments she was howling in the throughs of orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could hardly believe his own stamina. He never got tired, not even close. He felt like he could keep this up all day. However, after 45 minutes of pumping, grinding, and tossing Laura around her room, Jason came hard. Several shotgun blasts of semen rocketed out of his monster cock and sent spasms up his spine.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of muscled lovers lay in each others thick arms for a while before Laura sprang out of bed. \"Ok, now we really need to go.\" She pulled some clothes out of her dresser and tossed them to Jason to put on while she went to the bathroom to straighten herself up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled the black shorts on and the white top which had a black stripe down the side. The shirt was long sleeved and made of the same stretchy material as the shorts so it hugged every swell and bulge. Jason stood before the mirror and flexed watching as the top expanded with his muscles effortlessly. The words \"\u00dcber Male\" we're printed in bold black letters across his chest. Jason put his hands on his hips and flexed his pectorals. He couldn't help but laugh at the way the words spread and distorted ahead of his enormous chest.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found some shoes near the door that looked like they would be his size and slid them on just as Laura returned. She pulled on a similar outfit to the one that Jason wore except her top was red, sleeveless and had an circular opening at her stomach to show off her cobblestone abs. Instead of saying \"\u00dcber Male\" hers said \"\u00dcber Woman\" across the chest. She pulled her hair back in a ponytail and gave Jason a huge kiss.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'll see you at the gym later?\" she asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking I'd go with you to see Vanessa.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left and climbed into Laura's car, a big black Hummer, and drove across town to Vanessa's studio. When they arrived Vanessa greeted them wearing a suit, which shocked Jason into near silence. He'd never seen her wear anything professional in her life, but she looked amazing in her black blazer and matching pencil skirt. Jason couldn't be sure, but he thought her breasts were larger than they had been when he'd seen her last. Her white button up shirt was pulled tight over her bosom and Jason had to do everything in his power not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason also noticed another difference in Vanessa's appearance: her calves were noticeably larger. Vanessa had always been pretty fit but these were the calves of a full blown athlete. As she strode around in her high heeled shoes Jason watched her calf muscles flex and harden into stark definition with a clear cleft below the heart shaped muscle. Jason began to wonder what the rest of her looked like now and he scanned her body for hints of expanded musculature. Clearly his and Laura's added girth had an effect on the entire family; Jason began to wonder what Greg looked like now.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa took them around her studio and showed them several samples from upcoming clothing releases which were, as it turned out, marketed under Jason's name. Each of the items they saw were made from the same stretchy material that Jason was currently wearing. It was some new material called \"expandex\" that was supposed to grow with the wearer so they didn't have to constantly buy new clothes if they made big gains. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finished looking over and approving the new designs Vanessa led them to her office. Once they were inside and the door was closed behind them Vanessa gave Laura a huge smile.\u00a0\"It's done.\" she said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura lit up and began hugging Vanessa. \"It is!?! Can I see it? I want to try it on!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Vanessa said. \"But you know he needs to get out first.\" She motioned to Jason. \"But don't worry, I've got something for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very confused Jason was led to a large dressing room with mirrors on every wall. He had no idea what Vanessa was talking about, until he was handed a garment bag containing an extra large tuxedo. He deduced that Vanessa and Laura were discussing Laura's wedding dress.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason slipped into his tux. He found it was made of a thicker style of expandex. So while it was rather tight, he could flex and move without worry of bursting his seams. To make sure he flexed his 40 inch arms. The sleeves of his jacket stretched and molded to his biceps so tightly he could make out his veins through the thick material, but it never showed signs of ripping.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it fit.\" Vanessa's voice came from behind him. Jason looked over his shoulder in the mirror to see her.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of snug, but I get the feeling that that's the point.\" he said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point? Those were your exact specifications!\" Vanessa walked up behind him and began feeling the way the jacket and pants contoured to Jason's body.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I....uh.\" Jason stammered. Both because he was unaware of his previous conversation, but also because he saw that Vanessa had removed her jacket and rolled up the sleeves of her dress shirt. He saw clearly that her forearms were swollen with muscle, not enough to put her in league with bodybuilders, but Jason was confident that she could wipe the floor with the competition in a figure show. He also spotted that she'd opened the top button on her shirt and Jason now had very little doubt that her breasts were bigger. Her DD's had grown into something closer to a G cup, and tight cleavage was visible through the opening at the top of her shirt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed. \"You're just as weird as you ever were. You'll notice it's not quite as tight as you wanted, but since the wedding is still several months away I wanted to give you room to grow, so you'd better continue to pack on the pounds, ok?\" She crouched down in front of him to adjust the legs of his pants and Jason got a clear look down her shirt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat and looked straight ahead. \"Uh, yeah. Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed again. \"No matter how big you get you'll always be that geek from down the street to me.\" She wrapped her fingers around his thigh and squeezed. \"But oh my, how you've grown.\" She continued to paw at him, adjusting the tux here and there.\u00a0She stood up and looked him in the eye, even in her 4 inch heels she was still more than half a foot shorter than he was. \"Sometimes I think breaking up with you was the biggest mistake I ever made, but when I see how happy you make Laura I feel much better.\" She took his face in her hands and pulled him down for a quick kiss.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's head was spinning, he wished there was some sort of history book he could read from to get him up to speed on his own life.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had just opened his mouth to speak when suddenly the door opened and Laura walked in. She was back in her regular outfit and looked a bit distressed.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Jason asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got off the phone with Greg,\" she said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed. \"What does that asshole want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shrugged. \"I'm not entirely sure, he sounded drunk. And angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what else is new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at Jason. \"Honey, I kind of want to check on Greg but a part of me just wants to ignore him. Plus I know we need to go see Dr. Richards. What do you think?\"</span></div></div>",

An angry Greg didn\u2019t sound like a good place to go, so he went with the schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can address the Greg situation later.  I think we have an appointment with Dr. Richards soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to sound confident even though he had no idea what time the appointment was or what it was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.  Although I doubt he\u2019ll be any happier to see us than Greg would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to remain straight faced and nodded once again.  Greg quickly took off the tux and was back in the clothes they started their trip with.  They hopped into the hummer and Jason finally had an idea about how to address his lack of current knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Laura, would you mind if I borrow your phone for a moment?  I\u2019d like to Google myself and see what\u2019s out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \u201cSure thing silly.  Afraid of something scandalous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled nervously.  \u201cNo.  Just making sure our brand is in good standing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded and smiled as she fired up the car and started driving.  Jason did a quick check for the alterations ap and strangely found it missing.  He bit his lower lip with concern, but figured he would have time to address that problem later.  Right now he needed to get caught up.  Jason went to Wikipedia and got a quick history lesson.  The article stated that he had started to grow larger a few years ago without any explanation and the article didn\u2019t seem to offer anything concrete.  It mentioned Vanessa briefly and Laura quite a bit.  It seemed Laura started growing larger once they were a couple.  He sighed in frustration.  Laura glanced over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything wrong?  Don\u2019t tell me Greg posted something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason kept his eye on the phone, thumbing through other articles, most of which described various events and business deals.  His brain then caught up to Laura\u2019s tone about Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nothing from Greg.  What are you worried about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura furrowed her brow.  \u201cOur secret silly.  Only you, me, Vanessa and Greg really know.  Although I suspect Dr. Richards knows too.  That\u2019s what the meeting is about.  I\u2019m kind of glad I came along.  He can be persuasive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed, now only wishing he could ask a direct question.  Before he could figure out how to follow up, Laura had pulled in front of a large building.  The sign displayed \u201cRichard\u2019s Advancements.\u201d  Laura got out of the car and Jason followed behind as they headed for the front door.  The building was beautiful with a fountain and glass walls in the front.  Laura moved quickly and was talking to the receptionist and the guards.  The guard called ahead and soon a drop dead gorgeous woman in a perfectly cut black dress approached them.  The short skirt revealed toned, tight legs and the top had plenty of fantastic cleavage exposed.  Her red hair was thick and shined brilliantly.  Her green eyes were inviting and wild.  She was looking right at Jason, but Laura stepped in front of him as he instinctively put his arm out to shake her extended hand.  Laura practically growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Nicole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stopped and turned her attention to Laura.  \u201cOh, hello Laura.  I didn\u2019t think you were coming with Jason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s eyes narrowed.  \u201cI\u2019m sure.  Now are you taking us to see your father or were you just here to hit on my future husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood there dumbfounded as Nicole\u2019s expression remained somewhere between happy and bored.  The fact that Laura\u2019s huge muscles didn\u2019t intimidate Nicole was perplexing and was turning him on, which he immediately tried to halt lest he started sporting another embarrassing monster erection.  After an uncomfortably long pause, Nicole simply smiled, turned and waved her arm out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight this way.  Daddy is expecting you.  Or at least Jason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grumbled and Jason moved close to her to make sure he was showing her support.  They were soon in a large room and walked toward a very large desk.  Nicole walked around to stand next to an older looking very handsome man.  The man stood up and reached across the desk to shake Jason\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Sullivan!  So good to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat he quickly turned to Laura and shook her hand.  \u201cAnd Laura Freidman.  You\u2019re looking better than ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kept her Poker face on and nodded as she shook his hand.  Dr. Richards continued.  \u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Laura sat down and Jason looked at papers turned toward him.  It looked like a contract of some kind.  Dr. Richards sat down while Nicole stood next to him, leaning forward a bit to reveal her tantalizing cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Mr. Sullivan, as we discussed, I have been happy to this point with your cooperation concerning our investigation into your super human abilities and would now like to move on to further tests.  The documents in front of you allows us to take samples of bodily fluids as I discussed with you on the phone.  The contract is for 50 million dollars.  All you need to do is sign.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s eyes widened at the thought of having 50 million dollars, but before he could say anything, Laura spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  We\u2019ve reviewed the contract and feel that Jason is going to pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Richards looked shocked.  Nicole\u2019s expression remained unchanged from her seemingly mild indifference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had a verbal contract Ms. Friedman.  Do you think that 7 million dollar check for your charity was just to see Jason lift a damn tank?  That was part of the deal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood up and Jason quickly did the same.  Her expression was stoic, his was confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were under no obligation to give that money and we are under no obligation to sign your contract.  Now if you\u2019ll excuse us, we have another appointment.  We can find our way out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Richards stood up, his face red.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grabbed Jason by the wrist and yanked him forward as she walked quickly out the door.  Jason glanced over his shoulder to see Nicole smiling seductively at him.  He had a strange feeling that Dr. Richards was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they climbed into the Hummer, Laura turned to look at Jason.  \u201cYou could have backed me up in there you know.  What were going to do if I wasn\u2019t along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason flushed red and started to sweat.  \u201cI, I would have done the same thing.  That\u2019s, uh, what we agreed to do, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled.  \u201cI sure hope that\u2019s what you would have done.  Knowing you, you would have agreed to review the contract again and brought it home.  At least that\u2019s over for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura fired up the engine and stomped on the accelerator, roaring the engine.  She slammed the car into drive and pealed out of the parking lot.  Jason clumsily snapped in his seat belt as Laura purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we can finally get to the gym!  You know much I love to work out after we have sex!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was glad to move on to some place that wouldn\u2019t feel as awkward.  Of course he figured he would have to pay attention to what Laura did in the gym since he didn\u2019t work out with weights prior to his phone aided upgrade.  Laura pulled into a spot up front reserved for them and practically jumped out of the car, Jason quickly caught up and they entered the gym together.  They were greeted with several happy welcomes and Jason followed Laura to an area off to the side with a large double door.  Laura turned to the girl at the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be working out in private Kelsey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey smiled as Jason followed Laura through the doors.  He stopped as Laura turned and shut the doors behind them.  The weights and machines were something out of a comic book.  Huge plates, bars and cables filled an area big enough to hold four football fields.  Laura moved close and gave him a kiss.  He pulled her closer and he started running his hands along her incredible physique.  Within moments he was sporting another erection and poked Laura in the abs.  Laura pushed away for a moment and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, big boy.  You really want to have sex twice before we work out?  I know you have a hell of drive and I love you death for it, but you remember the last time we did that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason held her firmly, not letting her go.  He just had to know more and figured he had his in.  \u201cEnlighten me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pushed a bit harder, but Jason resisted.  She giggled and allowed Jason to pull her closer.  \u201cYou know I won\u2019t mind, so if you\u2019re ready to fend off a few explanations I\u2019m all yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason released her and pulled off his shirt, Laura did the same and they kicked off their shoes and were soon rolling around in a padded area.  Jason was soon on top, pumping away.  As he climaxed Laura squealed with delight and with a strong tug, moved around and was soon on top, riding Jason like a bucking bronco.  Another climax followed and Laura leaned back, her incredible body slick with sweat.  She smiled, licked her lips and brought her arms up into a double bicep pose and squeezed her fists, causing the muscles to harden and pop.  Jason was breathing hard as he stared at her arms.  They looked even bigger than they did this morning.  Laura moaned and then snickered at Jason\u2019s somewhat confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are looking at me that way silly.  You know that your juice is like a super steroid.  So while you can grow bigger and stronger at an incredible rate when you work out, I can\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The slow rhythmic thrusting grow more intense with his caresses which in turn caused him to quicken the pace of his hands, and with the quickening of his hands she quickened the pace of her thrusting.  Before long, a light sheen of sweat covered the two lovers and the first drops of precum soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura moaned softly feeling the precum begin to work their magic and raised both of her huge biceps into a monstrous flex revealing her glorious might for Jason to see.  His eyes nearly bugged out of his head as he watched those marvelous striated and massive veiny peaks surge higher than any other woman and almost every man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she whispered as she lowered her arms and again raised them into another monstrous flex.  Jason could swear those arms were now larger, more massive, with bigger peaks, denser muscles, and thicker veins than they were for the last flex.  The thought sent him over the edge and spurt after spurt of the powerful muscle-building cum flowed into his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the surge, she quickly followed his lead releasing a flood about his waist.  Her body quivering, swelling, heaving, fell on top of him forcefully.  Her heaving breasts pressed against his massive chest and her lips found his and locked on a powerful and forceful kiss.  Her eyes were full of fire and passion, \"Again, she whispered.  We've never done three.  I have to know, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was half-demanding and half-begging.  In his current state, he didn't think he could refuse.  This time, it was faster, more intense.  Ground-shaking thrusts turned the bench they were making love on into a twisted heap of metal and plastic as their animalistic passions rose to a crescendo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't take his eyes off of her upper body.  Not just because it filled his filled his field of view, but also because with each animalistic thrust, she seemed to be swelling ever larger right before his eyes, and as her heaving breasts jutted out beneath massive, thick, amd rippling pectorals she curled her arms around in the most awesome display of muscle Jason thought he had ever witnessed.  Again, his sheer excitement pushed him over the edge and she followed immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor long moment, she lay gasping on top of him.  Her body swelling from Jason's super-coctail.  Light kisses peppered both massive bodies as they recovered, but it wouldn't last nearly as long as Jason had desired for very quickly she peeled herself off the top of him rose to her full massive and hugely immense glory.  Jason could hardly believe his eyes.  She had seemingly added inches everywhere and the glow about her seemed to show that she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNude, she strolled over to the weight bench and once there, she turned one massive shoulder layered with ultra-dense muscle and smiled at him.  \"Come on, babe.  I'm not wasting one moment more.  Spot me, I want to see if the effects of multiple doses are additive or exponential.  Either way, I'm pumping new record weights today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped and whispered, \"exponential?\" and wondered what he had done, but wonder as much as he did.  The thought and curiosity made him hard all over.</span></div></div>",

Jason's penis started to stiffen at the sight of Laura working out nude.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, big guy. Let me finish my exercises. Although I can't wait for you to inject me with your seed again so I can grow again!\" said Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she was done, and she came over to Jason. After working out, she was as big as him! If he injected her for a fourth time, she would no doubt be bigger than him, and he'd likely never catch up to her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment, Laura. I'm wondering, if my seed can cause you to grow, I wonder if you have something that will make me grow.\" said Jason.<br>\r\nLaura pondered for a moment, liking the idea, then jammed his penis in between her breasts.<br>\r\n\"Maybe my breast milk could do that for you. After all, milk is good for the body, right?\" said Laura.<br>\r\nJason smiled and started sucking her nipples and massaging her massive breasts.

It looked like he wouldn't stop, but his biceps stopped at 39 and a half inches. His abs grew thicker than bricks, and soon Laura could feel his penis lengthen in between her breasts. Next came Jason's thighs and calves, and soon they grew enough to put trees to shame in terms of thickness. Laura looked up at her now humongous partner, who was 7', 565 pounds, and a new 20 inch cock.<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jason! You're huge! My milk is like your seed!\" said Laura excitedly.<br>\r\n\"Heh, now I have no problem having sex with you. If you grow much bigger than me, I can always catch up, and vice-versa!

It didn't take long for Laura to lactate again, but Jason kept growing. Laura could feel Jason suck with more intensity as he grew. Soon it was too much for Laura. She lactated once... twice... thrice... and finally a fourth time before she stopped. Jason stood over her, still growing. He had to be over 7'6\" by now, and he was still growing! His pecs grew huge, and his 45 inch biceps were getting bigger than basketballs! His abs became a 10-pack, and his legs grew thicker than large oil drums. His cock kept growing in between Laura's breasts, to the point where the head of his cock was almost as big as her head! And he still kept growing, until he reached 7'10\", 654 pounds of muscle, and a 25 inch long cock. Laura was amazed at how big she just made Jason.<br>\r\n\"Umm... I think I might've made you a little too big...\" said Laura in a worrying tone.<br>\r\n\"What, you don't like my huge muscles?\" said Jason.<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's not that at all.

Then he also began to suck like a tiger from the breasts of Laura, rubbing in a gentle and wild at the same time. Sex now that the two boys were doing was even more powerful, extreme and miraculous than they could imagine. Each harbored another with passion and desire to do more and more, without ever stopping. Soon the two boys began to grow, becoming exponentially more every second. They grew in a synchronized manner and without doing it on purpose, neither could overpower the other, in terms of size, muscles and lust. Thanks to the sperm of Jason, Laura's breasts grew and was always full of milk. Thanks to Laura's milk, the penis of Jason growing and it was always full of spunk. Not to mention the rest! The size of the two boys became colossal, passing within a few minutes the nine feet high. Their muscles reached and exceeded the limits more unthinkable. Their sensuality reached and exceeded the peaks inviolable. By dint of growing, the two young titans never tired to have sex, which increased in pleasure and fury in every passing second. Jason's penis exploded sperm, which was absorbed in the body of Laura. Breast Laura expelled ocean of milk with the same power of a geyser, and Jason did not miss a single drop. More Jason nursed those gigantic breasts, Laura felt more powerful and desired. More Jason pumped his sperm inside his girlfriend, the more he felt a god of Mount Olympus. Continuing at this pace, it became more exponentially with the passage of time, the pair reached twelve feet high, their bodies overflowing of muscles and sensuality, and screaming and moaning of pleasure lustful and wild.</span></div></div>",

Seemingly every set, every rep, even every movement caused her muscles to respond and grow.  Her legs inched outward in every direction with every upward motion of the powerful weight until tears began forming in her workout shorts.  After she added more weight, the tears became even more pronounced, and on the third set, the shorts gave up entirely shredding to release her colossal quadriceps from their flimsy cloth prison.  All that remained on her lower body was a barely-there thong that left little to the imagination.  Jason ogled at her expanding glutes as she rose up and down, watched those twin globes expand with ever more striated, veiny, dense, and thickening muscle.  Watched until her thong seemed ready to burst and him with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third set, her body thick with sweat, they did just that.  With a snap, the tiny piece of fabric gave up and snapped free revealing her lower body in all it's glory.  She didn't even pause.  She just kept pumping the weights harder and harder and he could tell just how excited she was becoming at her own progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came squats, and her legs swelled further, like a pair of titanic beasts intent on growing stronger, bigger, thicker, denser, more massive.  Barely pausing, she moved onto bench press, inclined bench press, decline bench press.  Her sports top didn't survive the the third set and after Jason watched as her already massive chest swelled to titanic proportions inching larger and larger with every rep.  After chest, came a bevy of bicep curls and cable curls, and he watched in awe as her biceps swelled to previously unseen dimensions with massive split peaks and thick veins snaking across their monstrous surface.  Lunges, back row, lat pulldowns, weighted crunches, weighted pullups and tricep dips, tricep extensions, the list of exercises went on and on as did her growing frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, she collapsed exhausted, a snarl on her face.  Her body was a mass of ridiculously large, pulsing musculature soaking in sweat.  If Jason had ever wondered what Laura might look like in six months of the most ridiculous circuit training he had ever seen, he now knew.  She looked up at Jason, and his monstrously erect member, and began crawling forward.  Slowly at first, but faster and faster as she drew closer to him.</span></div></div>",

And two in one day!! Mmmmmm, I already feel like a new woman.\" Laura stood and flexed her mammoth muscles enjoying the gains she'd already received from Jason's seed. Then she helped Jason to his feet and gave him a kiss. \"Let's see what these babies can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't even put their clothes back on but instead went straight into their routine. Jason followed Laura to each station where they took turns lifting insane amounts of weight. All along the way Laura was commenting on how much stronger she was now.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason followed and did his best to not freak out too much when Laura worked her way up to 5 ton arm curls, apparently a full ton over her previous best. Her arms pumped to insane size as she sweated through each repetition, the thick vein that crossed the peak of her bowling ball sized muscle was nearly as thick as Jason's finger. When she reached 10 reps with the huge dumbbells Laura dropped them to the floor and hit a double biceps pose. Her monumental arms were cut to shreds and pulsing with power. This morning, after her transformation, Laura's arms were 29 inches around. Now, mere hours later, she had added 4 inches turning them into 33 inch bazookas.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm catching up with you, big guy!\" she said feeling the solid peak of her right arm with her left hand. \"Usually I can just keep pace with your growth, but a few more double sex days and I'll be bigger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to hide his smirk as he worked in and started doing his own bicep curls. He started with the 5 ton weights Laura had been using and, after a few sets, worked his way up to 9 tons. Clearly he was still the stronger of the two by a fair margin, but he wondered how long that could last. He felt so horny he wanted Laura again already. He didn't think he'd be able to control himself very well. He decided to focus on the workout, but even that wasn't easy when he was being spotted by the sexiest woman he'd ever seen.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved on to the bench press, then the cable rows, and preacher curls. They worked their arms, their chests, backs, abs, and shoulders. Every step of the way Laura had added at least a ton, sometimes two, to her lifts. When it came to the leg exercises, though, she averaged a three ton increase, even in the single leg lifts.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As amazing as my arms are I've always loved working my legs,\" she said while lifting 20 tons with her left leg alone. Her thighs expanded outward while each of her 4 quad muscles flexed larger than her leg used to be before her transformation. At last they moved on to squats. Just over a week ago Laura had struggled to get through 5 reps with a 65 ton tank. Now she was able to power through 5 repetitions with 70 tons of weight on her shoulders.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix hours after they'd started Laura and Jason were a sweaty, exhausted pair of ultra buff and pumped muscle monsters. Jason stood before a mirrored wall sticking pose after pose watching with glee as his body swelled and hardened like a tidal wave of living steel. He felt like a superhero from one of the comics he'd been reading all his life.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked up behind Jason and slapped him on his butt. \"Time to hit the shower. I'm not having you in my car smelling like a sweaty bull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the ajoining room and showered together before recovering their clothes and leaving the gym.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to just drop you at your place or do you want to come back to mine to get your car? Or maybe we could play some more.\" Laura shot Jason a sly glance. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he wanted to spend more time with Laura he figured this was the best way to figure out where he lived. \"You know I want you, but if I gave you a third boost today you'd likely go from She Hulk to Abomination overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed. \"Oh, I love it when you talk nerdy to me. Ok, your place it is.\" Laura took them to a neighborhood about 10 miles up the beach from where Laura's house was. This area was ripe with multimillion dollar homes and huge mansions. Laura pulled into the driveway of a moderately large place. It looked like it had at least 6 or 7 bedrooms based on the windows he counted, but it was by no means the biggest place in the area.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laura stopped and said goodnight Jason looked at her. \"You know you can come in and stay with me tonight.. you know, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled sweetly. \"Baby, you always offer and I always tell you the same thing. Not until we're married. I know I'm strange, but somehow it'll make living together more special if we wait. And you know if I stay the night tonight I'll probably never leave.\" She leaned over and kissed him. \"Have a good night. See you to tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got out of the Hummer and watched Laura drive away. Once she was gone he sighed. \"What a wild day.\" He turned and went up the steps to his front door, but he stopped cold when he realized the door was already cracked open. \"Well, what would a wild day be without a wild night to top it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the door open and walked right in with the confidence of the strongest man in the world. Once in he found someone in his living room, waiting for him.</span></div></div>",

The black blazer was off and her white button up shirt had several more buttons undone than this afternoon, exposing deep, sensual cleavage.  The hair bun was gone and her long blonde hair spilled across her shoulders.  The skirt remained and hid much of her legs, but still showcased her sexy, bulging calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I haven\u2019t seen you stare at me for quite a while the way you did today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blinked, his supercharged libido already affecting his body chemistry, pushing his member out more than he would have liked at the moment.  His rising shorts were not lost on Vanessa who purred her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t given me that welcome for quite a while either.  You know, I\u2019ve missed the powerful feeling that you provide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to calm himself.  \u201cWell OK Vanessa, but your sister is my fianc\u00e9e.  I mean that kiss this afternoon was one thing, but don\u2019t you think this is a bit much to come here and expect something from me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa\u2019s smile remained as she apparently ignored his comments.  She licked her ruby red lips and pushed her long blonde hair over her shoulder.  \u201cI heard you and Laura refused to sign the contract with Dr. Richards.  I was worried Nichole would convince you otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stumbled at her change in conversation.  \u201cWell, uh, it did help that Laura was there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sniffed lightly, flaring her nostrils a bit and pushing her chest out.  Jason\u2019s mouth opened slightly.  Was there anything she didn\u2019t do that wasn\u2019t sexy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was good because you know I have several deals pending, including the one with the supplement manufacturer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried not to stare blankly.  At least the conversation had tempered his desires a bit.  He quickly decided he could use that comment to mine for some information.  He just hoped his comments weren\u2019t out of character for the new him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t pay all that much attention to your pending deals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled, walking toward him on her bare feet, stepping on her tip toes, jutting her gorgeous calves out with each graceful movement.  She reached into her bra and pulled out something that looked like a sugar packet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do know that Jason.  But I most certainly have paid attention.  I know what you\u2019re capable of\u2026 providing.  The supplement manufacturers would do about anything to get your name on their products.  So when they put this together per my special specifications they thought I was a bit off my rocker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at the packet and nearly gulped as Vanessa moved in closer, the seductive smile back on her beautiful face.  Her deep blue eyes twinkled like precious gems.  He surprised himself by backing up against the wall.  \u201cUh, what are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa leaned in, pressing her firm breasts against his thick pectorals, looking up into his eyes with a hypnotic gaze.  \u201cThat as much as I love you and Laura, that seeing the two of you grow bigger and stronger all the time while I remain the same has been hard to take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason started breathing heavy as her scent was starting to affect him.  He was momentarily frozen, not sure what to do and not strong enough mentally to push her away even though he knew deep down that\u2019s what he needed to do.  Besides, she was talking in riddles.  Before he could bring his arms up, Vanessa reached down and pushing his shorts and boxers half way down his giant thighs with the hand holding the packet, grabbed his hardening member with the other.  He let out a quick spasm as his giant cock rode up Vanessa\u2019s skirt.  She deftly moved to the side and started stroking slowly but firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god, Jason, I almost forgot how big you were.  How big you can get with just a little coaxing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was torn, his mind told him to stop but his body was near rapture.  He grunted as he started to leak and he felt guilt as he could tell his body was overriding what he knew was right.  Vanessa kept her eyes on Jason and smiled knowingly as she continued her expert movements.  As Jason leaned back, giving into the sensation, Vanessa pulled the packet up to the mouth and tore it open with her teeth.  She emptied the contents in her mouth and just as Jason\u2019s mighty member reached its full 17 inch glory and grew as hard as steel, Vanessa got down on one knee, nibbled on the shaft and stroking faster and harder, pulled Jason to climax.  With her mouth open as wide as she could she drank in his magic seed, holding his shaft with both hands as he came and came.  With a final burst Jason sighed deeply and slumped his world record sized shoulders a bit.  Flushed red, he pulled up his shorts and looked down at Vanessa who was rising up and wiping the excess juice off her chin.  She smiled with the deep satisfaction of someone taking a bite of a decadent dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a while since I\u2019ve had that wonderful rush.  And with my bonus, it feels even more\u2026 tingly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, mad at himself for letting this happen, pushed Vanessa away.  She stumbled back, but the smile remained.  Jason fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 why did you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa licked her lips and moaned lightly.  Jason\u2019s eyes blinked as he could swear that Vanessa\u2019s eyes were moving up a bit.  He looked down to see that she was not on her toes as he expected.  His eyes were then pulled back up at the sound of stretching fabric.  He now knew a single injection of his semen would have an effect on a woman and he knew what two would do, but he was still playing out in his mind just how much Vanessa would expand.  It was then that he recalled something about a packet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa for her part was enjoying the ride as her top stretched and popped threads at an increasing rate.  Jason stared at her expanding cleavage as her pectorals surged larger and her breasts appeared to grow rounder and started to spill out of her lacey black bra and across her white shirt.  The shoulders on the shirt ripped next and gave a hint of the growing muscles below.  Vanessa giggled and stepped back toward Jason, pressing her expanding chest into his and wrapping her arms around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did it because I wanted to.  And because you wanted me to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted and pushed her away again, this time harder.  To his surprise she didn\u2019t seem to stumble back any further and to his dismay her smile remained.  By now he could see she had grown several inches taller and her shirt was ripping even faster as the sleeves split against her growing biceps and triceps while he heard two buttons hit the floor.  Her breasts, back and pectorals were now stressing the bra to the limit and a loud snap indicated that it had lost the battle against Vanessa\u2019s expanding physique.  He barely had a chance to size up her legs when she jumped forward once again with a mischievous grin, pushing her extra firm breasts against his still much larger chest and wrapping her expanding arms around his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you can just push me away now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was growing frustrated and angry and once again pulled up his massive arms and did just that, pushing her away with a great deal of strength.  This time she did stumble back further, but didn\u2019t fall down as he expected.  Her smile indicated that she looked at this entire ordeal as some type of sex game, which only made him madder.  Vanessa giggled and pushed down on her skirt, ripping the sides as she momentarily struggled to push the material over her expanding thighs.  But with one final shove the skirt hit the floor and Vanessa kicked it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his mounting concern, Jason could now see that Vanessa was growing\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jason looked on, Vanessa's body surged in all directions.  Smiling and inhaling deeply, her already magnificent chest surged forward with layer upon layer of thick musculature pushing her pecs forward in an awe-inspiring display.  Deep striations formed as Jason watched the muscle fibers split, swell, split, and swell again until her chest was a surging mass of muscle that only seemed to enhance her already near-perfect form.  As her pectorals swelled, veins snaked across their surface, themselves pulsing with blood, swelling, trying to keep pace with the unearthly muscle forming beneath.  If anything, her magnificent bosom swelled even further seemingly not wanting to be outdone by her pectoral development.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's eyes widened as he watched her breasts swell and swell, then his eyes flowed down over her breathtaking form as he watched her abs undulating up and down as she put on a little show for him.  With each ripple he watched those deep cobblestones, swell, and bulge.  He watched the veins snake across her midsection and down to her shaved lips.  Watched her abs go from fit, to bodybuilder, to something obscenely massive and feminine, and watched her clitoris engorge with blood.  Still she swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa jutted one toe forward, Jason's rising manhood, stood at full attention.  The sight of her thick ultra-feminine legs exploding with muscle in every direction was too much to resist.  Her massive and deep-cut quads defied description safe to say they were ultra-ripped, ultra-huge, and seemingly ultra-perfect.  He watched the veins surge out of her pelvis and down her quads, feedind the muscles.  Watched them snake around to her hamstrings and converge before flowing down to her calves.  Oh those calves, they erupted from either side of her shin like two caged and starving beasts finally released from prison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft moaning-sigh escaped from her lips drawing Jason's attention to her radiant face, those perfect lips--so red, so wet, so luscious, so inviting.  His eyes quickly swam down to her neck, now encased in thick trapesius muscles, then over to her bulging deltiod.  He caught his breath in anticipation before letting his eyes roam down to her arms.  His heart skipped a beat at what he saw.  A bicep as defined and perfectly developed as could have ever imagined greeted his view.  Behind it rested a deep-cut tricep surging outward with with even the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching his eyes, Vanessa smiled and rewarded him with a double bicep flex.  Her twin mountains rose and rose, surging higher and higher.  Each muscle defined to inhuman perfection, the split peak a model that every bodybuilder after seeing, would aspire to.  Jason twitched, scarcely able to take in all of what was before him.  Vanessa smiled further at his state, knowing she had him exactly where she wanted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sultry voice rang out, dripping sex, calling to him like a siren.  \"It seems all those times we were together, your seed was building inside me, waiting for something.  I always wondered what it was.  It always felt like I was destined for something greater, and now it seems, I know what that was.  I think I'm bigger than your precious Laura now.  Yes, much bigger, much prettier, much more sexy.  Perhaps what was waiting in me finally reached critical mass and like a nuclear chain reaction... well,\"  She flexed her biceps again, pumping her engorged muscles again and again, watching them rise slightly higher, denser, larger, with every flex.  \"This, feels so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa began walking forward, slowly, like a predator about to pounce on her prey.  Every movement caused muscles to swell and expand in inhuman and alluring ways.  Whatever you could say about Vanessa, she knew how to drive the opposite sex crazy with desire, and that effect only seemed to be enhanced by her swelling muscularity.  She watched as Jason's member twitched in anticipation, and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was a few steps from him, his eyes lost their glaze for a moment and he tried to speak, \"Vanessa, please, this is wrong.  I won't let you!  I'm engaged to Laura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't stop you before, and I'm so much more than I was a few minutes ago.  Why you can barely contain yourself now.  All it will take is one tiny touch and you will be mine again.  Just look at you, it's all you can do to keep from jumping me right now and driving that big thing deep into me with everything you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped inches from him, and spread her legs apart in a powerful stance.  His eyes strayed up those perfectly massive legs to her waiting womanhood and it was all he could do to close his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened them...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason peered around his huge pectorals so he could fully view Vanessa's expanding physique. His stomach sank when he realized she had, in less than a minute, grown larger than Laura. To make matters worse her muscles were still swelling. The beefed up blond raised her arms and flexed a pair of biceps that had grown to 35 inches around then she smiled with satisfaction.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! The feeling of strength, of power, it's the most amazing thing I've ever experienced.\" She placed her hands on Jason's chest and began to cuddle up to him. \"This must be how you feel all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had had enough of her silly sex game and decided to end it. He firmly gripped her wrists and shoved her arms away. It took considerable effort, but he managed to put a few feet between himself and the ever expanding beauty.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being angry Vanessa seemed to get even more excited. \"It's not easy, is it? You can't just overpower me like you can everyone else, can you?\" Vanessa began pushing back and, to Jason's dismay, winning. Her muscles had finally stopped growing, but she had outgrown him; she wasn't radically larger but it was pretty clear that her physique out shined his, though he was still the taller of the two by 3 inches. \"Mmmm, I think I'm going to like this. Even the world's strongest man has to bow to my strength.\" She took hold of his hands and squeezed them sending bolts of pain up his arms which drove him to his knee. \"That's right, baby. Bow to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't believe it, just one shot of his semen had taken Vanessa from athletic to monstrous, and now she was beginning to really revel in her newfound power. Jason couldn't help but wonder about the mysterious supplement Vanessa had taken before she'd sucked him off.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jason began to fear for his life he saw a look of confusion wash over Vanessa's face. She stumbled back a few steps and examined her arms. To Vanessa's horror and Jason's relief they were shrinking. Her whole body, actually, was reverting back to its previous size.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!! No, no, no, no!!\" Vanessa shouted at her muscles. \"Why?!? Those bastards, they got it wrong!!\" As quickly as her titanic body had appeared it had shriveled away leaving her no larger than she'd been before ingesting Jason's seed. Even her height had returned to her former 6 feet even and she stood naked except for her black panties.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was in shock, one moment she was the most powerful human being alive and the next she was back to normal. She looked up at Jason with tears in her eyes. \"All my beautiful muscles are gone. I just don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason approached her and began to put his arm around her shoulders to console her. \"It's okay, you don't need-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa cut Jason off by letting out a blood curdling scream. Then she placed her hands on Jason's chest and shoved with all her might, \"SHUT UP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found himself flying through the air then connecting with the living room wall. His body had such velocity that he plowed right through the wall and landed in the dining room on the other side.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lay dazed on the floor looking up at the newly created hole in his wall. A moment later Vanessa's smiling face appeared.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not gone!! They're just hiding!!\" Since the hole was four feet off the ground she kicked her way through the lower portion with ease and stood over Jason. \"I'm still strong!\" she announced before reaching down and gripping Jason by the throat. She lifted him straight up and held him in the air with a single hand. \"Really strong!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried with all of his might to pry Vanessa's fingers away from his neck, but it was no use.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really understand it,\" Vanessa said, \"but I love it.\" She raised her free hand and examined her arm. \"I wonder if...\" She tightened her fist and as she flexed her arm her biceps, triceps and forearms exploded outward in all directions returning to their former monstrous size. She then relaxed her arm and it returned to its slender, lithe size. Vanessa laughed then, still holding Jason aloft with ease, looked around her round bust and tried flexing her left leg. Just like her arm her leg expanded until it eclipsed Jason's humungous thighs. Then she relaxed her left leg and tested the right. Then both together. \"I love this game!!\" she squealed as her legs receded again. \"Let's try another one.\" This time Vanessa took on a look of concentration for a moment then Jason found himself raising higher off the floor; Vanessa was growing taller. Not only could she tap into her added muscle, but her height as well. She grew until she was 6 feet 7 inches tall then stopped. Vanessa shivered with excitement and Jason could see goosebumps breakout all over her arms and chest. \"Ooooh, that feels good. Now, where were we?\" Vanessa looked at Jason then grinned. \"Oh yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even blink Vanessa whipped the arm holding him to the side and Jason was flying through the air again. He crashed into another section of wall and flew through it as if it were paper. He sailed through his living room and landed behind the couch. As he got to his feet he looked up to see Vanessa enter the room, her body once more inflating with slabs of muscle until she was, once more, the bigger of the two. She strode over to the tattered remains of her clothes and sorted through them until she found another of the strange packets. She tore it open and emptied the powder onto her tongue before approaching Jason.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jason said holding his hands up to try to keep the musclebound beauty at bay. He had no desire to find out what another dose of his semen would do to her body with her supplement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed. \"As if you could stop me.\" She puffed out her chest and tightened her arms causing tidal waves of motion under her skin. She shoved him again sending him spilling over the couch and onto the area rug. She then leapt over the couch and landed in a straddled position on Jason's stomach. She then slid down, sat on his legs, and leaned in close to his crotch. Vanessa began blowing on Jason's thick penis which, against Jason's wishes, began to spring to life. Without missing a beat Vanessa wrapped her mouth around his member and began sucking hard. Jason was writhing around on the ground in a flurry of ecstasy trying to get his mind into anything else and prevent the inevitable. Try as he might it only took Vanessa 30 seconds of sucking and licking to coax him to blast a torrent of come down her throat.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason's vision began to blur and darken, then he passed out.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke sometime later and stumbled to his feet. For a moment he thought he had only dreamed of Vanessa's growth exploits but then he noticed the giant holes in his walls and other general wreckage and realized it was all real.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! You're awake.\" Jason turned and saw Vanessa sitting in an easy chair reading a book as though she hadn't just attacked him and thrown him around his own house. She was back to her normal size and now wore a pair of denim shorts and a very tight t-shirt with Wonder Woman on the front. It was obvious the shirt wasn't hers because it was several sizes too small and her huge boobs were packed in tight. Vanessa must have noticed Jason staring because she looked down at her chest and giggled. \"Yeah, I assume this was Laura's from before she ballooned. Not exactly my size, but it'll have to do until I get home.\" She stood and put her book down. \"I have to say that I wasn't expecting to be able to control my size but I'm very excited about it. It's going to change my plans, but all for the better. Now,\" she walked seductively towards Jason, her sleek thighs flexing slightly with each step, \"I've decided that, for now, I'm going to keep the full scope of my power a secret. That means you're not allowed to tell anyone what I can do, not even Laura. And if you do... well, let's not even think about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to hurt anyone are you?\" Jason's asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 6 foot tall woman reached up and placed her hand on the 6 foot 10 inch man's shoulder and, with the greatest of ease, slowly pressed down until Jason was on his knees. Then she looked him in the eye and said, \"I'm going to do whatever the hell I want. And no one is going to stop me.\" Then she released her grip and left Jason alone in his destroyed living room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It's good to see you again.\" Nicole was sitting in an easy chair in Jason's living room. She still wore the skintight black dress she had been wearing earlier. She sat with her purse at her feet and a glass of wine in her hand. The wine bottle sat open on an end table to her left. Her gorgeous legs were crossed and she had a very relaxed air about her. Just like earlier Jason got the feeling that there was nothing in the world that could faze this woman.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care for a drink?\" Nicole motioned to the end table where another glass sat filled with the red wine. \"I hope you don't mind I helped myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole? What-\" Jason began but was cut off by the beautiful redhead.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I've told you before. Call me Nikki.\" She flashed an amazing smile at Jason that caused his knees to feel weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole,\" Jason used her more formal name to try to maintain control of the situation, \"what are you doing in my home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer green eyes lit up and again Jason felt out of his depth. \"You know exactly what I'm doing here. You practically begged me to come. When your musclebound fianc' denied you your happiness and financial security I could see the look in your eyes. You were watching me, preying I would give you a second chance. Well, here I am. Now you can sign our deal in peace.\" Nicole took a sip of wine and set the glass down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason flushed. He had been staring at Nicole earlier, but that didn't give her the right to break into his house. \"I really think you should leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you?\" Nicole raised an eyebrow. \"Come on, you're smarter than this. I know full well that under all that rock hard muscle you're a borderline genius.\" She practically moaned the words \"rock hard muscle\" in a way that caused Jason's penis to twitch.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave. Now.\" Jason forced his voice to remain even toned which was very difficult considering how smoldering hot this woman was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stood then bent over to gather her purse. Jason got another great view of her wondrous cleavage packed into her tight little dress. \"Have it your way,\" she said. \"At least let me leave my card with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jason could even respond Nicole reached into her purse and pulled out a handgun. With zero hesitation she fired six shots into Jason with dazzling accuracy. Jason's initial thought was to wonder if he were bullet proof or not, but his fear subsided a bit when he saw that she had stuck darts into him, not bullets. Her marksmanship was incredible. In about half a second she had put all six darts exactly in her targets: one in each arm, two in the chest, and one in each leg.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went to pull the dart out of his right arm with his left hand, but he only got halfway before his left arm went completely numb and fell to his side dead. He then tried to move his legs, but fell right to the floor instead, twisting as he did so he landed on his back with a huge thud.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, still calm as ever, walked over and set her purse down next to Jason's limp body. Jason, for his part, was still very conscious but completely unable to move or feel anything away from his hands, feet, or waist.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole? What are you doing?\" There was obvious panic in Jason's voice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh! Relax. I'm just gathering a few samples. You'll be back to normal in half an hour or so.\" She hiked up her dress a bit and straddled Jason's middle. He could feel her smooth thighs against his abs, which were far enough away from the darts in his chest to retain feeling. \"And I told you, call me Nikki.\" She winked at him before'she got down to business and pulled a small, black case out of her purse. She unrolled it onto Jason's enormous chest and began pulling small test tubes out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Nicole said holding up a small swab. \"I'm just going to collect a few samples and be on my way. Let's start with a cheek rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason clamped him mouth shut. He had no desire to cooperate with this thief.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole frowned. \"Now, now. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Which do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason held his jaw closed. Nicole sighed then put the swab down. Quick as could be she pulled the two darts out of Jason's chest and stuck them into either side of his neck, right below his jawbone. \"Now, there should be just enough relaxant to loosen up those lips... there we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could feel the numbness that had overtaken his body spread into his mouth just enough to cause his jaw to fall open. Nicole smiled and rubbed the swab along the inside of his cheek. Since there wasn't much of the drug left in the darts feeling returned to his mouth fairly quickly, but it was far too late to prevent Nicole from getting what she wanted. The rest of the samples were much easier for her to get, and she set about collecting them with the ease and speed of a master surgeon. She got samples of hair, blood, muscle tissue from his arms and chest, and even fingernail clippings. All the while she spoke as if this were a normal activity for her: \"I have to say, you really have no idea how obsessed daddy is with finding out how you got to be so big. He thinks it's the greatest medical mystery of our time. I, on the other hand, think he's looking at things all wrong. To me you aren't the real mystery. I mean, sure, you're bulging and freakishly strong, but you're an anomaly. What gets my motor running, so to speak, is the mystery behind your little lady. And I use the phrase loosely. See, one person turning into a giant is strange. But his girlfriend growing as well shortly after the two get serious about each other? Now that's freaky. But, like I said, to daddy you're the puzzle, so here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole put each of the collected samples away in the black satchel and rolled it back up. \"Still,\" she continued, \"I look at Laura and even your ex Vanessa and I think that you must have had something to do with their physical state. Vanessa may not be all that big, but she never works out and I know she's really strong. So, what have you shared with the two of them that could make them that way?\" She looked Jason in the eye and gave him her dazzling smile once again. \"And then it hit me.\" Now she reached back into her purse and pulled out a plastic cup with a lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do now?\" Jason asked, he was afraid of where this would lead.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm testing a theory,\" she said. She began sliding down his belly and over his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't get away with this. I'm going to call the cops and have you and your father thrown in jail!!\" Jason yelled.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stopped sliding for a moment and chuckled. \"Oh honey, don't you know that daddy owns the cops. He was going to send them to collect tonight, but I insisted so it got done right. And so I could harvest a sample of my own.\" She pulled the waist of his shorts down and exposed his giant unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the careful placement of her darts Jason still had full feeling in his penis. Nicole used this to her advantage and she began stroking and licking the thick shaft. Jason was at her complete mercy and couldn't budge an inch. Within seconds his cock was rock hard and fully erect at 17 inches long.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, get off me!!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sat up for a moment. \"Your mouth says no but your ridiculously large cock says suck me off.\" She returned to licking and sucking with increased vigor.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shut his eyes and held his breath. He tried to ignore the intense waves of pleasure that were shooting out of his crotch in all directions. Worst of all, he was enjoying what Nicole was doing. Then the sensations changed and he opened his eyes to see what was happening.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had slid the top of her dress down and exposed her perfect C cup breasts. Now she had them wrapped around the lower part of his shaft while she sucked on the huge head of his penis. Just the sight of her gorgeous, teardrop titties wrapped around his pole was enough to send Jason right to the edge, but the feel of their soft warmth along with the sensation of her tongue dancing on the tip of his dick was too much for him to stand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a quick yell and Nicole released his penis and aimed it into the plastic cup she had waiting. Jason's cock flexed and blasted a load that filled the cup past half way. The second shot filled it to the top. He continued to fire and his jizz spilled all over his chest and abs.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done Nicole capped her sample cup and stowed it in her purse. \"I should have brought the extra large,\" she said looking at the pool of come she had left behind. She readjusted the top of her dress and then tied her hair back in a ponytail. \"Well, waste not want not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole got down on all fours and began slurping the come off of Jason's body. She ran her tongue over his bulging swells and when he was completely clean she stood up. \"Well, now we get to find out if my theory is correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole turned to leave then paused and began laughing. \"I WAS right. I can feel it already. Oh! Oh, that's incredible.\" She closed her eyes and enjoyed the feel of power washing over her body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole closed her eyes for a moment and reveled in the feeling of strength that was flowing into her body. Then, as she felt her body begin to harden, she opened her eyes and watched her arms. All the changes were subtle, but exciting all the same. She saw her forearms expand and gain some definition while her upper arms shrank for just a moment as the excess fat around her underarm melted away. Then small amounts of muscle built back the size that was lost. She flexed her arms and watched small but solid biceps pop out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Nicole listened as her dress creaked and groaned under the strain of her chest and back both growing together and pressing against the already tight garment. She laughed as she watched her breasts begin to squeeze together and spill over the top of her neckline. There was a quick surge and her breasts themselves grew as well adding half a cup size and causing a small tear to form between them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's eyes were focused on Nicole's legs, both because of his vantage point from the floor and the fact that they were probably the sexiest legs he'd ever seen in his life. Now their appeal was increasing because Nicole's shapely calves, which already had a defined cleft with the help of her high heels, hardened and became even more rounded and obvious. Jason marveled at how the juxtaposition between her slender ankle and her now more curvaceous calf had increased and made her already gorgeous gams eye-popping. His eyes drifted up to her thighs where her muscles were becoming more pronounced. The line that highlighted her quads deepened and her smooth skin spread out around the supple meat beneath.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll told the changes to Nicole's body weren't extensive, but they were dramatic. The difference between fit and toned for her took her from sexual vixen to out of this world bombshell. Jason, being who he was, had a plethora of mirrors around the house and Nicole approached a full body one along the wall. She ran her hands along her waist and hips turning one way and the other.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, this will do nicely.\" She turned and examined her rear which was practically shrink wrapped into her dress. She then flexed her calf and smiled as the tight little muscle hardened into a heart-shaped mass. \"Beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole faced the mirror once more and squeezed her breasts. \"You even pumped up the girls a little. That's an added bonus, but I shouldn't be too shocked considering how top heavy Vanessa is. You must affect different girls in different ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sauntered back over to where Jason remained prone on the floor. \"Overall I didn't grow all that much but I feel so much stronger. I can't imagine how you and Laura must feel.\" She flexed her bicep and felt the small but solid muscle with her free hand. \"But not to worry, I'll find out soon enough. Once the lab boys analyze your.... specimen they'll concoct a super potent version for me.\" Nicole put her high heeled foot square on Jason's enormous chest and leaned over to look him in the eye. \"When I'm done I'm going to make you look like a stick figure. That little stunt you did with the tank will be nothing compared to what I have in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was frightened by the look in Nicole's eyes, she was power mad and the key to untold strength was within her reach. \"Nicole.... please...\" he spoke softly for such a strong man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, call me Nikki.\" Her magmatic smile returned, but this time it gave Jason a chill. Nicole gathered her things and left without another word leaving Jason still pacified on the floor.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the next half an hour fighting the numbness in his limbs but he was finally able to get feeling back and got to his feet. He looked at himself in the mirror. He was ashamed over the fear he had been feeling when Nicole had him pinned. He was the strongest man the world had ever seen, everyone else should be scared of him. He took several deep breaths and pumped his chest and arms. Then he let out a long, loud yell while he tore his shirt asunder revealing his immense pecs.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would put a stop to Nicole's plan before she ever found a way to grow stronger. He would tear Dr. Richards's facility to the ground if he had to. They wouldn't get away with what they had done. He would stop them. He had to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason sat onto the large couch in the living room.  The numbness was dissipating, but it had left him feeling spent.  He leaned back, the adrenaline rush that forced him to overcome the effects of the drugs along with the embarrassment and anger all left him exhausted for the first time in this new reality.  He sighed heavily and closed his eyes to rest a moment before deciding what to do next.  Within a few minutes he was asleep and his mind churched as the recent events played out in his head.  He woke up with a start and sat upright quickly.  He could see the sun rays coming in the window.  Jason groaned as he glanced at his watch.  It was dawn.  Nicole had all night to run tests with his body fluids.  His anger returned as he bit his lip, unsure of what to do.  He found his phone and stared at, wondering what he would say to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around his house like a stranger he found the well stocked refrigerator and pulled out some premixed supplement drink.  It was called Max Up and had his endorsement on it.  He smirked, thinking that Vanessa must have gotten this for him.  The company was called Bodyblasters and he remembered seeing something about that on his Wikipedia page.  It wasn\u2019t associated with Dr. Richards.  He wondered if they were competitors.  Shaking his head he moved into a computer room that looked much more familiar.  It was if his old bedroom were transported here.  Pictures of superheroes were on the wall and a powerful computer was sitting on a desk.  Nodding his head he sat down and quickly logged in, looking for a specific program.  He smiled when he found it.  Jason pulled up recent calls and was not terribly surprised that when he moved down far enough that he found Nicole\u2019s number.  He fired up his tracking program and entered her number and waited.  He leaned back and took a drink.  Nicole was right about one thing.  He was a near genius, at least when it came to computers and programming.  He was just happy he hadn\u2019t abandoned his programming abilities in this reality.  Jason leaned in as the tracking program linked in to the hacked satellites and showed Nicole\u2019s location.  Pulling up Google Address he soon found that she was not at the lab as he would have expected, but in a mansion off the beach.  Google Earth gave him a good idea of just how big the place was.  A more recent satellite image off another hacked satellite showed more recent pictures along with better detail.  It looked like a fortified bunker.  The tank he bench pressed was there, apparently airlifted back from the stadium.  More tanks, aircraft and other large items surrounded the estate.  He frowned.  Getting in there would be difficult, but he had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also knew he needed to call Laura.  As speed dial number 1 her phone was soon ringing.  Laura picked up after a several rings.  He had obviously wakened her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you what time it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Jason would have laughed and given her grief, but not today.  \u201cSorry, but point in fact, I should have called you earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear her sitting up.  \u201cYou sound serious.  What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ran through the entire embarrassing events, even pleading for forgiveness about his indiscretion and his inability to stop it.  Laura would have none of it and he could practically hear her teeth grind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will kill that little bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted.  \u201cWhat we need to do is to try and get everything back, but I\u2019m afraid Nicole may have already dropped the uh, specimens, off at the lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we should go there first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.  If Nicole\u2019s right about being able to amplify things we need to make sure they don\u2019t finish anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was surprised by the pause on the line.  Laura sounded concerned.  \u201cThen maybe I need to bring the sample from Bodyblasters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stumbled, knowing he should know what she was talking about.  \u201cUh, sure, if you think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could here Laura walking around.  \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.  I\u2019ll come and pick you up.  Let me call Vanessa too, I want to see what she thinks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason agreed and hung up.  He went back to the computer and stared at Nicole\u2019s location.  He found an iPad and transferred the program onto it.  He brought it with him as he walked to his bedroom, washed up and put on some new clothes.  He looked at himself in another large mirror and marveled at his massive muscles that pressed against the blue muscle shirt and blue spandex shorts.  He found some athletic shoes and walked toward the front door with the iPad when he noticed the phone moving within the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and walked over to door that led to the garage and saw some keys in a bowl.  He picked them up and walking into the garage saw a black hummer nearly identical to Laura\u2019s.  His mind churned.  If Nicole left, he worried that she would get to the lab before them.  Confronting her alone made him nervous, but with an angry grunt he opened the garage door and climbed into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still the strongest man in the world he thought, and there should be nothing to fear.  He sent a quick text to Laura to let him know what he was doing and recommended she head to lab.  Jason was soon driving away, keeping one eye on Nicole\u2019s location.  His phone buzzed, but he ignored it and stepped on the accelerator.  He would be there in 10 minutes.  It would have taken Laura nearly that long to get to his house.  He skidded to a stop outside of a large gate and looked at the 10 foot walls.  He wasn\u2019t sure if he didn\u2019t want to tear down the gate or try and smash thru the wall.  Shaking his head, he moved back and with the moves of a superhero, took a quick running start and jumped over the wall, landing with a thud in the grass on the other side.  He smiled to himself and scanning the area, took a look at Nicole\u2019s location and saw she was outside the mansion.  Afraid she would be leaving he ran to the house and turned around it, staying close the side.  He peered around the corner and saw Nicole in a bright red bikini at a wet bar near an Olympic sized pool.  He let out a small \u2018woah\u2019 as he also saw the tanks, vehicles and large planes off to the side.  There also appeared to be some very large plates and hydraulic apparatus similar to what was in his gym.  This made him nervous for a moment, but once he was sure Nicole was alone and apparently unarmed he walked around the corner quickly, puffing out his massive pecs and putting on as much bravado as he could muster, growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do with my DNA material?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was gratified to see her jump, but when she turned toward him she had on the same award winning smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJason, so glad you came.  Is your girlfriend coming too or were you too embarrassed to tell her about last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stopped walking forward as he couldn\u2019t believe that she could regain the advantage with one sentence.  Angered that she could control him that easily he grimaced and walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnswer my question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole leaned back against the bar.  A large drink was next to her and he could see her hand reaching behind her.  Nicole kept her calm but as Jason moved forward swiftly she pulled out a weapon.  Jason stopped again, mad that her simple remark had given her time to do so.  He cursed at himself for not just charging forward and grabbing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are going to do, shoot me with darts again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled as she pointed the gun at him.  \u201cNo, this gun is quite real.  If you remember, we did perform tests on you that indicated you were nearly bullet proof.  However, this gun\u2019s caliber is strong enough to take you down if necessary.  And if you remember dear Jason, I am an EXCELLENT shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her eyes on Jason, she motioned the gun down.  \u201cNow sit for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, his anger causing his ears to ring, stood still, his fists clenched at his side and his body ready for action.  Nicole\u2019s smile dropped and before he knew it she fired the gun and he felt a rip of pain along his right thigh.  He yelped and reached down to see blood flowing.  He looked up with surprise and Nicole smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just winged you big boy.  We both know your body heals injuries at a superhuman rate.  You\u2019ll be fine.  But unless you want me to put one in you that won\u2019t heal so fast you had better sit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimping forward, he sat down on a large chair that still groaned under his considerable weight.  Nicole picked up the drink and walked calmly toward him, the gun still trained on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy.  Now I am so glad you came so quickly, even if it was unannounced.  You saved me the trouble of getting you to come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grimaced, the pain in his leg still throbbing.  \u201cWhy?  What else could you possibly need from me?\u201d  He eyed the drink cautiously, figuring he may need to knock it out of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stopped as she neared him.  Her body was a symphony of luscious muscles and insane feminine curves.  The boost she gave her last night now on full display.  Noticing that his stare had moved from the glass to her tight, six pack abs, Nichole smiled seductively and tensed them, causing them to jump, harden and separate into a fitness girl\u2019s dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you like my body Jason.  Because this accelerator is what\u2019s needed to make me into your dream girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped.  He needed to something quickly and at this point his own safety seemed to be of less importance.  So as Nicole backed up with a smile on her face and a twinkle in her eye, she\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Like I said before,\" Nicole spoke with her typical seductive grin, \"I'm glad you're here. Not because I need anything from you, but because I want you to be a witness to my ascension to god-hood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason started to move towards Nicole, dodging to the side to avoid any potential gunfire that could be headed his way. He was hardly out of his seat, though, when Nicole brought the drink to her lips and quickly downed its contents. Jason smacked the glass from her hand but his heart sank when it shattered on the ground and he could see Nicole had already emptied it.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed Nicole by the throat and lifted her off the ground so she was face to face with him. \"What did you do?\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole simply laughed then placed the muzzle of the gun against Jason's beefy shoulder and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thunderous explosion ripped through Jason's shoulder and out his back causing him to drop Nicole and stumble backwards into the chair again. His free hand went right to the wound and he felt hot, sticky blood running down his chest and arm; the scratch on his thigh was now completely forgotten. Jason examined the hole in his shoulder and decided it wasn't as bad as he had originally thought. His Kevlar thick sinew had clearly been the difference between a small (though very bloody) hole and his entire arm being ripped off.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was still laughing and, Jason now noticed, her body was changing. She was clearly taller, her magnificent legs having lengthened considerably, and she now appeared to top out around 6 foot 5 inches in height. All over her body her musculature had increased, and by a greater margin than it had the previous evening. She had left the realm of fitness star and now looked like a full fledged bodybuilder. Her statuesque thighs, wide shoulders, and thick arms would have been at home on any Ms. Olympia stage, but, much to Jason's surprise, her muscle growth stopped there. Her breasts, on the other hand, were still swelling. Nicole had been right on the border of a D cup upon Jason's arrival but she was now sporting full blown G cups that were still growing. Her red bikini top was straining to contain the supple flesh. Overjoyed with her expanding assets Nicole thrust her chest forward and the tiny string between her breasts snapped and her massive globes were set free. Nicole's hands went right to her boobs and gave them a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole moaned and closed her eyes enjoying the feel of her expanding tits which now put even Vanessa's enormous chest to shame. Finally when they had reached the size of small beach balls her breasts stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Nicole asked stepping back toward the Olympic sized pool so Jason could take her entire body in. She examined herself and smiled. \"I must say I'm still shocked by how much you affect my boobs.\" She bounced up and down and watched her breasts bounce as well.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked from Nicole to his own shoulder. To his surprise he bleeding had stopped. His wound still looked nasty, but not as bad as it had moments earlier. Did he really have superhuman healing properties? It sure seemed like it. Starting to get some confidence back he looked at Nicole again. \"I have to say you're not quite as buff as I would have expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole chuckled. \"Yes, well, that's the best part. First of all my muscle is ten times as dense as your already superdense muscle. I'm way more powerful at this size than you would be. But, yes, you're still way bigger and way stronger so it's a good thing that accelerant beverage was only a catalyst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's heart sunk. \"Catalyst? For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this.\" Nicole then revealed that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole\u2019s smile remained as she tossed the gun away to land on the grass behind her.  Jason shook the shoulder she had shot and was already getting some feeling back.  He felt strong enough to go after her, especially once she tossed the gun away.  He took a step toward her with anger in his eyes and clenched his fists, pumping his muscles up to their full potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stood next to the pool with her superior smirk on her face, seemingly daring Jason to come and take her on.  And Jason was ready to oblige, moving toward her until he was at arm\u2019s length.  To his surprise she actually took a step back, into the pool.  Jason grunted and followed her in as she backed up into the shallow end until she was standing up near her hips.  Just before he reached her Jason paused as the water was bubbling a bit around Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, Jason.  I can feel it working.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at her with new concern.  \u201cWhat\u2026 what\u2019s working?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole snickered.  \u201cWhy the protein bath of course.  I had the pool changed over last night.  I can only grow so much with your seed, even with an accelerator.  A body needs something to grow with.  And this entire pool is designed to do just that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood frozen and he watched with horrific fascination as Nicole\u2019s body began to tense and un-tense seemingly on its own.  And each time her body throbbed outward, he could see her muscles growing bigger.  Her already magnificent body pushed outward with her back and pectorals expanding, showcasing her growing, knee weakening sexy upper body.  As her muscles slowly grew larger, Nicole\u2019s full smile returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and Laura are the only ones who could appreciate how thrilled I was last night when I found I could easily lift up the back of my car!  It was the most excited I had been in years.  And now with your help my muscles are growing stronger and even denser.  Your incredible muscle size coupled with your super human size to strength ratio was a great start!  But now that I can feed my muscles directly, your mighty physique is no longer going to look so mighty next to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole cooed with delight as Jason watched her legs expand further outward, her midsection grow harder, her chest muscle its way forward and her relaxed arms bubble with formidable bumps and grooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the protein bath will not only give me incredible muscle size faster than your semen alone could, but coupled with the accelerator will increases the size to strength ratio to, well beyond super human levels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her beautiful smile turned more domineering, Nicole lazily pulled up her right arm as her already large muscles pulsed involuntarily due to the accelerator and the protein bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even have to lift a weight to take advantage of the effect.  In fact, I haven\u2019t even had to flex yet.  But for you Jason, I\u2019m willing to oblige our desires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slowly pulled her right arm up and with just the action of bringing her forearm near vertical her bicep jutted up as big as a cantaloupe.  Chuckling at the feeling, Nicole gave her fist a squeeze and let out a satisfying squeal.  What happened next Jason could only surmise was muscle explosions as Nicole\u2019s muscles were growing, ripping and reforming so quickly into denser and more powerful mounds of steel that the ground around them shook as she flexed.  Baseball sized muscles pounded out from her bicep in an orgy of dynamic growth.  Feeling the moment, Nicole pumped her forearm up and down, tensing her muscles harshly at the peak as low frequency rumbles emanated from her bicep with increasing amplitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you just FEEL it Jason!  My bicep is already bigger than your girlfriend\u2019s!  And with my enhancer, the strength flowing through them is multiplied many times greater!  Just listen to the song my muscles are singing.  The song of ultimate POWER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole\u2019s beautiful green eyes started to glow as she smiled like a power mad super villain!  Her beautiful red hair thickened across her widening, growing shoulders, her chest pushed forward with unearthly pectorals and the breasts of a goddess, her abs rippled and hardened across her narrow midsection and her legs pushed out slabs of throbbing, incredibly shapely muscles that now rivaled his size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began sweating as the ground shook and the pool floor cracked around her small feet as she continued to flex her biceps to match, and to his continued concern, beyond his size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm, the strength, the size, the density, the POWER!  You thought you were so big, bad and tough Jason.  But now I can feel you slowly slipping away from me.  My muscles are already BIGGER than yours and they\u2019re still grrrrrrrrrrowing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole flexed harder and her bicep shot upward and outward with the sound and concussion of thunder!  Her bicep grew up to the top of her fist, then to the top of her head, then 6 inches higher!  Masses of jagged, unearthly muscles fibers rippled and multiplied, feeding her strength, enhancing her density and pushing her might to unthought-of levels!  Her biceps pushed out beyond 100 inches around and over three feet tall from her bulging, surging triceps up to her rumbling peaks!  Thick veins snaked their way up, pulsing with each heartbeat as her magnificent bicep pushed up even higher!  And higher!  And HIGHER!  Nicole was laughing manically as her bicep blew up to beyond 120 inches around and over four feet high!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven I can\u2019t believe how powerful I\u2019m growing Jason!  Every new inch of girl muscle multiplies my strength and increases my density!  And I\u2019ve added over 100 inches to my biceps alone!  These babies are now over three times your puny size!  Remember when I told you that I\u2019d make you look like a stick figure?  Do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had seen enough.  If he was going to live through this ordeal he needed to do something other than stand there and stare.  Growling, he reached out to grab her neck, looking to toss her out of the pool and into a nearby tank.  But Nicole reacted faster, releasing her mind blowing flex and reaching out with cobra speed and grabbed Jason by his neck, causing him to tense his muscles and gasp.  Nicole narrowed her eyes and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo little, too late Jason.  I\u2019m wayyyyy too strong for you now.  Haven\u2019t you been listening?  Don\u2019t believe what you\u2019re seeing right in front of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole\u2019s smile widened as she slowly pulled Jason off the ground and into the air.  His feet dangled uselessly in the pool as he kicked the water.  He grabbed her forearm and squeezed with all of his might, but her thick forearm was unyielding!  Nicole\u2019s eyes danced with delight and glowed unnaturally brightness with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could crush your neck right now Jason.  But what fun is that?  You obviously don\u2019t believe what you\u2019ve seen so far.  You need a little demonstration.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked around and pulling her arm back tossed Jason high and hard into the nearby tank that Jason was looking to toss Nicole towards.  The irony was not lost on him as he sailed through the air and hit the side of the tank hard with a crunch.  He groaned in pain as he struck the tank and fell to the ground.  He was somewhat relieved to find that the tank had taken the worst of the encounter.  He had little time to celebrate when he looked up to see Nicole high in the air above him, apparently jumping directly out of the pool over 100 yards away and looking to land right next to him!  He could only watch with concern as she fell toward the earth, landing 5 feet away with an earth shaking thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled down at him as she took a step out of the small crater she had created.  Her long, sexy legs were pumped up beyond belief with criss-crossing striations on slabs of muscle over two feet thick!  Her calves bulged out as big as basketballs as she pushed down on her comparably tiny feet.  He looked up further and gasped at just how ripped her midsection was with pulsing veins, 10 bricks of deeply etched muscle along her abs and balls of muscles running up the side to her barn door busting wide back and her seemingly impossibly thick shelf of pectoral muscle and her goddess like breasts the size of globes that melded perfectly with the underlying, pumped up chest muscles.  Even four feet away he was losing sight of her angelic face as her chest pushed out over two feet thick!  Nicole paused and looked down at Jason with fire in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember when you struggled to bench this tank five times?  Remember when I told you that little stunt will be nothing compared to what I have in mind?  Well I\u2019ve got plenty in mind now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole reached out with one incredibly muscled arm toward the tank with a wicked smile on her model perfect, beautiful face; staring down at Jason as though all of his size, all of his super human strength were nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s eyes moved from her hypnotic gaze over toward the tank as he saw.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jason saw Nicole's dainty fingers grip a large portion of the side of the nearly 70 ton vehicle and then bend and warp the solid metal as though it were tin foil. She twisted, reshaped, and formed a deep well in which she could insert her hand and obtain a good grip.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for this, little man?\" Nicole asked peeking around her monumental chest to where he sat on the ground. With no hint of exertion Nicole then curled the M1 tank off the ground and held it high in the air.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't even imagine how it was possible for a human body to possess such strength much less the torque required to pick the tank up from the side instead of the bottom. Nicole then tossed the tank 50 feet into the air and as it descended down upon the two of them she delivered a punch to the vehicle that sent it flying so high it was no longer visible. The punch sent a shockwave blasting out through the air that drove Jason into the ground and rattled his bones.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified Jason began scampering away from the hulking beast that towered over him. Nicole began laughing, her voice seemed to shake the ground beneath Jason which only scared him further.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Nicole called after him. \"The \u00fcber male, the strongest man in the world is afraid of little old me? I'm only getting started. Wait until I get really strong. You haven't seen anything yet.\" She then leapt towards a locomotive that was sitting 30 yards away. She landed on the roof of the train car and proceeded to pound it onto oblivion.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason used the opportunity to make a break for it. He got to his feet and starred running for his car. As he neared the pool and the small building behind it he noticed some motion in the trees. He could see a large arm emerge from the brush and motion him over. He found Laura and Vanessa crouched in hiding.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was relieved to see them, though he still didn't think they stood a chance against Nicole. He quickly relayed the events that had occurred.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura punched Jason in the chest. \"Why the hell didn't you wait for us like I said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I wanted to stop her before she could get to the lab and use the samples she stole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good job on that one.\" Laura's sarcasm stung. He thought to himself that he was very much to blame for more than even Laura was aware of.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Vanessa interjected, \"we brought these.\" She held up 3 small vials of clear liquid with a label on the outside that read, in plain black text, \"Bodyblasters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they'll be enough?\" the older sister asked. Jason noticed that she had clearly been woken up to be here as she had on no makeup and was wearing cotton shorts and a tank top. Jason did his best not to stare at her copious cleavage, but failed. Even in a crisis he just couldn't help himself.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know,\" Laura said. \"They haven't really been tested. We were afraid of growing people larger than ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn't really know what Bodyblasters were, but another idea came to him. \"Nicole drank something from the wet bar over there that allowed her to absorb the chemicals in the pool. What if we were able to do the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Laura and Vanessa looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could work,\" Laura said. \"But it's also possible that whatever it was has been formulated to work with Nicole's body chemistry. There's no telling what could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Vanessa added, \"and not to be crude but whoever takes that might also need your.. uh.. semen to be a part of the mix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should already be in there because...\" Jason really didn't want to finish that sentence. \"Well, it just is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, fine.\" Laura said impatiently. \"So, what's the plan?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Acting upon the fact that Nicole would soon be searching for them, Laura and Vanessa quickly downed the Bodyblasters. The change took place almost instantly as both the girls\u2019 bodies began to tremble uncontrollably before both clenched their fists as the growth took place. It was a success, though it did frighten Jason slightly as he took a step back, as their arms, torsos and legs began to increase in size at first. Then ridges, mounds and ripped definition began to form as if their skin was tightening around their limbs\u2026 or their muscles were getting a whole lot larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched in bewilderment as the two girls transformed right in front of him. While they were a good portion smaller than him before this, each of them now stood a full head taller than him. And they didn\u2019t just break the 8 foot mark in height; their musculature and overall size were nearly double his now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Vanessa began to moan uncontrollably, getting louder and louder, as the growth brought a tremendously orgasmic feeling that was now amplified towards the end of their growth. Immediately, Jason noticed the loud sounds of pounding and metal squealing nearby ceased\u2026 he was sure Nicole had heard the moaning and would find them in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jason smiled\u2026 it would be Nicole getting the unpleasant surprise this time. He took a look at Laura and Vanessa, who now stood massive, naked and admiring each other\u2019s magnificent physiques \u2013 each of them stood taller, wider, bulkier, heavier and, quite certainly, much stronger than Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough, it didn\u2019t take long for Nicole to pinpoint the source of the moaning and she arrived to find herself face to face with Jason and two monstrously muscular girls behind him. Nicole\u2019s arms and legs were huge from being pumped up by the protein bath but Laura and Vanessa were thoroughly enhanced from head to toe with ripped 8 foot physiques that dwarfed her 6 foot 5 size and even larger arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them quickly charged forwards and each grabbed an arm before hoisting Nicole in the air. Along with Jason, they headed back towards the pool, but not before Nicole\u2019s keen eyes spotted the third vial of Bodyblasters they had dropped in the bushes they had been hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you make your muscle cocktail?\u201d Laura demanded to know but Nicole just glared at her without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell us!\u201d Vanessa tightened her grip on Nicole\u2019s muscular arm, though it take considerable effort on her part before Nicole even showed any signs of wincing and discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have no time to waste, we need to find a way to keep her down while we go have a look at her\u2026\u201d Jason\u2019s words were interrupted by a loud bubbling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls and him turned their attention to Nicole\u2019s swimming pool which was now filled with a dark blue liquid that seemed to pop and bubble with a slushing sound. \u201cWhat is going on? What\u2019s in that pool?\u201d Laura asked as she watched the blue liquid filled pool continued to boil and bubble. She turned to Nicole before turning to Jason, while Vanessa did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole quickly took advantage of their curiosity and bewilderment of the pool to muster just enough strength to break free from Laura and Vanessa. She timed it right and caught them by surprise, and before they could even react, Nicole made a run for the pool and dived gracefully into the bubbling pool of opaque blue slush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d Laura screamed \u201cNow what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason noticed the sludgy contents of the pool started to tent upwards in the center and pointed at it, prompting Laura and Vanessa to turn around. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d The 3 of them looked and began to cower in fear as a human-shaped figure began to surface. It was Nicole, now more muscular than ever before and as her new body slowly unveiled itself, she was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But we could follow the foot marks in the ground..\". <br>\r\nAn extra hour of walking later they were led to a massive water pumiping plant with a giant hole in the front entrance where she had bust through, the 3 entered cautiously as they heard short moans coming from the main pumping area, they all walked through to see Lauren, still at 30 feet tall and hooked up to a huge machine. It was to their horror that they then noticed it was pumping the strange blue liquid into her body, Lauren turned around smiling to reveal her massive muscular body once more. Three main pumps going to her nipples and pussy while 8 other pumps with needles on the end were pumping it into her arms and legs. \"COME TO WITNESS MY ASCENSION?!\" She boomed as she ripped the pumps out of her body and punched the machine to the point of utter destruction, pulling out the other 3 tanks of liquid and a strange device that was set to constant circulation, she quickly devoured them and spread her body out. \"NOW YOU WILL WITNESS TRUE POWER AT ITS FINEST AHAHAAA A TINY POOL OF THE STUFF MADE ME THIS SO JUST IMAGINE WHAT A WHOLE OCEAN WORTH WILL DO AHAHAAAAA THAT COMBINED WITH MY CONSTANT CIRCULATION DEVICE AND I WILL BECOME SOMETHING OF A GOD!! MAYBE EVEN MOREEE!\" She screamed at them as suddenly her right arm boomed larger than her entire body, her left did the same as she moaned in delight at her transformation, next her legs bulged furiously, adding masses of.muscles and might onto her massive legs that were now 100 foot around just like her arms. Then her volptuous body evened out, causing her to shoot up to 300 then 500 feet as she screamed and came in ecstacy, her tits booming out way in front of her, nipples and areola expanding audibly atop her breasts. Her abs and hourglass figure followed after, growing respectively as they should as she finally stopped her continouos orgasm of power. \"LOOOK AT MEEEEE AHAHA MMMM OH YEAHHHH THE POWER, THE POWERRRR!!!\" She screamed in might as her eyes glowed a vibrant blue as lighting crackled in them and from nipple to nipple. \"AND NOW IM A HUGE GODDESS OF ALL!

She rose out quickly, as she did the sludge turned from sticky to slippery, running down her body and back into the pool, and stepped forwards to the concrete floor near where they were standing \u201cYou\u2019ve just contributed to the biggest breakthrough that our labs have ever had. I am now a full muscle goddess\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d he punched Nicole in the stomach with a force that would have cracked the hull of the tank he had pressed during his demonstration. But instead of doubling back with pain, Nicole merely flinched slightly and began laughing at how pathetic he was. Jason punched her again, but yet again his fist bounced off the thick wall of cobbled sinew that were her abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something even more frightening occurred as the pool began to bubble and two humanoid figures surfaced. Two muscular females, each standing 7 feet tall and looking identical to Nicole, stepped forwards. Each of them smiled as they began curling their arms into various positions, making their biceps and triceps burst outwards in huge bunches. Both stood superior to Jason though neither could match the size or physique of Laura and Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bitch! What did you do?! What is this?\u201d Jason spat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see from my perfect clones trapping your girlfriend and her sister? THAT is no longer a protein bath, but it has evolved thanks to my DNA mixed with yours into an Olympic-sized pool of biomass, genetically optimized just for me. Your time spent escaping to these two girls instead of fighting me was just enough time for the contents of the pool to\u2026 mutate into this beautiful blue sea\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole snapped her fingers and her two clones rushed forwards to grab Laura and Vanessa. But they were prepared and put up a struggle. Her clones had little chance against Laura and Vanessa, who had a clear advantage in size and strength and easily deflected the blows that were supposed to take them down.<br>\r\nJason looked up at Nicole whose gaze merely stood transfixed at the brawl between her two clones trying to punch and tackle Laura and Vanessa, who defended and blocked them with ease. Then Laura and Vanessa began to fight back ferociously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so tough now, are they?\u201d Jason smirked when Nicole took her eyes off the fight for a moment and took a quick glance at him. But she merely smiled, even as the fast, hard punches from Laura and Vanessa sent her pair of clones flailing backwards and peppered with bruises all over.<br>\r\nIn the next few seconds, they sent the pair of 7 foot tall girls slumped against the wall, exhausted, and stomped up beside Jason, ready to take on the real Nicole who stood smiling at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically, her 9 foot body stood quite a bit larger and more ripped than either Laura or Vanessa alone. But there were two of them along with Jason, and only one Nicole. Yet Nicole didn\u2019t look one bit intimidated and bit one side of her lip seductively as she looked at them. \u201cSurprise\u201d she said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They watched as her two clones leaped to their feet and, before they could stop them, ran and dived back into the pool behind Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, the two clones flew back out of the pool, as if launched by cannons into the air, and gracefully landed, one on each side, next to Laura and Vanessa. Nicole\u2019s clones looked rejuvenated and energetic as ever, ready for another brawl\u2026 their bruises were all gone and there was nothing but perfect golden tanned skin on each of her nude clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut worst of all, they were bigger, more muscular and powerful looking than ever. Each of the two Nicole lookalikes were now 8 feet tall and stood eye-to-eye with Laura and Vanessa respectively; their musculature was no longer inferior, but now matched the two girls they previously were defeated by. \u201cAs long as this lovely pool exists, we are UNSTOPPABLE!\u201d The two Nicole\u2019s said in unison as they began flexing their enormous bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them grabbed Laura and Vanessa by their arms and this time, Nicole\u2019s clones were significantly tougher to resist. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Jason, I\u2019ve already gotten everything I wanted out of you\u201d Nicole smiled as she watched Laura and Vanessa struggle to prevent her clones from subduing them \u201cIt\u2019s these two who will provide the last piece of the puzzle to transform me into a superstrength pumped goddess to take over the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless you can get them.\u201d Jason spat \u201cIt looks like your clones are still a bit lacking compared to my girls\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes they are\u201d Nicole answered \u201cBut not for long\u201d She clasped her hands around one arm on each clone and gripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched as Nicole\u2019s arms rapidly deflated in size until they look ridiculously disproportioned on her 9 foot body. But immediately, the shoulders of Nicole\u2019s clones began to throb with power and their arms began to expand to a massive size. It was a frightening sight for Jason as he watched their skin pulse in wave-like motions, almost as if the muscles underneath were liquid, and began to build on even more muscle from their shoulders down to their forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their arms almost doubled in size and strength, Nicole\u2019s two clones quickly turned the tables and easily wrestled Laura and Vanessa to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee how wrong you were?\u201d Nicole laughed as she bent down next to the pool and dipped her arms into the shimmering blue liquid. She pulled them out after a few seconds and her arms were now restored to their full muscular glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooped up a large handful of the pool\u2019s contents and began to massage them on her breasts, adding on a few cup sizes and more inches of mass on her thickly muscled pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jason tried to stop the already gigantic Nicole from getting larger by reaching up for her arms. But Nicole reacted first and squeezed her hand into a fist, making the substance she was holding spray out a projectile of dense biomass that splattered painfully in his face and made him stumble backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole merely laughed \u201cHaven\u2019t you learned?

We'll be here ready to go with the Bodyblasters if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded then took a deep breath. He peered through the bushes and found Nicole was still playing with the locomotive like an enormous cat with an even more enormous ball of yarn. Jason's heart sank when he realized that she was now balancing the giant train car on it's end using, what appeared to be, one finger. At the same time she was flexing her free arm into a towering 150 inch mass and grinning as she stared up at the peak that rose high above her head. Nicole's size and strength were truly off the charts; Jason knew he had his work cut out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where he knelt behind the bushes he was separated from the edge of the pool by a mere 10 yards, but the patio with the bar was further and the bar itself was further still. He guessed if he made a break for it he would have to cover a good 25 yards completely out in the open. That did not seem like a good option. Jason then realized that the bar was fairly close to the building that housed the bathrooms and pool cleaning equipment and if he followed the bushes down just a little he could dash behind that building with minimal exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hands on Laura's face and pulled her close for a big kiss. \"Here goes nothing,\" he told her. He shot Vanessa a wink as he passed by and noticed that she actually blushed. With his confidence bolstered he made his way to the edge of the bushes which were about 30 or so feet from the edge of the building he'd be using as cover. Suddenly the air was filled with a terrifying screech. Jason looked back to where Nicole was just in time to see the hulking woman finish rending the locomotive into two massive pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Nicole appeared to be distracted by her own accomplishment Jason seized the opportunity to dash behind the building. He then used his powerful legs to leap atop the building and crawled across the top on his belly. When he was sure that Nicole was looking away he dropped down right behind the bar and began furiously searching for anything that could have been what she drank earlier. He found nothing but liquor bottles so he began opening lids and pulling corks giving the contents a sniff. In his haste he set a bottle too close to the edge of a counter and it tumbled down striking the concrete patio and sending a clinking sound echoing off in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason quickly silenced the bottle then waited. Surely Nicole was so absorbed in what she was doing that she wouldn't have heard that, right? The building a few feet to his right exploded and Jason looked to see one half of the locomotive now sitting in the rubble like a wrecking ball. He stood and spun to find Nicole approaching from the far side of the field where she'd been playing with her giant toys. She was casually tossing the other half of the train in one hand like a baseball which was quite an impressive feat considering it was a mangled hunk of steel over 30 feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched with awe as Nicole twisted her body back slightly then pitched the train car down just enough to get some leverage behind it so she could hurl it directly at where Jason stood. He almost didn't even react and instead watched the 60 ton projectile careen towards him. At the last second Jason dove aside landing on his belly just next to the first half of the locomotive. He quickly rolled onto his back and attempted to get to his feet but before he even knew what was happening Nicole was right there towering over him having covered the several hundred feet that had separated them in mere moments. Jason froze in place unsure of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman bent at the waist so she could see Jason around her enormous chest and bust. Nicole's usual immaculately combed hair was now a wild mane of fire that hung down around her face. Her emerald eyes glowed unnaturally bright and she wore a smarmy grin on her face. \"Didn\u2019t we do this already?\" Nicole said in a tone that suggested she couldn't believe he would dare return. \"You already know you can't hold a candle to my power. What were you hoping to do, find more of my formula? Oh there's more, but I'm not dumb enough to leave it lying around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused with a thoughtful look on her face, then she sighed. \"So, what am I going to do with you?\" Her eyes drifted to her arm which she pumped slowly watching the enormous muscles harden into beach ball sized masses before relaxing once more. \"I mean, if you're going to just keep getting involved I suppose I could kill you.\" She tensed her arm tighter still intimidating Jason with her 100 inch guns and making sure he knew she could do it, as if he didn't already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him in the eye and smiled letting her words hang in the air for a few moments. Then her eyes roamed the rest of his muscled body, \"I could but I don't want to; you're just too much fun.\" She released her flex and began gently kneading her breast and tweaking her nipple while staring at the closest thing she had to an equal. \"But I need to make sure you keep out of the way for now, so\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole placed her dainty food on Jason's chest and held him down. Then she began increasing the pressure driving the breath from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Jason asked grabbing her ankle and trying to push against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I curious to see what gives in first, the ground or your chest cavity.\" Nicole said continuing to press harder, hardly noticing Jason's attempts to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he fought Jason's hand slid up to Nicole's calf muscle which was bigger around than a basketball and impossibly hard. Even though he was struggling to survive he couldn't keep himself from squeezing and worshiping her amazing muscles which felt like diamond encased in silky padding. The hydraulic press on his pecs increased beyond his ability to breath when Nicole's question was answered and the cement behind Jason began to crack and give way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought,\" she said continuing to press Jason into the ground until he was encased in a Jason-shaped indent. \"Perfect, now don't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monstrous woman turned to one half of the decimated train car and dragged it over Jason's prone body covering him up to his shoulders, then she gathered the other half and casually tossed the giant weight atop the first one thus guaranteeing that Jason couldn't get out. Then Nicole sat by Jason's exposed head and began caressing his face and running her fingers through his hair as if they were two lovers enjoying a picnic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being so strong is even more exhilarating than I ever imagined, so thank you for helping me get so powerful.\" She said while Jason merely glared at her. \"But what's really surprising are all the extra benefits you've given me; my senses seem to have gotten stronger too. For example, I can smell your fianc\u00e9 and her sister. And now that I've incapacitated you I can crush their little heads between my fingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stood and turned toward the bushes where Laura and Vanessa hid. Jason called out to the both of them to warn them that Nicole knew they were there but that didn't bother the big woman one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, ladies,\" she snarled curling her mind bending arms inward and flexing every muscle group she could. Her monumental crab flex made her body inflate out in all directions with mass Jason had never even dreamed was possible. \"Ready or not, here I come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Vanessa stood and emerged from their cover. They held small vials of clear liquid, Laura had one in hand while Vanessa had two. Quickly, without hesitation, the girls drank their formula.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"For this!\" Nicole said then brought her hands in front of her stomach with her palms pressing against each other below her outrageous bosom. She tensed her arms, shoulders and chest and her torso exploded outward in all directions. Muscle piled on top of muscle which fought for space on Nicole's frame. Her shoulders seemed to reset themselves and widen allowing more room for her rapidly swelling chest and back to grow. Within seconds Nicole's upper body was just as wide and thick as Jason's, but her chest stuck out a lot farther because of the watermelon sized breasts that sat atop her shelf of pectoral muscle. Nicole unclenched her hands and held her arms up for her own examination. They were easily as big as Jason's mighty cannons.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is what I call power.\" Nicole said still watching her meaty arms pulse and twitch with power. \"I can be as big as I want.\" To prove it she struck a double biceps pose showing off her 40 inch arms. Then she straightened her right arm and flexed again while pouring even more size into her massive muscles. Now her right arm was 50 inches around with an insane split running through the peak of her mountainous bicep. Nicole repeated this motion with her left arm and pumped even more size into that arm bringing that bicep to over 65 inches around. Finally, with a grunt, she released and flexed both arms together and her fantastic biceps surged upward so that the peaks topped out a few inches above her clenched fists.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's heart was racing. He was both terrified of this crazy woman who had surpassed his record breaking girth in mere moments and also incredibly turned on. Whatever spell Nicole held over him had been amplified right along with her body. He felt lost in her stunning green eyes and overwhelmed by her sensuous smile. He desperately wanted to run his hands over her diamond hard swells and bulges; to will her larger and larger. His eyes traced the wild juxtaposition between her wide shoulders and thick chest and her slim waist which was lined with bricks of abdominal muscle. It was then that Jason noticed that Nicole's legs had, so far, not been transformed and still resembled those of a female bodybuilder. The look was downright ridiculous; her upper body was monstrous and held a physique never before seen on a human being while her legs were simply large.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole noticed Jason's gaze shift downward and she laughed. \"Are you ready to watch the rest of me transform?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried not to respond, but Nicole must have seen a glimmer of excitement in his eyes because she wore an expression of dominance and victory. She slowly slid her right leg forward before planting her foot on the ground. She gently tensed her muscles making her quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves to grow by just a few inches to start. She then tensed a little harder slowly inflating her leg further. Over and over again she expanded her thigh and calf muscles slowly, adding just a few inches at a time. She could tell she was driving Jason mad with anticipation and a wicked grin spread across her lips when she spotted a thin line of drool drop from his lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her right leg eclipsed Jason's in girth Nicole pressed her bare toes down causing her melon sized calf muscle to flex and harden. The pressure she was exerting caused the cement ground around her goes and the ball of her foot to crack and fracture. Nicole laughed at this. \"I have so much power, so much strength. Just look at what my little toesies can do.\" She flexed her toes harder and dug away at the cement which broke away easily in small chunks.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have complete control. I can grow slowly or...\" Nicole then brought her left leg forward and slammed it down. Before it had even landed Nicole had expanded her left leg to match the right, and her foot hit the ground with such force that she left a perfect indent of her foot and toes with cracks radiating out in all directions for several yards. \"all at once.\" Nicole finished her sentence then placed her hands on her hips. She puffed her chest out and Jason could hear the muscle fibers expanding further.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was at a loss. What could he do against a woman who could could grow at will? He didn't even know if there was a limit to her size, but it was clear she could overpower him with no trouble at all. And if he couldn't match her strength there as no way Laura or Vanessa could even hold a candle to Nicole's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole relaxed her body and her bulk began deflating as if someone had let the air out of her. Within moments she was back to the bodybuilder sized muscles she'd started with. She began seductively walking towards where Jason sat awestruck. Her hips swayed hypnotically from side to side.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can even go the other way, if I want,\" she told him. Her muscles began to shrink further until she was once again a slender supermodel. Her 6 foot 5 inch height remained as did her monstrous breasts. She moved with more difficulty now that her muscles, and as such her strength, were gone and the weight of her huge boobs now affected her. She sidled up to Jason then straddled him with her long luscious legs wrapped around his thick thighs. She leaned in and smashed her breasts against his chest while grinding her crotch against his. \"Of course at this size I'm not nearly as strong as you anymore, but I'm still stronger than just about any other woman out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just what I needed to hear!\" A new voice spoke from behind Nicole who spun around to find Laura with her 33 inch arm cocked and a look of rage on her face. \"Goodnight, bitch!\" Then\u00a0Laura swing her fist at Nicole's head with all of her might.</span></div></div>",

And then came an even scarier realization: the hand was linked to a lengthy limb with a sizeable wrist and thick forearm, which Laura continued to trace along to an intimidating upper arm with biceps bigger than her thighs, all the way up to Nicole\u2019s head which was now several feet above where she had aimed for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not too sure about that\u201d A monstrous voice boomed, vibrating the room and their ears. An eerie smile stretched across Nicole\u2019s face, a face that was now paired with a far larger body \u201cWhat were you planning to accomplish with your fist?\u201d Nicole, now twice as large and still sitting atop Jason, mocked Laura\u2019s puny attempt at knocking her out \u201cLet me give it a try\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laura could react, Nicole had drawn her gargantuan arm backwards, curled her huge hand into a boulder-sized fist and slingshot it into Laura\u2019s abdomen, sending her flying back across the yards of land and into the concrete wall that surrounded her mansion area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stopped straddling Jason and rose to her feet, unfolding to her new 9 foot height and looking down at her marvelous naked form, before unleashing an ear-piercing, ground-shaking laugh. \u201cFUCK! Now THIS is a body I can love\u201d she bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason didn\u2019t even try to escape this time as he lay there on his back staring in awe at the being that looked a mile tall standing over him. He watched as she brought up her monumental arms above her head: what had to be 120 inches of pure muscle on her biceps and triceps bunched up into massive craggy bunches on each arm while each of her forearms dwarfed his own muscular thighs. Her huge breasts had grown even larger but not by a lot and were now proportionally sized to her 9 foot frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took a step forwards to a more dominant position over him, Jason snapped out of it and tried to think of a way to somehow escape. But the only way to outmuscle her was if she was smaller, and right now it seemed she was more than happy with her new size. He looked at her again, at her upper body which was strapped with huge muscles and was once again overcome with fear and lust\u2026 how was it possible that a girl could grow so huge? At this size, she had to have at least triple or quadruple his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could ponder further, Nicole bent down and grabbed Jason, wrapping her vast hand around his middle section. She stared at him momentarily, breathing hard with excitement to the point he could see her massive traps and deltoid muscles pulse with each breath, before a wide smile appeared across her face \u201cI\u2019ve decided\u2026 this is the size I want to be. Time for the final stage to becoming a muscle goddess\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinal\u2026stage?\u201d Jason repeated as she walked till they both faced the Olympic-sized swimming pool which now glowed with a golden liquid \u201cWhat the fuck is this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole rudely interrupted Jason as she stuffed her huge hand into his pants and tore it open from the inside as she cupped her hand around Jason\u2019s 17 inch erection. \u201cI will need your seed for one last time. The height control was merely a stepping stone for me to try out different heights, and I just love being 9 feet tall and looking down at puny humans like you. This pool contains a special mix that will permanently fix my height and turn me into a full-on, muscle packed, powerful superhuman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you already powerful enough?\u201d Jason asked with disgust while trying to stall for time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPowerful? How fickle-minded can you get? YOU HAVEN\u2019T SEEN POWERFUL YET!\u201d Nicole bellowed angrily \u201cIt will rework me from the inside out to something beyond human and your comprehension\u2026 all my senses stretched to the max, virtually limitless strength, the ability to harvest and drain energy from anything, shapeshifting, intelligence and thinking capacity enhanced infinitely over puny humans\u2026 and let\u2019s not forget, I will be sexually superior to all\u2026\u201d she ended her sentence abruptly with a dragged out smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! You\u2019ll never get away with this\u201d Jason beat his fists against her arms but Nicole didn\u2019t even flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already have\u201d She pressed her rock hard nipples into his back and jacked him off with her free hand, unloading thick wads of semen which landed with a sizzle in the golden pool. She ignored Jason flailing his arms helplessly and quickly tossed him onto the grass nearby after she milked him of nearly two gallons of cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow watch\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole jumped and made a graceful dive into the pool of golden liquid. From the corner of her eye, she noticed Laura running towards her, but Nicole wasn\u2019t worried - there was no stopping her now. Laura watched as Nicole splashed into the shimmering opaque liquid and sank into it, the pool swallowing her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura, who had recovered and made a round to flank them, had heard everything and tried to dive into the pool after Nicole. But to her surprise, the shimmering surface of the pool was now solid as marble. She tried punching the surface a few times but it was impenetrable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, what now?\u201d Laura turned back to Jason who shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to find a way to stop her. She is stronger than either of us right now, but do you think she\u2019s telling the truth about becoming superhuman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d But a splash prompted them both to turn their attention back to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Laura looked up as Nicole\u2019s upper body surfaced and she convulsed backwards as she roared menacingly. Her skin was now coated with a golden sheen but if she had gotten bigger, it wasn\u2019t obvious since they couldn\u2019t see a difference in size. They watched as Nicole came to her senses and turned to them with a sinister smile before she dived back underwater in the golden bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look particularly powerful, besides the super-fake gold tan she has now\u201d Laura said to comfort Jason. But she was wrong\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were barely taunted for five seconds about her disappearance when a massive arm rose and planted itself into the side of the pool, smashing into the concrete and leaving a web of cracks everywhere. Jason and Laura began to take in the reality of what they were facing, that Nicole was quite possibly telling the truth about becoming superhuman, as they stared at the sight of the colossal arm that had just surfaced from the pool \u2013 it was HUGE; Nicole\u2019s forearm had to be triple the size of his thighs, and it was linked to an even bigger upper arm, bundled with what looked like at least 200 inches of bicep muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the impressive sight began to settle in, a second identical arm surfaced and smashed into the concrete. More cracking was heard as both arms pressed harder into the ground, accompanied by increasingly crushed concrete around the hands and cracks spreading across a wider radius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, she couldn\u2019t have grown in the five seconds it took for her to swim to the edge\u201d Jason stammered in disbelief. He then trembled slightly as he realized how incredibly spread out one arm was to the other. \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t possible. That would\u2026 that would make her body at least 14 feet wide!\u201d Then, more of the body that was making them quiver began to surface, confirming his fears: A broad, extremely muscular pair of shoulders rose out from the pool, almost in slow motion that gave them a brief peek at a proportionately huge back filled with a map of bumpy muscles before Nicole\u2019s head whipped backwards and her face, plastered with glee, looked towards Jason and Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his fear, Jason also felt aroused as his penis began to thicken at the sight of this muscled beauty rising up. He continued to watch as more of her body became exposed: long golden hair draped on the impossibly broad shoulders which were capped with deltoids packed with muscles while her neck was flanked by traps which formed a high secondary shelf of muscles on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, muscles\u2026 thick, fucking powerful muscles\u201d Nicole moaned with delight as she continued to power her arms into the ground with mounting pressure, bringing more of her body up from the golden liquid. Two gigantic golden globes that were Nicole\u2019s breasts were next to surface out of the pool; they were basically the only areas left with prominent body fat as the pool had turned the rest of Nicole\u2019s body into hard superhuman muscle. Still, her breasts were not to be reckoned with as each tit was bigger than Jason\u2019s head and sat atop a tremendous shelf of pectoral muscles; coupled with the fact her new golden skin was now more impenetrable than the world\u2019s hardest diamonds left Nicole with no particular weak spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was definitely a huge situation Jason had gotten himself into, and he kept blaming himself for letting Nicole capture and use him in the first place. But it was too late now. The rest of her body was just as huge and muscular: hardened abs etched into her body made her waist, which was relatively slim versus the rest of her body, no less intimidating than her muscular thighs which were multiple times the size of tree trunks, or quadruple the size of Jason\u2019s legs.<br>\r\nAs she nearly got her full body out of the pool, Nicole proceeded to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She quickly got to her feet and placed her hands on her hips as her gleaming 9 foot physique stood brimming in superiority. Compared to the average human, Jason and Laura with their 6 and a half foot hyper muscular physiques outclassed any man or woman on earth\u2026 but against Nicole, there was just no comparison. Nicole stood taller, broader, more defined and far more muscular in her own league far above them; she dwarfed them at the level of her breasts, stood over twice as wide with a chest that was triple in depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look at all this MUSCLE!\u201d Nicole bellowed as she slammed one fist into the ground next to Jason. Jason had large muscular thighs from all his growth and training, but next to Nicole\u2019s arm, which was longer from her shoulder to her knuckles than Jason\u2019s legs from his hips to his feet and at least three times as thick, his powerful legs just seemed puny and weak in comparison. \u201cFuck, and I\u2019m just getting started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked down at her chiseled abdomen, prompting Jason to do the same, as the muscles beneath her shimmering golden skin began to swirl and swell. Her skin creaked as her abs became increasingly ripped with deeper definition while her thighs began to get bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love being super! I could never have done it without you, Jason\u2026 now it\u2019s time to destroy you.\u201d Nicole laughed as her words instantly sent Jason and Laura into panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot before we defeat you first!\u201d Laura proclaimed, jumping up high in the air using her potent leg muscles and punching Nicole in the face, while Jason flanked her and smashed his fists into the back of the 9 foot girl. But their hard blows didn\u2019t do a thing as trying to weaken Nicole\u2019s tremendous muscles coated with a satiny golden layer of superhuman skin was like punching rocks coated with a smooth, bouncy layer of steel-hard rubber. Nicole didn\u2019t even flinch as Laura repeatedly landed blow after blow against her pretty face and eventually batted Laura to the floor with one mighty swipe of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole turned her head back to face Jason, a feat that was impossible with a normal human without snapping their neck, and smiled at him getting tired from his efforts at breaking her back before she flexed her back. \u201cAaaahhh, yeahhh, mmm\u2026\u201d Nicole moaned as her back began to thicken. Jason\u2019s jaw dropped as Nicole\u2019s lower back began to pack on more muscle than his chest, arms and thighs combined. She quickly snapped out of her orgasmic state that seemed to be induced whenever she thought of her muscles or experienced growth and let out a ground trembling laugh \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try to even bruise my back now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason quickly ducked as Nicole swung her arm at him and slid beneath her legs to her front. That barely gave him enough time to throw two punches at her crotch, which he had hoped was more vulnerable than the rest of her body, before Nicole rotated her head to face her front. \u201cNice try\u201d Nicole said, evidently annoyed but otherwise looked like she hadn\u2019t even felt the two hard punches he landed on her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hands still balled into huge fists, she extended both her arms, one after another, at Jason who managed to dodge one punch while trying to catch her other fist in his hand. But Jason soon learned that avoiding blows from a juiced up, extremely muscular being like Nicole was a necessity as defending against them was simply impossible. Nicole powered her fist right into Jason\u2019s hand as if it were nothing, breaking his wrist while still being able to land a punch in his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t defeat me! I\u2019m a muscle goddess, remember?\u201d She grabbed him by the neck using just one hand and swung his 500 lbs body a few times around in the air as if he weighed nothing to her before throwing him a few feet away near Laura. \u201cI think your efforts, despite being a big fail, should be rewarded.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole fastidiously reached for Laura\u2019s halter top and workout shorts with both her hands and ripped them apart. \u201cNow we\u2019re all naked\u201d Nicole smiled as her eyes rapidly darted about the naked female and took in every detail of Laura\u2019s muscle-packed body. \u201cLook at both of you\u2026 remarkable specimens of male and female anatomy.\u201d She remarked \u201cBut there is only room for one ultimate icon of perfection, and I am FAR superior to both of you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole narcissistically caressed her right bicep, her hand barely being able to encompass a quarter of the humongous upper arm. \u201cI\u2019m bigger than you, Jason, much bigger\u201d Her bicep began to swell larger and a loud creaking sound echoed through the night as her muscles hardened and veins rose to prominence. \u201cAnd I\u2019m more feminine and hotter than you, Laura\u201d Nicole smiled as her huge tits impossibly inflated to a larger size while her glutes became enlarged and more muscular than before. \u201cStill, I\u2019m missing something that Jason and every man has\u2026 but come to think of it, Laura, you ARE pretty hot\u2026 yes\u2026 inferior to me but still pretty, and muscular, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in the world did she mean? What was she doing? Jason wondered as Nicole\u2019s gaze at Laura intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck yes, that felt good!\u201d Nicole boomed before laughing thunderously \u201cWatch out Laura, I\u2019m fucking hot for you now\u201d Jason and Laura watched as Nicole\u2019s throbbing clit slowly lured their focus away from her dripping snatch. Was it thickening with arousal? They wondered. Yes, and fast too. It reached the point where it literally doubled in size with each throb and soon extended to 5 inches long and thick enough to eclipse her snatch. To Jason\u2019s horror, what looked like a cockhead started to appear and it became more pronounced as her clit slowly began to take the form of a male penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Laura said in disgust as she watched the heavily-muscled amazon grow a cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I had the boys at the lab make something that would work with dear Jason\u2019s juices\u2026 to turn me into a hybrid superhuman goddess\u201d Nicole sounded calmer than before for a moment \u201cWhen the male side of me gets turned on, does it get FUCKING TURNED ON!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood stunned as Nicole\u2019s long clit-turned-cock rose up and quickly formed a stiff 9 inch erection, and still continued to grow. Soon, it throbbed till it was 17 inches in length and 6 inches across, rivaling Jason\u2019s erection, which was still standing up. Nicole grunted as a silvery substance began to ooze out and drip onto the ground below, sizzling lightly with each drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call that a cock?!\u201d Nicole laughed as her erection surged past 24 inches and started to pack on a series of miniature muscles and veins which doubled its girth \u201cJust look how pathetic you are! I\u2019m not only more muscular and stronger than you, I\u2019m bigger and longer than you too down there! Let me show how pathetic you are\u2026 even Laura would agree!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grabbed Laura by her hair and forcibly tossed her onto a concrete bench by the poolside as her cock continued to expand and. \u201cLet go of me\u201d Laura protested, tugging uselessly at the large hand which maneuvered her head effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got a surprise for you\u201d Nicole laughed darkly. Her transformation came to a close as two ostrich egg sized balls surfaced from the base of her shaft and she stood mightily, head facing Jason with a smirk, with a 3 foot long, rock hard erection pulsing between her humongous thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned behind and screamed at the sight of the monstrous cock pulsed against the back of her thighs. \u201cNO! STOP!\u201d She continually beat her fists against Nicole\u2019s forearm while Jason rushed and tried to pull Nicole back by her tree trunk sized thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring both their puny attempts at resisting, Nicole grunted as she shoved one and a half feet of her heavy-duty appendage into Laura\u2019s butt. \u201cFuck! This is so nice and fucking tight!\u201d She laughed as she pulled out slightly and rammed her cock deeper in, causing Laura to instinctively moan from the inevitable pleasure that the thick phallus gave her. \u201cLook closely Jason, THIS is a cock, THIS is power and dominance\u201d Nicole boomed as she wrapped her hand around the exposed part of her appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with anger and humiliation at the sight of Nicole taunting him while fucking his girlfriend, Jason angrily\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With all the strength he could call upon from his body, Jason delivered a hard punch to the shaft of Nicole\u2019s long cock. Nicole flinched slightly and frowned. Evidently it had caused her some discomfort but not enough to make her budge and withdraw from Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole\u2019s expression darkened as her cock instantly started to thicken from the base upwards. Jason watched as Nicole\u2019s member widened a full inch in girth and stretched its victim, Laura, and quickly delivered a follow up punch. But this time, Nicole barely flinched and continued her ramming action. Jason panicked as her cock thickened inch after inch, nearly doubling from its original 9 inch girth and sent Laura screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s enough, lucky you\u201d Nicole smiled as she stopped and, with her cock still in Laura, powered into a full body flex. Something she was doing was causing Laura to rapidly shrink from her immensely muscular form down to a plain, toned 5\u201911\u201d 180 lbs figure\u2026 and with that, Nicole was done and withdrew her cock. Nicole and Jason both watched as the long 3 foot cock shrunk and disappeared, before Nicole suddenly batted at Jason with her huge arm and sent him flying \u201cThat, was for hitting me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason landed near the gun that Nicole originally had used on him and seized the chance to grab it. He quickly rolled over and pointed it squarely at Nicole as she began to approach him \u201cStop!\u201d he demanded but Nicole merely laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll test that little thing on a super muscular goddess like me?\u201d Almost as if her body was responding to the impending threat, Nicole\u2019s chest began to thicken. Slab after slab of beefy muscles began to layer her already immense pectorals and pushed her already prominent breasts outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason noticed this and squeezed the trigger before she became impenetrable. But she didn\u2019t need to be invincible if nothing could touch her\u2026 Nicole caught the projectile directly in the middle of her chest, squeezing her breasts together and stopping the bullet in between with her superhuman reflexes. She began to laugh as she squeezed her pectorals together, and soon after, drops of liquid metal that used to be the bullet began to drip downwards from her pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason frantically aimed for her abs, knowing her upper body would make targeting anything above her chest futile, and unloaded. Nicole merely laughed as the projectiles created tiny sparks as they landed and harmlessly bounced off her muscular abs. \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got? Now it\u2019s my turn!\u201d Jason watch horrifically as her clit began to thicken and transform, this time at a far faster rate which led him to believe the first time it happened, she was either showing off or the transformation took longer during its first time. Within seconds, Nicole had her hand wrapped around the thick shaft of a lengthy 3 foot cock with pre-cum already bubbling out from the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving him time to react, Nicole pumped her cock and shot out a fist-sized blob of cum which hit Jason squarely in the chest; its impact so powerful that Jason was sent stumbling back a few steps. Nicole promptly sent another 6 jets of cum, the last of which was a huge basketball-sized wad, hitting Jason in the chest, stomach and arms before he finally fell to the floor, exhausted and bruised all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink of an eye, Jason found Nicole standing over his now-spent, pathetic self. He could barely see her face between the cleavage of tits, muscles and chest beef, but he didn\u2019t need to in order to figure she was taunting him. The view from the ground seemed a lot different, especially when he usually stood high and mighty with his 6 foot 6 height which was far superior to the average person, yet the same with Nicole as he was both treated and tormented with a new view of vast acres of muscle and enormous inhuman definition of sinewy veins and muscle groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stayed silent for a moment with her body heaving ever so slightly with each breath. She had the tips of her toes of each foot resting lightly on Jason\u2019s biceps, but that was all she needed to keep him pinned down, and she smiled to herself as she could feel him continuing to resist pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you want now?\u201d Jason asked angrily as Nicole continued to be quiet while playing with his biceps using her toes and her long cock still dripping with cum that landed on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst\u2026\u201d Nicole said with a paused as her prick began to throb ominously \u201cI want you to shut up\u201d With that, Nicole began to furiously rub her hand up and down her shaft while letting out thunderous moans that even made Laura cover her ears from several feet away. Jason watched as the movements of her hand turned into a lightning fast blur and a crackling sound as her muscular erection hardened. There was a brief unnaturally calm pause before the giant cock began to pump out copious amounts of silvery semen onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good 30 seconds before she stopped ejaculating, by which time she had expelled nearly five gallons of cum all over Jason and the floor. \u201cNow, what do I really want?\u201d Nicole smiled as she squat down and loomed over Jason, heedless of her still erect member still spurting out juices.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll see in a few moments just how special it is\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole saw the panic in Jason\u2019s eyes but calmly grabbed him, stood up and rammed a foot of her long cock into Jason\u2019s ass. He began to scream as she pumped it in and out of him, ramming it deeper, harder and faster each time. Nicole laughed as ridges began to form along her shaft, widening the sizeable 16 inch girth of her cock and making each pump into Jason more painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole moaned as she felt nothing but pleasure from her long member and arousal from forcefully dominating a powerful man like Jason. As she continued to gasp and Jason continued to scream, a long sinuous tongue extended out of her mouth and began to lick Jason\u2019s pectorals while her body began to emit a strong superhuman pheromone which invisibly fueled Jason\u2019s erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Show me how big a man you are!\u201d Nicole laughed as she wrapped her hand around Jason\u2019s cock and began to pump it. At the same time, she began to ejaculate thru her own cock; pumping out juices that were triple the volume Jason was expelling as if she wanted to emphasize who was in control and superior in every way. Nicole pulled out of Jason with the sound of one last scream from him and began to jack herself off \u201cUseless male! Even my hand does a better job than any part of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was done, Nicole stood up and pulled Jason up with her. He inspected himself and realized he was a lot smaller than he used to be, standing 6 feet even and 240 lbs; still incredibly buff for a male but way smaller than before. What happened?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now you\u2019re human again.\u201d Nicole laughed \u201cBut now, I\u2019M A TOTAL BEAST!\u201d Nicole\u2019s left arm suddenly began to swell rapidly with increased muscle mass, as if their present ripped state wasn\u2019t enough, and quickly rocketed in length towards the ground until it stretched from her shoulder to her feet. She looked ridiculous for a moment, as the sheer size and weight of her arm made her body tilt to one side, before the same growth repeated to her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit\u201d Jason took a few steps back as Nicole\u2019s huge arms, now at least 300 inches in size, caused her to hunch forwards and support their weight on her knuckles. But her proportion quickly balanced itself back into a more humanly shape as her legs and torso began to lengthen significantly. He watched in awe as layer upon layer of muscle began to visibly coat and strengthen the already immense girth of her thighs while her abdominals began to fill out with even more muscle than anyone could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly pissed himself as her breasts, which were originally slightly above his head, rose higher and higher up while her hardened abs took their place at his eye level. But even that passed by quickly and soon, he had to look up to see her navel. Loud creaking and crackling noises were heard as Nicole\u2019s skin coped with the insane amount of growth happening beneath. Nicole\u2019s growth spurt sent her hitting the 15 foot mark while her body had essentially quadrupled in surface area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason now stood face-to-face with a monstrous pair of thighs. A thunderous laughter began to shake the ground as Nicole placed her hands on her hips. From her view, some 9 feet above his head, he seemed puny and vulnerable to be squashed under her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over now; Jason didn\u2019t even want to try. The gigantic pair of thighs, each measuring twenty times the girth of a muscular male chest, throbbed with power and stood like monuments on their own that supported their owner\u2019s 3000 lb weight with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smacked her lips \u201cThe energy from you and Laura combined was very delicious\u201d she walked towards the bar by the pool where she kept all her supplies and mixtures and smashed the entire structure flat under her feet \u201cI\u2019m self-sustaining now, and with rapid super-adaptive evolution in place\u2026 none of this will be of use to me ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly ignoring them, Nicole leaped over the tall walls that surrounded her mansion compound with ease and started running; based on the direction, Jason guessed it was towards the docks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they had been left alone, Jason turned to Laura; both of them still quite muscular and with a good ten times the strength of an average human, but far more inferior to Nicole than when they had first started out. They knew to defeat Nicole now, they had to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nicole's huge back faced him as she continued to penetrate Laura with her god-like cock. Nicole's back tensed and flexed with every thrust as she leaned her head back, moaning with pleasure as she fucked Laura. Watching Nicole's sculpted ass flex with effort with every thrust, Jason was suddenly overcome with desire. Her rushed at Nicole, thrusting his own ample cock towards her ass. It slid in easier than he would have anticipated and before he knew it his own cock was balls deep in Nicole's muscular ass. She gasped at the sensation, her eyes going wide in surprise. She slowly closed her eyes and smiled as she realized what Jason had done. Looking back over her shoulder Nicole laughed at the tiny man pressed against her ass. \"Enjoying yourself back there Jason?\" she quipped. \" Allow me to help.\" Nicole flexed her glutes and Jason was instantly shocked as his cock was crushed in the vice like grip of her ass. \"Don't look so distraught little man. That's not even a fraction of what these cheeks can do!\" Clenching her glutes harder, Nicole forcefully slid Jason's cock in, and then out of her ass, using her own strength to pump his cock into her. \"Ohhhhh Yesssssss!\" Nicole moaned, massaging her own throbbing cock still halfway inside of Laura. The mere thought of having not one but two people under her complete sexual control brought Nicole near to orgasm. She began to work them both harder, fucking Laura while using Jason as a sex toy. Nicole could feel an intense orgasm building inside of her. She was the strongest, she was the biggest, she was the GODDESS!</span></div></div>",

By the way, thanks for coming into the office and leaving traces of yourself, including hair, the other day. Can you imagine how ineffective these numbing darts would be on this\u2026 nice, big body of yours\u2026 had they not been tailored specifically for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you sneaky little bitch!\u201d Jason yelled as Nicole slowly expanded to 6\u20194\u201d with her toned body getting increasingly defined \u201cYou\u2019ll never get away with this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I already have\u201d Nicole said with a giggle, followed by a slight moan as she continued to experience a tremendous rush through her body. Still, she was coping with her growth very well and maintained full mental and physical control over herself. She pulled out a small machine from her purse, which looked like a micro coffee-maker, that began unfolding like a Transformers robot to unveil various compartments and slots which she filled with the samples she had collected from Jason earlier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that? What are you doing?\u201d Jason, still numb, exclaimed in fright as the thing began to feed everything into a central tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that? It\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re really timid for such a big man, that small contraption isn\u2019t gonna hurt a big boy like you\u2026\u201d Nicole laughed \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if I can say the same for the results from that blender\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whirring and mixing stopped after just several seconds, where a hidden underside compartment released a tube with a sparkling purple mix, evidently the result of processing samples from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! NO!!!\u201d Jason tried to move but he just couldn\u2019t, no matter how much he struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, I was done with you a long time ago. This\u2026\u201d Nicole daintily picked up glass tube of glowing purple \u201cThis is for me!\u201d she uncapped the tube, which unveiled a flat tip with a permeable cover, and shoved it up herself under her skirt, which by now was stretched to the limit by her thick thighs and huge long legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was instantaneous and Jason watched as Nicole experienced a horrifying exponential growth in size and muscles which shredded her of all her clothes. In under five seconds, she spurt up to well over 9 feet tall and her muscles quadrupled in size, pausing several seconds before quadrupling again and again. This repeated about 3 times until the only recognizable part of Nicole was her gorgeous head, now perched upon a human-shaped mass of monstrous muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\u201d Nicole straightened her knees and slowly stood up to her new 14 foot height while placing her hands behind her head and flexing her arms and chest simultaneously. She was big\u2026 no, not even that, she was huge\u2026 no, huge would be an understatement\u2026 she was now a monstrous muscle goddess. Each of her arms had to be twice as large around as his legs while Nicole now had bigger voluptuous breasts that stood out from the already massive 5 feet slab of chest beef and pectorals she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forwards and began to power herself into a full body flex, making her ripped abs become insanely ripped with thick knots of veins mixed with muscles and making her lats and boulder-sized delts jut out hugely from her body in such a way that she cast a shadow over Jason. For someone who was the strongest and most muscular MAN the world had ever seen, Jason paled in comparison over this new entity who was double his height, triple his width and multiple times as muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think daddy will be delighted to take a look at you, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it\u201d Nicole grabbed Jason by lower legs and held them tightly together with just one hand before slinging his body over her broad shoulder and towed him like a sack of potatoes out into the night. \u201cYou think I\u2019m gigantic now? He\u2019s going to make me big, REALLY REALLY BIG!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pounded down the sidewalk, leaving cracks all over the pavement and crushing things like cars and bikes as she crossed the streets and headed on to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She paid them no mind as she sauntered into the lab facility, her head grazing the vaulted ceiling. She entered the main laboratory with a confident swagger that comes with the knowledge of extreme power. Dr. Richards was bent over a lab bench analyzing some chemicals when Nicole spoke \"Daddy, I'm home!\" Dr. Richards turned and his eyes widened in surprise and alarm at the fourteen foot behemoth that stood before him. Every inch of Nicole's god-like body bulged with inhuman power. Every shift of her weight caused her muscles to flex effortlessly to incredible proportions. She made a pouting face. \"You look worried daddy, aren't you glad to see your little girl?\" Dr. Richards tried to contain his alarm as he spoke. \"Nikki... wow, I guess your theory really was correct.\" dropping Jason to the floor in a heap Nicole went into a most muscular flex and snarled. \"Your fucking right my theory was correct! Look at me! Look at what I have become!\" She began to run her hands over her incredible form, flexing muscles larger than any human on earth. Suddenly she grew serious again. \"I brought the samples daddy, I have them right here.\" She opened her huge hand to reveal the device containing the samples of Jason's cum. She walked over to Dr. Richard's lab bench and placed the device on the bench. Standing before her Dr. Richards barely came to eye level with his daughters bulging thigh. Nicole flexed a titanic bicep casually. \"Now it's time to make good on your promise daddy. It's time for you to use those samples to make me a GOD!\" Dr. Richards couldn't keep from trembling as he picked up the sampling device from the lab bench. \"Sweet heart... don't you think you're big enough? We could use these samples to make millions! Change the world!\" Nicole furrowed her brow angrily. Her muscles seemed to flare instinctively. \"FUCK THAT! You said you could make me BIGGER! Thats what I want! To become more than human! To rule this planet as a fucking GODDESS! You WILL use these samples to make BIGGER and you'll do it NOW! I command it!\" By now Dr. Richards was terrified of the hulking giantess that had been his daughter. One flick of her wrist could snap his neck like a twig. \"OK OK calm down Nikki, we can give you what you want.\" Nicole brought her fist down on the lab bench denting the steel table like wet cardboard. \"WELL WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! DO IT NOW!\" she roared. Dr. Richards immediately set to work, not wanting to see his daughter get any angrier than she already was. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWe actually have the appropriate equipment to process these samples right now\u201d Dr Richards explained to his massive daughter \u201cJust allow me to explain\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Nicole could protest, he had already pressed a button which opened a large metal door and a big hunky guy stepped out to stand next to Nicole\u2019s father. At 6\u20196\u201d and 300 lbs, Bryce stood a good head over his girlfriend\u2019s father but was far smaller, obviously, compared to Nicole\u2019s 14 foot height. He was shirtless, wearing just a jockstrap with a large sack at its front, and looked like he didn\u2019t need to wear any clothes with a perfect tan-coated muscular physique. His most notable feature had to be his arms: they were enormous in size, at 22 inches in size when relaxed, his biceps dwarfed most men\u2019s thighs and his shoulders were huge to the point he could knock someone out if he were to ram into them (and he had even done it before to prove it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach bicep was heavily threaded with pencil thick veins that flowed down to his equally sizeable forearms, which in turn were topped by large hands which were balled into boulder sized fists as he stood there waiting with the smaller, older man by his side. He looked absolutely beastly compared to the average man next to him: from one muscle-capped delt to the other, Bryce was about 7 feet wide and had an arm span of close to 9 feet thanks to his huge shoulders pushing his arms far out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Bryce\u2019s size was no mistake. The 19 year old football jock who used to be 5\u201911\u201d and 190 lbs had transformed, with the help of Dr Richards, over the past year into a massive hunk from various growth and strength serums. Of course, this was merely the start of things\u2026 by getting the secret of Jason\u2019s large size and strength, James was bent on turning Bryce into the ultimate specimen of a perfect superhuman with an ideal size of 9 feet tall and 700 lbs of rock hard muscles, something both Bryce and his girlfriend would really appreciate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryce stood confidently as he waited; the large pouch at the front of his jockstrap twitched uneasily as it struggled to contain the beast within. \u201cNicole?!\u201d Bryce huffed at the sight of this 14 foot giantess that just stepped into the room with a large male over her shoulder. \u201cWow, fuck, you\u2019re huge!\u201d He said in admiration as his cock began to harden, slowly pushing the underwear to its limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBryce? Damn you got big too, though not as big as me\u201d Nicole powered one tremendous bicep into a huge flex, making a huge mountain of muscle rise and veins pop out. \u201cOh, let me introduce you to Jason, the little twerp who used to call himself the world\u2019s strongest person\u2026 not anymore though!\u201d She curled her huge arm upwards, making her huge traps and delts rise to prominence, and began to squash Jason in between the confinement of her muscular bicep and shoulder. \u201cYou can\u2019t be the strongest person ever if a girl can knock you out just by squeezing you\u2026 GOOD NIGHT!\u201d Nicole tightened her flex and squeezed Jason into unconsciousness before dropping him down for Dr Richard\u2019s assistants to carry him off into the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, perhaps with the presence of your boyfriend, that might have changed your mind a little?\u201d Dr Richards questioned hopefully \u201cYou could witness him grow to a larger size first, all the better to please you\u2026 and then you can become a superstrong muscle goddess later\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole contemplated her father\u2019s words for a brief moment. He was right\u2026 Bryce was far too small compared to her now; she would squash him into pulp if he even tried to please her, and besides, what was a brief delay now compared to the pleasures she would receive from her boyfriend if he was much bigger. \u201cFine\u201d she huffed reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I need you to do is get into that glass cylinder in the other room. It will fill up with a special liquid that allows you to breathe in it and will serve as a medium for energy transfer.\u201d Dr Richards explained as he walked Nicole into an empty room with nothing but white tiles on the walls and three huge glass cylinders in the middle. Each glass container was roughly 15 feet tall and 25 feet wide which allowed Nicole to simply walk in without having to squeeze her large body into it. \u201cWe will give Bryce a head start in absorbing Jason\u2019s strength, since you\u2019re already much bigger than him, but we\u2019ll hook you up shortly after\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but make it quick\u201d Nicole agreed as Dr Richards shut her into the cylinder made of a special glass that was so strong, it was near indestructible. He was confident not even a muscle-packed girl like Nicole could break out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin\u201d Dr Richards announced as Bryce got into the glass cylinder which directly faced the tubes that contained Jason and Nicole. The tubes containing Jason and Bryce began to fill up and suspend them in a liquid. Jason stirred just as a shimmery green liquid filled his vision, and a purple liquid filled the cylinder opposite him containing Bryce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he tried protesting but struggling in the liquid that suspended him was like trying to get out of a huge jelly blob that kept bouncing him back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The project was off to a great start as Jason\u2019s exaggerated muscular physique was reduced to a mere 6\u20194\u201d and the size of a football player, albeit an above average muscular one but still far from his super muscular form. All that size and power was instantly transferred Bryce whose face instantly lit up with a smile as he could feel his 6\u20196\u201d 300 lbs body pack on more muscle and weight at an unimaginably fast rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn organic creaking sound was heard as Bryce\u2019s skin struggled to cope with his growth and as muscles on every inch of his body began to expand and harden. At first the growth came in width as his arms ballooned to a tremendous size, along with his chest and legs\u2026 but then he began to pack on more height. Dr Richard\u2019s invention quickly transferred Jason\u2019s nutrients to turn Bryce into a hulking 7 foot tall, 400 lbs fine specimen of a man within half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Nicole signaled to one of the numerous assistants to begin adding a super-growth accelerator, derived specifically from the sampling device which would amplify the effect of harvesting Jason\u2019s strength, and patch her in to share the fruitful yields that Bryce was enjoying. She got a nod from the assistant as her tube began to fill up with a purple liquid as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched furiously but helplessly as the machine continued to drain him down to his original 5\u20197\u201d, 140 lbs scrawny self while converting the potent strength that used to be his and channeling it to Bryce who just grew bigger and bigger. But Jason\u2019s fury turned into fear the instant the accelerator serum kicked in, turning the purple liquid that Bryce in which was suspended into a sparkly blue color, and the already big young man began to pack on muscles and size at a mind-numbing rate. The status beside Bryce\u2019s container ticked up to 7\u20192\u201d, then 7\u20193\u201d, then 7\u20194\u201d as he began to grow steadily and rapidly, about an inch in all directions every few seconds\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than half a minute later, Bryce was now a staggering 8 feet tall and 500 lbs of muscle, showing no signs of stopping. Nicole, who was delighted at first at the sight of huge biceps, quads, lats, glutes and hamstrings tearing out of Bryce\u2019s body and making him more ripped than ever before, was now impatient as she felt no different\u2026 still 14 feet tall and the same amount of power she had at Jason\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe banged one fist against the impenetrable glass, making a loud \u2018THUMP\u2019 sound that got the attention of the workers in the other room. \u2018Start it now!\u2019 she mouthed as she watched everyone rush around at an even busier rate, fearing the wrath of the giantess once she was done with this ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the reading on the screen beside Nicole\u2019s tube dropped to \u201913 ft\u2019 as she shrunk a full foot in size, not a lot relative to her height but it was noticeable. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d James asked his staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears there\u2019s an error which is causing her size and strength to get absorbed too\u201d One of the guys manning the controls explained \u201cWe\u2019ll get it fixed soon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s getting her strength and size?\u201d he said in slight panic; the last thing he wanted was Jason to grow all powerful again and tear the entire facility apart. \u201cFix it now! Right away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, Bryce is receiving all her strength and we need to temporarily stop the absorption process\u201d Another assistant sounded, just as Nicole shrunk another foot to 12 feet tall. The reduction in size this time was accompanied with a gradual deflation of her muscle size\u2026 simultaneously as that happened, Bryce shot up a full foot in height and peaked at 9 feet tall while his muscles began to inflate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole quickly deduced what was going on and pounded her fists on the glass in protest and anger. Yet it was useless as she continued to weaken and get drained, first to 10 feet tall, then she was 8 feet. By the time the liquid was drained out of her tube, Nicole was down to 6 feet tall and far less muscular than before, though she was still incredibly muscular for her size with a physique of a female body builder and certainly a lot bigger than the average female athlete. \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Nicole screamed, angrily stomping her feet within the confines of the glass container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately for her, no one bothered with her this time as all their attention was turned to Bryce who was growing at an astonishing rate. His weight reading began to rise with fast growing digits spinning like slot machine icons; he began to push 650 lbs with growing muscles, looking like a giant-sized bodybuilder right now. The only lucky thing was the glass container Bryce stood in was built with far larger subjects in mind and still managed to hold him\u2026 for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the next few minutes, the electronics in the facility managed to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHis growth is getting out of control! We can\u2019t stop it!\u201d one of the assistants yelled out. Everyone watched in horror as weight readings went off the charts and increased exponentially, from 700 to 800 lbs, then 1000 lbs and then 1400 lbs\u2026 along with a corresponding increase in body and muscle size, though Bryce\u2019s height remained at a firm 9 feet tall. Soon, he was weighing over 2 tons of pure hugely dense muscles and smoke began to come out from the machinery and the room that Bryce was contained in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing anyone in the room saw was him becoming so huge, that his size far exceeded the capacity of the glass container that was built to accommodate a tremendous amount of growth, before he burst out of containment while the equipment overheated at the exact moment\u2026 A deafening bang reduced the testing area into ruins, though the rest of the building remained safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Dr Richards\u2019 assistants, a gorgeous brunette girl in her mid-20s, was the first to recover from the mayhem. She only saw smoke and dust all around her but then the ground began to tremble and it was getting more intense and louder. The sound of metallic squealing echoed the ruins of the chamber as if something was squashing the fallen titanium frames of the room like paper, this wasn\u2019t good. Slowly, she crept backwards, hoping whoever that was would not notice her, but the sound of her hands pushing against the debris and broken glass betrayed her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the dusty ruins appeared Bryce, now transformed into a frighteningly large muscular giant. He stood 9 feet tall but at 5 tons of hugely dense muscles, the width of his body was simply monstrous: his chest stood out at 100 inches around and more than 6 feet thick. Deep muscled pectorals, that looked like they could crumble concrete pillars, carved a perfect separation into his massive chest and transitioned smoothly into a rock solid textured abdomen with muscles that twitched like living steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant stood dumbstruck at the sight of this being. Witnessing his growth from another room behind multiple layers of indestructible glass was certainly far different than standing so closely to this male with an impossibly godly body. She stood with her head at the level of his immense thighs, which looked like they could fit and crush tractors between them, and slowly looked up, her eyes elevating from the view of his steely abs to his huge neck and traps and finally up to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh up there, a perfect handsomely formed masculine face with ruffled brown hair stared back down at her with green eyes that seemed to emanate a glow. Bryce was inconceivably huge yet more perfect than any human man\u2026 his ripped body and model-like face would make any girl wet herself, an effect which began to take place with this lab assistant. Yet she also began to fear for her life as a snarky smile stretched across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daze was soon broken as Bryce let out a grunt and a sound like rubber being stretched drew her attention back down to the events occurring at her eye level: In between his tree-trunk legs was a lengthy 2 foot flaccid penis which began to rise from its limp form just as she looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn! What a babe!\u201d Bryce said under his breath as he began to undress the brunette in his mind which made his penis start to sprout a tremendous erection. It was a breathtaking yet deadly sight as Bryce\u2019s penis began to harden, rise and lengthen simultaneously. It was like nothing any man had as his cock grew to an amazing 4 feet long and as thick around as a huge thigh, ripped with a cobbled texture and thick veins\u2026 it had muscles, sinewy ripped cock muscles! \u201cFuck\u201d Bryce muttered as a huge blob of liquid formed at the tip of his muscled cock and instantly trickled down the appendage, effectively lubricating his thick shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Please! No, leave me alone!\u201d The girl protested \u201cI helped in making your super growth possible!\u201d She stammered as she looked at this monstrous male staring down at her. He looked indifferent to what she had just said before his expression quickly darkened and he let out a loud roar that made her ears ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelped? Did you really have a hand in this?\u201d Bryce casually flexed his gargantuan arms and raised them so he could view his thick forearms \u201cBecause whoever who came up with the stuff to make me into this FAILED!\u201d He placed so much emphasis into his last word until it rung and echoed in the poor girl\u2019s ears repeatedly for several seconds \u201cI wanted to be BIGGER! I wanted the ability to shapeshift! I wanted the ability to absorb mass! WHERE ARE ALL MY ABILITIES?!\u201d He got noticeably angrier and somehow his anger was reflected by the size of his cock as his penis began to widen and lengthen to a solid 6 feet long. \u201cLICK!\u201d he commanded furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis seemed to respond to his every thought, which Bryce himself found surprising and new, as it lowered its angle down to the level of assistant\u2019s mouth while maintaining its fully erect state. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m sorry, I want to make this right for you. Don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d The young lady said in tears as she stood face-to-face with the huge basketball-sized cockhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bryce ignored her pleas and his eyebrows knit downwards in an angrier frown. Dr Richards had intended to insert some sort of emotion control into the growth serum in order to limit Bryce once he had reached a colossal size, but the machines had failed far before that, leading Bryce to experience the full side effects of the growth serum: Heightened anger and agitation levels, lower tolerance, zero empathy, a constant and tremendous desire to dominate and control and an ego that was as big as his massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unfortunate part was that transformation process DID include some powers that he would be far less powerful without. Notably, Bryce now had senses that were heightened to superhuman levels, allowing him to sense people approaching him from behind from yards away, and he retained full conscious control over his cock and its juices\u2026 he would spurt regular cum by default, but could mentally control and change his semen to include growth characteristics when ingested. His intelligence remained the same as before but his mind was greatly sharpened to the point he would make no mistakes, eliminating the chance he would \u2018accidentally\u2019 discharge his growth cum into someone he didn\u2019t want to make huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou WILL lick my cock!\u201d he shouted angrily as globs of semen dripped to form a large puddle at her feet, effectively gluing her in place on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d A voice suddenly shouted, making him turn around to see\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he opened his eyes he squinted, blinded by fluorescent lights overhead. Where was he? The place was clean and organized with scientific equipment and chemicals littered around. The lab of some strange scientist or doctor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat bolt upright, the tranquilizing darts having mostly worn off. A doctor\u2019s lab - Dr. Richards! That meant Nicole had taken him here! He had hoped that vision of her expanding to twice his size and becoming even more muscular had been a nightmare but if not\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, and darted through an open doorway to where he heard the whir of machinery and voices. He prayed he wouldn\u2019t be too late to halt this horror. As he rounded the corner he saw Nicole in her 14-foot tall glory, her luscious red hair framing her victorious face in a corona of flame. Behind her was a massive vat of a glowing purple liquid like she had used to become\u2026 this back at his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d he cried, charging forward. He knew he couldn\u2019t take Nicole directly, so he veered off and slammed into her father. \u201cAre you mad?? I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s your daughter - don\u2019t give her any more of that!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s anger quickly subsided to be replaced once more by terror as Dr. Richards, gasping for breath, merely pointed behind Jason. Jason dropped the doctor as a maniacal, booming laugh came from behind him, followed by the chamber being filled with the sounds of Nicole\u2019s moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmmmMMMM you fool! You\u2019re already too late!!! I\u2019ve taken twice as much as I did before - and the effect is exponential! A single dose magnifies height and strength by 2.25x, so two more will let me put the 50-foot woman to shame!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole continued to moan and cry out louder and louder as her beautiful face burst through the ceiling. Muscle mass continued to pack onto her frame as her perfectly round, firm breasts pushed further outwards, though the too were soon above the ceiling. Jason tried to run, but before he could flee a ginormous calf had blocked the door. Liquid began to drip into the area as Nicole played with herself amidst her growth, while her shouts of pleasure grew further away yet increased in intensity. The floor began to collapse under the giantess\u2019 weight, though the formula tank was still secured by metal beams attached to all the walls and a solid base. As the shaking of her growth ceased, Jason barely came above her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the rest of the ceiling collapsed as a massive hand reached in and grasped him and Dr. Richards. Slowly they rose to meet her face sitting atop a mountain of muscle yet still flawlessly feminine in appearance, not overshadowed by the strength in her toned shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooohhhh thank you so much daddy for helping me to start my growth to goddesshood! Looks like your little girl\u2019s finally starting to grow up\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cAnd as for you Jason, I never could have possessed all this power without you! Aww, do you want to give me a little boost? I guess tall girls really turn you on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down and saw, to his immense shame, that the sight of such beauty and strength had made his penis fully erect. Raising him to her mouth, Nicole deftly sucked him off, causing him to ejaculate almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, yummy! And it looks like it\u2019s augmenting the formula wonderfully!\u201d she teased as she shot up another 10% to a lucky 77 feet. \u201cI must say, nothing else can compare to the feeling of all of this power!\u201d she said, flexing an enormous bicep that was nearly as tall as Jason. \u201cNow the only question is\u201d she asked, eyeing the tank that still had 20 doses in it (each again magnifying her power by 2.25x), \u201cshould I go show off all this power to the world or give myself even more first?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he agreed to go see Greg she looked visibly relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason changed out of his tuxedo and back into his regular clothes rather quickly; he was definitely getting used to moving with such incredible bulk. Even more so he was really enjoying the power he felt behind his every move and the way others looked at him with reverence.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he'd changed clothes Jason said goodbye to Vanessa and joined Laura in her car. They drove to Greg's in silence and thousands of questions ran through Jason's mind. He wondered about Greg's relationship with his family and what caused it to be strained. He wondered how he and Laura got engaged. He really wondered about his apparent former relationship with Vanessa. A part of him felt lost and alone, but mostly he was excited to discover what this world had in store for him. He just had to be careful what he said and how he acted.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura parked her car outside a very small gym that looked closed. As far as Jason could see there was no one inside and the place hadn't been used in a while. Laura led Jason through a door next to the gym which led to the apartment above it. They found the door was cracked open and went inside.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck you want?\" spoke a deep voice from across the room.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned to the source and saw Greg slumped on a couch with a large liquor bottle in his hand that had nearly been completely drained. Jason could instantly see that Greg was now much larger, his body had added a good hundred pounds of muscle to his already large frame. He was shirtless and wore only a tight pair of shorts. Jason estimated that Greg was easily bigger than any professional bodybuilder he was familiar with, though he and Laura were even bigger.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here because of your call. I wanted to make sure you were ok.\" Laura said slowly crossing the room to where Greg sat.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I not be ok? Look at me! I'm fuckin' shredded!!\" Greg dropped the bottle of liquor and flexed his arms. \"Look at these guns! 28 inches!! That's a world record. Or it was.\" Greg looked past Laura and shot daggers at Jason.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's what this is all about? You're jealous of Jason? So what if he's bigger than you? He and I are about the only ones!\" Laura yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because you two are cheaters!! And even worse you won't fucking share!! My own sister. And you pick him over me!\" Greg stood up. Greg was a bit taller now as well and stood a good 6 inches over Laura, but Jason still had the height advantage by more than half a foot.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stepped forward, she was bigger and clearly stronger and she wasn't about to let anyone push her around. \"I didn't pick anybody!! You took yourself out of our lives!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't even tell me how!!\" Now Greg was right in Laura's face. \"How did you do it?!!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura cocked her arm and was about to deliver a devastating blow to Greg's jaw when Jason grabbed her fist. \"Stop! Do you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what?\" Greg said. \"I don't hear nothing. You'd better get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason puffed out his chest and looked Greg right in the eye. \"Shut it. Now.\" He loved having all the authority, it was intoxicating.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stood in silence for a moment. Then there was the unmistakable sound of someone crying from behind a closed door. Jason walked over and put his hand on the knob.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you open that door!\" Greg warned, but Jason didn't hesitate. He opened the door onto the bathroom (it had been locked, but he hadn't even noticed) and found a girl sobbing.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara! What are you doing here?\" Laura rushed forward and put her arm around the girl. \"I thought you and Greg broke up weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason saw that the girl, Sara, was bruised and battered. Some of her cuts and scrapes looked old and scabbed, but a few were fresh. She had a black eye that had almost completely healed while a bright purple bruise was visible on her collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason vaguely remembered Sara. He'd seen her a few times with Greg in the past. Just like everyone else this Sara was a little bigger. Before she had a very toned physique, now she looked quite athletic and almost as big as Vanessa was currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did,\" Sara sobbed, \"but he said if I didn't come back he would hurt my family. He's too strong, I didn't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura hugged Sara tight. \"You should have called on those who are stronger. Don't worry, it's all over now.\" Laura led Sara out of the bathroom and into the hall outside the apartment.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Greg and Jason were staring holes in each other. Jason was full of rage. He couldn't believe Greg would hurt that poor girl. He wanted to hurt Greg in so many ways, but he refused to let himself turn into that sort of person. After an eternity he tightened his arms and caused them to swell into massive trunks of intimidating muscle.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to leave Sara and her family alone from now on. If I see you anywhere near her I'll rip you apart.\" Jason turned and left Greg alone.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he got back down to the car Sara looked like a new woman. She still held the marks of a woman who'd been through a lot, but it seemed as though a weight had been taken off of her shoulders. Her short blond hair had a new sheen and her blue eyes were bright.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked Sara if she had anywhere to stay, any family. She said she does, but she doesn't want them to see her like this. I told her she could stay with me as long as she needed.\" Laura said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded, then looked to Sara. \"Are you going to be ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and smiled. \"Yes. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued, \"So, we could either drop her off at my place now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pause was long enough that Jason grinned and said, \"Or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura returned the smile. \"Or since we're already late to see Dr. Richards maybe we could take her along? I mean maybe he can even, I don't know, do something for her. He is a doctor after all.\" Laura finished this statement with a wink.\u00a0</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Vanessa, but just as the Alterations app had suggested she'd been changed. First of all she was wearing a suit. And not a swimsuit as Jason was used to seeing her in, but a business suit. She had on a black, pinstripe jacket and matching skirt with a white blouse. He'd known Vanessa for years and he'd never seen her wear anything even remotely professional. He had to admit, it was a great look for her. Her blond hair was tied back in a tight bun and even the look on her face seemed to mean business.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's eyes roamed over Vanessa's form looking for additional alterations of which there were several. The most obvious was her physique. Her upper body was pretty well covered, but her skirt was quite short and the legs on display were very long and very, very strong. Vanessa walked across the living room toward a chair and as she did her thighs pumped with each step hardening into shapely pins that would be the envy of any fitness division competitor while her high heels caused her calves to harden with defined clefts outlining the heart shaped muscle. She had apparently oiled her gorgeous legs because they shone brightly even in the artificial light of the living room. The other change he noticed was that Vanessa's breasts had grown. Her former DD cup bosom had swollen by at least 2 cup sizes into what looked to be an F cup or so. Her blouse was very tightly packed and several buttons were straining to hang on. This change confused Jason, it made sense that a person could be inspired to workout and change their physique when they were around someone like him, but why did her breasts grow? More importantly how did they grow? Jason decided it was possible that she was wearing a bra that was making it look like her breasts were bigger than they really were, but why would she when her natural assets were so amazing on their own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa removed her jacket and sat down in an easy chair across from Jason and crossed her legs placing an iPad in a leather case on her lap. \"I swear every time you're alone you end up watching that again. I keep telling you no one suspects you were faking the effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the things Vanessa could have said this was the last thing he had expected. His head was still catching up from the fact that he was apparently engaged to someone. That was when he noticed that Vanessa was wearing a fairly sizable diamond ring and he realized it was possible that she was his fianc\u00e9.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened his mouth to respond but Vanessa cut him off. \"Every report I've read as well as every account on social media all were astounded that you were able to lift that tank. No one suspects the truth.\" She spoke all while tapping through various screens on her iPad.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth.\" Jason said trying to make it sound more like a statement than a question. This was the first time he'd heard his voice since his latest transformation and he really liked what he heard. His voice was far deeper and even in those two words commanded confidence and power. Already he began to feel more in charge. The real scope of his power was contained in that voice. He came to realize that he was the strongest man around; he could take whatever he wanted. For years he'd dreamed of sex with a woman like Vanessa, now he could just do it. There was literally no one who could stop him.\u00a0These thoughts were getting Jason excited and he could feel blood beginning to flow to his new, enormous cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked up at Jason. \"Yes, the truth. About the true scope of your strength. As far as I can find no one in the world suspects that you could have easily benched ten of those tanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's head was spinning. Just how strong was he? He was astounded that he'd be able to lift 65 tons, but 650? He couldn't even conceptualize that. And why would they lie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have even better news.\" Vanessa continued. \"The plan worked perfectly! Dr. Richards wants to go double or nothing on your side bet. He's giving you six months to beef up and hit a new weight goal, and the best part is he's letting you set the goal! He has no idea what he's in store for. It's like we're printing our own money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jason understood the scam. It was a classic hustle. He felt a little dirty about it, but then he remembered that he was giving money to a charity and felt a bit better. \"Ok,\" he said still in love with his authoritative voice, \"what's the new goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sexy yet sinister grin slid across Vanessa's lips. \"Well, he wants to go double or nothing. I was thinking we could do the same. Go with two tanks and we're only at about twenty percent of your total power. We'd sill have a lot of room to grow. We could then slow your overall progression, keep up the charity events, and keep you from topping out for at least six or seven years. And that's just at your current strength level; if you do continue to get stronger we can string him along for a decade or more. I've charted it all out of you'd like to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's interest in his and Vanessa's scheme was waining. He was feeling rushes of testosterone that he'd never before experienced and he was dying for an outlet. Sitting this close to his long-time crush who's sex appeal had gone smoking to out of this world was driving him crazy. And now that he had the ability to do something about it he was going to take her. Before he even knew what was going on he found himself speaking. \"I'll tell you what I'd really like to see. You. Naked. Riding on my enormous cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe what he had just said. Never in his life did he ever think he would have the guts to try something like that, but now that it was out it felt natural. He felt not just strength but power, and it was intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly his words were having a positive effect on Vanessa. Her cheeks flushed and her crossed legs tightened. Then it became very apparent that she was not, as he had previously believed, wearing a bust enhancing bra or any bra at all. Her nipples stood at stark attention as thick as thimbles and poking right through the fabric of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled at his control over her, a control he'd wished he'd had for years. Now she was like putty in his hand. \"Well? Are you going to take your clothes off or do I have to rip them off of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa reached up and released her hair which spilled over her shoulders. \"Well, of course, I'm happy to, but...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason stood and towered over the seated Vanessa. He chuckled. \"My appearances can wait. This can't.\" Jason took hold of the speedo wrapped around his very generous groin (the only scrap of clothing he currently wore) and pulled it off allowing his enormous cock to flop free. It was already filling with blood and stiffening, the head slowly rising higher and higher. Jason wrapped his hand around his giant tool and pumped it twice speeding its transformation into a raging 17 inch erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa locked her eyes on Jason's penis and began slowly sliding her hand up her round breast which she squeezed roughly through her shirt. She then leaned forward and hungrily began sucking, nibbling, and devouring his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sucked in a deep breath and moaned with pleasure. For all intents and purposes he was a virgin and he never imagined in his wildest fantasies that his first time would be with a hyper-sexed up Vanessa. To make matters even more incredible Vanessa was a master with his penis. She attacked his pole full bore and made him feel weak in the knees despite his superhuman strength. Jason tensed and flexed his entire body as a flood of pleasure enveloped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of the most intense blow job Jason could imagine Vanessa stood up and put her hands on Jason's chest. She gave him a solid shove which he hardly felt, but he understood her intent and plopped down on the couch once more. Vanessa stood over him and slowly unbuttoned her top revealing more and more spectacular cleavage by the minute. Finally she pulled her blouse away and Jason got a look at her torso for the first time since her transformation. Her breasts were bare, bra-less and the most perfect he'd ever seen in his life; they were cantaloup sized and hung just slightly into a teardrop shape while still remaining very firm. Her nipples were thimble sized and stood at full attention. Jason was also impressed by the muscle tone she now had, her abs were clearly defined as were her pectorals. Her shoulders were broad and her arms were thick with baseball sized biceps. Vanessa cupped her breasts and pinched her nipples. Then she slid her hands down her washboard stomach to her miniskirt which she unzipped and let fall to the floor. Just as she was going sans bra so to did she forego wearing underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa, now completely nude, climbed up and straddled Jason. She pressed her pelvis against the base of his cock which now lay flush against her stomach and reached all the way to the base of her breasts. Jason's hands went immediately to Vanessa's gorgeous thighs which he squeezed savoring the incredible balance between soft skin and solid muscle. One hand went to Vanessa's rear where he reveled in the same juxtaposition in a different ratio. Vanessa offered Jason one of her breasts and he gladly let her guide it into his open mouth. He moved his hand from her butt to her free breast while giving the one in his mouth such a solid suck that Vanessa cried out in a mixture of surprise, pain, and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa moved her hands down and grabbed Jason's penis and began furiously pumping while he continued to suck on her tits. He desperately wanted to jam his cock into Vanessa's vagina, but he guessed that because of his enormous girth that they had worked out this arrangement instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa continued to milk Jason with both hands even as her breathing became highly erratic and she was thrown into the wild fervor of an orgasm. Jason mentally patted himself on the back for getting a girl to come on his first attempt at sex, then lauded himself again for being able to do it by simply sucking on her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later it was Jason's turn. His body tensed up and his penis let loose a flood of hot come that doused the underside of Vanessa's tits. Vanessa cupped her hands over the head of his dick to deflect flow and direct it down around the shaft of his 17 inch monster. She continued this until nearly the entire surface of his penis was soaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa then quickly got up and spread her legs wide so that she was crouched, spread eagle, over Jason\u2019s legs and waist. She lowered herself and guided the apple sized head of his member into her waiting pussy. It took some forcing but the combination of come from Jason and natural lubricant from Vanessa allowed her to cram his glorious unit into her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa howled with divine pleasure as the head popped into her, then she let loose a moan that seemed to originate from the bottoms of her feet as she slowly slid down his length. Before long she bottomed out with almost half of his penis still outside of her. Vanessa braced herself by grabbing ahold of Jason\u2019s engorged pectorals then began lifting her body up again. When Jason\u2019s fat cockhead was just about to slip out of her Vanessa dropped herself down hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed again and locked her eyes on Jason\u2019s. The look she gave him was borderline scary; it was the look of a woman who had lost control of her rational mind and was now overcome with insatiable lust for him. It was a look no woman had ever given Jason, and he loved the fact that he could drive a woman, especially one like Vanessa, to the brink of insanity with desire for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa raised and dropped herself again maintaining eye contact the whole time. Feeling more stable she removed one of her hands from Jason\u2019s chest and placed it on her own, squeezing her breast and tweaking her nipple. She raised then dropped again, then again, picking up speed. She was screaming nearly constantly now and Jason was certain that she was in the midst of an epic orgasm. She pumped faster and faster slamming herself against his steel hard cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had never dreamed, not even in his wildest fantasies, that sex with anyone could feel this amazing. He tried to take in every sensation, every bit of stimulation but his brain was overloaded. The only rational conscious thought he could muster was a realization about Vanessa\u2019s legs. He noticed that they were a bit more muscular and developed than the rest of her body and he now realized why: she was performing an insane number of very difficult squats at a very rapid pace. And they must have performed this exercise often because Vanessa moved with stupendous ease. Her thighs and hamstrings were pumped and loaded with quivering, flexing masses of cut sinew. Her legs shone now with more than just the oil Jason had noticed earlier; they were covered in a sheen of sweat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later Jason joined in with Vanessa\u2019s cries with moans and grunts of his own. Vanessa continued to ride Jason\u2019s cock for nearly 15 minutes at full speed this way before she had to slow down. By this point her entire body was dripping sweat, but the hungry look in her eye remained and when she caught her breath she ramped her speed right back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 10 minutes later and Jason could hold on no longer, he was going to come again. Vanessa sensed this and began coaching Jason along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby!!\u201d she cried. \u201cC\u2019mon, flex for me, let me see those gorgeous muscles. Show me your power, oh- oh my god, YOU\u2019RE oh-, you\u2019re my god, c\u2019mon. Do it!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason obliged by raising her arms up and flexing his monstrous 40 inch arms. He pumped his forearms in and out causing the peaks of his mountainous biceps to pop and swell higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!! Yes, yes, yes, oh, oh, yes. Now, do it! Explode. Fill me up!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could take no more and was happy to see to her request. His cock began to spasm so hard that Vanessa was pulled off of her feet and onto Jason\u2019s prone body. Buckets of come poured out of him into her, then down over his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the flood stopped and the pair lay in each other\u2019s arms sitting in a pool of their own sex. Jason could tell that Vanessa was physically spent, but for his part he felt like he could do that again. Heck, with his superhuman stamina he could probably go all day and night. Part of him wanted to; now that he had sampled sex he could feel himself becoming addicted. It would be very easy to poke at Vanessa and get more out of her, and if she was unwilling he was certain he could locate a whole host of women that would give him everything and anything he desired. He was just about to demand Vanessa get up and ride him again when his rational mind returned and he was able to calm himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was concerned, he could feel some very unsavory emotions and desires bubbling up from his id and had to remind himself of the corrupting effects of power. To ground himself he hugged Vanessa close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him with a weary smile on her face. Her body quivering with exhaustion she said, \u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled back. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said and was surprised to find that he meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cuddling on the couch for a very long time Vanessa finally stood and collected her clothes. \u201cCome on, big guy. We still need to make that signing. Let\u2019s take a quick shower then speed over there. We\u2019ll only be a little late if we hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood and stretched smiling at how Vanessa\u2019s mouth dropped open at the sight of Jason\u2019s movements. \u201cOk,\u201d he said, \u201cbut shouldn\u2019t we clean up our mess here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked at Jason as if he\u2019d just asked a ridiculous question. \u201cNo,\u201d she scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d Jason looked down. The puddle of come had soaked into the couch and there were sweat stains on the cushions. He suddenly felt very guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Vanessa said taking Jason by the hand and leading him upstairs. \u201cLaura will clean it. She always does.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A strong familiar voice from behind them popped up harshly.  \u201cYes, Jason, what about your fianc\u00e9?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Vanessa and Jason turned to see Laura at the bottom of the stairs.  Jason was unsure of how much she had heard, but he figured it was at least the last part of the conversation.  It was at this point that Jason\u2019s mind began to fill in the blanks.  He started remembering how he got to this point in time.  Years ago Laura and he had fantasies of being superheroes.  It was through his computer skills and Laura\u2019s biology skills that they actually came across a way to increase the density of human muscles beyond what was previously thought possible.  They soon developed what they called Progression, a solution that increases the density of the human body down to the cellular level, maybe even further.  Set with their DNA it worked wonders on Jason, it was modified and worked to a much lesser degree on Vanessa.  And as Jason stood up to his full 6 foot 10 inch height, he could see that it had worked on Laura.  His bride to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while Jason pushed it harder and further, Laura continued to try and tweak the formula, thinking of the greater good.  But to Jason, it was all about the muscle, all about the strength, and all about the control.  Laura was big alright, bigger and stronger than any other woman and man on earth, but she was nowhere in his league.  Over a year ago they had decided to get married, but as Jason worked more with Vanessa to get money, much of which went to charity to keep up positive appearances, they had grown a bit apart.  And Jason\u2019s ego, fueled over the years with an indestructible, super human body, had grown as well.  So as Jason turned to face Laura he simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, come on Laura, you know I\u2019m just kidding.  It\u2019s fun getting a rise out of Vanessa.  And you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood there, taller as well thanks to the Ap at 5 foot 10 and as beefy as a large male bodybuilder.  She had on a thick tank top that hugged her large upper body.  Her chest was thick more with muscle than breasts, but her boobs still sat high on her large pectorals.  Her wide back curved in to a narrow, muscle laden midsection and her well muscled arms looked to be 24 inches unflexed.  Laura\u2019s mid-thigh level shorts exposed legs that were long and strong.  As Jason\u2019s gaze made it back to her face it was clear she wasn\u2019t amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you two really think you can continue to fool Dr. Richards?  He\u2019s not the rube you two take him to be.  His daughter Nicole is the head of the pharmaceutical division and she has been snooping around the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason scoffed.  \u201cThe gym is more secure than Fort Knox.  And the door to the basement lab weighs 1000 pounds.  Even if she made it into the gym, she\u2019s never get into the lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head.  \u201cI\u2019m not as confident as you are I\u2019m afraid.  Besides, why on earth would you want to hide your true strength?  Don\u2019t you remember why we started this in the first place?  It was to become super heroes!  We were going to help people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned.  \u201cThat\u2019s in the comic books.\u201d  He turned toward Vanessa, who had stood up and was clutching the ipad against her huge boobs.  \u201cAlthough, that would be a great idea.  Me as a comic book hero.  We should pitch the idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa smiled and was already tapping on the ipad.  \u201cYes, you could then promote the comic book as you continued to break your lifting records across the country.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled.  \u201cOr across the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggled as Laura shook her head.  \u201cI would leave you two alone, but if you remember, Jason and I were heading to the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa swiped the ipad and pulled up a schedule.  \u201cRight!  Jason needs to give me a new baseline for bench press and curls today so I can factor that into my equations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \u201cUh-huh.  I suppose you want me to write the results down for you and bring them home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa nodded.  \u201cYes.  No more texting that sort of thing.  We don\u2019t need that kind of information roaming the digital highway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura picked up the car keys and headed for the door.  \u201cCome on Jason.  I know how much of a thrill pumping up your muscles gives you.  I could use a work out too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded and followed Laura toward the door.  He turned his head toward Vanessa, smiled and gave her a wink.  He was already plotting getting back to Vanessa once Laura headed down to the lab like she usually did.  Vanessa smiled back and bit her lip, blushing with equal anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura climbed into the Hummer and Jason sat down in the passenger seat, which was already set to handle his size.  As they pulled away Jason turned toward Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, come on Laura, you need to lighten up a bit.  Just because Progression worked better on me doesn\u2019t mean you still can\u2019t join me at some of the charity events to lift some heavy stuff too.  After all you are the second strongest person on earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed.  \u201cI have no desire to be part of your scam.  You two would want me to hold back and add me to your wagers.  No thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out an annoyed sigh and crossed his large arms across his massive chest, enjoying the feeling of his indestructible muscles.  He flexed his chest a few times for effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself.  But you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing.  The cheering crowds are a big turn on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head sullenly and forced a smile.  \u201cYes, I know how much you enjoy that.  I\u2019m glad that it makes you happy.  I just wished you would be more honest, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head; he was tired of this conversation and turned to look out the window.  A few minutes later they were at the gym.  His gym.  The biggest gym in the state.  He hopped out of the car and smiled at the marquee.  \u201cJason\u2019s Gym, Home of the Strongest Man on Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked in several people turned and one person walked up to Jason, looking for an autograph.  He smiled and walked over toward the counter.  He only signed pictures of him posing in skimpy shorts that people could buy for $20.  Laura sighed again as Jason signed the photo and followed her toward the back area and their own gym with the lab below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pushed in numbers and put their eyes forward for scans before the two foot thick metal doors opened up.  Jason smiled as he saw huge metal disks, massive hydraulic devices and big screens connected to computers that controlled the machines and could measure muscle girth and density.  Only Laura, Vanessa and Jason knew just what he, or for that matter, Laura was capable of.  And with further Progression treatments there didn\u2019t appear to be any stopping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ripped off his shirt, exposing his massive upper body.  He rubbed his hands together.  Within minutes the machines were powered on and Jason was pumping hundreds of tons.  Laura punched in progressively larger numbers until he topped out at 678 tons for two reps.  His muscles were pumped up to incredible levels and he smiled at her as he grabbed a towel to wipe off the sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA new record!  That felt incredible.  Ready for a turn yourself, I can set the weights down for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s expression was thoughtful as she wrote down his results, but then as she stood up, her expression changed.  Looking at Jason, he was surprised when she told him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Someone WHAT?!?\" Jason yelled. He began breathing heavily as seething rage poured into his body. He tended his already pumped arms and chest and his veins rose to the surface of his skin looking ready to burst. He stomped over to a reenforced rack of huge dumbbells and picked up one that was about the size of a large dog. The label on the side indicated the weight weighed 10 tons, but Jason handled it like it were no more than a baseball. He then hurled it towards the far side of the gym 200 hundred feet away where it broke a hole in the wall and vanished. Jason put his hands to his temples and shut his eyes tight trying to control his temper. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't at first,\" Laura said calmly, she had seen these sort of outbursts from Jason before, \"but now I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the power log shows that the computer was on early this morning, but I didn't think much of that because Vanessa comes by at strange times. But one of the micro-filament strands I had placed across the USB ports has been broken, and neither Vanessa or I ever use those ports. Someone else plugged something into the system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What filaments?\" Jason didn't know what Laura was talking about.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you and Vanessa made me take out the security cameras from here since you didn't want any video leaking out that could ruin your little lie. So I put tiny strands across the ports that would break if someone used them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time does the log say the system was accessed?\" Jason was maintaining his cool, but he was right on the edge.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7:22 AM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spoke slowly and deliberately tempering his anger. \"Okay, pull up the security footage from the main gym and see who was near the secure door around 7:22 AM. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura clicked through the menus for a few minutes then frowned. \"It's all been wiped. The video from 7:18 to 7:31 is all blank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began to shake. His face flushed and his chest surged forward. With a floor rattling yell Jason began overturning racks of weights and tossing plates around. This time Laura backed up against the nearest wall, less from fear and more to remain away from flying debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jason began to settle. He looked at Laura with murder in his eyes. \"WHO?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way to kn-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said Richards has a daughter, that she's been poking around. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's got to be her. I know it. What was her name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason approached the computer and did a few quick searches. It didn't take long to find an address and photo of Nicole Richards. She was a cute redhead, a bit overweight, but very pretty. Jason found the address on google maps and left the gym without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even bother to take Laura's car and instead opted to run to Nicole's home. His massive legs propelled him faster and faster until he was pushing 50 miles an hour and still not exerting himself much. As he ran he couldn't help but think that the name Nicole Richards sounded very familiar. Something about a profile and changes caused by an iPhone app. The memories were buried but in there somewhere fighting to be heard. Instead Jason ignored it and continued running. All that mattered now was finding this Nicole person and making her pay for her theft. If she exposed his lie he would be ruined in the eyes of the public, but even worse if she discovered the secret of Progression he could potentially be dethroned as the strongest person in the world. He didn't like the idea of competition and would keep his secret process safe at all costs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later Jason had spanned the 25 miles between the gym and Nicole's house which was a huge walled off compound with a mansion on a hill in the center. Without even slowing Jason leapt over the 15 foot wall and sailed halfway across a large field. He slowed his run and approached the main house. As he rounded the rear and approached a huge patio with several deck chairs and a pool he heard a voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned and found himself facing Nicole Richards. It was quickly obvious that the picture he had seen at the gym was an old one. The Nicole before him was no longer the cute and overweight girl but a ravishing beauty with a tight gymnasts body. She stood 5 feet 9 inches tall with fair skin and thick red hair that spilled across her shoulders. Her face was gorgeous with full lips and a light splash of freckles across her nose. Her eyes were otherworldly and seemed to glow unnaturally green. She wore black lycra shorts that hugged her hips and rear like a second skin and a matching sports bra with perfectly rounded C cup breasts underneath. Her outfit as well as her running shoes and iPod on her hip suggested she was just about to head out for a jog. Her legs were long and muscled and her bare stomach showed off a defined six pack. Her shoulders were broad and her arms trim with cut muscles that popped as Nicole raised her hands to tie her hair back in a pony tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason Sullivan!\" Nicole lit up. Her smile was brilliant and intoxicating. \"I'm a huge fan!! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Jason's confidence wained. As strong as he was this woman made him feel weak. Then he remembered the break-in. \"Don't play dumb! I'm here because you stole files from our computer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's face took on a look of surprise, but her eyes didn't. To Jason it looked as though her eyes were laughing. \"I have no idea what you mean! Why would I steal anything from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb. I know you've been snooping around, and now someone wiped our security videos and copied our hard drives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole laughed. \"And you think it was me? I'm sure you have some proof to back up your claim. Otherwise I think you should be on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue a platoon of security personnel surrounded Jason.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think these guys could even slow me down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I think the video cameras they all have attached to their visors could capture enough incriminating video of you threatening a poor little girl to effectively end your career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind was removed from Jason's sails. He realized how flimsy his case really was, he had no proof only a hunch. \"This isn't over,\" he said and turned to leave.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go,\" Jason stopped to listen without turning back, \"I just want you to know I really am a huge fan of you and your beautiful fianc\u00e9. I used to be overweight and out of shape and the two of you really inspired me to work hard and get fit. As you can see I've made some pretty amazing progression.\" She let the last word hang in the air until Jason turned to look at her again. Nicole smiled her incredible smile once more. \"Of course I'd be lying if I said that daddy didn't help. It does pay to be the daughter of the world's foremost gene therapy scientist.\" Nicole raised her arms and flexed her biceps. Her fit arms expanded way more than should have been possible. Her gymnasts arms grew to bodybuilder proportions until her softball sized biceps took her arms to 18 inches around. \"I'm no where near as strong as you, of course, but a girl can dream.\" She tightened her flex even further squeezing yet another inch out of her eye popping biceps before relaxing her arms, which shrank back to their previous size, and blowing Jason a kiss. Then she nonchalantly put her iPod earbuds in and took off at a jog down a path towards a group of trees.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason left the compound, the whole way being followed by the security team that he suspected Nicole had no need for.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura sat down in the lab, the generators were humming and a number of beakers were boiling, pushing out precise quantities of solutions into long tubes that mixed together to end up in a single flask.  Laura was staring as her new version of Progression dripped forth.  She glanced over at the third beaker, the one she had made a deal to get, the one that not only linked her initial gene therapy together, but gave an added bonus.  Her concentration was broken when the phone buzzed.  She stepped over to pull up a text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe just left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the phone down.  \u201cDamn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura then looked around and smiled slightly as she stepped over toward a mini fridge and was happy to see some ice cubes.  Pulling one out, she plopped it into the beaker and stepped upstairs quickly into the gym.  She had already done her best to clean things up, but it would take a team of welders to fix some of the mess.  Of course the team of welders was quite used to cleaning up \u201cunexpected\u201d messes.  At least most of the weights were in the right places.  She had left the heavier ones alone, not willing to give anything away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Jason would come back.  If Vanessa told him she needed his best bench and curl numbers then he would make sure she got them.  She grumbled out loud, upset that he listened to Vanessa more than her.  Of course it had been going on for a while, but that didn\u2019t make it any easier to take.  Nor was the sleeping around.  How dumb did he think she was?  Or worse yet, how little did he care?  Of course she also knew that Vanessa was the only one besides herself strong enough to actually have sex with him, but she knew all about the throngs of woman at the hotels when he traveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up at the gym cameras to make sure Jason wasn\u2019t near; Laura quickly headed back downstairs, turned off the heat to the chemistry set and closed the end valve.  She picked up the flask and looked at it for a moment, swirling the contents around as the ice cube melted.  Letting out a nervous sigh, she pulled the beaker up to her mouth and drank the contents down.  Licking her lips she headed back toward the stairs, turned off the lab computer and the lights and reaching the top, carefully pulled the heavy metal down until the hydraulics kicked in and slowly pulled the door into the floor.  Several clicks indicated the door was closed.  Laura pulled the area rug over the trap door and walked back to the computers to make sure Jason hadn\u2019t ruined any of the delicate equipment.  She let out a small burp and felt the advanced Progression formula work its way through her system as she checked out the hardware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Laura worked, Jason was still walking back, talking to Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know how she got in or how she was able to flex up muscles out of nowhere.  That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to tell me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I\u2019ll see what I can find.  Have you talked any more to Laura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grumbled.  \u201cNo, not yet.  I suppose I should head back there and see if there is any more information from the computers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  And make sure to finish your workout to give me some baseline numbers for both your curl and your bicep size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed.  \u201cConsidering what happened I\u2019m not as thrilled as I was earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know, but until we have some proof or Nicole makes a move we need to stay on plan.  Besides, once you start working out you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded to nobody.  \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.  I do love working my bi\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my boy.  Now let me do some checking and we can talk more tonight at say, your place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled, and growled softly.  \u201cSure thing.  I\u2019ll just have to lose Laura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hung up, looked ahead and started running back toward his gym.  Within moments he was running as fast as the traffic, if not faster, and only slowed down when he made it to the gym.  He brushed himself off, and realized that he was in only his shorts and his specially made shoes.  As he entered the gym and the desk crew smiled at him, Jason smiled back waved and pointed to the back gym.  They nodded and he walked briskly to the back area and entered the lab.  Laura looked up from a console as Jason entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at her with anger and turned away.  \u201cNot good.  I confronted this Nicole, but she of course denied everything even though I\u2019m quite sure she knew what I was talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura held her plain expression.  \u201cSo you weren\u2019t able to get any proof?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head.  \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the worst of it.  When she pulled in her security she flexed her arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stared at him blankly as he paused for effect.  \u201cAnd her biceps expanded.  A lot.  I mean, way more than they should be able to.  More than anyone should be able to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned her head slightly, trying hard not to smile.  \u201cAnd then what?  Did she say anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s face flashed red as his anger returned.  \u201cNothing!  The bitch turned around and ran off.  We need to figure out what is going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded her head.  \u201cOK, what do you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked around, eyeing his earlier handiwork on his equipment.  \u201cWell maybe we could run a tracer to see which files have been copied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at him to continue, but then he turned to look at the weights.  \u201cAfter I work out my arms.  I need to blow off some steam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura forced herself not to roll her eyes or smile.  She thought that dealing with Jason over the years had given her the ability to be a good poker player.  Moving over toward another section of the gym, Laura reached out to a display and powered up the station.  There was a thick bar with giant plates on both side and hydraulics to lock them into place.  A laser machine sat above the center of the bar and several others were on either side.  Jason smiled for the first time since Laura gave him the news of the computer hack and walked up to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume you have the lasers ready to measure my biceps after I pump the weights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded.  This station had taken months to finish and was all about Jason\u2019s ego.  It wasn\u2019t enough that he could curl weights no other person on earth could hope to move, but a complex set of equipment was put together to measure and announce the size of his biceps.  It was configured for Laura and even Vanessa, but they rarely used the extra feature.  Only now as Laura felt more and more powerful did she think about utilizing the feature on herself.  But not now.  Jason needed to go first.  She set the computer to allow for Jason to announce adding more weight and moved off to the side as he approached the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now every movement Laura made was causing her muscles to contract and bulge, pushing out slightly larger and feeling much stronger.  The experience was raising the hair on the back of her neck and she was starting to sweat.  Jason was ignoring Laura completely as he set himself and reached down to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, Jason.  Set for 100 tons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer responded.  \u201cConfirmed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down and easily deadlifted the weight up and with a small grunt began curling the weight.  Laura looked on as he slowly increased the weight after a set of 10.  His strength and his bulging biceps used to turn her on and only a year ago she would have been begging to let her feel his muscles and cheer him on as he curled heavier and heavier weights.  Now she felt quite different.  It wasn\u2019t emptiness so much as a loss.  But as the power of the new Progression pulsed through her veins, new feelings were coming to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished up with 205 tons, another record, he dropped the weight and the room shook.  Smiling over at a nearby mirror and still ignoring Laura, he pulled up his right arm and staring at it, looked over at the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, biceps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lasers moved quickly and announced, \u201c42.5 inches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled and with his typical boastful attitude turned toward Laura for the first time since he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother new record!  Pretty awesome, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s eyes narrowed.  \u201cYeah, pretty awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a sideways look.  Did she look different?  Shaking it off Jason snickered and said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason always felt better after a good pump.  Especially one that confirmed just how strong he was.  He clearly was super human.  The only one in his class was Laura.  And she was less than a tenth as strong as he was.  This fact alone had given him the bravado and the overall arrogance that had driven him to take whatever he wanted.  He had initially enjoyed Laura\u2019s excitement and sex with her was incredible, but when he wanted to reach out and take what the world had to offer, she didn\u2019t want to come along for the ride.  And as he alone had supreme strength to go along with his world record breaking physique he didn\u2019t have to worry about any consequences.  After all, what could Laura really do to him anyway?  He continued to play along with her to keep her under his thumb, but it was getting harder to get a read on her.  And he hadn\u2019t seen her lift in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo just to keep a mental note of just how far Laura stood below him and to accentuate his dominance, he decided to play nice and offer her a chance to work out him.  After everything she continued to do for him, he figured she\u2019d earned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you\u2019ve seen what a real man can do, how about we see what you can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kept her emotions in check, but her response betrayed her calm exterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?  Can I?  I wouldn\u2019t want to get in your way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  \u201cLook, if you want to be that way we can just go back to the computers and check for further signs of entry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura licked her lips.  She felt primed for action.  Her senses were all on edge and she let out a few controlled breaths to contain herself.  She had no idea how effective this new version would be and she didn\u2019t want to overplay her hand if she didn\u2019t have one.  But it took everything she had not to just try and lift what he had just completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked over to the bar where Jason still stood and forced another smile with as much warmth as she could fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Jason, I guess the break in bothers me too.  I would love to work my arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed, satisfied with her response and backed out of the work out area.  Laura let out another breath as her pulse started to race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, Laura.  Set for 10 tons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason backed up against a rack of weights and smiled.  From what he remembers, this was already near her previous best.  Perhaps she was getting stronger too.  She did look a bit bigger he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura reached down and easily pulled up the bar.  She remembered how thrilled she was when she was first able to dead lift this much weight.  Of course Jason made sure to lift ten times as much and then more.  But now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now this weight felt\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight.  Really light in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to smile, Laura kept up the show and slowly curled the weight for ten reps and held it at her thighs.  Her entire body was tingling and she feeling as more excitement than she had felt in, well, years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer.  20 tons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hydraulics kicked in and more plates kicked in.  Laura almost giggled as she still felt little resistance.  She quickly knocked off 10 reps and paused.  Jason looked on, a bit put off that she was apparently actually one tenth as strong as he.  Something she hadn\u2019t been since they first took the Progression.  And his feelings changed further as Laura pulled in another excited breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer.  40 tons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was going to say something about the weight being too heavy, but before he could Laura was already curling the weight.  He watched as her arms appeared to be pulsing with each rep and looked like they were growing\u2026.  Larger.  Certainly bigger than she had been.  In fact all of her muscles looked like they were pushing out larger across her frame.  Her legs, already thick and cut looked denser and harder, stripping off the small amount of fat as her quads and calves sharpened considerably.  Her glutes rose up as he could see her shorts push out, exposing the bottom of her behind.  Jason could tell he back and chest were widening and thickening as her thick spandex top pulled outward, exposing hints of the muscles growing below.  He barely had a chance to take in her other muscles when Laura shocked him with her next statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer.  80 tons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood upright and stared on as Laura began to curl what was now easily 7 times her previous best.  He focused on her arms and was no longer surprised to see that they had grown much bigger than before.  Laura could flex her biceps up to 26 inches on a good day.  But he surmised that her biceps were now swelling up well beyond 30 inches.  And as she pumped the weight he could see those biceps harden, thicken and bristle with new muscles and scary detail.  By the time she finished another ten reps Jason was feeling something he hadn\u2019t felt in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous.  And that unfamiliar emotion expanded further as Laura announced the next weight, this time with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer.  160 tons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s jaw opened as he heard the familiar hydraulics kick in and watched as the larger plates were brought into play.  He cleared his throat and before Laura attempted her first curl, she turned her head looking for Jason to say something.  He nearly stammered, but held his normal commanding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gave him a mischievous look.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted.  \u201cYou know exactly what I mean.  You\u2019re about to attempt to curl over 10 times your previous best lift.  What have you been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gave him the same look he had received from Nicole.  Her face had a look of surprise, but her eyes were laughing.  And as she started to curl the weight like it was no big deal, she raised her eyebrows as if nothing were out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing really.  You know me, always tinkering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura quickly knocked off ten curls and paused as Jason struggled to put his thoughts together.  And Laura was not about to let him off the hook.  Not today!  She felt unstoppable.  She felt like she was in control for the first time.  And she was going to enjoy it!  And the best part so far, the part that Jason hadn\u2019t even seen yet, was the extra bonus.  But first things first.  Laura nearly laughed as she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer.  320 tons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s face flashed anger.  No way was she going to curl that much!  There was no way she was over twice as strong as him!  He clenched his fists at his side and his massive muscles pumped hugely.  He took a step forward to put this to an end, but didn\u2019t make it to a second step when Laura moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd slowly, hypnotically, curled the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, twice, three times in slow, controlled, sexy, powerful strokes.  Her biceps responded with shocking growth, adding inch after inch of muscle as she curled over twice Jason\u2019s best with seeming ease.  After 10 full, strong reps Laura let out a satisfied sigh and let the weight drop with a deafening boom that shook the entire block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was a good warm up.  But I figured since I just crushed your record that you\u2019d like to get a look at the biceps that kicked your ass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled up her right arm slowly for effect as Jason quite literally shook with growing rage.  How could she do this?  Why didn\u2019t she do this to him?  As Jason stood there temporarily frozen, Laura looked over toward the computer as she pulled her hand into a fist, but didn\u2019t flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer.  Biceps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lasers did a quick sweep and announced \u201c36 inches\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled at that and brought her forearm down slowly and then bringing it back up began to squeeze her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer.  Biceps and continue to announce each inch increase.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lasers moved and began to announce 38 in\u2026, but stopped as Laura tensed her bicep fully.  Jason\u2019s eyes widened as he watched something he never would have believed if he hadn\u2019t just seen it done an hour before.  Only this time the muscle being flexed was much larger, much harder and much, much stronger.  Laura\u2019s bicep surged upward as muscle fibers flooded her bicep and triceps, multiplying and growing, pushing muscles on top of muscles, fueling her strength to even higher levels and causing the computer to choke as it tried to keep up.  Jason thought it was stuck as it spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForty\u2026, Forty\u2026, Forty\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt kept going until Jason soon realized that her bicep had grown beyond his best and that she wasn\u2019t slowing down when it got stuck on\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFifty\u2026, Fifty\u2026, Fifty\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRips and tears were barely heard above the computer, but it was evident that Laura\u2019s top was losing a futile attempt to contain her surging upper body that was growing bigger, although not nearly as big or as fast as her biceps; which now peaking up toward her fist and were already stuck on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSixty\u2026., Sixty\u2026 Sixty\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had had enough.  Whatever she was doing, whatever she had done it didn\u2019t matter.  Nobody shows up Jason Sullivan!  Even as the computer kicked into the Seventies, Jason stormed forward, his right hand back into a fist.  Laura turned her head to see him approach, narrowed her eyes and gave him a look that dared him to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing red, Jason...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason slowly opened his eyes. He was feeling dizzy and disoriented and it took him several minutes to figure out that he was now laying on his back. He kept waiting for his vision to clear then he realized that the big white blur wasn't a blur at all but a white ceiling. He had just figured out that he was on his back in bed when he felt someone on his left moving. A warm body, a woman's body, snuggled up close to him and wrapped her leg around his while pressing her chest and breasts against his arm. From his perspective the woman felt tiny, a mere fraction of his size; but then he realized that this was because he was so large not because she was small. It became very clear that this woman, whoever she was, was naked when she began grinding her crotch against the massive swell of his thigh and Jason could feel a small patch of pubic hair. The woman slid her hand across Jason's chest and squeezed his pectoral muscle.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever in his life had Jason been touched in this way and his penis leapt into immediate action hardening and pitching a 17 inch tent with the bed sheets.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, the monster is awake. And it looks hungry,\" the woman moaned as much as she spoke. She pulled the sheet back to reveal Jason's incredible cock. \"Come to mama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sat up and Jason got his first look at her. The first thing that was obvious was that she was gorgeous. She had thick red hair that was wild with bed-head but that was still alluring, her eyes were bright green and shimmered; but her smile is what melted Jason where he lay. He smile dazzled and he could feel himself falling for this woman already. The second thing that was clear was that this woman was a bodybuilder. She had wide shoulders and a thick chest that supported her C cup breasts and kept them from drooping. Her abs were chiseled and looked cut from steel while piano key obliques lined her sides. She raised her hand to push some wayward strands of hair out of her face and Jason saw the bulge of a baseball sized bicep pop for a split second. Jason guessed this girl could pump her arm to a good 16 or 17 inches around. She wasn't the biggest female bodybuilder he'd ever seen, but she was by far the most beautiful.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked hungrily at Jason's unit and began crawling toward it. She placed herself I between his legs and looked up at Jason through an open curtain of red hair then slowly moved forward, mouth open, until her tongue was nearly touching the apple sized head of his penis.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" A new voice shouted from Jason's right and nearly made him jump out of his skin. There was another woman in bed with him, and now she was sitting up into his view. He was viewing this girl from behind and at first all he could see was her long, chestnut brown hair. Then, as she sat up further, he saw that she too was incredibly muscular, in fact even more so than the redhead. This girl's back was alive with plates of sinew that rolled and swelled with every move. Her wing-like traps tapered in to a slender waist which was the lowest he could see of her. Then she raised her arm to point at the redhead and Jason was able to see her bicep surge to nearly 20 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like I'm doing?\" the redhead asked shooting the second girl a sarcastic grin.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well back off!! It's my turn and you know it!\" The brunette got up on her knees and began moving toward the redhead who sat up to meet her challenger.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls grabbed each other by the shoulders and began trying to push one another down. Jason could see each girls muscles bulging as they fought for the right to please him, but within moments it was obvious that the brunette had the strength advantage. That didn't keep the redhead from trying, though, and she threw her body back and forth trying to break free, her hair whipping wildly from side to side.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason finally snapped out of his delirium over what was transpiring and realized that these girls could hurt each other over him. \"Girls, stop!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both froze in their embrace. Then the brunette whipped her head around tossing her hair over her shoulder and looked at Jason. \"I thought you liked it when we fight over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason brain short circuited for a moment. Then he spoke without thinking, \"Laura?\" It was true, the body was unrecognizable, but the face was undeniable. Now that she had turned he could see her pectorals were pumped and supported a pair of DD cup breasts to rival her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laura could respond to Jason's confused calling of her name the other girl released Laura's shoulders and slid her hands down Laura's chest. \"Maybe he'd rather watch us make out instead of fight.\" The redhead squeezed Laura's large breasts then lowered her head to suck on the hardening nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of ecstasy washed over Laura's face and she put her hand next to the redhead's face and guided her lips up to meet her own. The girls pressed their torsos together smashing their generous breasts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't help but laugh to himself. This was his life now? Watching the two most sexiest woman he'd ever seen vying for his affection. He watched the two girls kiss, rub, and feel each other's bodies for several minutes. Then he propped himself up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead noticed him out of the corner of her eye. \"Oh no! I think he's jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he is,\" Laura agreed before releasing her partner and zeroing in on Jason's penis. She crouched down and wrapped her mouth around the giant head running her tongue all over its circumference. At the same time the redhead began crawling up Jason's stomach and chest placing kisses on his bulging muscles as she went. She straddled Jason's stomach and locked her lips to his. It was instantly the best kiss of his life. He lost himself in it and gripped the woman's legs with his hands marveling over the swell of her quads and the smoothness of her skin.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's hands crept up the redhead's body to her back, then he slid one hand into her thick mane while the other cupped her round breast. At the same time Laura began working the shaft of his 17 inch member with both hands. It was less than five minutes before Jason was blasting an enormous load of come down Laura's throat. Once he was done Laura repositioned herself so that she was squatting over his crotch, then she guided his oversized penis into her vagina. Slowly she lowered herself down, crying out in pleasure and pain until she had taken in about half of his length and had to stop. She then began pumping herself up and down, slowly at first then faster. At the same time the redhead guided one of Jason's hands to her snatch and slid his fingers into her. He obliged and began working her clit with his powerful digits. She responded by writhing with pleasure.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio continued this way for ten minutes when Jason felt his penis tense preparing to explode once more. His whole body tensed which caused his fingers to press deeper into the redhead's pussy sending her into an intense orgasm. Then, moments after torrents of hot come began spewing from his giant pole, Lara began to buck and scream as similar waves of pleasure rocketed through her body. The three of them all twitched and moaned in one, enormous shared orgasm.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly a full minute later both girls collapsed on either side of Jason, wrapping themselves in his massive arms. They lay like this for a long time; the girls breathing heavily and Jason, amazed at his own stamina, was still full of energy and ready for more.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually got up and went to the bathroom. Inside the huge room he found a floor to ceiling mirror in which he examined his stupendous physique. He flexed his thighs, chest and arms watching the masses of muscle swell to impossible size. Then he struck a double bicep pose and marveled over his 40 inch arms and wondered just how strong he was. The excitement over his own gargantuan body had already brought his penis back to a full, throbbing erection.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason returned to the bedroom and took in the full scope of his situation. His house was a huge mansion, his bed was filled with two gorgeous women, and he was the single most physically powerful man in the world. This was his life now. This was going to be good!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason admired the buff beauties sleeping in his bed. Laura looked absolutely amazing with her new muscles, and the other girl with the red hair was a spectacular woman as well. He walked past the napping ladies to a door that lead to a balcony. He stood naked surveying his kingdom. Below where he stood was an enormous infinity pool that overlooked the ocean while off to his right he saw a huge gymnasium with glass walls. On his left was a path that led down a slope and eventually ended at the beach in the distance.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile taking in the sights he felt someone touch his back and slide under his arm on his right side. It was Laura. Added to the list of body alterations was her height; she was now 5 foot 10 inches and while Jason still stood a foot taller than her the height difference wasn't as much as it could have been.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watcha' doing?\" she asked while sliding her hand across his stomach tracing the outline of his brick sized abs with her finger.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" he said, \"just taking in the sights.\" Jason looked down and was yet again astounded that this beefed up bodybuilder could possibly be Laura.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sadly it looks like Nikki and I are going to have to leave. I'm running late for work and she said something about needing more steroids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't do steroids!!\" The redhead who was apparently named Nikki yelled. \"And you know it!\" A wayward pillow sailed through the air and hit Laura in the back of the head.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Jason turned. Nikki was already out of bed and getting dressed. She had pulled on a pair of tight denim cut off shorts and a pink halter top with spaghetti straps that was short enough at the bottom to reveal a few inches of the succulent abs beneath. Now that she was standing Jason could see that this girl was tall. Her muscular legs were miles long and teleported Nikki's height to a surprising 6 foot 5 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned at Nikki. \"All I know is you've gone from scrawny to buff in just a few weeks from taking drugs. Sounds like steroids to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's looked offended. \"I don't take drugs! Daddy has been developing a combination of gene therapy and hormone alteration in an attempt to recreate the incident that have allowed Jason, and to a lesser extent you, to unlock his muscle building potential and become the beast that he is.\" As she spoke these last few words she looked Jason up and down with a hungry grin, taking in the grand scope of his massive muscles. Then she looked back to Laura. \"Besides, you're just jealous that it won't be long before I'm bigger and stronger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked up and stood toe to toe with Nikki, her naked body brimming with power. Laura had to look up to look Nikki in the eye, but the shorter girl still look like the dominant one. \"You make it sound like the accident gave me all this muscle.\" Laura said. \"But I have earned every inch.\" Laura raised her arms and flexed her biceps. Her arms were even bigger than Jason has previously thought and the guns she displayed were a good 22 inches around. \"I worked for every inch, every pound, both in muscle and lifting strength. This body wasn't just handed to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki ran her hands over the peaks of Laura's biceps and moaned. \"Ooooh, I love it when you get all passionate about your body. There's no question that you had to work to get big, but lots of people have worked a lot harder for a lot longer and not gotten a tenth of the results you have in the last six months. That lab explosion did something to the two of you that made it so much easier to build muscle. Daddy and his scientists are just trying to replicate that. And if I just happen to benefit,\" Now it was Nikki's turn to flex her arms. Her arms were certainly big at 17 inches around, but they were still outclassed by Laura's. \"Then who am I to complain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shoved Nikki who fell into the bed behind her. Laura then leapt up and straddled Nikki, pinning her hands down. The two girls stared each other down for a few tense moments. Jason was about to say something when Laura finally spoke, \"Lucky for you you're one sexy bitch. I can't wait to see you get bigger, it just drives me to push myself that much harder.\" Then Laura locked her lips onto Nikki's and the two engaged in a long, passionate French kiss for several minutes. Jason watched Nikki's legs wrap around Laura's waist while her hands explored the bulges along Laura's arms and back.\u00a0When the two finally separated they were breathing heavy.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you had to get ready for work?\" Nikki said.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cancel your plans and I'll cancel mine. Then we can just fuck all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but today's a big day at the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all big days according to you.\" Laura released Nikki and stood up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. They're getting bigger all the time, just like me.\" Nikki laughed at her own joke, her giggle was rather geeky and sounded funny coming from such an amazon of a woman. \"Hey Jason, did you want to come along with me today? I think you'll really find what we're doing down there interesting. We could even-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" Laura interrupted, \"you could come with me to the gym. I only have a few clients today and after we could get naked and pump some iron. Of course I'll understand if you don't want to. I know you get impatient watching me in personal trainer mode, but I'd make it worth you while.\" Laura cupped her large breasts and squeezed them together while giving Jason a look that made him ache to jump her right then and there. At the same time he was really interested in finding out about what Nikki was up to. He also thought it would be a good idea to figure out who she was and what this lab accident was that they were talking about. Besides, he didn't know the first thing about workout routines and didn't feel confident in working alongside Laura, even if he did dwarf her in stature. But then he looked over her body again and didn't care what anyone thought, he would move mountains just to watch her lift weights and pump her awesome muscles to new size.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was truly torn, but after weighing all the benefits of each option he knew what he wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

Laura gazed at his erection for a moment with a wry smile and then looked back into Jason\u2019s eyes. Nicole followed Laura\u2019s reactions as mirrored Laura\u2019s movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d Laura finally said. \u201cYou got your wish big boy, now it\u2019s time to decide. Are going to be with me or are you going to be with Nicole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s eyes moved from confidence to confusion. His reaction wasn\u2019t any better.  \u201cUh, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole giggled and Laura let out a soft grunt. \u201cYou got your three-way, just like you asked. Us girls even played along to complete your fantasy. But now that the night is over and we need to move on with our day I\u2019d\u2026., we\u2019d, like your answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s massive erection started to drop a bit as he was forced to think about something he was currently ill prepared to do. He didn\u2019t even know this Nicole and he was unfamiliar with this version of Laura. Heck, he was unfamiliar with this entire situation. What had started as the greatest morning ever was quickly taking a left turn. Trying his best to show an air of confidence he put on his best cocky smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls! There\u2019s no reason for me to decide right now. We\u2019re all having fun. Why don\u2019t we go to breakfast, or we better yet head back to bed and pick up where we left off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s smirk soon dropped as Laura stood up, her face contorted in anger. \u201cWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole winced and Laura took as step forward with her right arm was tensed into a fist, causing her muscles to flex and surge into large bulges. She stomped toward Jason and he, despite having an obvious strength and size advantage, took a step back. Laura looked up with growing anger and poked him a few times in his massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI let you have your three way.  I gave you your little lesbian fantasy.  Nicole was nice enough to play along too even though we just met two weeks ago at your gym.  You were calling this a fling before you finally were going to make some type of commitment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s face turned toward regret as he listened to Laura\u2019s rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now I see it was all just a game to string me along.  If you think I\u2019m going to be just another loose commitment; or worse yet, just another GIRL\u2026..\u201d  She let that last word hang for a moment as sweat began to trickle down Jason\u2019s cheek. \u201cThen you\u2019ve obviously mistaken just who I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned on her heals, marched over to where her clothes were, picked them up, and stormed out of the room, naked and fuming. Jason continued to stand there, too shocked for actions. Nicole sat there too, a disappointed look on her face that was betrayed by a sneaky smile.  Jason heard several doors slam so hard that he was sure they were cracked and turned his head toward a window to see an SUV peel out of the driveway. Nicole finally stood up and looked at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Not sure what you were thinking champ, but I\u2019ll chalk that up to just what this body has to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused as she placed one hand on her hard, slim waist and pushed her left hip out. Jason tried not to gulp at the sight of this beautiful, naked hard body in front of him. His erection started to return and Nicole\u2019s smile slowly grew. She laughed and turned, looking down her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to stick around, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise for either of us. After all, we gave Laura the advanced gene therapy five days ago. The fact that it worked as quickly as it did was already shocking us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pulled on her underwear and slipped on her bra as Jason looked on. He wanted Nicole to continue so he could have some idea of what was going on. She slid on a black dress and gave him a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you OK? You look like you have no idea what is going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stammered as he continued to feel completely out of place. \u201cMy head is a bit cloudy. Uh, just what kind of gene therapy did Laura get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole laughed. \u201cReally? Come on, Jason. You know that Laura came to my Dad\u2019s clinic after meeting me at the gym and I explained how I got my rocking body as a test subject. She likes you a lot Jason and was willing to subject herself to the next phase so she could have a body that could keep up with your massive muscles, strength and endurance. You\u2019ve seen the results. She\u2019s charting off the scales to the point we\u2019ve asked her to stop working out just to see if her muscle size and strength gains slow down. Don\u2019t you remember her last work-out two days ago when she was actually becoming bigger and stronger DURING the work-out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped. Laura, his best friend and potential future wife had taken a huge risk just to please him, had given him a night of pleasure that every man dreams about, and he humiliated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right. It\u2019s all just happened so quickly, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole chuckled as she ran her fingers through her hair and reached into her purse to pull out a tube of lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is one girl who\u2019s not going to get in her way right now. Although now that we have some idea of what the next phase of the gene therapy can offer, perhaps I\u2019ll give it a whirl. Added to what I already have should produce some interesting results. At least then maybe I can become your ultimate fantasy girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a sigh. She was already a fantasy girl. But he guessed what she meant. He was also a bit worried at the way she said it. Nicole finished with her makeup touch up, walked to the bedroom door, turned and smiled seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood bye stud. Last night was a blast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blinked his eyes. \u201cUh, thanks. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole let out a quick chuckle and walked out the door. Jason knew that laugh. She might as well have said, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there in his large bedroom, alone both literally and figuratively. Sighing again, he decided to look around after a shower. He then gave himself a tour, whistling as he walked into each room. He was obviously rich, although he had no idea how. Finding a computer, he began searching himself when his phone buzzed. It was from someone named Adam. His picture indicated he was a rather large bodybuilder.  Seeing as Adam was in his phone he felt it was safe to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped. \u201cUh, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to Laura? She\u2019s in here pumping weights like a madwoman and cursing your name. She\u2019s scaring even the big bodybuilders, including me. You need to come here and calm her down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood up and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I\u2019ll be there.  Uh, where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winced as he let out the fact he had no idea where Adam was calling from, although he deduced a gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt your downtown gym. Where else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grit his teeth. \u201cRight, I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung up and and punched in his name into his smart phone and was surprised when he saw just how many gyms had his name. \u201cWell,\u201d he thought as he walked toward the garage, \u201cat least that explains where the money came from.\u201d A bowl was sitting next to the door had keys to a Ford Explorer and he was soon driving to the gym. He pulled into a spot with his name on it and walked into the gym quickly. Adam was there waiting and he could hear Laura cursing in a large free weight area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s been working out since she stormed in here. I can\u2019t believe how much she\u2019s lifting. Everyone has moved to other areas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked nervously toward the free weight area and glanced over at a large board with his name on the top and World Record Lifts below. His jaw opened slightly as he saw numbers he would never have thought possible. Hell, his bench press was 3850 pounds! That fact gave him confidence that no matter what Laura\u2019s gains may have been that there was no way she could be anywhere as strong as he was. As he approached Laura she was doing one arm curls, but his view was obscured by the squat machine, so he couldn\u2019t see how much she was lifting. Pulling a breath and letting it out slowly he cleared his throat. \u201cLaura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned her head up and dropped the weights. He was surprised at how loud the thuds were and felt a slight reverberation along the floor. She narrowed her eyes, but didn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell do you want? Want to kick me out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason remained calm and put on a comforting smile. \u201cNo, of course not. I want to apologize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura glared at him, her face stuck on a stone stare. As an uncomfortable silence followed, Laura finally said. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Jason knew this needed to be good as he began to talk.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell,\u201d Jason thought, trying to formulate a valid explanation, \u201cI was still playing the game from the night before.  I really never meant to hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sniffed.  \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed.  He was adjusting a bit to this new reality as if his previous history was being absorbed.  His size and strength had given him what he wanted.  Laura\u2019s friendship was something he enjoyed, but until a week ago, they had drifted a bit apart.  So for her now to demand so much so quickly was actually more than he was willing to accept.  Apologizing was starting to feel forced, but he felt he owed her that.  However, for her to continue to want more was beginning to bother him.  The fact that she had taken some kind of gene therapy to make her the strongest girl around was bothering him less as well.  After all, she was still just a woman and was a foot and half shorter.  There was no way she could ever approach his strength or size.  Even though the sex this morning was incredible, if she continued to play this game with him, he was more than willing to move on.  So as his face turned from conciliatory to a bit bored, he walked around the squat machine to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, really.  Now are you going to calm down now and quit scaring the other members?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood there with her hands on her hips as Jason got a good look at her.  Trying to maintain a more commanding attitude that his size and strength gave him; he was still taken aback by the Laura he was looking at.  She had grown bigger.  By quite a bit!  Laura was still only 5 foot 4, so the large muscles flexed up across her body appeared even larger and more impressive.  The fact that she was barefoot and sporting only a set of undersized spandex shorts and a seriously strained athletic top was almost enough to want to pick up where they left off this morning.  Laura\u2019s upper body looked especially pumped and the arms he had once figured were nearly 20 inches now looked to be closer to 24!  Had she really added that much muscle with just an hour or so of lifting?  That would seem impossible.  Laura caught his slight change in attitude and noticed that he was looking at her arms.  Smiling slightly, Laura pulled up her right arm slowly, squeezed her small hand into a fist and gently flexed her bicep.  Veins that had already surfaced due to her workout pumped along her forearms and across her biceps and triceps.  Laura tensed harder and the bicep popped up into a hard softball sized muscle with incredible definition, a clear split and a rigid, angled peak.  Jason looked favorably impressed and Laura let out a soft grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to calm down mister.  I think these muscles are growing big enough to command a little more respect, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s fascination was grounded for the moment.  \u201cWell I can see that you\u2019ve added a bit of muscle since this morning.  But if you\u2019re trying to intimidate me you can forget it.  You can work out all you want but you\u2019ll never catch up to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his own arm up and flexed his gigantic 42 inch biceps to drive his point home.  Laura\u2019s eyes shot daggers in his direction as she released her flex.  Jason nodded at his quick victory and released his flex as well.  Laura\u2019s stood there for a moment, grinding her teeth before her expression changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then perhaps you would like to work out with me then, to show me your superior strength and size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in the back of Jason\u2019s mind was telling him to back off.  The stray comment from Nicole about not wanting to get in Laura\u2019s way gave him pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only for a moment.  He had wanted to try out his new body since the moment he stepped in.  If Laura stuck around and gushed over his huge muscles and super strength like she used to, maybe her attitude would change and she\u2019d get off her bitch rage.  So with a superior smile planted on his face, Jason snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.  But I was looking to work my chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grunted.  \u201cI\u2019m still working my arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed.  \u201cFine.  When you\u2019re done you can join me at the bench press.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s serious looked remained, but she forced a smile.  \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded and rubbed his hands together, looked at the bench press and counted out the weights to see it was already at 3500 pounds plus the weight of the bar.  He must have left it at this weight the last time he worked out seeing as nobody else on earth could lift even a third of that weight.  To see seven huge, custom made 250 pound plates line either side only boosted his confidence and once he got into position he was quickly pushing the weight up and down.  It was heavy alright, but very manageable.  Ignoring Laura completely, Jason continued to increase the weights until he was attempting over 4000 pounds, breaking his own record!  He reached up and with a loud groan, pulled the weight down and with all of his formidable strength pushed to the limit, completed the lift!  He laid there panting, holding the weight up when he saw Laura\u2019s beautiful face look down at him with her long chestnut hair flowing around her head.  Her smile was confident and a bit off-putting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed some help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sniffed.  \u201cNo, not really, but you can guide the bar back on the rack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s light brown eyes sparkled down at him as she gripped the bar with her small, feminine hands.  \u201cSure thing stud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted again, liking the words, but not so sure about the tone.  Laura reached out and as he got the bar to the rack, let go.  Only Laura didn\u2019t let go and instead pulled the bar away from the rack.  Jason\u2019s eyes opened a bit with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up, turned and stood up to face Laura, who had taken a step to the side, holding the massive weight at her thighs.  Her confident smile remained and grew as Jason\u2019s jaw opened.  Laura was now even larger than she was just seemingly moments ago!  Much larger in fact.  Her legs, likely not even worked, appeared thicker and harder with rippling quads to put most male bodybuilders to shame.  Her calves expanded to be seen on either side of her shins and appeared to actually pulse.  Were her muscles growing larger by the moment?  Her hard 8 pack abs looked even more defined and exposed more muscle along the sides even as her midsection remained as narrow as before.  Her back looked wider and the athletic top looked ready to burst against her larger chest.  But it was her arms that gave him pause.  She was holding the weight in a reverse grip and her biceps bulged and throbbed with more muscle than he would have thought possible, even fully extended!  As he reached her happy eyes, Laura licked her lips and let out a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy I\u2019m just helping you out like you asked.  Helping you with a two ton, record breaking bench press weight, which is pretty impressive I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason cleared his throat, growing nervous for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh right.  Now why don\u2019t you put the weight down before you hurt yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura chuckled.  \u201cYou\u2019d like that wouldn\u2019t you?  To see a puny girl hurt herself with your big, manly weight.  Well there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m now sure about.  Nicole was right to ask me to slow down with the weight lifting, because once I get this body going\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jason\u2019s horror Laura slowly began to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason\u2019s high after bench pressing over two tons was draining away as stared down at a seriously beefed up Laura. To see his friend, a beautiful brown haired teen-age girl hold the gigantic weight with seemingly minimal strain; the weight he had just struggled to bench press, caused his jaw to open as he stared at her with fear and awe. After all, he was 6 foot 10, weighed 500 pounds and had muscles twice the size of a heavyweight bodybuilder. But now his incredible lift was quickly being overshadowed by a 5 foot 4 inch tall girl whose muscles were pumped larger than any woman and except for him, any man! If his body was massive, hers was gigantic! The fact that Laura\u2019s boulder sized muscles flowed around her thin frame with achingly feminine appeal was even more mind blowing. And now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to do something that even he couldn\u2019t do. Something he hadn\u2019t even thought about doing. She was about to match his world record lift in the bench press\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy CURLING the same weight! Laura\u2019s smirk was off putting at best as her nostrils flared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your world recording setting bench press weight. Like four times the next best, making you four times stronger than anyone. Let\u2019s see what a little teen age girl can do with such a staggering weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura struggled for a moment to pull the bar upward, but she did her best to mask the pain. After all, having grown stronger in leaps and bounds over the last 30 minutes, she was now confident that even this massive weight was something she could handle, and soon enough handle with ease!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Jason\u2019s jaw dropped further and Laura\u2019s lips curved into a wicked smile, she did the seemingly impossible and slowly, incredibly, curled the 4100 pounds up toward her muscle pulsing chest. Her biceps bulged forth with eye popping mass and thick throbbing veins as the bar and the gigantic weights rose higher. Letting out the breath she was holding to bull the bar upward, Laura spat at the stunned Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! If you\u2019re four times stronger than any other man by benching this, what do think curling this weight makes ME? Well I\u2019ll tell you one thing! It makes me stronger than YOU! And now that my muscles are primed and pumped, there\u2019s no stopping me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason\u2019s pulse raced with fear. How could she possibly be doing that? How could her muscles be growing and surging right in front of him like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if to drive him further over the edge, Laura pulled the weight back down to her tree trunk thighs and pulled the gigantic weight back up quickly! With only a small grunt and a cocky stare up at Jason, she continued to pump the weight up and down. And her smile grew wider as each repetition was actually easier than the one before. Laura was beginning to feel unstoppable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten hard reps, Laura dropped the huge weight with a ground shaking boom and snarled with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Jason? Not what you were hoping for? Expecting me to just crawl back to you, fawning over your huge muscles and great strength? To beg you to forgive me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled up her right arm, the one that seemingly moments ago was an impressive, rock hard 24 inch super feminine bicep, but now surged upward into a gigantic throbbing mass of frightening bumps, grooves and insane muscle fibers out of a science fiction horror movie. Laura licked her lips and looked back and forth between her rising bicep and the white face Jason, Laura nearly giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe if you\u2019re lucky I\u2019ll let YOU fawn over MY great strength\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing her fist as her forearm moved up, her bicep pounded upward at an alarming rate. Her muscles appeared to be expanding and growing right before Jason\u2019s eyes! For every inch she moved her forearm toward vertical, her bicep appeared to add two inches of rippling, massive, shredded she muscles! By the time her forearm was upright; her ridiculously massive bicep was peaked up to her wrist! Jason gulped. Laura\u2019s bicep had to be nearly 40 inches around! Almost as big as his! Laura smiled at his frightened look and glanced over at the mighty muscle that throbbed ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd MY great muscles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused to examine the muscle for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, almost as big as yours now Jason don\u2019t you think? Maybe almost big enough to intimidate even YOU?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura released her flex and stepping toward the stunned Jason, reached out and grabbed a fist full of his shirt. With a wicked smirk, Laura brought her arm up and pulling Jason toward her; lifted him off the ground! Even though she had just curled over two tons, lifting his 500 pounds off the floor with one arm was more than Jason thought she was capable of. Laura snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s this? Am I strong enough for you now you pathetic worm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grimaced as his heart pounded. He reached out with both arms and pulled against Laura\u2019s forearm. Laura grunted as Jason dug into her thick muscle with his formidable strength and squeezed with both hands, causing her to lower Jason until his feet were back on the ground. Jason took a step back and Laura struggled to hold him close and jerked forward before holding her ground. Her eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not. But I can fix that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strong power move, Laura pivoted quickly and yanked Jason over on his side. He grunted again as he found himself slammed to the floor. Laura quickly reached over toward the weight with her other hand and gripped the bar. Laura pulled the bar and Jason up to both hips. Jason regained his footing and just when he was about to try and pull away again, Laura let out a hard breath as she pulled Jason up into the air once again until his feet were back off the ground. Jason let out his own hard grunt as he struggled to gain some balance. His expression changed back to shock as he stared down at Laura. She was holding the two ton weight with one arm! And worse yet, he thought she was actually looking to curl it? No, this just couldn\u2019t be happening! He was the biggest, strongest man on earth! He just couldn\u2019t be outdone. Especially by Laura! But as he stared down he heard Laura\u2019s overstrained top finally rip in several places as mounds of rock hard girl muscle burst forth, pumping up to an unearthly degree across her back, shoulders and chest, and to his disbelief, her arm! Laura let out another grunt as she pulled the bar away from her body as she grew stronger and stronger! Muscles bubbled and throbbed across her bicep as her power ramped up and the bar and her ferocious bicep rose higher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd higher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd HIGHER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredibly, impossibly, Laura pulled the 4100 pound gigantic barbell up until she completed the one arm, super human busting curl! And her bicep, previously flexed up to nearly 40 inches around surged upward with more muscle than should be humanly possible! Her lower bicep was the size of basketball up to the base of her bicep split while the back bicep, sitting on top of her basketball sized muscle and peaking up way over the top of her fist, was the size of a football!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out another grunt and slowly brought the weight back down until her arm was outstretched and her tricep ground into a horse shaped 18 inches thick super muscle! She paused for a moment and with a hiss of effort pulled the bar upward once again, completing the curl in moments, causing her bicep to explode upward once again and pushing the football sized back bicep higher until a third, biology busting muscle slowly rose up on top of the football until the third tier was the size of two softballs! Laura now laughed through her strain and quickly brought her arm back down. And this time she barely paused and brought her arm back up, blasting more muscle into her unearthly arm muscles. She then picked up the pace, curling the bar quicker! Her muscle expansion slowed as the weight soon wasn\u2019t heavy enough to give her a pump! To drive her superiority home, Laura continued to curl the weight faster and faster until her arm was nearly a blur, laughing at how easy it was. As she pulled the bar down after over a hundred one arm, two ton curls, the massive weight flew through the air, smashing with a deafening explosion into the back wall 50 feet away, ripping through the plaster, metal and concrete and crashing into the parking lot, tearing into a car, embedding deep into the frame. With a wicked grin, Laura looked back up a Jason whose struggles were now easily muted by the super powered teen-age girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you intimidated yet dear Jason? Am I no longer just a plaything for you to discard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sniffed and tossed Jason to the ground. He landed on with a thud on his behind and put his arms back to catch himself from hitting the floor. Jason\u2019s breath was quick as he was nearly ready to hyperventilate. Laura took a step toward him and once she reached his feet she stopped, smiled and reached up to pull off the remains of her top. With a quick rip Laura easily tugged the rags and tossed them to the side, exposing her mind blowing muscles in all of their glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy superior strength has already left you paltry strongest man power in the dust. And these super sized girl muscles are so much larger, harder and grander than your once all mighty muscles that you\u2019re no longer even in my league.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason stared upward with growing fear, the door flew open and several members of a swat team burst in.  The first one in saw Laura, signaled to the others and yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreeze!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled.  \u201cOr what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swat team then\u2026.</span></div></div>",

He wanted to save his changes \"immediately\", right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Jason put the phone down, when suddenly, he was overcome with a warm feeling, mainly in his muscles. He flexed his scrawny bicep, only to find out it wasn't scrawny any more. Jason looked down at his shirt, and then pulled it up to reveal six-pack abs. Jason was shocked. Was he really going to grow into that muscular hunk he designed? Before he had a chance to look at Laura's phone again, he noticed his shirt tearing. His pecs were pushing right through the fabric. He noticed his legs were growing as well, and his pants ripped off, leaving him in his briefs. He kept growing, but he hoped his briefs would hold. Soon he reached Greg's size, but that was soon a distant memory as he grew to a massive 370 lbs.. Jason's briefs were still intact, but only just barely, as tears were appearing on the fabric. It also did little to hide his above-average endowment. Jason looked at the phone with wonder, but then he got worried. What if someone saw him like this? How would he explain? Jason then remembered the other \"Temporal Alterations\" options. \"Historical\" must change reality so it was as if the changes had always been there! He quickly changed the setting to Historical, and then tried to figure out what change he would do so he could change reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go over the top and make himself absolutely humongous. He was quite curious what reality could possibly have him that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could make Laura grow. Probably not as much as him, though.

Wondering where to start, he opens up the app and frowns at the model of himself. He quickly moves the height slider all the way up to 15 feet high, and then started filling it up with muscle. Huge amounts of muscle. When he looked at the statistics on the side, he was shocked to find the 15 foot behemoth he was creating was well over 2000 lbs.. At that size, he could easily lift a skyscraper! He then looked at the model and noticed it's clothes had changed. The virtual Jason was wearing a green speedo. He frowned when he saw absolutely no bulge whatsoever. His checked the settings for his penis, and changed it so it was 4.5 feet long erect, 3 feet long flaccid, and 1 foot in diameter. The model now had a bulge so big the speedo could barely conceal all of it. Jason smirked, and hit the \"apply\" button. However, a message popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*NOTICE*<br>\r\nWould you like to change any other profiles first before saving?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at it, then said yes. He went to Laura's profile and changed her love interest to him, and then he changed his love interest to her. When he pressed apply again, another message popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WARNING*<br>\r\nIf you don't make any more changes to [Laura Friedman]'s profile, she won't change physically. Do you want to continue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at that and thought that it meant that Laura would stay at her current size. Jason thought for a moment on what to do, then decided to continue anyways since he wondered what it would be like to have a small girlfriend.<br>\r\nHe hit \"continue\" and waits.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura pulled up her profile on her phone and began thinking on how she wanted to be. On the one hand, she could make herself the sexiest woman alive, ever, or she could match her best friend's new physique bulge for bulge. Her immediate thought was to increase her overall sexiness, so she added a cup size or two (or three) to her profile, her breasts in the picture swelling forward, beginning to fight for room within her shirt. Next she found the section specifically for her currently flat back tires (her butt). Within were a small selection of sliders, such as tone, size, jiggle, perkiness (an odd idea in her mind), and a small handful of others. She quickly decided merely having a larger behind with decent muscle tone would suffice for her, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after increasing the musculature of her rear, she began thinking about...the rest of her. She then looked up at Jason's new 370 lb frame, covered in calves cut like diamonds, quads and hamstrings bigger around than her chest, that pleasantly large bulge between the muscular pillars of his legs, his deep and separated 8 pack abs, the two pillows of steel that covered his chest, bowling ball-sized shoulders, with arms and forearms that looked like steel cables bunched together underneath his skin...Laura shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the app's features, she found the same one that Jason had on his profile, and quickly began increasing her muscle mass to similar proportions to his. Within a few seconds, the remains of her avatar's clothes were gone, and the digital scale in the corner of the screen read 350 lbs. She then realized that she would look freakishly big, as she would be packing all of that muscle onto her current 5' 4\" frame. That simply couldn't do, she thought to herself, and then increased her height to a much more appropriate 5' 10\", the scale now reading 375 lbs as the muscles grew alongside her height to stay with her preset proportions. She would be bigger than Jason. She would be bigger than Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked up at Jason, his briefs barely containing himself, and said, \"We're going to have some fun, big boy.\"<br>\r\nShe pushed the \"Apply changes\" button, selecting \"Immediate\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura immediately felt a fantastic warmth spread throughout her body, coupled with her preexisting lusting for Jason and his size, sent her into waves of orgasm after orgasm. Laura moaned uncontrollably, each breath she took she looked over herself as her breasts rose and remained, pushed further forward by the forming wall of her pectoral muscles; her shoulders swelling up and out as if they were balloons being filled with air; her biceps, triceps, and forearms growing thicker and thicker with cords of steel within. Her bra had given up long ago, she hadn't even noticed it was gone before her shirt practically exploded off of her now immense torso. She ran her left hand up and down the cobblestone wall of her abdominals and obliques while flexing her right bicep, each flex pushing the mountainous ridge of muscle higher and higher. Her jeans finally gave in to her swelling legs, ripping up the sides and across her rear to make room for the pounds of girl-meat that were being added. Laura reached down and pulled the denim off of her legs like paper, leaving only her panties behind, which quickly gave way to her bulging ass, hips and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time, Laura's growth had finished, leaving her standing 5' 10\" with more muscles than she had ever known could exist on a person. She raised her arms upward and flexed her biceps, the twin peaks of power rising above her colossal shoulders. It was then Laura remembered that she was standing in front of Jason, whose brief's no longer contained his large tool, which stretched forward a staggering 14 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The floor groaned beneath the feet of the two behemoths. Combined they weighed nearly 750 pounds and they definitely looked it. Laura sexily strode over to where Jason stood her every move activating a tidal wave of motion across her lower body. Her thighs bulged and hardened with each step, her calves hardened into diamond hard masses, her abs swayed side to side as she rotated her hips. She cupped one of her large breasts and moaned as a bolt of pleasure shot through her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Jason asked as the super sized seductress neared where he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grinned. \"You're smart, I'm sure you can figure it out.\" She reached out a hand and touched the large tip of his penis causing Jason to jump as if he'd been shocked with electricity. Then Laura opened her hand and slid her fingers around his shaft before slowly running her tight grip down the entire 14 inch length. She guided Jason's huge cock between her muscular thighs then pressed her body up against his draping her hands on his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura planted kisses on Jason's shoulders and chest giving the occasional nibble to his juicy muscles. \"We're a pair of naked, horny, muscle beasts. Care to take these bodies for a spin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason's hands were on Laura's hips and he was mashing his pelvis against hers. She let out a surprise gasp then jumped up slightly wrapping her huge legs around his waist. She was no longer planting tiny kisses on his torso she was sucking on his chest and neck for all she was worth leaving large red marks everywhere she went. Jason responded quickly to her leg wrap and set one hand under her rear to hold her up, though she was easily strong enough to support herself it gave him an opportunity to begin toying with her vagina with his strong fingers. He was astounded at the heat that was radiating out of her sex which drove him further and further into a state of unrestrained lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see those huge muscles,\" Laura said between sucks. Jason raised his free hand and flexed a 29 inch bicep with a peak like a mountaintop. Laura screamed with delight and reach out to paw at his huge arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spun and tossed Laura down onto her bed causing the frame to collapse but it didn't slow him down in the slightest. Instead he mounted her prone body and plunged his huge dick straight into her. She screamed again and demanded he do it again harder. Happy to comply Jason slid backwards slowly, relishing the tightness of his thick shaft in her tight pussy. He grabbed Laura by the waist and pulled her towards him while he plowed forward again, their bodies connecting in a violent collision that would have been painful for anyone else but pure pleasure for these two titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued to slowly hammer away, the force of his blows continued to shake the bed frame apart around the two of them. It didn't take more than two minutes before Laura was screaming and writhing in a titanic orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only encouraged Jason to work even harder and he bent forward so that he was on all fours, his face right by hers and began jackhammering his cock in and out of her at surprising speed. Laura's screaming continued as she thrashed back and forth between his huge arms. Jason lowered himself down slightly and clamped his mouth on one of Laura's large breasts and began sucking hard, switching between her gorgeous tits every few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed and it occurred to Jason that he was still hammering her at a rapid pace and had been for the better part of an hour. He had been waiting for fatigue to set in before switching positions but it never had and he'd gotten lost in the pleasure. Laura was a sweaty mess, her voice gone from yelling she could now only moan loudly while she played with the muscles of his chest and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last Jason allowed himself to come which hit the insides of Laura like a freight train. Once the two of them had settled down the napped together among the remains of her destroyed bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later they awoke and decided on their next steps.</span></div></div>",

The first was a drop down that read \"Progressive\" and the next was another drop down that read \"6 Months.\" Jason was even more confused by these options but before he could even begin to investigate he heard Laura emerge from her shower. He quickly tapped \"Apply\" and reopened Greg's profile. Satisfied that things were back to normal he left the iPhone where he'd found it and stealthily made his way downstairs and flipped on the TV to wait for Laura to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time as the day went on Jason tried to see if he could get Laura's phone from her so he could investigate the strange app further, but it quickly became clear that she wasn't going to let it out of her sight. By the following day he had all but forgotten about the app and the rendering of himself at 370 pounds of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - - </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later on the 4th of July Jason was getting ready to leave the house. He slid on one of his favorite t-shirts, a vintage looking Star Wars shirt with a X-Wing on the front, and frowned when it was too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many of my shirts have been shrinking lately,\" he said. \"Unless I'm getting fatter.\" He put his hands to his stomach and realized that it still fit fine around his middle. He'd never really thought about it but his shirts were tightest around his chest and shoulders. Curious he made his way to the bathroom mirror and removed his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a rule he never really paid any attention to his body, his 6 foot and 150 pound body was skinny and unappealing and he'd rather not even look at it, but now that he really took his reflection in he saw that his chest was no longer sunken but had developed enough pectoral muscle to even have a fairly deep groove running down his sternum and his shoulders looked wider. His stomach, too, even had some definition to it and when he tensed his arms he could see his muscles flex and harden a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it, he had a nice body. But how? Suddenly the memory of himself at superhuman levels of muscular development came back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not possible, is it?\" Jason asked his reflection. He remembered the screen that read \"6 Months\" and \"Progressive\" and did some quick math. \"Growing from 150 pounds to 370 over six months would mean about 35 pounds a month. It's been about four weeks since I would have started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out the bathroom scale and stepped on it. The digital readout reported his weight at 190 pounds. \"Holy shit! I've already grown by 40 pounds!!\" He put his hands on his chest and felt the solid sinew beneath. \"I feel so hard, I wonder if I'm stronger already. I mean, I must be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's mind was going a mile a minute, he felt like he was suddenly bursting with energy. He needed a test so he dropped to the floor and began doing push-ups. In the past he could only ever do a couple, maybe 5 at best, before his weak arms gave out. Now he quickly made it to 20 before he switched to doing them one handed. \"I'm way stronger than I used to be!!\" He said as he switched from arm to arm pressing his body weight with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the bathroom and searched his closet for some loose fitting clothes. He found some denim shorts that came down to his knee and a baggy button up shirt. He looked kind of like a slob, but it would do until he could find some new clothes. \"I'm going to need lots and lots of new clothes if I'm really going to hulk out like I think.\" Just the thought of his impending growth made his penis, the only muscle of his that had always been naturally huge though he'd never had the confidence to use it, stand at its full 10 inch glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his phone and called Laura. She answered and Jason could tell by her voice that she was annoyed by something. He asked her what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. It's just Greg and Vanessa.\" She sighed. Jason rolled his eyes, it was always her siblings. \"Tonight is their annual 4th of July beach bonfire. It'll be gorgeous girls and buff guys everywhere. So depressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, depressing...\" Jason's mind was drifting away from their current conversation and towards Laura's older sister. Jason had been harboring a major crush on the busty blonde for years but had never even considered acting on it but now he was a good looking guy with some decent muscular development. Jason knew Vanessa was drawn to guys with muscles and before long he would have more muscle than anyone else in the world. He was pretty sure he could get a date out of her if he were to try. Then again, maybe he'd be better off if he were to wait until he was even bigger and besides his best friend was feeling down. He guessed she didn't know that the app he'd found really worked or else she would have made some changes of her own. Perhaps telling her would cheer her up. Then again she may have gotten rid of the app and telling her could make things worse if she couldn't get it back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason and Laura chatted for a while, though Jason was barely there. He was busy thinking of all the various scenarios possible should he attempt to ask Vanessa out on a date. He felt kind of bad ignoring Laura in a time of need but the fact was she spent most of every summer complaining about her older siblings. Jason resolved that he would figure out if the magical app was still on her phone and if it was he'd tell her so she could have the body of her dreams. In the meantime he had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you even listening?\" Laura was asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am,\" Jason lied, \"look, you take all this too seriously. Just because Vanessa and Greg are popular doesn't make them better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're right. They're popular because they're better, not the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and rolled his eyes. There was no stopping her once she was on a roll. He listened and gave the occasional grunt of agreement for a while longer then asked, \"Just out of curiosity, were you going to go to the bonfire tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? No way! But since you ask did you want to come over-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Laura, my mom is calling me. I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow.\" Jason hung up feeling a bit guilty but reminded himself he'd help Laura soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a quick trip to the mall and picked up a few new articles of clothing that would fit his new frame as well as a few bigger sizes to grow into. Then he went home and paced for a few hours rehearsing every possible pickup line he could think of.  Finally the sun was dipping and Jason made his way up the beach in his swim trunks and nothing else. The sea air was cool and he could have done with a shirt, but he wanted to make sure Vanessa got a good look at his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he arrived at the party he almost immediately turned around. There was Greg with several of his bodybuilding buddies laughing and chatting while a handful of girls fawned over their muscles. Greg was looking especially incredible. While Jason had been growing Greg had packed on some additional weight as well beefing up to a powerful and intimidating 240 pounds. Jason had overheard him talking about his gains a few days earlier but hadn't gotten a look at Greg until just now. All of Jason's newfound confidence left him in that moment and it was all he could do to keep himself from turning right around. He bolstered his ego by reminding himself that come December 240 pounds would be like a stick compared to him and pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about 80 or so people all gathered in the vicinity of the bonfire pit and Jason moved among them in the waining light of the day. It only took a few minutes to spot Vanessa and once he did his heart started pounding in his chest. She looked amazing. She wore skintight black Lycra shorts and a dark red bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason found where the drinks were being served and before he could even decide on what he wanted a beer was poured from a keg and shoved into his hand. He kept close to Vanessa, sipping his drink and waiting for a chance to make his approach. To his amazement he only had to wait about 15 minutes when Vanessa excused herself from her current group and walked away alone. There was no one around her and Jason knew he probably wouldn't get another shot so he started walking quickly on an intercept course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vanessa!\" Jason shot her the brightest smile he could muster not believing what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa frowned at him for a moment which made Jason worry but then her face lit up. \"Jason? Is that you? I didn't recognize you. You look, I mean wow. You look great! Have you been working out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Yeah, I have. I think I've gotten some ok results. You want to feel?\" He held his arm out and tensed his forearm and bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she hesitated and Jason didn't think she was going to, but then she grinned and reached a hand out and slid it along his upper arm. As she squeezed down her eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you're so hard! What do you have in there, rocks? I don't think I've ever felt muscles this tight.\" She continued to squeeze his small but mighty bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then lowered his arm and flexed his chest in the hopes that it would entice her to further explore. To his delight it worked and soon both of her hands were exploring his chest and stomach. Even in the light of dusk Jason could see the skin on Vanessa's chest and neck flushed and her nipples began to poke through her top. A moment later they made eye contact with each other and Vanessa stepped back embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said. \"I got a little carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Jason said. He was sad that her hands were no longer on him but also thrilled that he had the upper hand in their conversation, a position he never dreamed of being in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you're doing keep it up, because... wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe I will.\" Jason guided them into a brief conversation that covered a few safe topics like the annual party and fireworks. Not wanting to keep her away from her friends for too long Jason eventually decided it was time to roll the dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was wondering if I can take you out to a movie or something. Maybe this weekend?\" Before he knew it the words were out there. And he felt as though time had frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa frowned and Jason felt his heart sink. \"Oh.. I'm sorry, Jason. I can't this weekend. I'm headed up to the mountains with some friends.\" Jason was about to accept his rejection and move on when she continued. \"But I'm free for the weekend after that. I hope that's ok with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason was giddy with energy. \"That'd be great. The classic theater in downtown is showing the director's cut of Blade Runner. Have you seen it? Total classic Sci-Fi.\" As soon as the words were out he realized his mistake. Vanessa was not Laura and had never been a fan of the nerdier things in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's brow furrowed for a moment. Then her eyes roamed across Jason's chest and arms. She looked back up to his face and smiles. \"You know, I don't usually like those movie but I don't think I ever really gave them a chance. There must be something cool about them if you and Laura like them so much. It's a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, great.\" Jason said then wished her a good night before walking back home. He remained calm all the way back up to his room where he immediately began dancing, leaping, and otherwise celebrating his incredible fortune. He had locked down a date with the woman of his dreams.</span></div></div>",

Jason did some math and figured he would grow from 190 pounds to just shy of 210 by that time. Jason excitedly marked his progress day by day and took lots of pictures of his expanding muscles. Now that he was aware of his growth he could definitely feel a great increase in his overall strength which was intoxicating and led to him frequently finding heavy objects and seeing if he could lift them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week after the bonfire party Jason's body crested the 200 pound mark and something about crossing that threshold really pushed him into bodybuilder territory. His chest was looking thick and pronounced, his arms when flexed were up to 15 inches around and his thighs were exploding with sinew. And still he continued to grow at nearly 2 pounds a day until date night arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dressed in a black button up shirt with short sleeves and a pair of jeans that fit a little loose but that would certainly be tight within a few weeks. He drove to pick up Vanessa who came bounding out of the house wearing a black dress with white polka dots and red Converse high tops with a matching red ribbon tied in her hair. At the sight of her Jason's mouth went dry. Her dress was tight across her bust with a slight v-neck dip accentuating her perfect DD cut breasts, but what really stopped Jason's heart was Vanessa's legs. Jason had always been in love with Vanessa's legs, they were long and shapely with generous curves of muscle developed from years of dance and cheerleading. The skirt of her dress was cut above mid thigh and her defined quads pumped and hardened as she skipped to his car. Even though she wore flats her the cleft of her calf muscles was obvious and perfect. Then, when she arrived at the car she went up on her toes and spun on one foot to show off her outfit. Jason's eyes were no where near her clothes, though and instead focused on her incredible pins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa opened the car door and plopped down in the passenger seat. \"I never thought, in a million years, that I'd be on a date with skinny little Jason from down the street. But here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just as amazed as you are, believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look gorgeous,\" Jason said truthfully. Then he really took in the outfit, the polka dotted dress and red high tops. \"You know, you look a lot like Clara, The Doctor's companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor who?\" Vanessa asked not knowing his reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Jason said. He could immediately tell his joke hadn't landed and wanted to kick himself. \"Never mind, maybe if you like the movie tonight we'll get to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove to the theater, purchased their tickets and sat in the dark auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've really never heard of this movie?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave Vanessa a warm smile. \"Don't apologize. I think it's awesome I can introduce you to something brand new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent a few minutes explaining the basic premise and how it was adapted from a book. He even gave a little detail about the difference between the original release and the newer version and all the while Vanessa remained interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her interest Jason became self conscious. \"I'm sorry, I'm probably boring you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Vanessa's turn to smile warmly. \"Don't apologize. Your passion is kind of sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked down. \"It's not passion. It's just me being a nerd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa put her hand on Jason's cheek and lifted his face to meet hers again. \"You are one sexy nerd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the lights dimmed and Jason turned to face the screen thinking about how insanely perfect everything was going. It was too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie began Jason found himself looking away from the screen and towards his date more and more. His eyes traced the outline of her shoulder down to her breast then further down to the bare skin of her thighs. Finally, a mere 10 minutes into the film, Jason could take no more waiting and he placed his hand on Vanessa's knee. Without even a split second of hesitation Vanessa lifted the armrest that separated their seats and slid her arm under his hugging it tightly to her body while cuddling up close to Jason. As she held his arm close his hand had slid from her knee to the hem of her dress and now he had a handful of the most perfect flesh wrapped in the silkiest skin he could imagine. He gave her thigh a squeeze and could hear Vanessa purr and give a squeeze back on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good gravy,\" she whispered. \"I'd forgotten how big and hard you were.\" Jason was tempted to make a joke about her comment but decided instead to just give his arm a flex which sent shivers of excitement through Vanessa's body taking her purr to a moan. Then she tightly crossed her legs so that Jason's hand was sandwiched between her incredible thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair sat that way for the duration of the film with Jason occasionally glancing at Vanessa to see if she was enjoying herself. As far as he could tell she was taken in by the story and he was pretty sure he even saw her shed a tear when Roy, the antagonist replicant, gave his farewell monologue and passed away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the movie Vanessa was raving about the whole experience. As the pair walked the few blocks toward the beach and a diner on the pier they talked about the movie. Jason was excited to see that Vanessa was really in tune with not just the story but the subtext as well. He was impressed with her analysis about how the replicants almost seemed more human and the humans in the story, or at least they had more compassion for each other. Jason pointed out that there was still a running debate as to whether or not Deckard was a replicant himself and they both went back and forth arguing each side themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the restaurant they were lead to a booth by the window that overlooked the ocean. Vanessa sat first and when Jason sat in the seat across from him she cocked her head and gave him a quizzical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's wrong?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed. \"My silly muscle man.\" Then she got up and joined him on his side of the table. \"You and I have both been waiting for this date for a very long time. We should cuddle up close every chance we get.\" She pressed her body against his and slid her hand across the front of his shirt feeling the bulging pectorals below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you've been waiting a long time for this?\" Jason asked putting his arm around her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have we known each other?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. I was seven and you were eight so twelve years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right. And if I'm not mistake you've been in love with me since day one. Right? In fact Greg and I used to joke that the only reason you and Laura were friends to begin with was so you could be close to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hugged Vanessa close. He was blushing and hoping she wouldn't notice. \"I'm friends with Laura because we're friends. Best friends.\" He paused. \"The rest is true, though. Why are we only talking about this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you only just asked me out.\" Now it was Vanessa's turn to pause. \"And besides, I thought I had ruined my chances a long time ago or else I would have made a move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"When I was twelve and thought I was so mature Ricky West broke my heart when he broke up with me to spend more time with his friends. We were just stupid kids but I thought my life was over. I was crying to Laura one day when you were over telling her that no one would ever want to be my boyfriend again. Then I ran off to my room to sob some more. Then I heard a timid little voice say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason cut her off. He remembered, of course he did. \"I'll be your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so surprised I didn't know what to say so I just stared at you. I was touched, but didn't know what to do. Then you left and I knew I had missed my chance. I didn't see you again for almost a month and by then I didn't know how I could even mention that day. Then more time passed and it was as if you'd never made the offer in the first place. I hope I can still take you up on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned and put his hand on Vanessa's cheek. He tilted her head back and guided her lips onto his own. They kissed long and deeply and Jason slowly slid his hand down until he was cupping her large breast. When their kiss ended Vanessa looked down at where his hand had ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Soon enough, big guy. Just a little more patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \"Sorry, I'm just excited. This whole night had been like some incredible dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean.\" She gave his pec a hard squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, patience!\" Jason said. \"Now who's excited?\" They laughed together then something occurred to Jason. \"So does this mean you would have gone out with me even if I didn't have these muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liked me from when I was just a kid. Would you have gone out with me if I had never grown big boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, point taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now that you bring it up, what's with the muscles?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jason knew this question would come up eventually and though he had rehearsed his story he wanted to play dumb for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all of a sudden skinny Jason from down the street becomes a buff hunk. How? Why? And, no offense, but are you taking steroids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. \"No offense taken. It's a fair question. No, I'm not taking any drugs, least of all steroids. I guess there were a couple of reasons for the change. Part of me was tired of being the skinny kid, bullies had always been a problem for me. Well, not any more. Also, I wanted to prove my smarts. When I decided to start working out I first studied as much as I could about muscle and strength techniques. There's a ton of science behind the sport of bodybuilding and I knew I could use my brain to enhance my brawn. So far it's been working great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" Vanessa chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly, I know you tend to like guys with big muscles. I thought it would enhance my chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Vanessa's turn to blush. \"Your chances were great to begin with, but yeah, I can't deny my love of muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are going to test that theory. If my math is correct then by the time Christmas rolls around I'll be bigger and stronger than anyone you've ever seen before. A lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa looked up at Jason with a primal hunger in her eyes. Her hand went down his chest, over his cobblestone abs to his crotch. Then a look of surprise washed over her face. Jason's 10 inch erection was reaching into his pant leg and she gripped it tight searching for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you have in here, a lead pipe? Is this you?!? Fuck patience, take me home now!\" She stood and dragged Jason out of the booth. She tossed a twenty on the table to cover the drinks they had ordered and ran out before the waiter could even take their food order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa practically ran back to Jason's car and he raced back to her place dangerously fast. Once home Jason scooped Vanessa up and she kicked her shoes off as he carried her upstairs. He didn't set her back down until they were in her room where he tossed her on her bed. He then ripped his shirt open and tossed it to the floor. Vanessa's eyes lit up when she saw his bare chest, he was noticeably larger than when she saw him on the beach. Jason puffed out his chest for a brief second to show off his size, then he pounced on his beautiful prey. Grabbing ahold of her dress he ripped it apart leaving Vanessa only in her bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Those muscles aren't just for show, are they?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering Jason took her panties in his hand and tore them as easily as he had torn her dress. Tossing the rags aside he pulled his pants off freeing his massive cock. He drove his manhood deep inside Vanessa eliciting a shriek of excitement mixed with exquisite pain. Jason was like a wild animal, years of sexual energy was being unleashed all at once and it was driving Vanessa mad. As he pumped away Jason buried his face in Vanessa's cleavage sucking and licking for all he was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa couldn't get the giant on her to back up long enough for her to unclasp her bra, so she did her best to slide the straps off of her shoulders and pulled the cups down to expose her bulbous breasts completely. Jason responded by clamping his mouth on one nipple while fondling the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was overwhelming Vanessa's senses and she was very quickly building to an explosive orgasm. She was panting faster and faster trying to remain quiet but failing miserably. Suddenly she was pushed over the edge and she began screaming for all she was worth. Jason slowed down just long enough for her to catch her breath, then he used his enhanced strength to flip Vanessa over onto her stomach and continued hammering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason awoke the following morning with an exhausted Vanessa in his arms and he thought to himself that his life was only going to get better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason didn\u2019t want to wake Vanessa, he knew she was tired after the marathon they both put in, but he also couldn\u2019t help himself from running his hands all over her body. He was like a child with a new toy and he couldn\u2019t stop playing with it. He hugged her close with one arm while he ran the other down her side to her hip. Vanessa moaned and awoke just enough to press her warm body against his and slide her leg up his. Her eyes shot open when her thigh came into contact with Jason\u2019s erect penis. She grabbed it with her hand and squeezed just to make sure she wasn\u2019t imagining anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!?\u201d She actually looked angry and for a moment Jason thought he was in trouble for some reason. Then her anger softened a little to incredulity instead. \u201cIs this monster ever going to be satisfied?\u201d She squeezed his cock hard now and grinned when Jason gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen it comes to you I\u2019ll never be satisfied. You are the sexiest woman I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d Jason tugged on her leg to get her to mount him but she resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on, stud. I\u2019m feeling a bit sore. But I think I can find an acceptable compromise.\u201d She slithered down his body and wrapped her large breasts around his engorged cock. There was enough of him sticking out at the top that when she tilted her head down she could wrap her mouth around the head. She began bouncing and sucking, stroking and licking. Jason was overcome with pleasure and could feel Vanessa\u2019s workings from his toes to his head. As he tensed to shoot a load into her mouth he grabbed a handful of the bed sheet beneath him and accidentally ripped a huge hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done spasming and he and Vanessa had caught their breath he looked at the hole and her exposed mattress below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll just add it to your tab. So far you owe me new sheets, a new dress and panties and then there\u2019s uh...\u201d She pointed to the headboard above her bed and one of the posts which had been ripped off exposing splintered wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was probably after midnight. I\u2019m not entirely sure, though. I lost track of time. You... um... just how strong are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fair question, but Jason literally didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d had fun finding heavy stuff around the house and lifting it, but he hadn\u2019t ever put any numbers to it, or found anything that really taxed him for that matter. \u201cWhat do you mean? Compared to what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa paused for a moment before answering. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a way to phrase this without sounding like a slut. I\u2019ve been with a few guys who were built like you and even one who was bigger... you know, muscles wise. But you are, or you seem, way stronger than anyone I\u2019ve ever known. The way you threw me around and destroyed my things, I\u2019ve never seen or felt that before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. \u201cI know it sounds funny but a part of my method is that I don\u2019t really keep track. I just add as much weight as I can. I think others get too concerned with numbers and either only pay attention to them to show off or they end up holding themselves back when things seem too heavy. But I\u2019ll see if I can get some comparable data.\u201d It was all a lie, obviously, but Jason was interested to see how he stacked up to other bodybuilders. Was he really stronger than he should be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t change your process on my account,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cI would hate to ruin your momentum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stood and stretched his muscular body then hit a double biceps pose and admired his arms which now looked to be 16 inches around. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Like I told you, in a few months you wont believe your eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa ran her slender fingers over the peak of his biceps. \u201cI already can\u2019t.\u201d Then she glanced to her right and spotted the clock on her desk. \u201cShit, I\u2019ve got to get ready for work.\u201d Jason knew Vanessa worked as a waitress at a nearby restaurant and though he was sad for their date to officially be over he had a new goal for the day: he would conduct some strength experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, I need to get in some time at the gym myself.\u201d He scooped a hand under her bare bottom and lifted her with ease. He held her so that her face was right by his and they kissed. Vanessa held onto both sides of Jason\u2019s face and sucked long and hard on his bottom lip. For a moment he didn\u2019t think she would let go, then his lip snapped free and she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa wrapped her legs around Jason\u2019s middle and squeezed as tight as she could, \u201cGod DAMN! You drive me insane.\u201d Jason laughed and then felt his erection returning. It poked at Vanessa\u2019s butt and she rolled her eyes, \u201cOh, come on! Really!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, I\u2019ll never get enough of you.\u201d Jason said setting Vanessa back down. \u201cSo can I see you tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa frowned. \u201cSadly no. We\u2019re going to see my grandmother for her birthday. Then I\u2019ve got a few night shifts ahead of me. I\u2019m free all day Thursday, is that ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jason said.\u201dThough I\u2019ll have quite a bit of energy stored up by then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa laughed as she slid into a white robe. \u201cWell, with luck I\u2019ll be healed up enough to help you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pulled his clothes back on. His shirt was missing a few buttons so he just left the front open. \u201cIn the meantime I\u2019ll just let out all my sexual frustrations in my workouts. I\u2019ll be even bigger the next time you see me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can hardly wait.\u201d She gave him one last kiss then vanished across the hall to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason silently slipped downstairs then made his way back home. Once there he too showered then got dressed in some loose cotton shorts and a tank top then thought about what he wanted to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason drove into the heart of town and found the gym. Twenty minutes and several forms later Jason was a member and standing among the various weights and machines wondering where to start. Fortunately there weren\u2019t very many others in the gym with him so he wasn\u2019t too concerned about making a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had told Vanessa that he had studied everything he could find about bodybuilding and workout techniques. This was only a partial lie. The truth was that he had done a little research just to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be completely lost should he have to talk shop about gym life. The bare bones basics he had discovered regarding building muscle was to do a few sets of reps with really, really heavy weights to break your muscle fibers apart then eat enough protein so they got bigger when they repaired themselves. Of course he didn\u2019t really need to worry about that part as his body was going to grow no matter what. Still, he wanted to find out what really, really heavy weights were to him. For a moment he wondered if working out would change the way his body was growing but decided it wasn\u2019t likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason decided to start with his arms. There were free weights all along the wall by a huge mirror and he began picking up different ones looking for a challenge. He started in the middle where the 40 pound dumbbells were then quickly made his way to the end of the line where they topped out at 100 pounds but they all felt pretty light. Just to make sure he wasn\u2019t tricking himself he picked up a pair of the 100 pound dumbbells and began performing curls. He made it to 20 reps with each arm before he decided he wasn\u2019t going to get much resistance out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason decided he would have to try something a little more unconventional and made his way to the bench press. He loaded a bar with 200 pounds and instead of lying down he lifted it and did a few double bicep curls. Just as he suspected this was no trouble so he again began adding weight. More and more plates went onto each end of the bar but still Jason found no real trouble when performing his curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jason added enough that when he stepped back from the rack with the bar in hand that he felt some real strain. \u201cAH! Now we\u2019re talking.\u201d He gritted his teeth and brought the weight up to his chest. He then slowly lowered it before curling it again. He was breathing heavily after five reps but he kept going watching as his arms expanded and his veins sprouted to the surface of his skin. He pushed himself harder and found he was able to make it all the way up to ten. He was about to see if he could push himself to 15 when a voice behind him distracted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason re-racked the bar then turned to face the stranger. He was about to lecture them on how they shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone while they were lifting but when he got his eyes on the speaker he was struck dumb. The woman was a few inches shorter than Vanessa but her legs looked even longer and, to Jason\u2019s delight, they were covered in slabs of bulging muscle. She wore black spandex shorts that were skintight and a green sports bra over a modest bust supported by prominent pectorals. Her shoulders were broad and powerful looking arms hung at her sides. Her face was gorgeous even though she wore no makeup and her fiery red hair was pulled back in a ponytail. Jason\u2019s heart really began to throb when he caught her eyes, they were brilliantly green and radiated confidence and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... er... I\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Jason stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much weight is on there?\u201d The mystery woman asked pointing to the bar he\u2019d been curling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d he said truthfully trying to hide his smile. It looked like he had gotten his answer regarding his strength, he was officially \u201csurprisingly strong.\u201d Now he just needed to figure out what exactly that meant. Looking to the weights he realized that he had certainly lost track of what he\u2019d added. He did a quick count in his head but continued to play dumb waiting for his beautiful companion to say it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c860 pounds?!?\u201d She practically yelled, but her answer matched Jason\u2019s. \u201cThat can\u2019t be possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that good?\u201d Jason was beginning to form a cover story in his head since it was fairly obvious he was seconds away from needing one. \u201cThis is my first time in a gym, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now I know you\u2019re lying. Look at you, you obviously work out.\u201d Her eyes roamed over his body for a very long moment before she added, \u201cA lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re very nice to say that but it\u2019s true. I grew up on a farm and hard work is just a part of your everyday. I\u2019ve been lifting and moving heavy stuff since I was four years old. I guess a body just gets used to it. A week of work where I\u2019m from is probably worth at least a month of exercise in a place like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, I don\u2019t know how you could possibly curl that much. Don\u2019t quote me, but I\u2019m pretty sure that even half of that would still be a world record.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to contain his excitement, as it turned out he was practically superhuman. \u201cAw, it\u2019s heavy but not too bad. I could probably even handle a bit more. If you think that\u2019s something you should see my older brothers. I\u2019m sort of the runt of the litter, if you know what I mean: shortest, smallest, weakest, all that.\u201d Jason could see the woman\u2019s nipples hardening and poking through her sports bra; she was clearly turned on by the thought of a family of supermen. \u201cBut look at you, I\u2019ve never seen a woman with such big muscles. You must be really strong, I\u2019ll bet you could handle something like this.\u201d He pointed to the bar behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she blushed. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m pretty strong for my size, but you\u2019re in another league altogether. I wouldn\u2019t even believe a person could curl 860 pounds if I hadn\u2019t seen it with my own eyes.\u201d She stepped closer and even the small movements caused a symphony of movement amongst the various muscle groups in her legs, stomach, shoulders, and chest. \u201cYou know with your baseline strength as a starting point I\u2019ll bed you could really develop some awesome power if you were to start a training program. If you pushed yourself hard you might even surpass your brothers, maybe show the boys back home who\u2019s boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed, he really liked where this girl\u2019s head was. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot him a spine-melting smile and her eyes flashed. \u201cI have no idea, but I really want to see you try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hand out. \u201cI\u2019m Jason, by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Nicole, but everyone calls me Nikki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jason was about to ask Nikki for advice on starting a workout routine a very large bodybuilder joined them. The newcomer was shorter than Jason by nearly half a foot, an inch or two shorter than Nikki even, but his muscle mass was probably equal to Jason and Nikki\u2019s combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNikki!\u201d The big man spoke in booming tones, \u201cWhere the hell have you been, I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here. Jason, this is Luke, my boyfriend. Luke, this is Jason. He\u2019s freaking incredible! He\u2019s way stronger than anyone I\u2019ve ever heard of. Look at that bar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could tell that Luke was not in the mood to be impressed, least of all by a guy who, while decidedly muscular, was not even close to matching his own size. He glanced at the bar Nikki was point at but remained nonplussed, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a pretty good bench press for a guy your size, but I wouldn\u2019t-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki cut him off, \u201cHe didn\u2019t bench it, though. He curled it! For reps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Luke was angry. For a moment Jason was unsure about how he was going to react, it was clear that Luke wasn\u2019t used to being outclassed. Then Luke simply redirected his anger towards Nikki. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me!!\u201d C\u2019mon, we\u2019re way behind schedule and I don\u2019t have time for this shit.\u201d He grabbed Nikki by the arm and dragged her away. As they went Jason could hear Luke lecturing Nikki about talking to other men at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgeous redhead glanced back to give Jason an apologetic look. He just smiled and waved though inside he was fuming.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason did his best to refrain from getting involved in Nikki and Luke\u2019s relationship and instead focused on his own workout. Since he was already at the bench press he began adding weight and seeing how much his body could handle. He made it up to 1900 pounds before he began to really have to work. He knew he could have added quite a bit more but he didn\u2019t want to go too far and end up stuck under something no one else could help with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis means I could bench press more than a full ton,\u201d he said aloud to himself. \u201cThis is incredible!\u201d He glanced over to where Luke was working his legs and saw that Nikki wasn\u2019t even exercising. Instead she was taking pictures and video of her behemoth boyfriend. She looked back his way and smiled when their eyes met but then Luke snapped at her and she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason continued his way around the gym for another two hours and at every stop found that his muscles afforded him previously unheard of levels of strength. He would occasionally stop to watch Nikki but each time would get a nasty look from Luke. It didn\u2019t bother him if Luke didn\u2019t like him, he just didn\u2019t want the big bully to take it out on Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jason felt that the had accomplished enough. His body was feeling pretty good, it was even radiating a glowing heat from within and he was covered in a slick of sweat. After striking a few poses in the mirror he made his way to the locker room. He stripped and went into the shower room; for the first time in his life he didn\u2019t care who looked at his naked body. He actually felt pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he showered he drifted away as the hot water cascaded down over the hills and through the valleys of his swollen muscles. After a very long time Jason decided he\u2019d soaked his somewhat sore body enough and he left the shower, dried himself and returned to his locker. After he\u2019d collected his things and dressed in a clean t-shirt and shorts he turned and found Luke blocking his path. Luke\u2019s body was pumped to an extreme degree, his muscles looked like they wanted to erupt through his skin while his veins were so pronounced that Jason could take his pulse from five feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d the bodybuilder said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way you look at my girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded. His whole life he had run from bullies just like Luke, now he was finally strong enough to stand his ground. \u201cThat\u2019s ok, you don\u2019t need to like me. Just like I don\u2019t need to like the way you disrespect your girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke raised his right arm and flexed. His bicep swelled and hardened into a melon sized ball. \u201cSee this? This 23 inch arm says I can treat my girl however I want. I don\u2019t give a shit how strong she thinks you are. All I have to do is look at you, then I look at me...\u201d Now he raised his left arm and mirrored the right. The result was fairly intimidating and for a moment Jason had to think about what he was doing. He thought back to his time in the gym which bolstered his confidence as Luke finished his rehearsed line, \u201cI take one look at me and I don\u2019t have to think very hard about what I can do to you. That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to leave this place and never come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke lowered his arms but put his hands on his hips and flexed his chest. His tight tank top let out a few pops to let anyone know it was under too much stress. Jason had to admit, this man was enormous. He supposed it would be good for Luke to have to deal with a little humility for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d Jason said taking a step towards Luke, \u201cyou seem like a major asshole. But that\u2019s your right, I suppose. However, as big an asshole as you are you still don\u2019t get to decide if I work out here or not. And you really don\u2019t get to treat your girlfriend, a gorgeous woman who deserves so much better than an asshole like you, like trash without retribution. That\u2019s what I am, life\u2019s payback for you being an asshole. I am as strong as Nikki told you, and I am going to be here a lot getting even bigger and much, much stronger all the time. I know you\u2019re used to throwing your weight around, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jason launched at Luke catching the big man off guard and grabbing him by the throat. Jason lifted the shorter man off the ground and held him above his head with one hand while his captive struggled for air and tried to pull Jason\u2019s fingers open. When he couldn\u2019t break free Luke began beating on Jason\u2019s arm but he may as well have been slapping a steel pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like you weigh quite as much as you thought.\u201d Jason finished. He then raised his free hand and flexed his own smaller but still impressive bicep. \u201cMy arms may not be 23 inches around, but my puny little 16 inchers are worth a hundred of anything you\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason spun and slammed Luke into the wall causing the lockers to cave in around his body. Luke\u2019s face was turning purple and all the fight had gone out of him but Jason only pressed harder and soon the sound of groaning metal was met with the cracking drywall. Finally Jason let up on his grip enough to allow some air to reach Luke\u2019s lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Luke\u2019s face had returned to red he continued, \u201cI\u2019m going to let you go today because I know being the biggest and the strongest has gone to your head. You\u2019re an asshole, like I said, but maybe it\u2019s not entirely your fault. Now you know what I can do to you so i\u2019d better not hear about you giving anyone any trouble, least of all Nikki. If you hurt her, disrespect her, or even use harsh tones when speaking with her I will fold your car in half with you inside it. Am I clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke nodded and Jason could see complete fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now I don\u2019t want you to think you\u2019re being banished from this place. In fact I want you to come around often so you can watch my body grow so big your little 23 inch arms will look like twigs.\u201d Jason released Luke, gathered his bag, then left without looking back. If he had he would have seen a bodybuilder with urine running down his massive thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jason walked outside the gym into the open air he spotted Nikki standing off to the side leaning up against a tree. She still wore her super tight spandex shorts but had traded her sports bra for a halter top that was cut off at the bottom to show off her sculpted abs and also had a low scoop neckline to reveal the rounded tops of her breasts. Now that they were no longer bound by her sports bra Jason could see that Nikki\u2019s boobs were larger than he had originally thought. While they were not nearly as big as Vanessa\u2019s glorious DDs Nikki\u2019s breasts were full and luscious C cups. As before, though, it was Nikki\u2019s insane legs that drew the majority of his attention. Her thighs were pumped and cut and every little motion of her body caused the different muscles contained within them to swell and recede in symphonic motion. His penis sprung to life as he imagined himself with her legs wrapped around his head and him sucking on her luscious quads and licking her vagina with his super strong tongue until she screamed for him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nikki saw Jason she shot him another smile that weakened his knees and made her way over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, listen,\u201d she sounded a little nervous which bolstered Jason\u2019s confidence a little, \u201cI hate to sound forward but the fact is that I just dumped a giant douchebag, but that douchebag was my ride. Do you think you could drop me at my place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said leading her to his dumpy car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason drove while Nikki directed him back to where her apartment was. On the trip Jason was overcome with conflict; he wanted this woman and bad. He was certain, as well, that he could have her with little to no effort sensing that she wanted him also. However, every time his thoughts turned to doing horrible things to and with Nikki\u2019s incredible body he remembered Vanessa, the girl he\u2019d been wishing for for more than a decade and the girl he had finally formed a relationship with. He reminded himself that they had only been on a single date together, but he felt that they had formed a pretty close bond on that date. The he would glance back at Nikki\u2019s powerful physique and remind himself that he was still free to date around just as Vanessa was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is me,\u201d Nikki said pointing out a older duplex with faded paint. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause and Jason felt the need to say something. He spotted a surfboard leaning up agains the wall between the front door and the garage. \u201cDo you surf?\u201d he asked motioning to the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned. \u201cOh, yeah. Well, I used to. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been out on the water. I used to be quite the fish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must look amazing in a swimsuit.\u201d Jason said. In truth he had only meant to think the words, but his mouth shot them out before he knew what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki actually blushed. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m sure you do as well.\u201d Then she took a deep breath and looked like she was trying to build up her courage. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve never been this forward before. In fact I\u2019ve never really approached anyone this way, but I want to know.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I want to know, can I be your personal trainer?\" Nikki looked at the floor. Jason couldn't understand why such an amazing woman would be so smitten over something like this. She began nervously running a finger down one of the grooves in between her quad muscles. \"I've never had to approach anyone about this, everyone always comes to me, but I think I can turn you into a real beast. I basically turned Luke into what he is now, for better or for worse, and I'm sure I could build you into something the world would never forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason chuckled. This girls job was going to be easy since he was already destined to pack on over 150 more pounds of muscle regardless of his workout routine. In fact it almost seemed like too much work to go through to adhere to a fitness regimen when he could just relax on the beach and let the muscle roll in. The more Jason thought about it, though, the more he liked the idea of being with Nikki as much as possible. The chance to spend time with her was impossible to resist and he'd be able to live up to his promise to Luke to constantly be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason nodded, \"Well, sure. I suppose you can train me. Do you really think I can get all big and muscley like your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki laughed. She had certainly relaxed now that Jason had agreed to be her pupil. \"I guarantee it. In fact, this time next year you'll be bursting at the seams. You'll need an all new wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason knew his transformation would occur much, much faster but he did his best to look amazed and surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki leaned across and planted a quick kiss on Jason's cheek then hopped out of the car. She leaned back in through the open window giving Jason a perfect view down her shirt where her breasts practically spilled out. Her green eyes flashed. \"Be at the gym at ten tomorrow morning. And be ready to be sore when we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned and walked to her front door. As she went Jason watched her legs and butt while his erection tented his shorts. Nikki gave Jason a quick wave goodbye and vanished inside her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was filled with giddy excitement as he drove home; a feeling he was becoming very familiar with recently. So far over the past two days he had lost his virginity to his dream girl, landed another smoking hot woman as his personal trainer, scared the living hell out of a musclebound bully, and discovered he was superhumanly strong. Life couldn't possibly be any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived home Jason stopped his car on the street instead of pulling into the driveway. There was another test he wanted to conduct. He got out of his car and stood behind the trunk. He didn't know how much his car weighed but he could curl nearly half a ton with his arms alone, shouldn't he be able to do this too? He looked up and down the street to make sure he was alone then squatted down to grip the undercarriage of his car. He made sure his back was straight and his feet were firmly planted and began to lift. His arms swelled and his chest expanded as the tires slowly lifted off the ground. He stood up straight holding the back end of his car a good three feet off the ground. It was a challenge but he could manage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a half grimace half smile Jason began slowly dragging his car up the driveway with his back to his house. Step by step he went up the slight incline performing a feat of strength that he had, heretofore, only ever believed possible in comic books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so startled by the voice that he dropped the car with a loud crunch. He spun to find his best friend with a look of shock on her face. His stomach sank, he should have shared his secret with her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... hi, Laura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you.. that's not.. how? How?\" Her eyes were getting glassy. Jason knew she'd be feeling betrayed, as though the one person she could rely on to be a weak and ugly outcast like herself was now special and she was all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason watched Laura's face go bright red and scrunched into a visage of pure anger. She stormed over to where he stood with her fists balled and began beating on his chest. At first Jason tried to block her shots but then realized they didn't hurt and instead tried to calm her by putting his hands on her shoulders. Laura only became more angry by this and the fact that her blows were doing nothing but hurting her own hands. She offered him one last slap to his face that reported loud enough to echo once off the buildings lining the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't pleased with taking such abuse, but he also knew he had messed up by waiting to say anything. Laura could be a bit mopey and obsessive about her appearance which annoyed Jason, but she was still his best friend. When Laura turned to leave with tears in her eyes Jason called out the first thing he could think of that would keep her from leaving and make her feel better. \"You might be able to change too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped dead and slowly turned back to Jason. She still looked angry but also interested. \"Don't you lie to me. If you're messing with my emotions I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No lie,\" Jason said holding up his hands. \"But I'm not sure. That's why I never said anything. If you couldn't change too I knew that would be devastating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pulled in a deep breath and sighed. \"Ok, I'll listen. What the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason told her the whole story going back to fining her phone and the changes he'd made. He even mentioned his date with Vanessa which he expected to kind of hurt Laura's feelings but he figured full disclosure was best; though he left out their wild sexual escapade for obvious reasons. He finished with his Herculean feats of strength and the defeat of the huge bully from that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's face remained solemn and stoic through his entire story. At the end Jason told her he was afraid that she might have deleted the app that had done this for him. At which point Laura said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I've... I've still got it!! I forgot all about it, actually. It really works?\" The upset Laura from moments before was long gone, replaced by one who looked like she was on top of the world. The fact that he had kept the secret of the app from her completely overridden by the fact that she could now have the body of her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should say so,\" Jason said flexing his superhuman 16 inch bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura let out a giggle that was composed of both excitement and alarm. She whipped out her cell phone and launched the Alterations app squealing when she was greeted with her 3D avatar. \"Oh my god, what should I do first? There are so many possibilities. I can be anyone, I can be a superhero or a sex goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed, he'd never seen his friend so happy. \"Whatever you decide to do just be careful. I only held the thing for a few seconds and put myself on a path to become the biggest and strongest man the world has ever seen. Make sure you know what the settings mean, you don't want any bad surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was furiously tapping and sliding her fingers around the screen refusing to look away. \"Oh don't worry, I'm going to do this right.\" She began walking away, her eyes still glued to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home, I've got a lot of research to do and decisions to make.\" Now she actually turned and looked at Jason with a cold stare. \"And don't think I've forgotten that you kept this from me for a month and half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's heart sank. He suddenly pictured himself shrinking back down to his original, puny body and became very afraid. At the same time he couldn't be too angry with Laura, he'd hurt her feelings and betrayed the trust of his best friend. \"I understand. I'm sorry.\" He hung his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's expression softened and Jason could see her anger diffuse. For a moment it looked like she was trying to stay angry but failing. \"Oh forget it! Look, just take care of Vanessa. She's had a crush on you for a long time. And I know she'd be devastated if I took your muscles away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you knew she liked me and you never said anything? Talk about keeping secrets from your best friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not the same! Don't even pretend it is.\" Laura shot back. She spoke loudly but Jason could tell by her smile that he'd got her and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe each of their lies of omission were not on the same level, maybe. But Laura had held her secret a hell of a lot longer and in Jason's mind that more than made up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, big boy! Look for the new me soon.\" Laura winked then hurried home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening Jason wondered what Laura would do to herself. Would she change everything all at once? Would she alter herself slowly? Would he even recognize her? He fell asleep imagining Laura arm wrestling her brother into submission without breaking a sweat while fondling her newly acquired beach ball sized boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning Jason wandered into the gym at a quarter to 10. He was greeted very quickly by Nikki who was beaming and looking even sexier than he remembered. She must have been working out earlier in the morning because her skin was slightly moist with sweat and her muscles looked pretty pumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love a man whose punctual.\" Nikki said then slapped Jason on the shoulder. Then she winced and shook her hand. \"Goddamnit! What do you have in there, rocks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason laughed. This was not the first time someone had asked that question, Vanessa had wondered the same thing. \"No ma'am,\" he said remembering his farm boy character. \"Just good ol' corn fed muscles. Built from hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, are you ready for a different kind of hard work? Oh, and I almost forgot. Here,\" she handed him a sheet of paper with a grid on it that was divided into sections for each hour of the day. Many of the squares were populated with large quantities of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Jason asked, though he already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your new diet. Not much corn feed in here, just lots and lots of protein. This is what will make your body grow by leaps and bounds. You need to eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason studied the chart for a few moments then looked at Nikki. \"Um, just wondering. Is it ok if I add to this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you want to eat more? This is a 5,000 calorie diet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just mean if I get hungry is it ok to snack between these meals? It seems like a bit of a step down from what I ate on the farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shook her head. \"You're gonna kill me, Country Stud. Sure, if you're hungry feel free to eat as much as you want. We're bulking here, the more you eat the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled. \"Great. Where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this.\" Nikki handed Jason a very large protein shake. \"Drink it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason did as instructed and sucked the thick fluid down in two big draws. Then Nikki led him to their first station where they spent a good while stretching and warming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair spent over 6 hours moving around the gym and working out. They would have been done in a shorter amount of time, but Nikki had to recalibrate every exercise to meet Jason's titanic strength. Every step of the way she couldn't believe what his body was capable of but in the end she just had to roll with it. Still, when she got him set up for a bench press of 2100 pounds and he made it through not 1 but 3 sets of 10 her jaw nearly hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're impossible,\" she told him as they were finishing up. \"There is literally no one in the world like you, and if I can get any sort of results out of you you'll be a god. Legit god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason played shy. \"Heck, if you can just get me to be strong enough to keep my big brother from putting me in headlocks and throwing me around the barn I'll be plenty happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, how big is your broth- you know what, don't tell me. I can hardly wrap my brain around you much less someone strong enough to bully you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged. \"I thought I was a weakling, then you tell me I'm not. Maybe it's all relative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stared at Jason for a moment then spoke almost wistfully. \"I went surfing for the first time in a long time last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason remembered the old board he'd seen at her place. He smiled to know that she'd pulled it out of retirement. \"Oh yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really rusty. But it was so much fun. Not much good surf but just being back out in the water was amazing. I hadn't had any free nights since Luke. Now with him out of the picture I could do something for me and it was wonderful. I just wanted to thank you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sent Jason off with another huge protein shake and orders to find lots of meat and chow down. Jason was surprised to find that, true to her word, Nikki had worked him sore. Just about every muscle in his body below his neck was throbbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it home and had a huge dinner. He had no intentions of following Nikki's diet, he'd get muscle regardless, but he was so hungry he couldn't help himself. After stuffing his face with piles of food he dragged his body up the stairs to his room and collapsed on the bed. It was only 7:30 but he was ready to just sleep until November.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's phone rang jerking him awake. He wasn't sure how long he'd been asleep or if he really even had passed out but he stood up to find his phone. It was Vanessa calling. They couldn't talk terribly long since Vanessa was still at her grandmother's house, but she just wanted to say hello. Vanessa mentioned that she and Laura were talking all afternoon about how Vanessa and Jason had finally hooked up. Vanessa said that she hadn't seen her sister so happy or just bonded with her so much in a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled happy in the knowledge that the wall that had kept Laura from her sister had been removed. He was also glad to find out that Laura had not yet physically transformed herself in any drastic way since Vanessa surely would have said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa apologized that she had to cut their conversation short but she had to get back to the family. Before saying her goodbyes she whispered, \"I can't wait to nibble on your rock hard muscles or feel you so deep inside me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's penis became a steel rod at her words. He responded by telling her how badly he wanted to suck her tits until she screamed. \"You are the sexiest woman I have ever known and I will spend every moment with you making sure you feel nothing but pure ecstasy.\" As soon as the said it it felt like the corniest thing he could have possibly said. It must have gone over okay, though, because Vanessa just moaned quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey said their goodbyes and Jason flipped on his TV. He spent a few hours flipping channels looking for something to watch while the entire time he could feel his muscles still throbbing and even itching. For the second time he wondered if him working out was going to change his muscular development. This was the last thought on his mind as he drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason rolled out of bed the following morning before 6:00 shocked at how awake he felt. In the past he wouldn't have been caught dead waking up before 9:00, and that was only on rare occasions. Before beginning his growth Jason typically slept in until noon but since he was so full of energy that he was sleeping less and less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had for the past few weeks he got up and went straight to the scale near his dresser. His weight was displayed as 227 pounds. Jason frowned. He looked in his journal and saw that yesterday he'd weighed 212 pounds. He'd been gaining between 1 and 2 pounds a day pretty consistently but now he had jumped by 15 pounds overnight. He looked at his reflection in the mirror and tried to decide if his body was visibly larger. Hitting a double bicep pose and flexing his legs Jason decided that he did look bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dang, looks like working out really does make me grown even faster. How long should I keep this up?\" He was a bit concerned about how this could affect his goal body, he was already turning into a beast would he even be able to move when he was done growing if he kept working out. Jason hit a few more poses and decided that he liked his expanding physique too much to quit so fast, but that he would probably only meet with Nikki a few more times before cutting ties with her and \"moving back to the farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's body cried out for food but he didn't think there was quite enough left in the fridge to satisfy him. Instead he got dressed and jogged down the beach to the local pancake house where he ordered enough food for 5 people and scarfed it all down. He sheepishly ordered an extra pair of meals which the busty, 30-something waitress brought him and then asked if she could feel his muscles. Jason obliged with great pride offering his flexed arms for her examination and he grinned when he saw her nipples poke through her stressed top after running her fingers over his super hard biceps. When she spotted that he had noticed he shot her a wink that made her blush. When the check was delivered Jason noticed that the waitress, her name was Sarah, had scrawled her phone number across the top. Jason paid his bill and made sure his exit route took him past where Sarah was clearing a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for this,\" he said holding up her number, \"but I'm afraid to say I'm spoken for. If I weren't though, I'd take you home and...\" He leaned forward and whispered into her ear. Sarah dropped the dishes she held with a loud clatter and threw her hands to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" she said as Jason left the diner without looking back. He was feeling quite the stud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Jason met Nikki for their second session. If she'd noticed that he had swelled a bit she didn't say anything. She did, however, notice that Jason was stronger already. Their workout was shorter, around 4 hours, and much more focused on his arms, chest and shoulders and each lift that Jason did was well beyond what he had been able to do the day before. His bench press alone had increased by 200 pounds while his double arm curls went from 900 pounds to over 1,000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like yesterday Jason was amazed at how quickly Nikki adapted to Jason's strength and was able to push him to crazy extremes leaving him beaten and sore by the end of their time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the gym and made a stop at the market to load a cart full of ground beef, steaks and chicken breasts. These he brought home and started cooking. He kept waiting for his parents or his twin sister, Jasmine, to ask him what he was doing or where he giant muscles had come from but it was almost like they were ignoring his changes. That was okay, he'd grow so much they'd have to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night was one where Vanessa was working and they were unable to talk but they did send a few text messages back and forth. As the evening wore on their messages got more and more explicit until suddenly Jason received a picture from Vanessa of her tightly packed cleavage in her opened shirt. Later she sent him another one where she'd lifted her short skirt to show off her skimpy black thong panties from behind with both of her perfect plump butt cheeks proudly displayed. Jason responded by sending a picture of his fully erect penis which he then put to use by masturbating to the pictures Vanessa already sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair finished off by telling each other how much they looked forward to seeing each other on Thursday after which Jason fell into a very deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days followed a very similar pattern, and each morning Jason found he'd grown by about 15 pounds. The day after his upper body workout all the extra weight had gone only into his arms and chest and Nikki definitely noticed his increased size this time. By the time Thursday rolled around Jason was 50 pounds heavier than the last time Vanessa had seen him and he looked every bit the bodybuilder. He was a 260 pound behemoth who would have been larger than Greg's 240 pound body if his muscles weren't so dense, but he was catching up quickly. Jason now sported a pair of 19 inch guns with a 53 inch chest and thighs that were each nearing 30 inches. Every measurement was only a few inches behind Greg's and Jason assumed that he would surpass Laura's brother within a few days. But even more than his size it was his strength that continued to really explode. The way things were going he wouldn't have to leave Nikki she would drop him when it became impossible to find weights in the gym that would stress his superhuman muscles. As it was he was squatting 2 and a half tons with little trouble and bench pressing just shy of 3,000 pounds. He felt invincible and was becoming addicted to the power that was constantly growing within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday finally arrived and Jason spent most of the morning pacing around anxiously awaiting Vanessa's arrival. He'd told Nikki not to expect him at the gym today and she'd gladly agreed. She said that rest days were vital to the growth process but Jason also suspected that she needed a day away from her impossible client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after noon the doorbell rang and Jason nearly leapt down the entire flight of stairs from the second to the first floor he was moving so fast. When he opened the door he saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason didn't even really notice what was different about Vanessa right away. He was far too busy basking in her amazement over how he himself had changed. The moment he opened the door her jaw dropped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!!\" She rushed forward and put her hands on his arms squeezing his bulging arms which he flexed to their full 19 inches for her. \"It's only been a few days, how are you this big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been working with a personal trainer. My techniques combined with hers got my body really growing.\" Jason said. As her hands moved to his chest he flexed his pecs for her then wrapped his beefy arms around her pulling her close to him and holding her tight. \"At this rate I'll outgrow your brother in less than a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa stood on her toes so she could kiss Jason deeply. He responded by lifting her off of her feet and carrying her to the couch in the living room where he deposited her before sitting next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand how this is even possible. You're growing faster than any man in history. I'm not complaining about the muscles, but I just need to know that you're not doing anything.... unsavory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked into Vanessa's eyes. \"I promise you it's all natural. I will submit to any sort of drug test any time you want. No warning, no questions asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Jason looked down and noticed what was different. Vanessa wore a pink halter top that framed her gorgeous breasts wonderfully. The top was so tight he could easily make out the outline of her bra underneath as well as the fact that her boobs were spilling out over the top of each cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of bigger...,\" Jason began but he never finished his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa turned beet red. \"I know, I know. I'm retaining water like crazy and it's all in my tits. This is my loosest bra and it still looks like I've got four boobs the way they're spilling out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason frowned. \"I don't think you're retaining water, I think they're growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boobs aren't like muscles. They shouldn't be getting any bigger unless my body fat content goes way up, and I'm actually leaner now than I've been in years.\" To prove her point she lifted the bottom of her shirt to show off her tight washboard tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, there's lots I don't know about breasts, but I'm pretty sure I've read about women going through a sort of second puberty in their late teens or early twenties. It's rare but it happens. You may want to consider getting some new bras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see. In the meantime I apologize if I look like I don't know how to dress myself.\" She did her best to adjust her boobs but they only spilled out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's sexy,\" Jason said. \"It's like they're too massive to be contained.\" He tugged the neck of her top down a little to reveal tightly packed cleavage. Then he used both hands to squeeze the sides of her breasts and make them explode out of the top of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa giggled. \"They're all yours, baby. I'm glad you like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like every inch of you.\" Jason said. His penis was pressing hard against his shorts begging to come out and play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jason was about to rip Vanessa's top off and have his way with her she told him that she had shared with Laura about how much she enjoyed watching Blade Runner and the girls spent their time at their grandmother's home discussing more nerdy things that Vanessa might like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said something about Firefly? She wasn't sure if I'd like it, but she said the main guy was pretty hunky.\" Vanessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was a bit sad that he'd have to wait to ravage Vanessa's expanded boobs but he was very excited that he got to share even more geeky stuff with his new girlfriend. So he turned on the TV and put on an episode of Firefly while snuggling up to Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad to have the assist from Laura in keeping Vanessa exploring his interests. He'd have to thank her the next time he saw her. Jason began to wonder what Laura had been doing with the app, if anything. It seemed that she was really taking her time in changing things for herself. That's when he glanced down and saw Vanessa's breasts again, he was certain that she was bigger and not just retaining water. Of course! It must have been Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding Vanessa tight with his right arm Jason pulled his cell phone out and discreetly sent a text message to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Did you make your sister's boobs bigger?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura responded back almost right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura: <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Yep! I'm growing them slowly. In a few weeks she'll have a pair of JJ cups. How do they look so far?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Bigger for sure, but she's still wearing an old bra so it makes them look huge as they spill out. Why are you pumping her up?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura: <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Lol! A gift to her for always being nice to me, even when I was a brat and was angry that I didn't look as good as she does. She's a good sister and deserves good things. Oh! That reminds me, you know she loves huge muscles on her guys, but there's something else that she loves to be huge as well. Here's another gift for her that you get to benefit from...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to send another message asking what she was talking about when he felt a furnace in his shorts. His penis was on fire and surging to an intense erection. Just like earlier his shorts were tented and very tight but when he reached his usual 10 inch erection his cock didn't stop swelling. Jason's overtaxed shorts groaned and snapped as his huge cock grew bigger and longer. The sounds were enough to catch Vanessa's attention and she looked down just in time to see his dick tear through his cotton shorts and stand at attention. The fire began to fade from Jason's crotch  and he was left with a foot long member that was almost twice as thick as it had been previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could see a mix of confusion and lust in Vanessa's eyes. She wrapped her hand around the giant shaft that protruded through the hole in his shorts and squeezed hard finding no give in his steel cock.</span></div></div>",

I like him a lot.\" she purred seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself stir in his pants at the thought of Vanessa, the hottest girl he knew throwing herself at him like this.  But he just had to know about the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he giggled a little despite himself.  \"I mean what did you think about the movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that.  It was ok I guess.  Not really my style, but the actor was kind of cute for being back in the fifties or whenever that was made.  He was in Anchorman 2, right?  I think I recognized him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa, that was Harrison Ford!  Han Solo?  Indiana Jones?  Oh come on, you've never heard of Indiana Jones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down, nerd-boy.  The name is familiar, but I don't think I've ever seen the movie.  Like I said, these really aren't my style.  Maybe for our next date?\"  she stretched up a little and kissed his earlobe lightly, sending a shiver of desire up his spine.  He wanted her so badly, she was just so hot and so sexy but, how could she not like 'Blade Runner'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went on to get a coffee after the movie.  He brought their order back to their table while she checked facebook on her phone.  She didn't put it away when he got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, I think Sally is sleeping with Kent!\"  She leaned in and turned the phone towards him showing him pictures of two people he didn't know, but also tipping far enough forward to give him a delightful view of her breasts down her low-cut top.  He shrugged, tried not to stare, and tried to start a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what kind of movies do you like then?\" he asked, genuinely interested in learning a little more about the woman behind the body he'd been lusting over since he hit puberty.  She was just so smoking hot, he was having a hard time concentrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I dunno.  Like light, funny ones.  Grownups 2 was pretty funny, did you see that?  David Spade is hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just sighed and shook his head, and she quickly returned to looking at her phone.  After a few minutes she turned it back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, how would these shoes look on me?  Black or red?\"  He looked at the $500 pair of heels a little bewildered.  He was sure they'd look good on her, but couldn't really picture them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you know, I have a birthday coming up,\" she hinted without a trace of shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt kept on like that for a long time. He'd try to start a conversation about the ethical implications of creating artificial people like int he movie, and she'd reply with something she'd read at TMZ.  Then go on and on about how pink was out this season and how hard that was on her because she looked amazing in pink.  And it finally hit him, he couldn't stand her!  She was vain, shallow, entitled, boring, and didn't have an intellectually curious bone in her body.  He wanted to see her naked more than anything he'd ever wanted before in his life, but if he had to listen to her for five more minutes he was going to have to kill himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was so hot!  It wasn't fair, why was it that a girl like Laura who he had so much in common with couldn't look more like her sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second.  Why couldn't she?  In the world he was used to it couldn't happen, but with the magic iphone app, anything could happen?  He didn't have to put up with a girl's vacuous personality because she had a hot body.  He could give Laura a body ten times hotter than her sister's!  Even better!  He had always loved muscular women, his ultimate fantasies were huge, powerful women who could dominate him.  As hot as Vanessa was, even with her tight, athletic legs, she didn't completely push that button.  But with a few taps of the magical iphone app he could create his ultimate fantasy woman!  He just needed to download the app for his own phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took Vanessa home, and she must have felt his lack of enthusiasm towards her, as she didn't invite him in.  He rushed home to open the app store, looking for Laura's app.  It wasn't there.  There was no trace of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, they must have taken it down.  He did some research about the app.  There was a whole discussion about it on reddit, and he read the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app was infamous on reddit.  Apparently it had gone up in the itunes store for only a few minutes before the company pulled it.  The next day the offices of the company that made it burned to the ground, and no one knew where the creators were.  There were sixteen confirmed instances of the app out in the world.  Laura's phone wasn't on that list.  Each was a limited trial version that could only alter three profiles before it locked the user out with a message to check back soon for the full version of the app.  A few redditors had tried to reverse engineer the software, to unlock the full version, or copy the app, but no one had had any success.  The app developed a reputation for being cursed though, as the hackers who were closest to cracking it all seemed to meet with unfortunately accidents just as they started to have some success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce word got out what it could do, a phone with the app installed and portfolios left was suddenly worth billions of dollars.  Warren Buffet bought one, and suddenly looked like a twenty year old god who could have started at linebacker for the University of Nebraska.  They had a quote from him saying that even if it cost all of his fortune to purchase the app, it would have been worth it.  A few other hedge fund billionaires were known to have purchased phones as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't good.  Jason would never be able to get a phone with the app on it.  If he wanted to create his fantasy woman, he needed to get Laura's phone and hope she hadn't used the three portfolios up yet.  The question was, how to get it?</span></div></div>",

She had been hoping to have Jason to herself for the day and things had started out that way but then he suggested they see what Laura was up to. The whole morning had been perfect, just her and her crush strolling along the sand talking about anything and everything. Too bad Jason was too oblivious to just how crazy Samantha was for him. Too bad Samantha was too shy to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open and Greg and Vanessa popped out. Samantha jumped aside as Laura's siblings barreled past her. At a mere 4 feet 10 inches tall the Asian girl was dwarfed by the statuesque pair and would have been knocked on her butt if not for her quick dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam,\" Vanessa said hardly looking back, \"Laura's upstairs, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg paid her even less attention than Vanessa but Samantha couldn't take her eyes off the muscled man. She wondered what it would be like to have a muscular giant like that for a boyfriend. Sighing she further wondered what it would be like to have a boyfriend at all. She had dropped hints to Jason time and time again that perhaps he should workout, she'd even offered to help him but he only ever mumbled something about being a nerd and it being too hard. In spite of his reluctance she continued to drop hints and every night her dreams were filled with muscular versions of Jason holding her tightly in his big, powerful arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha climbed the stairs to Laura's room but didn't find her friend there. \"She couldn't have gone far,\" she said to herself, \"her phone is still here. She never goes anywhere without it.\" Samantha was going to seek out her friend when she noticed the screen of Laura's phone displayed a 3D model of Greg's body. She picked up the phone and looked closer. The model was crazy detailed; the avatar was even wearing the same trunks and tank top she'd just seen the real Greg in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha tapped the back button and was greeted with a new model, this time one of Laura and she was completely naked. She looked over the various sliders that surrounded the model and began making adjustments. She found she was able to increase Laura's height and even added enough muscle so that she no longer looked like a stick figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing?\" Samantha zoomed in on Laura's chest and found a slider that could increase her bust size. She expanded Laura's boobs until they were equal in size to Vanessa's DDs. \"Heh, wouldn't Laura love to have a body like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha noticed a button labeled \"Apply Changes\" and was about to tap it when a thought occurred to her. Could this app really make these changes real? It sounded impossible but if Laura and Greg were in the phone maybe Jason was too. Samantha looked out Laura's window to the burger shack on the beach a hundred or so yards away. She saw her crush waiting for her to return. Could she give him muscles that would put Greg's to shame? Could she give herself a body that would drive Jason mad with lust? Maybe she should keep experimenting with Laura's profile before making any other changes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha looked back at the phone with the new and improved Laura on it. She realized that the body she'd programmed was almost on par with Vanessa's killer figure. As it stood Laura would be slightly shorter and not quite as muscular but just as busty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're going to experiment maybe we should push things just a little bit farther. We'll see how that bimbo likes being second best.\" Vanessa had never been mean to Samantha but Samantha was spiteful all the same. Things came so easy for girls like that. Having to live with her own short and pudgy body had put something of a chip on her shoulder, one that she and Laura shared. Now she could try giving her best friend an edge in life and if that worked she could do the same for Jason and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha set to work crafting a body for Laura that was unrivaled. Instead of increasing her overall height Samantha instead just increased the length of her legs until she was 6' 2\" just like her brother. Then she added more muscle onto her frame until she looked like a fitness model with plump thighs, a tight 6 pack, broad shoulders and strong arms. Lastly she returned to Laura's breasts and pumped them up even further until the slider listed them as H cups. Samantha found another slider that increased the firmness of Laura's giant new assets so that they sat high and proud on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked over her handiwork. \"Wherever you are, Laura, I hope this works for you.\" She tapped the \"Apply Changes\" button and waited while the phone compiled the alterations. Suddenly there was a blinding flash of light and Samantha dropped the phone while she shielded her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower Laura blinked for a moment. Something seemed to be wrong with the lights, for a moment it was very bright but now things were back to normal. She just hoped whatever that power surge was didn't happen again; the last thing she needed was for the lightbulb to burn out while she was in the shower. There was no other light source in the bathroom and cleaning herself in pitch darkness wasn't an appealing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how would I see my incredible body?\" she asked aloud. Laura giggled then returned to soaping her body, flexing her hard muscles while she rubbed the suds all over herself. This was the only time she really allowed herself to be completely narcissistic and appreciate the body she now possessed. She'd spent so many years as the ugly duckling that she felt she deserved to be proud. At 16 years old she'd decided she no longer wanted to be a tall and skinny rail and had taken up weightlifting just like her brother. Her body reacted well and she found adding muscle came somewhat naturally. Once she built herself into a thick powerhouse she slowed down and worked out simply to maintain the sexy, fitness model curves she'd created. She'd been somewhat disappointed that she had only seemed to pick up her brother's muscle building genetics and not her sister's breast growing ones but decided that beggars couldn't be choosers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat changed a little less than a year ago when Laura had discovered a massage technique on the internet that \"guaranteed\" to increase the size of her breasts. Typically Laura would immediately recognize this sort of scam for the bullshit that it was but in quite moments of solitude she decided to give the absurd a try. Within weeks she had gone from having nonexistent assets to perky little B cup boobies. Two months later she was into a C cup bra. Just shy of six months after beginning the massages Laura's breasts outgrew her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in the shower with steaming water turning her skin pink, Laura grasped her H cup melons in her hands and roughly began massaging them just as she had been doing for the last ten months. Laura knew very well that it was much more likely that she was, as everyone pointed out, simply a late bloomer and that the massages had nothing at all to do with her incredible growth. But she couldn't shake the coincidence of the timing as well as the fact that she had far outgrown her mother and her sister. If it really was the massages doing all the work then she had no intention of stopping for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha waited several long seconds before removing her hands from her face. She looked around and found the world still existed, but something felt strange. She glanced out the window and spotted Jason still sitting there waiting. He caught sight of her and waved. She grinned and waved back then turned her attention to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, things were definitely a bit different. There were fewer anime posters on the walls and Samantha spotted a stack of fashion magazine in the corner where a stack of DVDs used to sit. A shelf that was once reserved exclusively for various comic book figurines and other nerdy trinkets was still there but now there was also a host of jewelry scattered among the collectables that Samantha had never seen before. She then spotted a dresser with a mirror that was also new and gasped when she caught sight of her own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" She rushed forward and examined herself. She was no longer wearing the modest coverings she always did to hide her portly frame and instead was clad in torn denim shorts and a dark blue bikini top. She was still the same height but the fat had been completely melted from her body replaced with fair amounts of muscle. She ran her hands over her washboard stomach and gave her arm a hard flex showing off baseball sized biceps. \"What is going on? I didn't change myself. Not that I'm complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha turned her body watching the deeply etched lines of her abs and obliques stretch with her. She puffed up her chest grinning at the tightness of the bikini top. She still didn't have any boobs to speak of, but she loved her figure just the same. She leaned forward to take in her lower half and was blown away again. Her legs were even more developed than her upper body. Thick, juicy thighs bulged out of her tiny shorts; their short length only made them seem thicker and stronger. Samantha twisted around and stood on her toes watching her calves pop extra wide when compared to her slender ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible but I just don't get it. What happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked over the dozen or so pictures that were taped around the frame of the mirror and found her answer. The pictures showed Laura posing with various people, some that Samantha recognized and some she didn't but what she did recognize was the Laura that she had programmed: the tall, buff and busty version. One image in particular caught Samantha's attention since it featured her standing next to her amazonian friend. Laura positively dwarfed Samantha by nearly a foot and a half. The girls were pictured standing in a gym flexing for the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The phone, it doesn't just change a person it changes the past. Since I gave Laura muscles it changed things so that she's been working out. And since we're best friends I've been working out with her!\" Samantha celebrated by squeezing out a crap flex into the mirror and relishing the sense of power and tightness in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her breath she scooped Laura's phone off the floor. \"What else can you do?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha body was flooded with adrenaline; the phone in her hand had altered history so that Laura was a busty hardbody and she herself was covered in sexy slabs of muscle. She wanted to make more changes, create an even better life for herself and her friends but she also didn't want Laura to find her playing with the phone. What if she got angry? She shouldn't, right? She now had the body of her dreams; she'd be happy. But what if she had her own plans for the phone, what if she didn't want anyone else messing with it? What if she changed Samantha back into the little ball of flab she'd been just a few minutes ago. Samantha was already too used to the feeling of strength in her body, she didn't ever want to give that up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she needed to figure out where Laura was. Samantha poked her head out into the hallway and looked one way then the other. She was just about to enter the hall when she heard the faint sound of the shower running in the bathroom across the way. She nodded; she probably had a least a few minutes to play with. She ducked back into Laura's bedroom and began tapping on the phone in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Jason's image filled the screen and Samantha grinned. The image before her was dressed in baggy denim pants and a Halo t-shirt exactly like the Jason that sat on a bench outside the window; at first Samantha was confused since Laura's avatar had been nude but then she remembered that Laura was in the shower and therefore would have been naked. No matter, it was time to get to work and build the Jason of her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisions of Greg's huge body filled her mind as she placed her finger on the muscle slider and began moving it to the right. Instantly the image of Jason's tall and lanky body was flooded with powerful slabs of sinew. The image adjusted and Jason's shirt vanished while his pants turned into swimming trunks. He looked quite the hunk already but Samantha wasn't satisfied yet. She poured more size into his frame pushing his physique beyond that of Laura's beefy brother, then beyond any of the bodybuilders that frequented the beach around their house, then beyond anyone who had ever lived. Jason's outfit altered again and the swimming trunks were replaced with a skimpy red Speedo. Samantha continued to slowly build Jason's body bigger and bigger looking for the moment that she felt his size was satisfactory. She still wasn't ready to stop when she noticed that Jason's new body would weigh in at 580 pounds. Without even thinking she lifted her finger off the screen. Had she gone too far? Perhaps, but she had no plans to make Jason any smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's crotch was burning with desire to see this Hulk sized Jason in the flesh but there were a few more things to attend to first. \"It looks like there's one very important muscle that didn't grow along with the others,\" she said to the virtual Jason. She zoomed in on his crotch and was surprised to find that he was already pretty well endowed and could sport a nearly 10 inch erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good for mere mortals, but we're making you into a god, aren't we?\" Samantha increased the size of Jason's cock until it was a full foot long when soft and 20 inches long when hard, she then expanded his balls pumping them up to the size of oranges. Jason's outfit changed again and his Speedo turned into a pair of black Spandex shorts. This new garment was enough to keep his insane unit covered but did nothing to disguise the outline of his cock or balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZooming back out to view Jason's body as a whole Samantha opened a sub-menu of the muscle control slider and was greeted with several more sliders with names like \"Muscle Density,\" \"Flex Effectiveness,\" \"Growth Ability,\" \"Loss Rate,\" and more. She didn't understand what any of these meant and was about to investigate when she heard the shower shut off. Laura would be back any second. Samantha quickly played with each of the sliders moving them randomly up and down but didn't see any changes to the model of Jason no matter what she did. She was about to put each slider back where it had started when she heard the bathroom door open. In a panic she tapped the \"Apply Changes\" button and tossed the phone across the room onto Laura's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the bedroom door opened and Laura, the new and improved one, came in with a towel wrapped around her enormous bosom. \"Hey, Sam. When did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was about to say \"just now\" when a thought occurred to her. With the history change it was clear that Laura had no memory of their old life, if she had she wouldn't be no calm about her new body. Samantha could remember the way things were before, though. So why was that? Either because she was the one who made the changes or because she was the one holding the phone when history had been rewritten. Now that the phone was out of her hand would she lose herself to the impending revision?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later the room was filled with a blinding flash.</span></div></div>",

A few seconds passed then she heard Laura giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, you afraid of seeing me naked?\" Laura asked. \"I don't think anyone on the planet has seen me nude more than you. Except for me, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha uncovered her face and looked around. The world was still there, Laura still had more curves than a mountain road, Samantha was still rocking a hardbody, but most importantly: she still had her memories, she was still herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's with the sudden modesty?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha tried to get her thoughts together quickly. \"Oh! Uh.. nothing really. I just thought you wanted some privacy, is all. I mean... you didn't really know I was here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devilish grin took over Laura's face as she dropped the towel from around her revealing Samantha's handiwork in all it's glory. Laura's glistening body looked even more spectacular than the 3D model on the phone could hope to convey. Soft flesh surrounded hard muscle at every turn and the incredible melon sized breasts Laura now possessed seemed to defy gravity. \"How's this for privacy?\" Laura took 2 steps toward Samantha then grabbed the shorter girl by the back of the head driving Samantha's face into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha fought to escape (more from the fact that she was suffocating than a lack of enjoyment) but Laura's strength matched her own and the extreme height difference made Samantha feel like she was being smothered by a hairless Sasquatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finally released Samantha from her bosom and while Samantha caught her breath she returned to her dresser. \"So, I assume you're here so we can hit the beach and strut our stuff.\" She opened a drawer filled to overflowing with underwear, lingerie and swimsuits. She poked through and began pulling out several skimpy bikinis. \"I hope you weren't waiting very long for me, I can get kind of lost in the shower sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no, I wasn't waiting all that long. Jason and I just came over to see what you were up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura glanced back over her shoulder. \"Jason? Who's that? A new boy toy? Does your current hunk of a boyfriend know?\" She slipped into a red bikini that hid next to nothing from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much to deal with in Laura's last comment that Samantha didn't know what to say. Finally she settled upon, \"He's no one, just a kid that lives near me\u2026 uh, follows me around sometimes.\" She glanced outside and discovered that Jason was, in fact, no where to be found. Had she changed him so much he no longer existed? Or was his life so radically different that they didn't know each other anymore. She sighed realizing that as good as things were now she may have also really messed them up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was clear to Samantha that things had changed more than she'd intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't so much the fact that she had turned him into a 580 pound monster, although that did have a great effect on Jason's new life, it was the additional sliders that Samantha had randomly adjusted in a panic that forced Jason's past in such a radically different direction. It wasn't enough to simply make him adept at weightlifting or bodybuilding, instead his entire family tree had to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the reality that Samantha knew Jason's parents were smart, his father, Tom, was a pharmaceutical technician and his mother, Carrie, was a school teacher. In this new reality his mother was a world class bodybuilder from a line of gifted athletes and his father was a genetic scientist obsessed with perfecting the human body. He'd fallen in love with Carrie because of her good looks and giant muscles and then used his vast knowledge of steroids and growth hormones to take her already huge body and turn her into the biggest female bodybuilder in the world. The chemical cocktails he fed her disqualified her from competition but she didn't care and instead became caught up in Tom's fantasy only wanting to see just how big she could get. She started a premium website selling photos and videos of herself and became an overnight internet legend and multimillionaire. At the same time Tom was able to make a fortune of his own selling various muscle building concoctions on the black market. He even became his own best customer and with Carrie as his trainer turned himself into a 6 foot tall, 300 pound bodybuilder. Tom and Carrie opened a new adult section of her website devoted to high quality nudes of their enormous bodies as well as videos of the two of them having sex. The traffic on their site exploded and through a few smart investments they became billionaires within a year of getting into porn. Shortly thereafter Carrie and Tom moved further north up the beach to a cliff-side mansion complete with an on property gym and video production studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carrie became pregnant Tom saw it as the perfect opportunity to test his latest experiment: a new form of gene manipulation he'd been working on for years. The procedure was a success leading to Jason being born 3 months premature yet still weighing over 14 pounds, nearly double the average full term baby weight. A single glance was all it took to see that all the extra weight was due to his bulging muscles and even as a baby Jason was built like a bodybuilder. His enhanced strength allowed him to learn to walk at 4 months old. By the time his first birthday rolled around he could perform pullups with a 20 pound weight tied to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom decided very early on that due to the nature of his experiments he should keep Jason a secret from the outside world, at least until he had time to fully research the effects of his gene manipulation. As a further control measure he kept Jason from weightlifting or working out in the family gym just to see what his body did naturally. This actually worked out fine for Jason who preferred the more sedentary life of video games, comic books and movies. Growing up he would frequently show off his stupendous strength and incredible size, but it would be a far stretch to say that he every really exercised. He didn't even mind that he was never allowed to leave the compound since the grounds were so large and he was supplied with anything he could ever want. They even had their own private section of beach that was naturally walled off from the outside world by sheer cliffs on either side. When he got tired of sitting around the house he would spend an afternoon on the beach or in the pool that sat in the middle of a huge garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was never lonely since he played several online video games and made lots of friends that he never met from all around the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was homeschooled by his mother and excelled at his lessons having inherited his father's intelligence. He was able to complete his middle school curriculum at 9 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while his hormonal makeup made it so he continued to build muscle on top of muscle. Jason was nearly always hungry and no matter what he ate or did his body turned that food into muscle. By the time his 10th birthday rolled around Jason was 5' 5\" and 225 pounds and rock hard without a hint of fat to be found. A few weeks later Jason's body entered puberty and his already out of control hormones rocketed into hyper drive. Because of the gene therapy puberty only took 4 months and completely changed the way Jason looked. His body was changing nearly daily: his face becoming broader, his chin wider, chest and pubic hair grew in like weeds, his penis and testicles swelled, and all the while he grew taller and more muscular. Six months after turning 10 Jason was looking like a man and standing just over 6 feet tall with a physique that weighed in at 340 pounds. Growing so rapidly had been somewhat painful for Jason since his body was stretching out by more than an inch every month and packing on 30 pounds in the same amount of time, but Jason reveled in the pain. Everyday he felt bigger and more powerful, he felt like he could take down the superheroes he loved reading about. Jason would spend hours before a mirror flexing his massive muscles, feeling them, ripping through clothes like The Incredible Hulk, and playing with his enormous cock. His hyperactive puberty had been kind to his penis as well making it 20 inches long and hard as a steel rod which made him feel more like a god than even his muscles could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt age 13 Jason's muscle growth slowed to a halt once he hit 380 pounds. He was a bit sad that he wouldn't be getting any bigger but considering he was a teenager with 32 inch biceps, 49 inch thighs, and strength that bordered on superhuman he tried not to feel too down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his teenaged mind turned to girls in such a way that he began masturbating pretty regularly. He confessed to his father that his sex drive was getting out of control when he spent nearly 2 straight days jacking off in a blind frenzy. Not entirely sure of what to do Tom lifted the ban on working out in the hopes that the physical exertion would curb Jason's libido and give him an outlet for his raging hormones. The plan had limited success but by the time Jason turned 14 it was becoming clear that a different solution would have to be found. Over the course of that year Jason had been able to pump another 100 pounds of muscle onto his body meaning he now tipped the scale at 480 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that only the real thing could satisfy his son Tom began working on expanding the maid staff for the house hiring young, attractive women then offering them a promotion of sorts. Instead of focusing on housework their only job would be to see that Jason's sexual needs were taken care of. He did his best to avoid words like prostitute when describing the job duties and after a few months of being slapped in the face and having to threaten to sue for breach of the nondisclosure agreement all his employees signed he was able to put together a group of 10 very attractive ladies to be a part of Jason's harem (another word he took care not to speak aloud).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow 15 years old and presented with his father's gift Jason greatly reduced his time in the gym and instead focused on his girls. His father reestablished the ban on weightlifting but Jason had developed a taste for his growth and snuck in a routine from time to time to keep his giant muscles growing. It wasn't hard either, a few workouts a month kept his enormous body swelling steadily bigger. By his 16th birthday he was a 530 pound god with inhuman strength who was worshiped by his ladies. They came in all shapes and sizes: short, tall, athletic, slender, voluptuous, buff and different combinations thereof. He loved them all and they were fiercely loyal to him quickly growing accustomed to life with their muscle teen. On an average day he'd work his way through each one at least twice (though often he'd have up to three at a time) and he very quickly learned their individual tastes and how best to pleasure each. It didn't take long for his new friends to really love their new job and since they had everything the could want on top of the most amazing sex all the time they all found themselves thinking of their life as a fantasy come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day that Samantha stood in Laura's bedroom trying to figure out where Jason had gone he was 15 miles north sitting poolside with 3 beautiful girls pawing at his 580 pound body while another pair of girls swam and splashed together. The remaining 5 members of Jason's harem slept in his giant bedroom, exhausted from activities that Jason had put them through that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha knew her crush was out there enjoying the body she'd given him and she wanted to find out where he ended up. She just wasn't sure where to start.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura's comment that Samantha had a boyfriend hadn't been lost on the Asian hardbody, she was just lost in thought over what could have happened to Jason. Samantha feared that she may have pushed his transformation too far, what if he was some sort of freak that had spent his life in a cage being experimented on? What if his growth over the years had put too much strain on his heart and he was now dead? What if he was still alive out there but she simply never got to see him again? No matter the answer Samantha knew that she had to get Laura's magic phone back at some point to find the answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was these thoughts that were swirling around in her head when Laura said, \"You know I'm pretty sure that Eric and Alan should be finishing up their routines about now. We should head on down and check out their hard work.\" It took Samantha a long time to put together that one of those names was likely the supposed boyfriend that Laura had mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" Samantha turned from the window to face Laura who had dressed in a skimpy white bikini that was held together using the thinest of straps. Between Laura's ample curves and her swollen muscles it looked like just breathing too deeply would cause a wardrobe malfunction. The top did very little to hide Laura's perfect H cup breasts, but of course that was the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just lose the shorts and we can get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Samantha's natural reaction to keep her body hidden kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shorts,\" Laura said giving Samantha a stern look,\" they're hiding your perfect ass. You're not leaving here until you take them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Samantha remembered what she looked like now and felt a lot better about stripping down, she just hoped she was wearing something appropriate beneath her cut offs. She undid the fly slowly and breathed a quiet sigh of relief when she spotted some dark blue bikini bottoms that matched her top. She let the shorts drop to the floor and stepped out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it,\" Laura said with a warm smile. \"You worked hard for that body, you need to show it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha twisted to the side and took a look at her reflection in the mirror. She noticed two things: first, she was wearing a thong; second, Laura was right she had an incredible ass. Her behind was big, round, firm and just perfect in every way. She ran her hand over her tight glutes and though she was initially concerned about the revealing thong bikini she was now excited to show off her amazing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girl, let's go.\" Laura slid an arm around Samantha's shoulders and guided her out into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's mind was swirling in a dozen directions at once. She was overjoyed with the attention she and Laura were getting as they walked across the sand. Heads turned everywhere and though Samantha knew that a vast majority of the looks were aimed at her amazonic friend she knew she was getting a handful of the attention herself. This joy, however was overshadowed by thoughts of Jason and her need to figure out if she'd ruined his life or not. Then, occasionally, she'd remember that they were going to see a couple of guys named Eric and Alan. Who were they? Was one of them her boyfriend? This thought terrified her the most since she had no idea who this person could be, what if she had to be alone or even intimate with this stranger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was a somewhat familiar name. One of Laura's brother's friends was named Eric. He was a bodybuilder that Laura had a crush on so it stood to reason that in this reality the two could be a couple.But who was Alan? The only Alan Samantha could think of was a portly Japanese kid that she'd spoken to once or twice in high school. He was nice enough, she supposed, but Jason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice walk across the beach Laura led them to the outdoor gym that was cordoned off right on the sand. This was typically the sort of place that only the biggest and baddest bodybuilders hung out. Samantha and Laura would frequently drool over the buff hunks that hung out there but always from afar, now they stood right up against the railing getting a good look at all the beef on display. To her surprise several of the men actually greeted Laura and Samantha by first name, they were actually known among this group!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Samantha noticed something strange about the bodybuilders in attendance: across the board they were enormous. Usually only the largest guys looked like they could compete professionally but now every single guy not only looked like they could be Mr. Olympia they were bigger than any Mr. Olympia in history, and by a fair margin. Looking around Samantha decided that even the smallest guy she could find was easily 250 pounds and ripped to shreds. The average looked to be 300 pounds with the bigger guys probably around 350. What she didn't realize was this increase in size was directly related to the changes she'd made. Tom Sullivan's supplements and drugs had flooded the underground scene and changed the entire bodybuilding industry. Men and women all over the world were bigger and stronger than they'd ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lulu!\" The voice was familiar and Samantha turned to find Greg approaching. \"And Sam, it's good to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greg that Samantha knew was a muscular 225 pounds but this guy was something else all together. Giant tree trunk thighs as big around as her chest were wrapped in lycra pants and pumped as he walked towards them his quads seemingly devouring his knees, his pecs protruded out beyond his chin and were stuffed into a shirt that was intentionally too small and already small holes were appearing along the seams, and his arms were among the biggest Samantha had ever seen and they weren't even flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura lit up at Greg's arrival. \"Hey! Lookin' swole, big bro. Whatcha working on today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg grinned. \"Today is arms day. What do you think?\" He raised a pumped up arm and flexed. His bicep hardened into a 26 inch mass caught in a net of pulsing veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Samantha said instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Sam!\" Greg said with a laugh. \"I'm pretty sure your boy is just about done with his last set. There he is over there with Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha turned her attention to where Greg was pointing and saw Eric standing at the bench press spotting someone. Her breath caught in her throat: Eric was even bigger than Greg! As she watched as the man laying on the bench took the weight bar, loaded with an obscene number of plates, off of the rack. Slowly it descended then rose again. She couldn't see the person Eric was spotting but she could tell his chest and arms were massive. This must be the mysterious Alan. Over and over again the bar lowered then rose until the giant's shaky arms nearly gave out. Eric put his hands on Alan's elbows and spoke some words of encouragement which must have worked because the bar, once stalled, rose one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big man racked the bar and sat up. Yep, the face was that of the Alan that Samantha remembered from school but just like Eric this guy somehow carried more muscle than the titanic Greg. It didn't hurt that both men were shorter than Greg which made their awesome mass look even bigger stuffed onto a smaller frame. The pair spotted Laura and Samantha and came over. They both climbed over the railing and stood on the sand with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so nice to see you,\" Laura said to Eric's pecs as the monster of a man wrapped his arms around her waist pulling his lady close. It wasn't easy to do since Laura was a good 7 inches taller than Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My eyes are up here,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made my choice,\" Laura joked pawing at his pumped chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was watching this exchange so she was surprised when Alan approached her from behind and grabbed her ass firmly with both hands. She jumped and made to step away but an instant later she found herself wrapped up in a pair of the most powerful arms she'd ever felt. Then Alan's mouth was at her ear giving her lobe a little tickle with his tongue. She'd never had anyone do this before and a wave of pleasure radiated out as she discovered that this was something that she loved. She tilted her head towards his mouth hoping to goad him further but he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going, baby?\" Alan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm good. How are you?\" Samantha realized that Alan was only about 5' 5\" which was nice since she herself was so short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good.\" Then Alan's voice dropped to a whisper: \"I just started a new cycle so not only am I crazy pumped I'm super horny.\" He pressed his crotch against her butt and she could feel a sizable bulge. \"Maybe you could help me out with that problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was conflicted. On the one had this guy was practically a stranger but at the same time she was getting turned on. Then again they were a couple, right? She should play along and perhaps she would find the grove of their relationship. But then she remembered Jason and Laura's phone. She couldn't just leave without making an attempt to fix things. But was it wrong to have a little fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral miles up the beach on his hidden compound Jason still sat pool side while Heather, a 5' 7\" blonde hardbody, knelt at his feet between his enormous legs. She had just removed his shorts and was gripping his big fat cock. She gave it a few slow pumps and watched as it transformed into a 20 inch long steel rod. She grinned at the huge pole and began ferociously devouring it, bitting, sucking, slapping, stroking, and pumping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted with satisfaction then turned to Alex, a petite girl with big round breasts and wide hips, who was rubbing oil on his shoulders and back. He picked her up off the ground with complete ease and lay back in his big padded chair. He set Alex down atop his own face and began using his powerful tongue to pleasure her. Within seconds he had her at orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more unseen girls began pawing at his beefy body and all Jason could think was: <i>This is the life.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha didn't know what to do. On the one hand Alan was practically a stranger to her, it didn't feel entirely right to just run off and have sex with him. At the same time she was feeling incredibly turned on by the thick muscles that enveloped her. She glanced down at one arm that wrapped across her chest, the hand gripping her shoulder. The bicep of Alan's arm was as thick as her head and he wasn't even flexing. She rested her hand on the giant bulge just to see how it felt. Heat radiated out through his skin which was soft and slightly damp with sweat. Just beneath the thin layer of skin she could feel the solid mass of sinew which was trembling with power. Sensing the probe of her fingers Alan responded by gently tightening his grip on her shoulder causing his bicep to harden and swell slightly. Samantha felt goosebumps cascade down her arms and back and she practically melted into his embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan responded by grinding his crotch against her backside again, this time she could feel his stiffening member poking into her muscled rear. She realized then that Jason would have to wait, her lust was taking over and she was going to let Alan have his way with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was saying something to Alan which pulled Samantha back to reality, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a hell of a lot of weight on there. What's your bench up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifteen,\" Alan said. \"Though I've got nothing on your man, he was pushing 21 earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was confused for a moment. Laura had asked about the weight not their reps. Then it hit her: \"Fifteen hundred pounds?!?\" She broke out of Alan's embrace and turned to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan laughed. \"Yeah, why? You sound shocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that she was betraying herself, was she already supposed to know that? \"It's just a lot of weight, is all. I, uh, love hearing about what your body can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan grinned. \"You know very well my body can do a lot more than that.\" Then he made his pecs bounce one at a time then together. They looked like they were trying to leap out of the top of his tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she say to that? What would the hardbody knockout version of herself do in any given situation. Whatever she wanted, Samantha supposed. So she reached out and squeezed Alan's chest. \"Well, you'll need to tell me everything,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Eric laughed together. \"You guys are so adorable when you're horny.\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose you're hungry?\" Eric said. \"I've got to get some fuel into me to keep this body growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan kept his eyes on Samantha. \"I think we'll catch up with you in a little bit. Sound good?\" This second part was a question for Samantha and she grinned and nodded. It sounded very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha glanced back at Laura as if to offer up some explanation for her behavior but she could tell by the look in her friend's eyes that it wasn't necessary. In fact, the way Laura was nuzzling up to Eric she might look to convince him to skip lunch for the time being as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha and Alan said their goodbyes and began walking across the sand away from the ocean. Samantha didn't know where exactly they were headed so she stayed a half a step or so behind her apparent boyfriend letting him guide her. This also afforded her a chance to further take in the majesty of his body. His short stature really amplified his bulk, and his shoulders were so broad it almost looked like he was wider than he was tall. Samantha knew that wasn't the case but the illusion was there. Her favorite thing, though, was his legs. His quads and glutes were so big and juicy that she just wanted to sink her teeth into his thighs and never let go. She felt a shiver of excited glee go through her body as she watched his leg muscles jiggle and harden with every step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the sand ended Alan reached back and put his arm around Samantha's waist, pulling her forward from her vantage point. She was a bit bummed to not have her view of Alan's legs anymore but the feel of being wrapped in his strong embrace again was a good consolation prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed herself to be led about three blocks inland to a small apartment complex. Alan took her to a small studio apartment that looked quite unsuitable for someone with such a large body to live in. Nevertheless the place was actually pretty well maintained and neat, the only mess being a small pile of clothes on the floor near the bed (which was just a large mattress on the floor) and a large black satchel on the table by the kitchen that was open to reveal several syringes and surrounded by about 3 dozen little bottles of a yellowish fluid. Alan went straight to this and began packing up the little bottles into the satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was starting a new cycle,\" he told her. Samantha hadn't understood what the term had meant on the beach but now with the context of the items in his hands she did: steroids. Was she supposed to be angry? Clearly he had done them in the past and he offered the information freely on the beach so she supposed not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you start?\" she asked. She didn't know what she would do with this information but if felt like she needed to be a part of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day before yesterday.\" Alan said. He zipped the satchel closed and put it into a cupboard in the kitchen. \"You can probably tell based on what I have that I'm looking at a long run this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. How long?\" It seemed like a good question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan paused then said, \"Twenty weeks.\" Based on his reluctance to answer she guessed this was outside the norm. \"I can always ramp down early if I need to. I just got such incredible gains last time I wanted to go longer and see what I could do. I mean, I grew almost fifty pounds in twelve weeks last time. Can you imagine what I'll look like six months from now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan made sure to help her with the mental image by pulling his tank top off over his head. He puffed out his chest and tensed his arms. At the same time he flexed his legs which caused the bottom of his shorts to slide up his bulging quads and bunch up near his waist. Samantha felt her breath leave her for a moment at the sight of this pumped up hunk. <i>Her</i> pumped up hunk. Quick math told her that if he saw similar growth during this round of drugs he could add another 80 pounds to his body. Was that really possible? She was sure it wasn't, wouldn't he hit a wall before that? Still, seeing how incredibly big all the guys in this reality were she guess that maybe he really could get that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that he had won her over Alan smiled and began walking slowly to where Samantha stood. \"I have to say, I had forgotten just how potent this stuff was too. I already feel so much harder and stronger.\" He stretched this last word out into something like a growl while he began squeezing his own chest. \"And you remember that little\u2026 side effect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she didn't but nodded anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's working already, I'm sure of it. I know it's only been two days but I'm sure my cock has grown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steroids make your dick bigger?\" Samantha blurted out by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan gave her a strange look. \"Yeah, remember last time around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, uh, sure. It just still blows my mind that your um\u2026 you know, gets bigger along with the rest of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan laughed. \"Yeah, crazy. They say the guy who developed this stuff is a total scientific genius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be.\" It occurred to Samantha that it was possible these drugs were the reason everyone was so big now, could that have been something she caused by changing Jason?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Do you want to take some measurements?\" Alan winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get the tape measure, you get the book.\" Alan turned and leapt across the room towards a tiny closet near the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha turned in a circle lost for what she was looking for. Then Alan's voice floated out of the closet, \"I think I saw it on the shelf by the TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the shelf in question, a skinny one set in the corner of the small room. She examined the contents and found a binder labeled \"Growth Journal.\" Since they were taking measurements this was the most logical item to take. Samantha brought the binder to the kitchen table and opened it. Each page showed a drawing of a body with various lines to fill in numbers. Each page also had a photograph of Alan attached. Flipping back to the beginning she spotted an image of the portly kid she remembered. If the dates were correct he had grown from pudgy to massive in a little less than two years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan handed over a tape measure. \"Where did you want to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smiled and bit her lower lip as she glanced down at Alan's legs. He laughed and shook his head, \"My thighs really are your favorite, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha knelt at his feet and unrolled the tape measure. She decided to start with his calves and Alan obliged by turning around and pressing his toes into the floor. Samantha hungrily grabbed the gorgeous muscle in both hands marveling over how far it protruded off the back of his leg. After giving the muscle a few hard squeezes and finding it to be hard as stone she wrapped the tape measure around and called out the result: \"Twenty four inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan turned back to face Samantha and she ran her hands up his leg beyond his knee to where his monstrous quads bloomed out in all directions. She grabbed great handfuls of sinew moving the slabs of meat around until Alan flexed his thigh and it transformed into unmovable steel between her fingers. Samantha launched herself at his leg and began gnawing on the massive muscles but she may as well have been trying to bite a slab of marble and her teeth slid across the hard surface finding no purchase. She planted a few final kisses before grunting with sighing and returning to measuring Alan's obscene dimensions. She actually had difficulty reaching back to wrap the tape around his leg but eventually got it all the way and announced the result: \"Oh! Thirty eight inches. Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha stood and turned her back to Alan and bent over the table to record her findings in the growth journal. Suddenly she felt Alan's hands on her hips gripping her tightly. He pressed his crotch against her behind and she could feel that he was sporting a rock hard erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" she asked then playfully wiggled her butt side to side grinding against his cock. \"I thought we were taking measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided I don't want to wait any more.\" Alan slid his hands up her back massaging her flesh as he went. Then Samantha felt her bikini top come untied and fall loosely off her shoulders and down her arms. Then his strong hands worked their way back down to her hips and on to her thighs. He leaned down so that his chest was close to her back and slid his hands all the way down to her calves. She encouraged him by going up on her toes and flexing her muscles for him as he had for her. He grunted his approval and began kissing and sucking on her back while he squeezed her shapely calves. He was careful not to use too much of his staggering strength but gave a good hard squeeze nonetheless. Then he slowly moved his hands back up to her thighs and began rubbing her well developed quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha flexed these muscles too and said, \"Looks like you feel the same way about my legs as I feel about yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan gave a soft chuckle then moved one hand up the front of her thighs while moving the other around her behind. Next he grasped her bikini bottom in both hands and pulled them apart. The thin strings snapped easily and a moment later Samantha felt Alan's powerful fingers rubbing her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth to comment on the destroyed thong but at the same moment Alan's fat finger plunged into her and connected with a very sensitive spot and all that came out was a gasp and a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill he seemed to sense what she was going to say. \"I'll buy you a new one,\" he spoke gruffly. Then he stepped back for a moment and Samantha could hear the sound of fabric ripping apart. A black rag that used to be Alan's shorts landed on the table in front of her and he grunted as if to say <i>There, we're even now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alan pressed his body back up against hers again she could feel his monster cock slip between her thighs. She couldn't believe how hot it felt and how strong. It felt like Alan could have lifted her right off the floor using only his penis if he wanted; she decided she had to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about,\" she said between panting breaths, \"we measure one last thing?\" She turned around to face Alan before he could refuse. Then she dropped back down to her knees and came face to face with the biggest penis she'd ever seen in her life. Truthfully it was the only penis she'd ever seen in person, but she had watched her fair share of porn and Alan was clearly bigger than any of the guys she'd seen in those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha quickly unrolled the tape measure and ran it along the top of his shaft. \"Eleven and a half inches.\" She stood and turned back to the growth journal. \"The last time we measured was four days ago and you were,\" she scanned the page, \"eleven inches. So, you're right. Your\u2026 ah\u2026 well <i>you</i> have grown half an inch in two days. Pretty exciting, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back around to face Alan again and noticed that he looked strange. His entire body was tensed, flexed so hard the striations of his muscle fibers rose to the surface and poked through his thin skin. His breathing was erratic and his eyes were dark and distant as if he were looking through her. He raised his hands and put them on her shoulders, his motions were slow like he was holding back and keeping himself contained. Without a word he turned Samantha back to the table and bent her over it. His strength was so far beyond hers that resistance was out of the question. Suddenly his hands were back on her hips and the head of his penis was pressing against her sex. He pressed harder and harder, pulling her towards him slowly but irrevocably towards him. Finally the pressure was enough that his cock, as fat as her wrist and hard as a steel pipe, slid into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha let out a scream of surprise and ecstasy. Alan continued to pull her towards him at the same slow pace until she absolutely could not take any more of him into her. Then he drew his massive cock back out just as slowly making her feel every inch until the head was just about to pop out at which point he plunged back in a bit more quickly. Out again, then in picking up speed. Alan slowly cranked up his rhythm little by little and all the while Samantha pressed against the table screaming and begging for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched her arms out and hugged the table, her hands gripped the edges so tightly she was sure she'd break a chunk off between her fingers. It was at this point that she realized that her feet were no longer touching the floor. She wasn't sure when Alan had lifted her up, likely right as he entered her, but his strong hands held her up at the perfect angle for his thrusts to land with precision. An orgasm, the first of her life not attained through masturbation, exploded within her. She was writhing on the table while Alan continued to pound away inside her fast as a jackhammer now not slowing a bit. As one orgasm would end another would fire then another until they were overlapping with each other and Samantha could only give in to the unending pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha didn't know how long Alan had been going but after an eternity he began to grunt and his rhythm became a bit more irregular. A moment later he roared out loud enough to rattle the windows of his tiny studio apartment and Samantha felt a bomb go off inside her. Heat filled her vagina then poured down her leg and she understood that Alan was coming, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoaked in sweat Samantha collapsed and the world began to grow hazy. A moment later she was flying, hovering in the air on her back. It took several seconds for her to realize that Alan was carrying her. He gently set her down on his bed and she promptly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how long she slept but the sun was down and the room was dark when Samantha awoke. She rolled out of bed and stretched working the soreness out of her crotch. She smiled thinking of the pain amazed at how good it actually felt. Her romp with Alan was the single most incredible experience of her life so far and she was already hungry for more. She put her hand to her vagina and rubbed it gingerly remembering how incredible it felt to have Alan inside her, so big and so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of her reverie she searched around the room until she found a light switch. She turned the light on and found the apartment empty, Alan was gone. She frowned. Not really sure how to proceed she stepped into the shower to rinse the layers of dried sweat from her body. As the hot water rolled down her skin Samantha thought about what to do next. She could either remain where she was and wait for Alan to return. He probably wouldn't be gone long and she could always try to get more information out of him; she could also see about enticing him into another round of love making. On the other hand Samantha kind of wanted to go back to Laura's house. She'd left her own phone there when Laura had made her take her shorts off and she still wanted to get Laura's phone too. Of course Samantha would have to find some clothes to wear before leaving, perhaps she'd left some of her own things at Alan's before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she shut off the shower and was drying off she knew what she was going to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha pulled up her own profile on the app, watching her newly buff body spin slowly on the screen in perfect 3D. \"If I can do this much good for myself by accident, let's see how much I can accomplish on purpose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with changes similar to the ones she made with Laura, but slightly moreso. She increased her height to 6'4\", with much of the height coming from her exceptionally long legs. Her breasts went from non-existent to massive JJ cup, with the same enhanced firmness and perkiness that she'd given to Laura making them almost too good to be real, while still undeniably natural. Her muscle tone was already impressive from her last change, but she still upped it a little more, going from fitness model to fitness goddess. She widened her hips to match up with her broad shoulders and narrowed her already thin waist, giving herself a balanced hourglass figure that would still put any pornstar to shame. She made a few subtle changes to her facial structure, going for a smaller nose, higher cheekbones, full lips, and so on, but avoided anything more out of fear of accidentally turning herself into a plastic surgery nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that the 3D model was every inch the knockout she'd always dreamed of being, Samantha turned her attention to the other sliders below the ones that seemed to govern appearance. She found one labelled as Strength Multiplier, currently set at x1, and moved the slider up to x5, wondering if that would make her five times as strong as she appeared. She was tempted to go even higher, but decided to hold off for now, in case she could accidentally make herself so strong that she'd break her own bones when flexing, or something. She raised Cardiovascular Health and Disease Resistance to maximum, and raised the Intelligence slider from Average to Super-Genius. She increased her reflexes and coordination to superhuman levels, and made herself much more resistant to physical harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to go back and alter the strength modifier to be even higher (maybe 50x, to start), before she remembered that Laura might come out of the shower at any moment. Not wanting to lose the changes she'd already made, she clicked Apply, and braced herself for the white light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, and consciousness returned, Samantha felt...powerful. Looking around, she wondered why the entire room had shrunk, before realizing that this was just the result of her new perspective being over a foot and a half taller. She looked down at her body to see if she could actually be as strong as she felt, but her vision was blocked by two giant breasts, pressed together by a sports bra to form the most incredible cleavage she'd ever seen. She began running her hands over her new body, feeling the steel-hard muscles in her abdomen and limbs, the soft, firm curves of her hips and breasts. Underneath it all she felt a core of impossible power, a massive strength dwarfing even what her considerable physique would suggest, the power to crush stone and bend steel with her bare hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, she could also feel her mind expanding, making connections she'd never before imagined. Problems that had seemed difficult before now felt trivial, and she felt a new thirst for knowledge rise up in her, a desire to know and understand more and more.  Her memories seemed to snap into crystal clear focus as her brain improved, and she realized that there seemed to be new memories alongside the old ones. Was she developing memories from this new reality? She hadn't gained any new knowledge from the last change, but then again, she hadn't directly changed herself last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning through the new memories, she discovered something unexpected. It seems that she'd enhanced herself so much that normal genetics could no longer plausibly explain her current state, and so the app had rewritten reality to create a new explanation. </span></div></div>",

So she pulled up his profile and found that his model was wearing a black shirt with khakis. She found the height slider and slid it up to 6'4\". She wanted a giant boyfriend bigger than Greg, so Jason would have to be taller than him. She noticed that the clothes on the model looked a little small now. Samantha then moved the muscle slider, slowly increasing it while watching the model Jason get buffer. Soon the shirt on the model gave way to his growing pecs, and when the listed weight was more than 300 lbs., his khakis tore off too, and the model only had green boxers on. Samantha giggled at the sight of her crush being in so little, and admired his body, from the six-pack abs to the bulging biceps. Then she realized she could do more. She made him grow until he was 355 lbs., and then she decided to change something else. She found the slider for cock size, and increased it to 12 inches long erect, 8 inches flaccid. The model then gained a huge bulge, and tears were starting to form on the boxers. Samantha decided that, if she could, she would make him love her. Soon enough, she found a \"Love Interest\" tab, and she put her name in. She then went and hit the \"Apply\" button when a message showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWARNING<br>\r\nYou have not picked your temporal settings yet.

Another message popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaving changes...<br>\r\nNote: only Jason will remember life before the change. You will not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha just ignored the message and looked at the model. The model's green boxers had morphed into a green speedo. Samantha laughed as she thought of the real Jason wearing that. Then her head started to hurt. She noticed certain memories were missing. Her mind started to cloud with amnesia. Then she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke to find herself on Laura's bed.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I was here to ask Laura about Jason!\" said Samantha, remembering her 'new' life.

He noticed that his muscles had started to grow bigger. He grunted as the fabric of his clothes started to rip. He ran over to his mirror and saw that he was growing taller, and soon his shirt and pants ripped off, leaving him in nothing but... a speedo? Jason wondered what was going on, and soon he felt his member grow bigger as well. Soon the growth was complete, and he passed out. When he woke up, he noticed he was in his home - or rather, somewhere that looked eerily similar to his home. The furniture was much bigger, there were bodybuilding trophies and weights all around, and he had less nerdy stuff. It was as if his life had changed, like he had had that body his whole life! Then he noticed a picture on his desk. It was of him and Samantha. Wow, did she actually like him? Then he realized that he now had feelings for her. Wondering what was going on, Jason decided to head over to Samantha's place.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sammy Mercer sat his in truck and watched as the muscle head and his drop dead sexy sister left their house and started walking toward the beach together. Sammy had been watching their house for several days now to get a sense of their patterns and knew that both mom and dad left early while the bodybuilder kid and the chick with the perfect tits tended to leave around noon to sunbathe for a few hours before returning. As far as he could tell those four were the only ones who lived there and he never saw anyone else coming or going so he knew that once the kids were out of sight he would have the house, and anything in it, all to himself for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy watched the musclebound twenty-something with a surprising degree of envy. The kid was build, there was no question. Sammy was no small man, at 6 foot 6 and 320 pounds he was something of a monster, but so much of his bulk was less muscle than it used to be and Sammy was not as strong as he had been years ago. As he observed the kid's muscles Sammy thought back to his glory days in high school when he was in peak form. He had been a dominating defensive lineman who picked up the nickname \"The Semi\" after mowing down countless opponents. Sammy \"The Semi\" Mercer had never had a body like the bodybuilder across the street, cut and bulging, but he had been quite the juggernaut and could have probably bowled right over that kid. Even now he imagined he was tough enough to take him on, but wasn't entirely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention to the girl, and what a girl at that! While he'd been casing the house he constantly enjoyed the glimpses he would catch of her. Sammy had seen so few women like her in his life and imagined her perfect tits wrapped around his dick and her ass bouncing on his lap. There were so many things he wanted to do to her and just thinking about them was getting him hard. Sammy had his own girl back at his place, Kylee, and she was a looker in her own right in her day. The trouble was that in the last few years Kayla had put on too many extra pounds in the wrong places and was looking less like the girl Sammy used to show off on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy did what he could to stifle his erection and focus on the job at hand. He'd been bouncing from neighborhood to neighborhood over the past several months looking for families that seemed rich but were dumb enough not to invest in security systems. Now that this one was sitting pretty he hopped out of his truck with a huge duffle bag and made his way to the front door. A fast pick job had the door swinging wide open and he entered quickly stuffing anything of value into his black bag. He went straight upstairs and into the parents room. He grinned when he found a large jewelry box that looked stuffed to overflowing sitting right next to a laptop computer. Sammy made his way down the hall to a room he guessed to he the girls. Sammy scooped up an iPhone that was laying on the her bed and slipped it into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard a sound come from the bathroom across the hall. There was someone else here! Someone he hadn't seen in all his days on his steak-out. Without a moments hesitation Sammy walked out of the room and down the stairs exiting the house and pulling the door closed. He returned to his truck, fired up the engine and sped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy sat on his back porch with a bottle of whiskey in his hand. He had turned his bag of loot over to Kylee who acted as his fence and found buyers. When she had asked why there wasn't more Sammy had given her a look that had told her that questions were off limits for the time being. Now as Sammy drowned his sorrows he kicked himself for not being better prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy took a long swallow off the bottle and set it down. Something was poking him in he rear. When he investigated it he found the iPhone he had lifted earlier. Absentmindedly he unlocked it and found himself staring at a 3D rendering of the bodybuilder kid. There were buttons and sliders up and down the sides of the screen and several tabs at the top. Just before Sammy could touch one of them a message appeared on screen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOWNERSHIP ERROR - RECALIBRATING...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a box appeared asking him to place his thumb inside. Sammy had drunk just enough whiskey so that this didn't seem like a bad idea, and once he touched the screen it blinked a new message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHANK YOU, SAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Sammy said aloud before being silenced by the appearance of his own image. The model on the screen wore the exact same jeans and wife-beater combination he wore. After staring at the screen for a very long time Sammy began tapping through different menus trying to understand what he was dealing with. Much of what he found didn't make sense to him, but then he found one menu that he understood: \"Muscle.\" When he selected it he was given two sliders to adjust one for size and another for strength. Sammy placed his finger on the size adjuster and slowly moved it to the right. Instantly the 3D model on the screen began to grow. The avatar's body went from being built like a refrigerator to being build like a statue of a Greek god. Much of Sammy's fat remained but his muscles grew making the image look like an enormous off season bodybuilder. Sammy pushed the slider a little further and watched as the pretend version of himself grew right out of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy chuckled to himself. \"I'd like to see some punk fuck with me if I looked like that. I'd be able to mop the floor with anybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy moved the strength slider up, slowly at first, then when he saw no physical change he slid it back and forth rapidly all the way up and back again. That one seemed pretty useless so he just left it sitting on the halfway mark and moved on. He tapped through a few more screens stopping on one that had a body fat reading. He began reducing this number and watched as the amorphous masses around his body began receding rapidly leaving only the giant slabs of muscle. As the fat melted away Sammy became less the off season bodybuilder and more the competition ready bodybuilder. By the time he was finished the avatar was shredded beyond belief becoming an anatomy chart of muscle groups, each one in stark relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, now I'd for sure blow that kid out of the water. Now that I'm all big, though, something else looks tiny.\" Sammy zoomed in on the 3D model's crotch. \"Let's fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the menu easily enough and added length and girth to both his flaccid member as well as his erection and even adding mass to his balls turning himself into a porn stars wet dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what this program is supposed to do, but it looks good. I wouldn't mind being built like that. Ain't nobody in the world would fuck with a guy with those muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy was about to close the app and shut the phone off, but something made him tap the \"Apply Changes\" button in the top corner first. Perhaps he thought he was saving the changes he'd made to review later, but as soon as he had touched it a building heat in his chest made him realize that everything about the mysterious program was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy dropped the phone to the porch and stood up. Only a few seconds had passed and already his clothes were becoming uncomfortably tight. The heat in his chest was now radiating out to his entire body and growing hotter by the moment. He put his hands on his chest and felt it quickly moving forward while his tank top tightened. Then he held his arms up and saw they were noticeably larger. Initially Sammy had felt panic but now he was elated. He may not have gotten much out of the house earlier, but he had found something better than he could have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy clothes began to rip apart and fall away leaving him wearing nothing but his tightening briefs which were quickly losing the battle against his growing cock and balls. Seconds later he was entirely naked in his backyard and couldn't care less. Fat was rapidly melting off of his growing frame revealing the obscene musculature below and even as his massive muscles slowed their expansion the heat within them continued to build sealing within his cells a strength beyond Sammy's wildest dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his transformation had completed Sammy was a living monument to muscle weighing in at 480 pounds. He raised an arm and flexed a record shattering bicep measuring 35 inches around. Sammy flexed his tree trunk legs and felt his toes digging into the solid oak boards beneath his feet; breaking through the hard wood like it was styrofoam. Intrigued by the ease with which he was able to break such sturdy material Sammy walked down the porch steps to a pile of small logs he used as fire wood. He picked up a fairly thick chunk and held it lengthwise between his hands. He started to squeeze and before he felt he was even applying any pressure at all the log shattered into a million splinters and virtually disintegrated between his palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he remembered the strength slider he had adjusted and left sitting at the halfway point. \"Obviously these muscles ain't just for show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill naked Sammy walked through the backdoor to his garage and approached his truck. In one quick confident move Sammy gripped the rear bumper and lifted the entire back end of the vehicle off the ground. Feeling no strain he lifted higher and moved forward so that he was under the truck. Now he lifted the entire thing off the ground. As it rose the truck crashed into several cross beams in the ceiling but Sammy hardly noticed. He adjusted his grip and removed one of his hands so that he held the 3 ton truck aloft with a single hand. He pumped the pickup up and down a few times and laughed with glee noting how easy it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy the Semi is back and better than ever!\" he shouted. \"And he's going to take whatever he wants from now on!\"</span></div></div>",

He turned, truck still in one hand, to find her standing in the doorway to the garage with her mouth agape. \"Baby? That you? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy smiled and took hold of either side of the trucks frame then squeezed his hands together. The truck buckled, steel folded, glass shattered and the whole thing collapsed together. Sammy dropped the destroyed truck to the ground then approached Kylee flexing his massive chest and arms. \"Something very good happened. Something that's going to change our lives forever. I found power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy raised his arm and flexed his giant 35 inch bicep right in Kylee's face. Her hands flew straight to it squeezing it and finding it to be harder than she imagined. \"Oh my god, babe! How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy smiled, \"It doesn't matter now. I need you to do something. I need you to go to the store before they close. I'll make a list of what you need to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee nodded and turned to go back to the living room but Sammy stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and babe,\" he said lifting his hardening member up and stroking it a few times. \"When you get back I'm going to shove every bit of my new 15 inch cock into you as I can. So be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee's expression was a mix of fear and excitement. She gave a quick nod then went to get ready to go to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn years past Sammy had run with another hood named Chuck Green. Chuck had been the brains behind a slew of heists mainly consisting of jewelry stores. Sammy and Chuck had been close until a few of their later scores. Chuck kept getting on Sammy about his sloppiness with crowd control and Sammy would defend himself saying they needed a third man. Of course that would mean reducing their cut so Chuck was completely against it. The rift between the two grew until Chuck wouldn't even tell Sammy where he would stash their goods and just paid Sammy almost like an allowance. Sammy accepted this as necessary but once Chuck got busted and sent to the state pen it left Sammy with nothing. He retraced all of Chuck's steps but could never find where he'd hidden anything. In the three years since Sammy had been on his own he had floundered from small job to small job just getting by. Now that he had the power the mysterious iPhone brought, though, he was going to get what he was owed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you going after Chuck?\" Kylee asked. She had found him the items he had requested and, true to his word, he had shoved his monumental cock so deep in her she would be sore for days. She had reached orgasm nearly immediately though pain followed right behind. When Sammy finally came Kylee felt like she was being blasted by a fire hose from within. Now, hours later Sammy was sharing his plan with her while working intensely on the iPhone he had found earlier. \"I mean its not like we need the score he hid. We, I mean you, could knock over any bank in the world single handedly. Couldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I could, baby. And I will. But I have a score to settle with Chuck. He cut me out, cut US out, and left himself sitting pretty. Do you think that once he gets out he's going to give up my share or is he just going to vanish and keep it all for himself? No, he's going to learn that you don't fuck with Sammy the Semi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy made a few more taps on the screen of the phone then set it on the table and stood. Kylee watched in amazement as Sammy's entire body shifted before her eyes. He grew taller until he reached 7 feet tall all the while his already monstrous muscles expanded further adding several inches to each of his measurements. As suddenly as it started Sammy's growth ended. Now that he wasn't swelling anymore Kylee noticed that Sammy's face had changed and was no longer rounded but hard with prominent cheekbones. His eyes had gone from brown to cold and grey. He didn't look anything like Sammy at all, really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh!! Even better!!\" Sammy reveled in his power. His voice was much deeper and Kylee could feel the bass tones vibrating her bones. \"You can't even imagine how strong I am now. I've made myself invulnerable to anything and everything. I can punch mountains into dust. I am a god among men and anyone who has ever crossed me will pay.\" Sammy raised his arms in a double biceps pose sporting new 41 inch arms and a chest so thick his pectorals alone could envelop Kylee's entire torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy pulled on the clothes that Kylee had bought for him, black boots, black pants and a black sleeveless shirt. Then he pulled a ski mask down over his head. He had changed his appearance, but there was still value in remaining hidden. At least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy's new outfit fit him like a second skin, but that's what he was hoping for. He wanted people to see the outline of his shredded quads and heaving pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee cleared her throat, \"Um.. since you.. uh, broke... your truck. Did you need me to drive you in my car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy let out a bellowing laugh that shook the foundation of the house around them. When he finally regained himself he shook his head. \"No, baby. I don't need anyone to drive me anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and walked out into the street in front of the house. Sammy took two quick steps then leapt propelling his 600 pound body a thousand feet into the air and out of Kylee's sight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kylee sighed and headed for the living room.  She figured that she\u2019d see Sammy, or at least the results of what he had planned, on the news.  Turning on the TV, she sat down painfully on the couch, now wondering if she would even survive another bought of sex from Sammy seeing as he was now even bigger and stronger.  Kylee also felt a pang of jealousy.  After all, Sammy had made himself into some kind of super villain and left her the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to look out the window, Kylee noticed the phone sitting on the table.  She crinkled her nose and glancing around as if she someone might be watching, Kylee picked up the phone.  Licking her lips she turned it on and was greeted by a quick error message, and then another that said \u201cRecalibrating\u201d.  After a short time, the message popped up, \u201cWelcome Kylee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee smiled and she saw a 3D model of herself seemingly float in the air above the phone.  It was surreal.  It was an exact duplicate of her, even down to the jeans and oversized t-shirt.  She moaned with a disapproving tone at how she looked.  She used to be really hot, but years of neglect had made her pudgy and feeling sickly.  But now\u2026.  Now she had the same chance to change things like Sammy did.  But what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFidgeting with the phone she soon found she could bring up profiles of others and quickly moved to Sammy.  She shook her head as she stared at the monster he had turned himself into.  She found it rather odd that he would not just change his body but his looks as well.  Looking further Kylee was able to ascertain just how big, strong and dense he was by the settings.  She was fascinated that as powerful as he had made himself that he could have been even bigger and stronger.  This phone had crazy powers!  By looking further she noticed a button that indicated \u201creturn to baseline\u201d.  Smiling wickedly, Kylee held that thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not a reset,\u201d Kylee said out loud to herself, \u201cbut maybe not as powerful.\u201d  She then paused as she pulled her own profile back up and giggled.  \u201cOr maybe just not as powerful as me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee began to work her own profile and soon realized that unless she went bigger that she couldn\u2019t see the changes on her 3D model.  Frowning, she looked around again as if someone were spying on her and then peeled off her jeans and shirt, leaving her in nothing but panties.  Feeling exposed and self conscious, she pulled her legs up to near her chest, leaned forward and stared at her character on the phone.  As she expected, the figure was now also in nothing but panties, which caused her to clean up her figure first, changing herself looking as hot as she once was, then hotter.  Smiling at the model perfect body, Kylee started working the strength and density slides, moving them higher and pausing as she noticed that the only thing that seemed to change was her breasts moving upward and outward as if they were filled with helium, not realizing that they were being pulled up by her stronger pecs and the comparable increase in density.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee paused for a moment as she continued to think.  \u201cI really don\u2019t want to be 7 feet tall; that would just make life difficult.\u201d  She then thought that if both she and Sammy were really strong, then maybe an increase in height wouldn\u2019t matter.  Staring at the image, her thoughts turned to adding muscle.  Kylee had always enjoyed strong muscle men.  That\u2019s what attracted her to Sammy.  But she had never really considered having bigger muscles herself.  It wasn\u2019t like either one of them went to the gym.  Getting up and trying not to look at her flabby, naked self, Kylee found her own phone and started searching female bodybuilders on the web.  She found various sizes and shapes of women with some of them not that appealing.  As she was considering muscle growth she then searched for female muscle growth and was soon on sites with obvious morphs of beautiful women with huge muscles.  She laughed at it, but started thinking that now maybe it was possible for her to do that.  For real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the magic phone again, Kylee nervously started to mess with the body shapes and started adding mass and removing excess fat.  She grinned as her body grew firmer with some nicely shaped tone.  Slowly sliding up the scale her eyes widened as her body went from toned to well muscled to highly muscled to incredibly muscled.  Remembering how big Sammy was per his phone stats, Kylee paused once she reached his proportions.  With her 5 foot 5 inch height she was still smaller than he.  Adding more mass until her muscles matched his size Kylee shook her head at just how big she now looked.  Knowing how much he had loved pumping his arms, Kylee flipped around and found she could grow specific body parts and keeping the rest of her at the already massive level, while still retaining her feminine curves, Kylee added more mass to her arms, giggling at the ridiculousness of it all.  She then went back to the strength and density, sliding up higher and higher, eclipsing Sammy\u2019s settings.  She then found another setting for speed and reflexes.  She went back and found Sammy hadn\u2019t touched those, although his power packed body would still be able to move quickly due to the huge muscles.  But nonetheless, Kylee went back to her profile and increased those as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee\u2019s heart raced at the possibilities in front of her.  Should she make herself THAT powerful?  What would Sammy think?  After all, she had just made herself bigger and stronger than he was.  Would he be excited, aroused, upset, or furious?  Or maybe a little of everything.  Kylee began to think that she should make him less powerful and dial back her settings as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she weighed the possibilities, one thing was for certain; she was going to make some changes and shed the body she hated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy was focused but couldn\u2019t help but feel like the Incredible Hulk with his earth shaking jumps and super strength.  The boots were already ripped from the jumps, not designed to withstand the force being applied.  So once Sammy knew he was close enough he ran.  And he ran fast!  His enhanced strength and muscles brought him to the prison in no time.  Walking up boldly toward the main gate the guard stared at the huge man coming at him.  As he had on a mask, the guard assumed the worst and called into the main prison and other guards were soon coming to the scene.  Sammy smiled and marching up to the large gate, grabbed two bars and bending them a bit, ripped the entire gate away from the wall and tossed it behind him.  Snickering at the scared expressions, Sammy spoke boldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here for Chuck Green.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs additional guards descended upon the scene and the alarm sounded, the closest guard pointed his gun at Sammy with shaking arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChuck Green?  I think he was transferred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy growled.  \u201cWhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlack Gate Prison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy sighed.  That was clear across the state.  In the opposite direction.  Not wanting to lose the opportunity for a little test, Sammy walked forward and the guards already yelling at him to drop to the ground opened fire.  Sammy smiled as the bullets bounced off his super hard muscles with no effect other than the feeling of a small bump.  Turning to the side, Sammy snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, it\u2019s your lucky day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy looked upward and bending down, jumped into the air and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kylee stared at the phone, she heard a loud boom that shook the ground around her.  Sammy was back already!  He marched in through door and tore off his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey moved him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee shook from fear.  When Sammy was that mad there wasn\u2019t much reasoning that could be done.  And now that he was super strong there was no telling what he might do without thinking of the consequences.  Glancing at the phone she realized that she had to move quickly and hitting buttons, tossed the phone behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy tensed his massive muscles as he caught the end of Kylee\u2019s movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are doing walking around naked?  And were you messing with my phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee let out a terrified breath that soon changed to a relieved sigh as\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew from Sammy\u2019s changes that she would quickly reach her programmed size and strength, but realized she needed a brief moment to keep him from doing something irrational before she completed her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, just wanted to be like you.  To be your partner so we could both do whatever we want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy grunted; his eyes still on fire with anger.  But as Kylee had hoped, her comment caused him to slow his advancement toward her and he stopped a few feet away.  She was right about one thing.  He had considered making her hotter.  And if she had done that he\u2019d be OK with it.  He thought that maybe if she grew a little stronger that he would be fine with that as well so she could take the kind of rough sex he enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Kylee\u2019s perspective, she was anxious and excited about where she was headed; but if he didn\u2019t like where she would finish, well, then that would be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee was breathing heavily as her body expanded to the initial size she had set, giving her muscles proportional to Sammy\u2019s massive frame.  Her legs blasted bigger, her waist filled with muscle but remained narrow and her back and chest pumped up with huge muscles, pushing her chest out to match his incredible thickness and spreading her lats out to barn busting width.  Kylee\u2019s arms hung to her side, slightly away from her expanded back, but with rippling balls of she muscle that pulsed with untapped power.  Sweating a bit from the ordeal, Kylee looked up at Sammy and smiled, hoping he would do the same.  However Sammy didn\u2019t seem pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou turned yourself into some kind of muscle chick?  I thought you would have just made yourself beautiful and maybe stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee\u2019s smile dropped slightly.  She certainly liked her new body.  And she also knew the changes weren\u2019t over yet.  But with her strength level still not fully adjusted, she knew she needed a bit more time before she would be able to fully \u2018convince\u2019 him that what she was doing was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you wouldn\u2019t want the girlfriend of the most powerful man on earth to be a scrawny supermodel now would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy huffed and crossed his massive arms across his equally massive chest.  Before he could answer, his eyes widened as Kylee\u2019s muscles began to swell again, pushing out to match his enormous size!  And seeing as she was a foot and half shorter, she looked like a muscle loaded tank!  Tensing her thighs, they ballooned across her leg and split into huge slabs of female muscle as thick as his mighty legs.  Her calves and hamstrings expanded equally large, looking gigantic on her shorter, womanly frame.  Kylee\u2019s feminine curves remained even as her legs expanded and her midsection bubbled with killer separation and her back pressed out even wider, thicker and harder.  Her huge pectorals surged further outward, matching his thickness of 18 ungodly inches and with her massive muscle tits, her chest pushed out over two feet!  Her face lit up with uncompromising beauty and her jet black hair thickened and her blue eyes sparkled.  Giggling at Sammy\u2019s reaction and pleased that her changes had frozen him, she pulled up her right arm, keenly aware of the next advancement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd after all, if you can flex up a bicep, say, this big\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee flexed her mammoth arm and her bicep exploded upward until the peak was near the top of her fist at 41 monster inches around, matching Sammy\u2019s male busting size.  Sammy\u2019s breath quickened a bit as he stared at a bicep on his now drop dead gorgeous girlfriend that was as big as own.  Kylee\u2019s smile widened as she pulled her forearm back down a bit and she turned her head to watch what she knew would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why wouldn\u2019t your girlfriend be able to flex up a bicep, THIS big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kylee brought her thick forearm up, her triceps tensed first, bulling downward into a dangerously thick bow over a foot thick.  But that thickness was nothing compared to the rising, rippling mass of muscle that was her growing, overloaded bicep.  Muscles stacked upon muscles as her mighty peak pushed up over her fist and to the top of her head into a wildly detailed, bristling, vein engorged mega bicep!  Her biology busting bicep was over six ungodly feet in circumference!  And to Sammy\u2019s growing shock, her biceps were STILL expanding!  With a sly, knowing smile forming on her angelic face, Kylee gave her small fist another hard squeeze, pushing her gargantuan bicep up over the top of her head until it was well over twice the size of Sammy\u2019s massive guns!  And not only was her bicep more than twice his size, but the shear enormity was matched only by the mind boggling detail and rippling, shredded mega musculature!  Kylee was flexing nothing short of a super bicep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy\u2019s eyes widened at the site, but his surprise slowly turned back to anger.  But even as Kylee noticed his change in expression the next wave of strength shot liquid power into her veins!  Her strength and density leapt forward and her muscles crystallized across her body harder than any known substance while containing the strength to bench press a mountain range!  Kylee sucked in a breath as her head spun momentarily with the nearly maxed out power settings of the phone, including the expansion setting she had adjusted right before he arrived.  Utilizing that very satisfying power, her bicep expanded even further and was now flexed to triple digits in circumference!  Her mountainous muscle glowed and her veins pulsed as though they were infused with lit neon.  Kylee moaned from the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhh.  So much power!  So much strength!  So much muscle!  You have no idea what that phone can do Sammy!  I am a goddess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy grit his teeth, surmising that Kylee had made herself stronger than him.  Looking passed his entranced girlfriend and her beyond muscle loaded form, he spied the phone and decided he needed to fix things.  And quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately for him, it was at that point the Kylee received the last phase of her settings.  Her speed and reflexes shot forward to beyond super human levels as she had maxed out those settings as well.  Kylee giggled as she could now sense everything around her as though it were moving in slow motion.  In a move faster than the eye could follow, Kylee released her bicep flex and zipped in between Sammy and the phone.  Unfortunately for Sammy he wound up walking right into his girlfriend, slamming into her much harder body and knocking himself backward.  He let out a grunt as he stumbled back a few steps, but was otherwise unharmed.  Kylee placed her hands on her hips and thrust out her chest into twin cubes of planet crushing power, rippling with glowing, pulsing muscle fibers.  Her nipples pushed out into twin bullets, harder than diamonds and flooded with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, her beauty was awe-inspiring as her blue eyes lit up, her teeth were bright white, and her hair darkened to a deep black night and flowed around her broad shoulders like silk.  She sniffed at Sammy, indicating she knew what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.  I\u2019m the strong one now and there\u2019s no reason to change things.  We\u2019re going to doing things my way from now on and there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy had had enough and without thinking about what Kylee might have done to herself, pulled his arm back and let forth a punch at her head.  Kylee sighed lightly as she casually brought up her forearm, swatting his punch to the side with ease.  Sammy\u2019s body twisted as the force to capsize a battleship was blunted.  Kylee held her casual grin as Sammy righted himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to play rough, huh?  Well I can do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee pulled her right arm back, rolled her small hand into a fist and tensing her muscles, caused her bicep to explode back up to monumental proportions with comet crushing strength.  Before Sammy could react, Kylee let loose an uppercut at his wide chin and connected with the force of a cruise missile.  The resulting concussion resulted in an explosion that send waves outward, destroying the walls of their house and rocketing Sammy into the air, smashing through the roof and high into the clouds, arcing outward so quickly his body shot away with a sonic boom and sailed out of sight.  But thanks to Kylee\u2019s super senses she quickly refocused and smiled as she watched her boyfriend sail up high and then slowly arc back down.  With a thought, Kylee bent down and ran forward, tearing up the ground with her bare feet as she rocketed ahead, quickly breaking the sound barrier herself, watching Sammy\u2019s dead weight head back toward the earth.  Kylee circled a bit to turn and come to a halt to watch Sammy slam into the ground, shaking the earth around him as he formed a crater several feet deep.  Groaning with pain, Sammy blinked his eyes, barely conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKylee walked up to him and looked down with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tough guy, I think you now know just who the strongest person on earth is.  So my only question is, what to do next?  Would you like to see even more?  Or would you rather try and fight?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In his haste to test out his newfound strength, Sammy completely forgot about the phone on the porch. And so, through a bizarre freak accident, one of the splinters from the logs he broke flew towards the phone and sent the phone flying. It was also by some, perhaps, magical coincidence the phone fell smoothly through the open window of one of Sammy's neighbors and straight onto her comfy bed. And so, while the squadron held their guns at Sammy who was now more confused than ecstatic, and Laura was sitting in one of the police cars hoping to find her phone and fearing that Sammy might have done awful things to it, Eileen was staring shocked at the phone that just appeared on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen was a stereotypical goth as they came, dark clothes, dark room, piercings, tattoos, pale skin and green and pink stripes in her black hair. The only thing that might have special about her was that she chose this not because she fell to society's fringes and wanted to escape, but rather because she just loved the aesthetic and feeling of it. The 19-year-old, 5'4'' young woman also wasn't very extroverted, but that was beside the point. She looked at the phone and saw it was open on some strange app, though the moment she tried to enter a message appeared:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRECALIBARATION IN PROGRESS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWELCOME EILEEN STERN<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew her own body appeared as a 3d figure, wearing the same clothes she was wearing. Eileen was both shocked and bored due to having finished all her course-work for college, so she started scrolling through the many options the app provided. She didn't really believe any of what she saw, but she had to check. She wasn't the happiest with her own figure, and that was mostly due to coming from a family of tall bodybuilders and she only got a slightly athletic build from working out. Her firm B cups were nice, but she wanted more; she wanted to prove that being goth didn't only mean thin and weak. While looking at the many options, she stumbled upon the historical changes section and a lightbulb turned on. She didn't want her life to just suddenly get better, she wanted it to have always been the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick change was all she wanted for now. She looked at the body options and dragged her height to 6', then simply wrote that in the new reality she got more favourable height genes from her parents (Her mother was already 6'5'' and her father 6'9''). as soon as she hit apply she felt vertigo and her entire room seemed to shrink. It ended as soon as it began, Nothing other than having bigger clothes seemed to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was real, and she was tall. She looked at the mirror and saw that she now showed more of her athletic midriff; she looked at family photos and the friendly way her family treated her seemed to stay the same as well. She just remembered always being taller than most people around her and finding it slightly erotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on her bed and started making the real changes she wanted. She was about the be big, sexy and powerful and most importantly - goth. As she continued making her ideal self more and more ideal the police a few hundred yards away found out Sammy was actually a big dork when a few dozen guns were in front of his face and he started explaining everything. His massive form found itself crammed into the van of Officer Misako where Laura was sitting shotgun. He told them all about the app and the only person there to realize he was telling the truth and not think he was high on something was Laura. The look Laura gave Misako was enough to convince Misako the man was not completely off the rocker. Misako contacted HQ and asked them to once again pinpoint the phone and quick. Yet by the time they reached Eileen's house, it was too late, and none of them even knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen hit apply changes and looked over her description of the new reality. \"<i>For generations out family have loved three things above all else, being the biggest and strongest around, being the sexiest and being ultra goth. This was so ingrained into the family that not even one person found it wrong. It mostly happened through our genes, which somehow always seemed to be 100% what we wanted. Slowly, over millennia, the people of our family just grew bigger and bigger, sexier and sexier, and naturally more goth. Over the past year, I grew from being what we consider average to a titanic goth amazon - a gothazon as we call it. Nobody ever saw anything wrong with our family and we welcomed anyone who wanted to marry into it. We never used our superior forms to bully, control or do anything super fashy and awful, rather we sought to improve them only through natural means, no science or magic mumbo-jumbo - pure hard work and dedication.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew Eileen was standing up and she looked down only for her view to be blocked by the two immense firm pale orbs, held together by a black and red corset. as she raised her arms to feel her new monolithic breasts she unconsciously flexed them and saw to her amazement as muscles piled on muscles and her bicep blew up to be at least 120'' around if she had to guess. The sleeves on her black dress were somehow not ripping to shreds, but they were on the verge. as she looked herself over in her mirror she could only orgasm at the pure perfection that stood in front of her. She knew she was about 9'8'' tall, she knew she was even more muscular since her workout yesterday, she knew her breasts had somehow become even larger and perkier since yesterday and were now well past ZZZ cups; her ginormous pecs pushing them at least 2 feet ahead of her. She felt her protruding 18 pack of pure power and felt her gigantic solid ass underneath her black dress. Her long powerful tree trunk legs could reak diamonds if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the room were various goth and workout paraphernalia, from a 1-ton dumbbell to a set of dark lipsticks. She noticed many new photos of her and her massive family members flexing and/or being gothy. She only now noticed that her skin was naturally much paler and healthier than she ever could achieve with make-up; she had more piercings and tattoos than she remembered and her hair seemed to be naturally black and neon green now. The college course-work on her desk seemed to remain the same - just as she wanted, and the spam folder on her e-mail was filled with hundreds of offers as she suspected considering hse was the biggest, sexiest person alive. She was also happy to see that her uncles and aunts were not that different, though they did seem to be taller and more muscular, that did make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? Why did that make sense?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cop car stopped outside the Stern House<sup>TM</sup>, many unforeseen changes now came to light. Eileen cared so much about improving her family and relatives she did not stop to think about the entire world. After all, now a family of 9' goth gods had to make sense and that wasn't happening with the old system. And so the entirety of humanity's gene code had to be rewritten so that humans would be more likely to become muscular and tall. Not only that, but that a woman's breasts actually grew bigger and sexier due to working-out, men and women had to be more equal in terms of height and muscle mass, and many more related changes. this meant that while society overall remained similar to the one Eileen knew, however concepts such as \"unathletic\" and \"unattractive\" seemed to have been completely erased. Now it was more about being below or above average. Not only that, but Eileen failed to see what would happen if the idea of the quintessential attractiveness was shifted away from supermodels, celebrities and Instagram stars and towards a 9'8'' curvy ubermascular goth who liked to pull beached whales back to the sea sometimes (footage can be found online easily). Since she was too busy being horny and thinking of the many men and women she wanted to improve and fuck now, she did not notice the whole world seemed bigger and there were more advertisements for goth apparel and gyms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was that when Misako and Laura walked out of the car and towards the house they were still a tall athletic Asian police officer and a below-average 18-year-old young woman, except that now meant that Misako was 8'2'' with large LLL cups held firm by gigantic pecs and 45'' biceps and laura was 6'4'' goth chick with GG cups and a nice 8 pack and 20'' biceps. Compared to nature itself and materials around them, which did not change much during the shift, the two women were powerful and laura liked to train sometimes with her friends by bending steel beams in a nearby junkyard. Sammy himself was now an 8'10'' mountain of muscle that was watched over by many guns and tasers while Misako rung the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground slightly shook as the police heard footsteps and Eileen opened the door, surprised to see the cops.<br>\r\n\"This young lady is looking for her phone, you wouldn't by any chance have found one that doesn't belong to you?\" Misako needed to step back a bit so she could see  Eileen's face over her massive bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen chose to:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah... yeah I did, wait here a second and I'll bring it to you.\" Eileen felt like she got everything she could have ever wanted and so much more, she had no reason to keep the magical phone, but she did want to make sure this world stayed as perfect as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only now noticed how much people have changed due to her shift. In the old reality, the shorter woman would have been considered a powerful sex goddess, but in this new one, she was below-average. As Eileen ran up to her room, the strengthened walls and stairs slightly creaked and shook with each of her steps. She made it to the phone and did a quick search through its contents to find out it belonged to Laura Friedman. She swiftly opened the alterations app and put Laura's name. During her first search through the app, she noticed one of the tabs that frightened her but now seemed necessary - the personal wants and needs. She opened it and wrote down something with a little bit of a heavy feeling on her heart:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Laura won't care about checking to see what previous changes were made with the app. Even if she doesn't know what these changes are, she will also never feel the need to reverse any of them - this mostly means that Laura will never think of changing me or my family with the app.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowingly changing the world when she became an amazon was one thing, brainwashing was a whole nother topic and she knew that if she wanted to keep this magnificent form she really did not have much of a choice. She ran back down the stairs and handed the phone straight to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't by any chance find a strange app on that phone, did you?\" Misako asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but it was really weird... and confusing so I didn't bother with it; also, it's not my phone and I was just about to call the police about it. It just flew in through my window ha-ha.\" Misako found it strange to see the sexiest person in the world embarrassed and confused; each one of Eileen's biceps was nearly the size of Laura, and Misako knew in her heart that there was something odd about that. No matter how much someone works out, you don't achieve this size through natural means alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a mental note of this and returned with Laura to the car. Before they entered she whispered into Laura's ear: \"I don't trust her.\" Yet when she looked at Laura's face it showed no signs of worry, which was even odder. They entered the vehicle and Sammy felt some relief knowing where the app was, even he was afraid someone would royally screw the world over with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Sammy, we will take you down to the station, Laura, you will come with me to a separate room where we can study that app more closely.\" They both nodded quietly and the police brigade drove away from Eileen's home. She went back in and felt a massive weight lift itself from her - as if the app itself was some cursed object that was no longer forcing its presence on her. She went up to her bed and started thinking about Rosa - her friend from college. She was from Cuba and in the old reality, she was a 5'8'' fit dancer who had nothing to do with the goth culture but was attracted to it. In the first semester, they tried dating for two weeks but found that they enjoyed being friends more than being a romantic pair. They still occasionally had sex. While thinking about her, Eileen realized the image that was popping into her head was of Rosa's new figure, and it was hot. Rosa now stood a towering 8'6'' and her curves alone rivaled Eileen's. She wasn't that muscular, though in this reality that still meant a prominent 12 pack and sizable 40'' biceps; that didn't matter for Eileen. She remembered how much more virile their sex now was and thinking about it made her orgasm a few times. She picked up her phone and called Rosa immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Misako stood in an interrogation room and stared at the open app. Sammy willingly entered his cell and requested to never see the phone again.<br>\r\n\"I tried deleting it; it won't let me,\" Laura spoke slightly dejected, she didn't want to tell Misako that she really wanted to try the app out. \"And I don't think Eileen did anything. Why would the most powerful person in the world want to change anything about herself?\"<br>\r\n\"Did you think she might have become that powerful because of the app? We don't know its full capabilities.\" Misako did not want to touch the phone herself after she saw what Sammy looked like 5 minutes after not using it.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't want to throw away my phone and you don't want anyone to touch it so there really isn't a way to transfer all of my data to a new phone. It kinda has to stay with me.\" Laura wanted it to stay with her, she was slightly frightened by how much she wanted to use the app.<br>\r\n\"You know I can't take any chances of having this app out there right? I hate to say this, but you are going to have to be put under watch Laura. I won't mess with your private life, and I honestly can't stop you from using the app yourself. But the moment that phone is robbed or I find out you used the app recklessly; I will treat it is a weapon of mass fucking destruction. My squad and I will keep a close watch on you, your family and your friends. We will make routine reality checks by writing down any and all things that you could change and comparing our checks. You will come to a weekly psyche check to make sure you are of sound mind and if you believe you can use that app for genuine good it will be done only in a controlled environment. Do you understand?\" Laura quietly nodded to everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both left the room, the phone was placed into a briefcase that Misako cuffed to her arm all the way until they reached Laura's house. \"There is a geolocator chip inside that phone and briefcase either the phone is more than 20 feet away from the briefcase and/or the briefcase leaves the premises of your home, a police squadron will arrive and get it back. I will be out here for the rest of the day, one of my partners will cover the night shift. See you around kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura got to her home and let out a massive sigh of relief. While Misako was busy with repeating her long-winded explanation for how the rest of her life would go, Laura discovered the historical change option in the phone - Misako would never be able to find out about a change she never knew happened. However... Laura also knew there was a clear basis to Misako's fears, what if the changes got out of control? She didn't want to wake up one morning and discover she unconsciously and out of greed turned herself into a ruthless titanic ruler that crushed dissidents under her massive feet and ate people for fun. She nearly vomited on that thought.<br>\r\nShe could hear the sounds of Vanessa and Greg working out in the basement and peeked to see her 8'1'' Goth, blonde, mega muscular sister working out with her 9' mountain-of-muscles brother while listening to heavy metal that was just a little too much for her. She swore that every month both of them looked a little bigger, not that that was strange, it was just the pace of their growth was unusual even for this world. Vanessa alone was now easily bigger and stronger than Misako outside, though only a little shorter and with slightly smaller NN cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura always felt jealous of their figures, everyone in their family was big and powerful and she... she flexed her 20'' biceps and felt her firm ass - she just couldn't stop comparing it to Greg's monumental 78 inchers and Vanessa's ass that was so big and powerful she even got into a local newspaper for breaking the concrete floor at a club she frequented due to being too drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe went up to her room and did what she usually did when she wanted to just think - started curling her 30 kg dumbbells in both arms. She stared at the phone waiting for her inside the briefcase on her desk and thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen had the best sex of her entire life and even her strengthed ultra-large bed had a hard time not creaking under her and Rosa's combined weight and strength. She swore she could feel her and Rosa slightly grow after they climaxed but ignored the thought.<br>\r\n\"Do you ever wonder how much even better our sex could be if I was your size?\" Rosa mused out loud, the smaller woman lay on top of Eileen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eileen did wonder.<br>\r\nIn fact, the dumb horny idea from the mind of a woman off of a post-coital extasy strangely borrowed itself into Eileen's own mind. Because she could make it a reality.<br>\r\nShe only needed to find a way to get the app.<br>\r\nIt was only an app after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stopped curling, noticed her biceps seemed a little bigger and picked up her phone:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura knew deep down in her heart that no matter what changes she would make, he would remain under surveillance possibly for the rest of her life. In fact, if she turned herself into a gigantic sexy goth amazon, Misako would probably become very suspicious. But there was a way out of this: what if Misako was ok with her using the app? It seemed like such a strange idea, but the more Laura thought about how to implement it, the more she liked it. If Misako didn't care about Laura using the app, she wouldn't tell her co-workers to keep an eye on Laura, and Laura could go on using it as much as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the \"how?\" that Laura got stuck on for a while; until she realized she could look at Misako's own desires. Under some general desires about what she wanted the world to be like - mostly the word justice about 15 different times in 10 paragraphs that were a little too long - Laura found Misako's hidden sexual desires. Laura was kinda shocked to discover Misako was into women who were slightly older than her but much taller and more muscular - and most importantly, were neither dominating or submissive to her. Laura, already finding most of the people around to be jaw-droppingly sexy, realized making herself into Misako's ideal lover won't only net her a hot girlfriend, but also a carte blanche on using the app to even further improve her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started using her phone, she made sure that Misako wasn't looking at her fro outside and starting changing herself drastically, making sure she picked historical change. As she finished sculpting her titanic new form, she began writing down the explanation for the new reality. \"<i>While I was still born to the same family, I wasn't my mother's daughter, I was her sister in this new reality. We loved to work out together and over the years I became much bigger, sexier and more powerful than her, but we remained good friends. Sometime last year I spotted Misako giving out a report and it was love at first sight for both of us. Over the next few months we met each other more and more until half a year ago we bought a nice apartment and moved in together. I received the app around the same time as in this reality and the events that happened to this phone were about the same, except Misako didn't report about it to her higher-ups and instead, I promised her that we would make the next change together.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finished, I applied the change and the whole world spun around me. I found myself on a large bed that I remembered getting last year with Misako. I was kinda shocked for a few minutes as 37 years' worth of new memories sprung into my brain. I remembered my sister and I working out and I quickly outgrowing her. I remembered the looks of lust, jealousy, and envy I got as I continued working out and became a professional supermodel (I didn't even write that part!), and I remembered meeting Misako and our many nights of passionate sex and exhilarating work-outs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood up I saw the 12' ceiling get frighteningly close and the top of my head brushed against it, just as it had for the past week or so. I looked down and I could barely see anything past my endless cleavage - definitely bigger than Eileen's. I flexed all my muscles and my pale naked body shuddered with ecstasy. My 20-pack of raw power felt like titanium, my biceps were much bigger than Eileen's at around 150''. I found it strange I was thinking about Eileen so much, but then again I considered her a sort of a protegee. In this new reality, she came to me for all sorts of advice, from where I got my goth attire that could fit my perfect through what to do at the gym. I looked over our closet to see all the many custom-made dresses. I decided I wanted to stay naked and continued observing my long powerful legs - pillars of strength. My ass was curvy and powerful. My hair was long and mostly white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stepped out of the room through large doors, I arrived at our living room + kitchen, the ceiling here was much taller. I saw the many photos on the shelves depicting my new family and also Misako's family. Then I saw a photo of me and Misako at a promotion ceremony at the police HQ and realized I forgot to take into account what would happen if a bodybuilding-crazed-superwoman became Misako's lover. Misako was much bigger and sexier now. She had to have been at least 9'6'' and her police uniform did nothing to hide her magnificent curves and musculature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya sexy,\" I heard her voice from the couch and she got up and started groping my huge breasts. our naked forms made love for about an hour - fortunately it was Sunday and my next photoshoot wasn't until tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen noticed nothing odd as she remembered she somehow forgot the fact that the magical phone she found belonged to her role model from her old reality. Well, in the old reality Laura Friedman was well known among goth circles for how powerful and sexy she was, even if the goth culture was a little niche, Laura helped goth girls feel a little less lonely by being a role model. Eileen still thought about how strange it was that in this reality they got so close because Eileen made herself so big; would they have gotten this close in the old reality? Wait a minute, did Laura use the app to make herself that big?! No, she seemed genuinely frightened when Eileen told her about the strange app yesterday when she and Misako appeared at her house. Of course, Eileen only told them she found the app, not that she used it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen picked up her phone and started searching for any information people had about the app, she wanted to give rosa the form she deserved - bigger and sexier than even Eileen's own. Most of the forums seemed to point out contradictory information. Some users say they just found the app on their phone one morning, others said it came with the phone. there seemed to be nothing to connect all of the cases of people using the app. Except for the fact that after one use they suddenly got the urge to continue using it and decided to get rid of it as soon as they could; some even went as far as burning their phones. Eileen thought for a second - what if this is what the app does? What if it was doing the same thing to her now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as those thoughts swirled in her brain she got a strange and familiar-looking notification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisako and her lover were exhausted after trying every sexual position they could think of twice. Ever since the 28-year-old met the older woman her life had only gotten more perfect every day. And since that day when they both found out Laura's stolen phone had a magical app on it, she was thinking about how much more perfect they could make it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Misako got up from their bed and looked at Laura's phone.</span></div></div>",

Now let's shoot for 1,000!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura (18) is a plain and ordinary girl who is tired of living in the shadow of her sexy and popular siblings. Her sister, Vanessa (20), is a 5' 10\" busty, blond, bombshell with a fit body from years of cheerleading.  Her brother, Greg (24) is an amateur bodybuilder and has packed a good amount of muscle onto his 6' 2\" frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura is horribly jealous of both of her siblings; both her sister's amazing curves and good looks and her brother's size and strength. Laura herself is a 5' 4\" 105 pound waif with no boobs to speak of. Though she's good at school she's also a bit of a geek who's really into Sci-Fi movies, comic books and video games, and as such she's a bit of a social outcast. Her siblings, on the other hand, were each massively popular in their day such that everyone is always comparing Laura to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this is about to change, though, since Laura is about to find an iPhone app that can help make a few.... alterations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add.
