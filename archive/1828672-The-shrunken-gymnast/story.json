Their was no one in the locker room since Ryan took an extra hour of practice while everyone went home. He went to his locker to get his soap and towel.

She has a slender, well-defined body with curvy hips, and perky D size breasts that are natural by the way. She also has smooth fair skin, and strikingly attractive green eyes. Her face is extremely lovely too, and she stands 5\u20196. She has a fantastic ass, and her legs are muscular. She is extremely intelligent, but can be a bit ditzy sometimes. She is also in line for a spot on the United States Woman\u2019s Olympic team, and she will stop at nothing to get that position. Normally, when Laura is not in any competition, she is an extremely nice person, but when something like the Olympics comes around, it is on like Donkey Kong. She becomes a ruthless super villain that nearly everybody hates, but still lust after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n On this day, Laura has just gotten her uniform on, and is about to start her practice section. As she stands in the empty women\u2019s locker-room, she hears something outside and decides to check it out. She opens the door of the locker-room and sees her cute boyfriend, Seventeen-year-old David Donald arguing with somebody. David stands six feet tall and is a gymnast as well. He has short brown hair, baby blue eyes, and lightly tanned skin, with a great ass. He has a lean, well-defined, muscular body, with no facial hair, or body hair on it. They have been dating for well over two years now, and they have similar personalities. He is normally a nice person, until a competition like the Olympics gets in his way. Then he turns into a super jerk, because he too is competing for a spot on the coveted United States Man\u2019s Olympic team. He is dressed in his gymnastic uniform too, as he continues argues with some crazy old looking person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She watches the old person raises his hand to David\u2019s face and blows magical powder all over David and Laura. The old man then left but the shrinking powder is all over the couple. A few minutes later\u2026</span></div></div>",
