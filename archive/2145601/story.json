Katie started to notice the differences of her high school everyone was a good 100lbs over weight at least and that included her team. When she asked her team leader Josie (a bottom heavy brunette with olive skin.) she said don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll catch up. It was unnerving to say the least, when she was at practices she barely does anything most times Josie just takes them out to eat appalling amounts of food. Katie tried her best to avoid eating it but recently she\u2019s been indulging. At the game she\u2019s the fasts on her team obviously but her team is a battering ram anyone comes close they get dropped by a ton of lard. Mid game it started to rain and one of Katie\u2019s team mates slipped and fell on Kate. There is a load crack.</span></div></div>",

Jacob\u2019s Hills curse they called it. According to some of her more superstitious friends tales is that the popular kid in middle school would lose there control become a real porkers. Kylie laughed at the rumors. First of all the last three leaders of the middle school (Rachel Freels, Madeline Bears, and Kate White) were absolute monsters when it came to dieting and manipulation. Secondly even if they had fallen Kylie was stronger than all three combined. In all honesty Kylie new that she was only stronger than two of them and that if all three were fat she might actually be in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOh, honey I\u2019m so excited, your first day of high school. Sigh it... e....it seems that it was just yes true day that you my little baby girl and... and now look at you. Your a beautiful young women.\u201d Kylie\u2019s mom was driving the car to Jacob\u2019s and had begun sobbing. It had just been the two of them ever since her father had died in a car accident when she was five. Her father left a large enough fortune behind that her mother didn\u2019t have to go to work but she would some times work at a local beauty shop for fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMom your going to embarrass me,\u201d Kaylie blushed with fake annoyance. Kaylie was a bit hypocritical about larger people often making fun or being discussed by them, when her mother was a bit over weight from the years of stress of being an only parent after the death of her loving husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOk,ok, well here we are let me get a hug from you.\u201d Kylie\u2019s mom parked the car and quickly exited running to her daughters side. She was a half inch taller than her daughter wearing a pants suit which pinched her middle (her belly still stuck out) and should plenty of her breast(which were like H in the cup sizes). Her thighs rubbed the inter way to her daughter. Kylie was embraced in a warm soft hug that she had grown so used to. They hugged for a long time until her mom gave a kiss on her cheek releasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBye mom love you.\u201d  Kylie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cLove you too,\u201d Mrs. Greer was a little chocked up seeing her daughter go towards the school. She did get really uncomfortable when she saw the way a boy was looking at her but what could she do.(hit this is possible foreshadowing.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHey there bestie,\u201d a familiar voice called out to Kylie. It was her oldest friend Summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHey Summer how\u2019ve you been,\u201d the two embrace each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cYou know same old, same old. But, man did you see the way Make Wilder was looking at you?\u201d They both look back at a handsome young man, when they make eye contact he nods toward them and they giggle. \u201cIt makes me kind of jealous of you that all the boys look your way and only when your with someone or gone do they look my way.\u201d(hit hit possible foreshadowing) She said a little upset<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWell you know I can\u2019t help it. Oh, gotta go don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d She puffed out her chest before running off so the guys could get a good view.<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE IS NO MORE ROOM FOR CHEERLEADING.\u201d Kylie frantically spouted at the guidance counselor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI mean what I said, now I have some more creative type clubs if you\u2019d be interested in any of them that you could join.\u201d The counselor said calmly offering a brochure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo thanks I think I\u2019ll just head to lunch ,\u201d she said disheartened. Kylie walked to the lunch room and after grabbing her lunch she realized none of her friends share the same lunch with her. \u201cWell what a great day,\u201d she decides to get some prof on that the hole curse thing was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She first found Rachel. Rachel used to be a an ebony goddess with curves for days, but when Kylie saw her today she was sitting down on two giant cushion sized ass cheeks thighs touching to the knees. Her stomach laid on thighs roll on roll. Her breast jutted out and relaxed on her stomach rolls. Her face was pudgy and had a double chin. Her arms large and plushy were wrapped around what Kylie assumed was her boyfriend who was feeding her a drum stick as though she were the queen of a mighty empire. Kylie was horrified by it but was worse she still fashionable some how. There was still hope though two more girls to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Madeline had been a blond track star and a merciless bitch. She hadn\u2019t turned out well either she sat next to her tank friends who were bigger than before but were dwarfed by Madeline who\u2019s colossal Stomach which pocked out of her shirt and rubbed against the table. Her thighs and hips while not as big as Rachel\u2019s they were still large. Her breast were massive and it would be hard to imagine her crossing her arms around her boobs. She had huge greasy cheeks and a triple chin. Her puffy arms the size of pillows were shoving food into her mouth. This scared Kylie but Kate would stay strong right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Kate didn\u2019t stay strong. She had a bob cut of her natural red hair and was making out with another chubby girl. She didn\u2019t have a huge stomach it was actually pretty small her hips were large her ass starting to spill of her chair her thighs touching to mid thigh. Her breast are massive around the size of watermelons the largest in the school. Her arms are puffy and wrapped around her lover. This started to scare Kylie but that couldn\u2019t be it. </span></div></div>",

Compared to her home in Poland, it was an absolute wealth of shopping and food, with the eldest daughter of her host family driving her around to introduce her to each American traditional delicacy before school started up in two weeks. As she bonded with her new family, she fell in love with hamburgers, corn dogs, French fries, fried chicken, you name it. She was overwhelmed, eating two generous fast food meals daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was preparing for school on her first morning as an American high school student, she found her jeans harder to button, her chubby belly and her slightly thicker thighs creating some stress in the fabric. She tugged a clingy white tank top on, which left none of her upper curves to the imagination. She finished the outfit with a red flannel shirt, left fully open in the front. She brushed her teeth, fixed up her hair, ate breakfast, then headed out with her book bag to the bus stop, five minutes before pickup time, per the instructions of the schedule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe boarded the bus once it came, seeing that it was mostly full, with a single girl sat near the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I sit wit you?\u201d Kat asked in perfectly structured English, but with a messy and horrible accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up at her, seeing both her potbelly and smiling face.

Alex's father is John Pitzaferro a sales man at Pumps unlimited  and often travels but when he is home he spoils his wife and kids.<br>\r\nAlex's mother Sam Pitzaferro works at a day care and dotes on her children but she doesn't approve of Alex's weight gain, the hypocrite.<br>\r\nAlex has an older brother, sister, and a younger sister. Her brother (Jake) is the normal stareo type over protective and strong as he'll, he made sure no picked on or dated any of his sisters if he didn't trust them. He has left for college but that doesn't mean he won't be home in a heart beat if any thing happens. Julia her older sister is a fitness nut and will pick on Alex about her weight but shuts up when her girlfriends around who's a bit bigger than Alex. Susan the youngest by 2 years is a bit of a chubster takes after Alex most and wants to do almost everything Alex does, it gets annoying but it's a little cute.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ok yeah yeah, what's with all the exposition I came her to read about a teenage girl filling out to the size of a blimp, well I like a little story behind the story will I'm reading this stuff so calm down here it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Alex's eye slid open to her alarm blipping  off almost emedently she slammed the snooze button and shuffled her weight to get more comfortable. Her small snooze didn't last though. Her mother called out to wake her up, \"Alex time to get up you'll be late for school... god... if you dont wake up your food will get cold.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    At that her eyes shot open. She lifted her arms and legs in the air and swung them to the side just to build up the momentum to get out of bed and land on her feet with a loud slam. Her mother had told her not to do it as it always made her think the ceiling was going to cave even when she was in soft ball (a code word for skinny). She rushed over to her dresser whos top was littered with softball trophies of a different life which she left behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She pulled on a pair of laggings which could have been a parachute for a small person. It got stuck bellow her butt cheeks for a second but slid past adventually. Alex let out a sigh of relief she didn't need to buy a new pair of laggings *yet*. She grabbed a large shirt with a famous Netflix character saying leggo my eggo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Alex grabbed hellboy volume 1 this should last her for the day until she could grab a new volume from the comic book store after school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Are you up Alex?\" Her mother shouted at the stair well ready to get her lazy daughter out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Coming mom,\" just grabbing a few things Clair replied a little annoyed. She had only ignored the call for breakfeast once and it had become her mother's routine to call her a third time everyday. \"Just gotta do some make up and I'll be right down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Alex trotted to the upstairs bathroom. Their was a full length mirror to her right she admired her self for a little bit.</span></div></div>",

She was dressed in ungodly tight skinny jeans with several holes in the front, some of them made by her rapid expansion. On top, she wore a long sleeved gray VS Pink shirt, with her cheerleader windbreaker left open over it. Despite the fact that she was off the squad, she could hardly process the reality and still dressed as though she was still cheering. She immediately went towards the athletic wing, calorie-laden Starbucks trienta in her chubby hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If cheer won't have my skills, then I guess another team will.' She thought with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she heaved her obesity through the halls of Jacobs Hill, she turned virtually every head in the building, but for all the wrong reasons. They stared at her in disgust. Her thighs shifted and oozed past one another, with clear wear on the inside of her jeans. her overfed belly bounced and heaved along with her heavy breasts, contained comically in a pushup bra. Her mouth hung open, her labored breath and heavy footfalls being very loud to bystanders and fellow pedestrians. She couldn't have interpreted this more incorrectly, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm! They love me! I see you all staring...' She thought and stepped up to the board of team listing, with three major options that appealed to her.</span></div></div>",

The two of them where on there free period so they decided to spend it eating. This was not uncommon for most of the female students just slightly more for Nichole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d Cassidy said after having a huge sip from her bucket sized Slurpy. On the side of the drink it said regular sized. Cassidy was another cheerleader who got kick of the team. She was thinner than Nichole a lot thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoining some sport I need to keep my girlish figure,\u201d at that note Nichole shifted her mass in the chair (barely moving because she did not really fit in the chair.) to do a sexy pose. Cassidy looked her up and down. She saw Nicky\u2019s (Nicholes nickname.) full frame on display. Nicky\u2019s face was plushy hiding away her check bones and falling in to a second chin. Her arms were pushing her DD sized breast together to make them look larger, needless to say it was not necessary. Said arms had two small pillows of fat attached to them. Right bellow her breast was a double laired belly that started to take up more residents on her lap every day. Speaking of her lap their was no gap that her tummy could slide through for her massive thunder thighs where in the way. Her ass which was fairly sized was almost stuck in the chair Cassidy gave it a thought and concluded that even if she joined track she would give it a month before Nichole would start getting stuck in chairs complaining that they must have changed out the chairs that couldn\u2019t handle her thick body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Cassidy said unimpressed with Nicky\u2019s ignorance. Nicky was the fattest girl in their grade but not by much. It was weird in this town for one reason or another after entering high school or moving in to this town all the women struggle to keep their weights down the reason for this is a mystery, some kind of curse, alien radiation, or perhaps it\u2019s just because of the high schools individual deals with a couple of fast food chains to keep the food in the school stocked not that Cassidy was complaining about the schools deal. Think all this over Cassidy looked down at her own body. She  did not have the same assets as her friend in the chest department being fairly flat with only a B sized bra to her name. She had a muffin top and saddle bags hanging over her belt. Her thighs touched but not half way down like Nicky and her ass was giving her a comfortably cushion on the seat. She thought to her self how long it was going to take before she would be Nicky\u2019s size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can do it,\u201d Nicky spat at Cassidy interrupting her train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d responded Cassidy nonchalant <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll prove you wrong!\u201d Nicky ate the last of the family sized bag of chips and waddled out of the room (presumably to get a slurpy from the schools caf\u00e9).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when you do I\u2019ll pay for lunch.\u201d Cassidy said from the corner of her mouth as she took one last slurp from her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day had gone pretty normally for Nicky going to classes, eating snacks through out the day, bumping into the larger students (Err I mean upper class men.). Nicky was stomping down the hall in frustration stripping out of her iced coffee, which might as well have been ice cream. Still frustrated at her friends disbelief in her she started to had home mumbling \u2018I\u2019ll show her\u2019. She was stopped in a crowd right in front of the doors out. \u2018What\u2019s going on\u2019 Nicky thought when she over heard a couple of boy students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, the seniors got themselves stuck in all the doors Again. It\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d Said the one boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Hey at least we get a better look at them.\u201d He sneakered getting up on his tippy toes to get a better view over the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018What pigs getting so fat as to get stuck in the doors,\u2019 Nicky thought as she ate a donut that she got from the cafe. Soon the staff came by and were able to pray them from the door frames while discussing upgrading the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy got on her bus and went home.</span></div></div>",

Letting loose a fart as she turned around, the surrounding students continued to stare at her in revulsion, still  amazed at how the grade's queen bee could experience such a downfall, and still act like she's hot shit even when she's at the bottom of the popularity chain. \"Ugh I'm starved.\" Nicole said to herself, clutching her massive belly as it roared for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the remainder of the day at school, Nicole drove her customized coupe home, where her two older twin sisters, Ella and Emily, were enjoying a lunch of bacon, egg and cheese bagels. Unlike Nicole, her two older sisters were rail thin, lacking any signs of curves. \"Hey Ella! Hey Emily!\" Nicole said, wheezing as she wiped the sweat off of her forehead from waddling into the house. \"Hey Nicole. We got you the cookies you asked for.\" Ella said emotionlessly as Nicole smiled greedily. She ripped the bag from her sisters hands, waddling into the living room and tearing open the bag, stuffing the cookies in her mouth quickly. Nicole savored the flavor of the cookies, licking her lips to capture all of the remaining crumbs. \"So good.\" She said to herself as she discarded the bag and wiped the crumbs off of her tight and messy clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was school today?\" Emily questioned as Nicole scratched her jiggly stomach. \"Same as usual. Except I decided to join the softball team.\" Nicole proudly said as her sisters let out a laugh. \"You playing softball? You get tired from walking around the house. What makes you think you could actively play a sport?\" Emily said as Nicole grabbed a bag of chips. \"I have to keep my status in school somehow. I was getting bored of cheer anyway.\" Nicole smugly replied as her sister's rolled her eyes. Nicole tried her best to ignore her complete downfall with false confidence, and it was pretty annoying. \"Whatever, I can't wait to see you on the field sis.\" Ella finished as she chuckled. \"Whatever.\" Nicole rolled her eyes while munching loudly of the chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Harris than came home with a huge takeout bag from Moe's Southwest Grill. Nicole licked her lips as her stomach roared once again. She greeted her mother with a quick hello before grabbing her deluxe steak burrito, quesadillas and nachos and started to pig out. \"Did anything interesting happen at school sweetie?\" She asked with a smile as Nicole let out a thunderous belch which shook the room. \"Yea, I decided to try out for the softball team.\" Nicole said, taking a rare break from devouring her food as Mrs. Harris' eyes widened. \"Are you sure you want to play for the team dear?\" She asked as Nicole let out a fart and stuffed her face with some quesadillas. \"I'm positive. I'm in the best shape I've ever been.\" She replied, taking a handful of nachos and dripping some cheese on her already stained blouse. Nicole polished off her meal then waddled into the other room to take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom.\" Ella and Emily simultaneously said as they walked in together. \"Hey girls. I got you the taco salads you asked for.\" \"Thanks.\" They said, sitting at the table and beginning to neatly eat. \"So did you two hear Nicole is trying out for softball?\" Mrs. Harris asked as the three girls laughed. \"That's gonna be too funny.\" Ella said as Emily nodded in agreement. \"She'll be off the team in a week, guaranteed.\" Emily said. \"How could she even run? She has to wheeze whenever she walks.\" Ella said as the sisters continued to laugh. Mrs. Harris was beginning to worry. \"I hope she doesn't embarrass herself too much out there.\"</span></div></div>",

There were two days between when Nicole signed up and when she would try out for softball, so they would have to make the most of what they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up on Tuesday to the smell of bacon flooding her nose, immediately roused and excited by it. She rolled quickly out of bed, her belly providing a good point of leverage to fling herself off. She heaved over to her dresser and pulled on a pair of black leggings which were slightly too small, allowing some of her skin to be seen through them. Following that, she pulled on a Paramore t-shirt, then a mint green North Face hoodie over that. She lazily brushed her hair and scrambled downstairs, finding her sisters preparing bacon, toast, eggs, you name it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God! That looks so good! How much is mine?\" She asked, automatically assuming she was entitled to at least a third, if not half of the feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it. You need to store up the energy for your big day on Thursday.\" Ella said with a forced smile, while suffering on the inside from getting up so early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole squeed in excitement and took a seat at the table while Emily served a plate of toast with butter, jam, and peanut butter spread over each piece, which she promptly dove into, smashing the toast into her greedy lips. Within the next twenty minutes, she managed to pack in at least twenty five hundred calories, more than a healthy man's general income. After belching and without thanking her sisters, as usual, she got up and grabbed her bag, then headed off to school, applying makeup to her messy face with one hand while she drove with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two days went very similarly, with Ella and Emily ensuring that their precious big little sister had plenty to eat at both breakfast and dinner, with plenty of snacks and perhaps a medicated milkshake in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school on Thursday, obese and somewhat high, Nicole showed up to tryouts in Adidas spandex and a Nike hoodie, her hair held back and her mind focused on performance.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't make contact with the ball, missed every grounder, dropped every catch, the only good value she bought to the team was the humor of her pants splitting when she bent down to field a hit. Suffice to say, the tryout was not a success, but that didn't effect Nicole's mindset. \"That was a great tryout. I'm a lock to make the team.\" She thought to herself while heavily wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the dugout, the rest of the ladies made sure to keep their distance from the former most popular girl in her grade. Nicole wreaked of body odor from all the exercise and she kept farting from the huge lunch of four burgers she had polished off earlier. \"Why is she even here?\" Ashley Rivera, one of the best players on the team asked her group of friends. \"She's just trying to regain her popularity. She's so stupid.\" Sarah Simms, the varsity captain, said as the majority of the girls laughed. Sarah had remembered Nicole from cheerleading. While she was popular, she always slacked and depended on her natural talent and looks instead of actually practicing, not to mention she was incredibly lazy. \"Is she really that bad?\" Gina Dash, a new student, asked as all the girls nodded. \"Yea, I remember last year, she started gaining weight and becoming a slob. Everyone alienated her. I felt kinda bad at first bur after she still acted stuck up, I felt no sympathy.\" Ashley responded. \"It's the first pig I've ever seen act so spoiled. Usually they just eat their guts out and smell like shit.\" Sarah said as the girls hilariously laughed. Nicole couldn't hear them, since she was so focused on eating the chips she had packed in her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was I cut!?\" Nicole asked herself, looking at the list Coach Bauman tweeted the next day. There were only two names, but she was one of them, along with Kat Sarnicki, a new exchange student that she had never heard of. \"Whatever, I'm too good for sports anyway.\" Nicole said as her stomach groaned. \"I'll just cut next period and get some lunch. It doesn't matter.\" Nicole said as the bell rang, prompting her to waddle to the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wheezed a sigh of relief as she reached the cafeteria. While she used to sit with her friends, she now sat by herself, stuffing her face with as much food as she could eat in the forty-five minute lunch period. She set down her bag and waddled to the lunch lime, picking at the wedgie her tight Jacobs Hill cheer sweatpants were forming. The popular girls table, where Nicole used to sit, laughed at her as she waddled by. \"I can't believe I was her best friend.\" Melissa Frank thought to herself as Nicole slowly made her way to the lunch line. \"They're just jealous of me.\" She wheezed to herself, letting out a belch as she reached the back of the line. Students in front of her held their noses as they scented her repulsive aroma. Nicole was sweating just from the short walk. As she waited, a girl walked up to her. She looked foreign, s little chubby in the middle and was all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I recognize you from the softball tryouts. I am Kat. Kat Sarnicki.\" She said as Nicole rolled her eyes. \"Yea, yea, yea. Whatever. Listen, a girl like me can't be seen with someone like you. I'm actually popular.\" Nicole replied as Kat chuckled. \"For being the school laughing stock? Please, everyone on the team was making fun of you yesterday.\" Kat responded. \"Thats.... Not true.\" Nicole quietly said as Kat rolled her eyes. \"Ugh, whatever. Surely your already low reputation can't be ruined that much by me talking to you could it?\" Kat asked as Nicole shrugged her flabby shoulders. \"I guess not.\" Nicole said as Kat stood next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the front of the lunch line, Nicole ordered a whopping three burgers and two chicken sandwiches, but Kat followed it up by ordering two burgers and two sandwiches, which surprised Nicole. \"You can eat that much?\" Nicole asked, grabbing two bags of Doritos and two bottles of Vitamin Water. \"Yea. I'm from Poland, so I'm just getting used to all of this American food.\" Kat responded as Nicole started thinking to herself. \"Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe I could trick this girl into feeding me. That could save me a lot of energy.\" Nicole thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

We don't really have those in Poland.\" Kat said as she walked with Nicole towards the entrance. \"You can do anything here. Eat, shop, watch movies, or just hang out. I used to go here all the time with my friends.\" Nicole said. \"Then what happened?\" Kat asked as Nicole sighed. \"They're always busy for some reason. I'm sure they'll be free one day.\" Nicole said as they entered the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat's jaw dropped when she stepped foot into the mall. She was amazed by the scene of all the shops, all the food places, and all the people. \"Come on, let's go to the food court first Imm starved!\" Nicole said as she waddled ahead towards the food court. Kat followed, slowing her pace to stay next to her obese friend. \"I wish the walk to the food court was shorter.\" Nicole wheezed, with her face turning red and sweat beginning to form. \"What do they have at the food court?\" Kat asked. \"You could get pizza, burgers, chicken, Chinese food, hot dogs, literally anything you want! My mouth is watering from just listing the options.\" Nicole said, reaching the escalator that led to the food court. \"Ugh, I can't wait. I'm so starving!\" Nicole excitedly announced as Kat looked at her perplexed. \"Even after your giant lunch?\" Kat questioned as Nicole licked her lips. \"You have to get used to American culture.

As she was calmly eating her meal, Nicole came waddling over balancing a massive amount of trays. She had meals from Popeye's, Panda Express, Wendy's, Sbarro and Taco Bell. \"Let's eat!\" She yelled as she dug into her humongous meal. Bits of food dropped onto her clothes and face as she ate like she was possessed. She looked like a pig, sloppily stuffing her face as farts slipped out while she ate. \"Is this what all Americans are like?\" Kat laughed to herself as she was mesmerized by the way Nicole ate. \"That food was so good.\" Nicole said, clutching her stomach after she finished the remains of her feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else is there to do here?\" Kat asked as the two girls walked around the mall slowly, still full from their respective meals. \"We could go shopping. One of my favorite stores is up ahead.\" Nicole said as she waddled into Lane Bryant, the only store that had comfortable clothing in her elephantine size. Walking in, one of the employees sighed. She recognized this slobbish girl since she came at least once a week into the store. Picking out some blouses that would soon be stained, Nicole happily whipped out her credit card to pay for the clothes. Kat looked around the store and saw that all of the customers were overweight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get any clothes Kat?\" Nicole asked as Kat shook her head. \"That store's not really for me. I don't need plus sized clothes.\" Kat said as Nicole turned red with anguish. \"These aren't plus sized clothes!\" Nicole screamed as Kat laughed. \"Then how come every girl in there was fat?\" Kat asked as Nicole rolled her eyes. \"I don't know. It's just what's in style right now.\" Nicole said as a fart slipped out in the middle of her rant. \"You're funny Nicole. I'm glad we're friends.\" Kat said as Nicole smiled back. Kat could be a headache sometimes but at least she was nice.</span></div></div>",

She stood up from her chair and cracked her back, stripped naked, then walked across the hall to take a shower at the tender hour of five thirty in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sufficiently clean, she came back over to her bedroom and pulled on a pair of gray leggings, then a black hoodie with the Sky High Volleyball Club logo on it in red.

Her eyes were bloodshot and accentuated by dark circles under them. Unfortunately, this had become a very common theme.

We have a job on the same high school, it's awesome\u201d A very eager Lara Reiner said to her sister as she took a big bite out of a donut. Lara was very different to her sister Lauren, first and foremost their skin color was quite different, while Lauren had a tanned body and brunette hair Lara was more of a peachy color with brown hair, both differentiated them the most was their personality and attitude towards fat: Lara was way more carefree than her sister, while Lauren spend hours training and exercising to maintain her perfect figure Lara stayed at her couch all day eating popcorn, if it wasn't for her inhuman metabolism Lara would be giant butterball right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm quite happy about but I know you way to well, tell me that you're going to watch what you eat while you're working\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on sis, you know I've never put a single pound\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLara, you aren't a kid anymore, you're 24, your metabolism will start to slow down and if you don't watch your diet and exercise you're going to end up as that Melanie Bauman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeeeah, funny that you mention her... She's the teacher that I'm going to be assisting\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?! Lara, have you seen how much that pig eats? And worst of all is that her students give her a ton of candy every day. Lara, I'm serious, I really hope you keep your diet and don't end up as big if not bigger than her\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, jeez, you don't have to scream, I promise that I'll stay on my diet\u201d Lara said as she took the final bite out of her donut, unknowingly to her sister, Lara had actually crossed her finger behind her back, Lauren was worrying too much. Lara wasn't the brightest girl in the world, she relied on her looks and her curves, she had a perfectly trim belly, a beautiful face with gorgeous emerald eyes, her breast might not be the biggest ever but they were nice and perky, plus, she made up for it with her great behind, just like her sister Lara was gifted with a very generous ass, she took a lot of pride in it and try to show it as much as possible with mini skirts and booty-shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on in the day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara was on her way to meet up with Melanie, she just had a big snack and yet she was eating some chips on her way to the classroom, she had to admit that the food was really good and with the teacher discount that the school had given her she planned on eating there quite frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, she was the first in the classroom, the chairs were really comfortable for her, something that she wasn't really used to as her large behind usually had trouble sitting in normal chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud footsteps could be heard from the hallway coming closer to the classroom, shortly after, the bulky english teacher body made itself known, Melanie was downright fat in anyone's eyes: her belly hung down to her thighs, her breast were beginning to sag down, her face was puffy with a prominent double chin, her butt was enormous (Lara now realized why the chairs were so big, it was obvious that they had her in mind when they brought them in). Lara had a mixture of disgust and intrigue on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hello! You must be Lara, right? I'm Melanie, sorry for the delay, as you can tell I'm not the fittest person here\u201d Melanie patted her belly to reaffirm her point \u201cPlease, grab some candy, I have a bit too much even for me, the kids always give me some of their own, they're in part guilty for my weight\u201d Melanie said with a smile as she gave Lara a couple of chocolate bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's eyes light up as she heard the magnificent news if the kids always gave Melanie sweets that would mean that they would also give her a ton of sweets, and if they didn't she could always eat some from Melanie's drawer while she was giving the class \u201cIt's going to be a pleasure working with you\u201d Lara said as she greedily took a bite out of a chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn class, things went just as Lara expected, all the kids were very kind and nice to Melanie and she handled the class without needing her help at all, meaning that she could just sit there and snack all day. As the class was about to end Melanie had to go grab some things from her car, so she asked Lara to help her clean the class in the meantime<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhg, I can't believe she expects me to grab a broom and clean this up-munch- I'm not the one that made it dirty in the first please, the kids should-\u201d Lara just had a brilliant idea, she stood up and selected a couple of girls to make her dirty work \u201cHey kids, I know we don't know each other very well, but I want to make a good impression with you, how about this: you three clean up this class and I'll be sure to give you some extra credit\u201d Lara didn't even finish her sentence before the three pudgy girls started to clean everything in seconds, meanwhile she just sat in her chair and kept on snacking, this was a good year.</span></div></div>",
