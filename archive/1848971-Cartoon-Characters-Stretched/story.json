            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a prett slow Friday for the penguins. They were so bored in fact, that they were helping Marlene redecorate her habitat. It wasn't anything too difficult. They were just listening to Marlene for where to put everything. While the other 3 penguins were busy moving something, only Private was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Private, could you move that couch over there.\" Marlene said pointing to the furthest corner of her habitat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Marlene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate got down getting ready to lift one end of the particularly heavy couch. As he came up with it, he felt a shock of pain go through his back. He dropped the couch and placed his flippers on his back. He turned to Marlene and with gritted beak said \"I'm going to go do something over there.\" Private carefully walked out of Marlene's habitat. Private finally made it to his own home and did whatever he could to relieve the pain. Nothing worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 3 hours passed and the remaining penguins arrived seeing Private with a pack of ice on his back.<br>\r\n\"Private. What's wrong? We haven't seen you for hours. \"Oh nothing Skipper. I just hurt my back.\" Private grunted as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKowlaki interjected \" private, I have an idea on how to fix your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is kowalski's idea.</span></div></div>",

Though his back hurt so much he was willing to do anything to soothe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked toward the machine. As he approached it, he noticed it a looked a lot like a mid evil torture device. \"Are you sure this will work?\" He began climbing into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolproof.\" Kowalski assured him. \"Just get in and I'll get you all set up.\" Private did as he was told and climbed in. Kowalski started by clamping his feet to the bottom crank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you lift your arms up? Thank you.\" As Private lifted his arms, Kowalski also clamped those. Private was getting very anxious at this point. Who knows what could go wrong from this? He was in a lot of pain and was willing to do anything to fix it. The next thing he knew, Kowalski had begun. Private heard a crank turn as he started to feel his flippers and feet being pulled apart from each other. Initially, he felt a crack in his back, nothing more than a pinch. From that point, nothing but relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRico and Skipper looked on at amazement at what was happening. Kowalski kept the cranking mechanism going as Private felt his back continue cracking as the machine continue pulling on his flippers and feet. Soon, Private felt the cold cement floor touch his feet, a bit odd considering he was suspended on the machine, but he didn't think much of it due to the pure bliss he felt. The process continued. After a while, Private was finally done and asked Kowalski to stop. Kowalski did as he was asked from Private. It only took a few seconds, but to Private it felt like minutes. He couldn't believe how amazing he felt. There was only one thing that was kind of odd as he climbed down, losing a bit of his balance. Kowalski, Skipper, and Rico were all looking UP at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow tall was Private stretched?</span></div></div>",

Thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate was also impressed with his new height. It rarely showed but he was fairly self-conscious about his height. He knew that he was the youngest and would still grow a bit, but it still bugged him being so small, it was as if no one else on the team would take him seriously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, now it would probably be best for you to rest up a bit. That was a lot of stress that was put on your back.\" Kowalski suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate agreed and walked toward his bunk. Skipper and Rico were still a little shocked. They were so used to being taller than Private and with him being significantly taller than them, they were a little bothered by that. Skipper figured it was a pretty good time for everyone to get some shut eye, especially after a hard day's work at Marlene's. Skipper ordered everyone else to a good night's sleep and climbing in his bunk, he realized that Private was having an issue squeezing into his bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Rico, could you cut out a little bit of my bunk, it seems to be too short now.\" Private said with an embarrassed smile. Rico barfed up a jackhammer and cut out a decent sized chunk of Private's cement bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Private said stretching out in his bunk as Rico climbed into his own bunk. As the three other penguins dozed off, Private couldn't help but stay awake a tad longer, just thinking what his new height will do for his role in the team. And with that, he fell asleep, ready for the next day's adventure.</span></div></div>",

They didn't know If Kowalski was being serious. Everything was still. Then, one of them<br>\r\ngrabbed Private. He took Private's arms in one hand, legs in the other, and pulled apart with all the strength he had. It felt so wonderful to private. He looked at his chest, and saw there was a good five feet between his toes and his beak. All Skipper and Kowalski could do was sit there dumbfounded. <br>\r\n\" Stop. I'm better now,\" said Private.<br>\r\nThe gorilla who stretched Private handed him over to the other gorilla, who then put him down.<br>\r\n\" Thanks, guys,\" said Private as they started to walk away.<br>\r\n\" Wait,\" said one of the gorillas.</span></div></div>",

It sure was!\" Private exclaimed, wobbling a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and began walking back with Skipper and Kowalski, whom he now towered over. It wasn't really easy for him to stand up straight. Having been stretched to 5 feet tall, he wasn't used to how it was to move. Sometimes his back would arch back and forth, swinging around his arms to gain some balance. Skipper and Kowalski were a bit concerned how this would effect Private. All three finally made it back home with Rico keeping watch, making sure to cover if Alice came around. Rico was able to see Private well before Skipper and Kowalski.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Rico!\" Private said, wobbling a bit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" was all Rico could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Not exactly what I was expecting but I love it! I feel great, not to mention it's pretty neat being taller.\" Private began twisting his back to get any kinks out, being able to easily twist his upper torso an entire 360 degrees from his lower torso now. \"I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready for some shut eye.\" Private yawned. It was especially odd in how Private was now forced to get into their underwater habitat. He laid across the cement island and grabbed onto the railing of their habitat and guided his feet down the ladder and he slowly pushed off the rail and climbed into the habitat. Once in, he had to arch his back fairly significantly just to fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipper, Kowalski, and Rico soon followed. \"Rico! Give young Private here a nice cot to sleep on.\" Skipper commanded. As always, Rico barfed up a nice, long cot for Private to sleep on. There was no way that he was going to fit in his old bunk. He lied down and stretched out his back a bit, easily lining a large majority of the wall in front of the other penguin's beds. \"Lights out men.\" Skipper said as he flipped into his bed, with Kowalski and Rico soon following. Private couldn't feel any better, physically or emotionally. Kowalski felt a little guilty, putting Private in a potentially dangerous situation. He had only meant for the gorillas to give Private's back a little tug, not a full on stretch. But yet, Kowalski couldn't but help feel a little envious. He was so accustomed to being the tallest in the group, but all of the sudden, he wasn't even close! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to do something about it.\" Kowalski mumbled so no one else could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lied there for a few minutes until he could hear the soft breathing of his comrades. Once he knew everyone was asleep, he carefully climbed out of bed, avoiding Private, and sneaked into his lab to fix the situation.</span></div></div>",

They gave each other a look and knew that the other was thinking the same thing. They both started with the two other susceptible penguins standing right in front of them.  Bada grabbed Skipper and Bing took hold of Kowalski. Bada stretched Skipper's neck out a fairly significant length and set him back down. At the same time, Bing grabbed Kowalski's beak and gave it a nice tug, enough to stretch it out a foot. Soon after placing down the two penguins, Bada and Bing made a run for it, hoping to stretch out the rest of the zoo animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Private helped Skipper and Kowalski regain their composure, they all hopped out of the gorilla's pen. Landing outside Skipper shouted \"Catch those gorillas!\" pointing his flipper. Having an elongated neck gave him the oddest feeling, moving his flipper so far away from his head. Although, all three had trouble running towards the gorillas. Private had trouble standing up straight enough to run, Kowalski's elongated beak make it trouble-some to keep his head up, and Skipper was having trouble keeping his neck straight. Not too long into the chase, the three penguins heard Julien screaming. \"Quick: to the lemur pen.\" Skipper ordered. Although the got there as quick as they could, they weren't quick enough. They got there just in time to see Bada and Bing each pulling one of Julien's arms, stretching them the length of the lemur habitat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey couldn't do much in their current state so they made the decision to go back to their own habitat and regroup with Rico before deciding what to do next. Climbing down their ladder, the altered penguins found Rico...</span></div></div>",

Private, Kowalski, and Rico joined him to listen in.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Skipper started. \"As you know, as penguins, we are quite in comparison to other animals in the zoo, which is high impractical for what we do.\" Kowalski looked at Private, both not sure where Skipper was going with this. \"Because of this, I have a proposal for a small 'competition'.\" Skipper air quoted with his flippers. \"We will each have a week, by any means necessary to gain as much height as possible.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Skipper.\" Kowalski interjected. \"Are you sure that's the best idea?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course it is! So it's settled. We will avoid seeing each other for the next week. As you will see, there is the schedule for when each of you may leave your respective rooms to do whatever is necessary.\" Skipper pointed over to the white board with a picture of each of the four penguins. Under each picture was the time of day that each penguin could leave their room. Kowalski during the morning, Rico in the afternoon, Private in the evening, and Skipper at night.<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute Skippa.\" Private said. \"You said this was a competition. How and what do we win?\"<br>\r\n\"Simple Private. The winner is who ever gains the most height and they win an entire week off to do as you wish.\"<br>\r\nThis was the best incentive to give any of the penguins. They've never had the opportunity to get an entire week off. Perhaps a day or two, but never an entire week. Skipper could instantly see the motivation raise in each of the penguins.<br>\r\n\"Alright Kowalski, you're up first. Good luck.\" As the 3 other penguins left the table for their rooms, Kowalski knew exactly what he was going to do.</span></div></div>",

He was going to utilize his crank-o-tronic spinal straightener. After hurting Mason's back with a bucket, Rico was chosen to test it in front of the chimps and it worked to perfection, for a little bit. Kowalski figured that with a more routine use of the spinal straightener that his spine would set into place rather than only growing temporarily. Strapping himself into the machine, Kowalski had his computer automatically begin the process. With a small tug, Kowalski felt his legs get further and further from his flippers. With a few grunts, Kowalski felt the machine reach it's capacity in pulling and the machine stopped. Kowalski couldn't help but smirk at how successful it was. He also couldn't notice how surprisingly comfortable this position was. He had decided it wouldn't hurt to sleep in this position, giving him several hours to set his back in and use the rest of the day to get used to his height and rest his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours after the first session, Kowalski was released from the grips and safely dropped to the floor. Not a far drop by any means. Kowalski then realized that the crank-o-tronic spinal straightener wouldn't be of much use at it's current length. Given he was already in his room, Kowalski had all the time he needed to grow, so while it was now Rico's time to leave, Kowalski modified the spinal straightener that would allow him to continually make the length of the machine longer and longer as needed. Night finally came with all the necessary modifications set in place. It was a strange few hours for Kowalski getting used to his new height. By time it was time for bed, Kowalski rigged the machine to his new height. His plan was almost working, while he was still taller, he was far from as tall as he was after the first session. Having an entire night on the machine should drastically help that process. Kowalski hopped in the machine and had his computer turn it on. Once again, the process began and the machine stopped seconds later. Getting comfortable in this position, Kowalski drifted off to sleep ready to win this thing.</span></div></div>",

Starting to get bored at this point, with no ideas, Rico looked to the clock and noticed it his him time to leave.<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" was all he could shout. Excited to get out of his room, looking for inspiration, Rico climbed out of the habitat and wandered outside of the zoo. After a few minutes of walking around, Rico noticed the printing company that he and the crew once had to deal with. Trying to stop the secret of the penguins antics...and Skipper's toilet paper problem. Rico couldn't help but chuckle back to that.<br>\r\nHis eyes lit up as he had the sudden realization of what he would do. Sneaking into the printing press room, Rico passed the ink machine right into the pressing room. Looking around for the right machine he noticed a small press that continually went back and forth. The perfect machine for what Rico was trying to do. Looking around to make sure no humans were around, he turned on the machine and hopped in. Grabbing onto the side of the conveyor belt, Rico steadied himself for the machine. He let go and slowly approached the presser. Normally Rico would be a littler nervous, but going through these sort of machines already, he was more than ready for it. Slowly he was pressed back and forth for a few few hours until he looked up to the clock and noticed his time was almost up.

Being jarred awake, Private rubbed his eyes and noticed it was time to head out. He climbed out of his bed and climbed out of the habitat. Walking through Central Park, Private heard his stomach grumble a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I guess I haven't eaten much since breakfast this morning.\" Private knew exactly where he was and decided to quickly sneak into the Winky factory, knowing that it would be closed this time in the evening. Reaching the building, he hopped into the ventilation shaft he was all too familiar with. As he belly slid through the vents on the way to the winky delivery room, Private felt the ventilation shaft collapse beneath him. Falling through the air, the next thing Private knew he was neck deep in a vat of sticky pink goop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum. Taffy.\" Private said giving it a taste test. Private tried to jump out, but the taffy was too thick and sticky. \"Uh oh.\" Private was defeated, until he heard the taffy puller whir into action. Private got ready to grab onto the machine as it descended. At the last second Private \"jumped\" up, but lost his balance and fell forward, trying to use his flippers to gain balance, he felt the the first set of grabbers grab onto his flipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate felt a little uneasy, now that he was stuck. The second set of claws grabbed into the chunk of taffy that Private's feet were still stuck. Private couldn't help but give a gulp and small scream. The next thing he knew, the taffy machine started to pull him and twist him up. After a few minutes, Private felt the machine place him back down on a conveyor belt leading to the packaging department. Private used this time to pluck out the taffy restraining his feet and rolled off the conveyor belt onto the floor. A little upset of what happened, Private angrily walked out the building plucking out some taffy out of his feathers. Private reached the zoo and his habitat knowing he'd be spending the next day pulling out taffy out of his feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate opened his room and climbed into his bed, or rather, he tried to. Private noticed that the bunk was a bit too small. Not sure of what was going on, he walked over to the mirror and noticed that he had gained some considerable amount of height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That machine actually worked.\" Private said astonished. He then started to give it some thought. Doing this everyday could actually work. If he played his cards right, he could avoid all the taffy and just use the machine. Private climbed into a cot beside the bed knowing that he now had the perfect way of growing the most. He was ready for his week break for sure. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He heard Private mumbling and slamming the door and he knew it was time to go, looking at the clock in his room for verification. Skipper took off and walked to the pre-determined location at the west edge of the zoo. Skipper knew Kowalski would be using an invention of his and Rico would do whatever Rico does, but there's one that Skipper has, he's persuasive. He had enlisted the services of Bada and Bing to help him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipper arrived and noticed two shadows in the background. \"You got the bananas?\" Bada asked emerging from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In due time. We still have a week, then you'll get your bananas.\" Bada and Bing agreed and started what they were asked to do. In the darkness of the zoom, Bada grabbed Skippers arms and Bing grabbed onto his ankles. Both tugged onto Skipper until he had reached his limit. \"Alright. Hold it!\" Skipper said. At this point, for the next few hours, Bada and Bing pulled with a little tension until it was time for Skipper to return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright gorillas. I'll see you tomorrow night.\" Skipper said as he was put down and walked back to the habitat. Admiring at how well it was working, he was certain he would win. Of course, not for a week long break, but just the gratification of winning and being the tallest of the penguins. Skipper hopped into his habitat and heard a small cranking sound come from Kowalski's room as he closed the door of his room.</span></div></div>",

While he had grown slightly, about a foot, the gorilla idea didn't work as well as he'd hoped. While the pulling definitely helped stretch the length of his arms, his height wasn't overly impressive. A little upset, Skipper walked over and knocked on Rico's door with his elongated flippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming.\" Rico shouted in his usual grunts. Skipper saw the door handle turn and saw Rico emerge from the darkened room. Rico had to duck a little bit to fit through the door, his mohawk rubbing against the door. \"Ta-da!\" he shouted realizing he was a lot taller than Skipper. He had a shot. One thing Skipper couldn't help but notice was how thin Rico had become. Almost paper thin. \"Uh. Are you Ok there Rico?\" Skipper asked looking up. \"Yep.\" Rico grunted quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching around Rico, Skipper knocked on Kowalski's door. \"Come on out Kowalski.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Skipper.\" Kowalski shouted from inside. As the door opened, Rico suddenly frowned seeing nothing but Kowalski's body through the door. Kowalski stepped forward with a sudden thud and a recoiling Kowalski. \"Owwie.\" Kowalski shrieked, as his flipper raised above the top of the door, to rub his head. Kowalski emerged and ducked below the door way, using his flipper as a guide, not used to being out of his lab for almost an entire week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKowalski stood straight up for the first time in a while, having to tilt his head to avoid hitting the ceiling. \"Well. Looks like I'm winning this.\" Kowalski smiled, noticing how much taller he was than Rico or Skipper. He didn't think Private stood a chance. Once again science led him to victory. \"Now hold on there. We still got Private.\" Skipper said knocking on Private's door from across the room. \"Private!\" No answer. \"PRIVATE!\" Skipper shouted, figuring he had fallen asleep. There was a small tap coming from the outside of the porthole behind Skipper. Behind him, he saw Private's face swimming around. Private pointed toward the surface signifying everyone to get outside. Kowalski stuck his head out of the hidden fish bowl first, mostly to stretch out his back fully, but also to see if the coast was clear. Seeing it was, he began to climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the first time he's been outside in over a week, Kowalski cupped his eyes with his flippers to keep the sun out. Rico followed and finally Skipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Private. I said to be in your rooms, ready to come out in 5 minutes.\" Skipper noticed Private's head sticking out of the water will a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Skipper. I haven't had time to get into my room recently.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Kowalski asked, a little worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Private said as he used his flippers to hop onto the platform. He pulled himself up and emerged from the water, for several seconds. It didn't take long for Private to reach Kowalski's height, with no end in sight. Finally, with a new upset Kowalski, he saw Private tower over him. He was slightly taller than he was after being hit with Kowalski's super ray when dealing with the giant Mort. \"I would have like to, but my room got too cramped after last night, so I just spent the last night swimming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...good job Private.\" Kowalski said looking down. All that time he spent in his lab for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, congratulations Private.\" Skipper said, reaching up to shake his flipper. Even with his elongated flippers, he still had some trouble reaching Private's. Private couldn't help smiling, getting ready for an entire week off. \"Thank you so much Skippah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone. Get ready to head on out tomorrow, except Private. Who knows what trouble the zoo has been in for the last week.\" Skipper said encouragingly. And look at it this way. With Kowalski being as tall as all four of us once were, Rico's 'flat-ness' and my flippers, we'll be an awesome crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose you're right.\" Kowalski said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Rico grunted. As Kowalski, Rico climbed down into the habitat, Skipper asked if Private would like to join them for dinner. \"Actually if you don't mine Skippa, could you make the base a little bit bigger, and my room too, so I can fit a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Private. You deserve it.\" Skipper said looking up at his tall friend. \"Great! For now though, I think I'll stay with Roger until you get that sorted out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll have Rico right on that. It should be ready for tomorrow. Enjoy your week off.\" Skipper said, waving to Private. Private waved back and headed towards Roger's habitat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was just a sense that since Rico and Kowalski were larger than him, that he couldn't be taken seriously as a leader, but Skipper had an idea to increase his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's see how this works.\" Skipper whispered from Kowalski's lab as his squad slept. He had tied a fairly large amount of weight around his ankles and he was standing beneath a pole, just a few inches from his grasp. With all his strength he jumped up and grabbed onto the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha!\" Skippers shouted, probably a bit to loud, but nothing that would wake his teammates. He just hung there for a few minutes, slowly feeling his back stretch out, straining to hold on, but Skipper wasn't willing to let that stop him, so he held on. In no time at all, he felt his feet firmly planted on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked.\" Skipper was amazed. He knew this would be a work in progress, since he didn't want to put too much strain on his back at once, nor did he want his team to notice what he was doing.

Skipper had to continually find taller and taller bars to hang from to adjust for his increasing height. He sneaked back into his bed, noticing it was starting to get smaller and smaller on him, and he couldn't be happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Skipper got up, right on time along with Private, Kowalski, and Rico. The four gathered around the table for a quick breakfast before they were forced to get out in time for the zoo to open. Standing there, just about to eat his fish sandwich, Kowalski couldn't help but notice Skipper's height change. He never really noticed, but now that Skipper was just as tall as Rico, it was a little more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Skipper. Have you gotten any taller recently?\" Kowalski had to ask. It was very possible that Rico was just a bit crouched down and it looked as if Skipper was taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I do suppose I may have grown.\" Skipper said innocently. There was no way that he was going to let his team know what was going on. Kowalski was a bit skeptical, since Skipper had stopped and should have stopped growing for quite a while now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipper didn't think Kowalski didn't have any idea so he didn't worry too much about it. After a quick 10 minute breakfast, the 4 of them headed out to the outside just in time for visitors to start watching them. The daily routine was significantly easier for Skipper, given how much more limber he was and the strength he's gained from holding on to the weights that pull down his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Skipper more than loved he was now the second tallest penguin of the group, he had a decision to make. Was he going to stay like this and end his routine or would he keep on going until he was taller than Kowalski?</span></div></div>",

Waiting a few hours until he was certain the penguins wouldn't return for anything, he hopped over his habitat wall and into the habitat of the penguins. Julien approached the fish bowl entrance he was so accustomed to entering. He tried to move it, yet it wouldn't budge and over the next few minutes, he tried as many ideas as possible and that fishbowl was stuck. An idea popped into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MORT!\" Julien chimed, and before he could look down, he felt Mort cling to his legs. A little disgusted, Julien peeled Mort off and fashioned his tail into a makeshift wrench. With a few tugs with his \"wrench\" the fish bowl moved and the entrance was open. Unfortunately, the force of pulling the fish bowl forced Julien into the water along with Mort. Soaked, Julien jumped out of the pool and into the newly opened habitat. Wandering around for a few minutes, Julien found himself inside Kowalski's lab, filled with many beakers and several machines. Julien wasn't too impressed and still soaked, he looked for whatever he could to dry his fur. Suddenly he noticed a giant tube in the corner of the room that had a giant fan at the top. Julien thought that machine had to be able to dry his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulien walked over to the machine and noticed a pair of boots bolted down to the ground for some odd reason. Just wanting to dry his fur, Julien hopped into the machine and closed the door. A little confused, he strapped on the boots and got ready to start the machine. Noticing the giant red button inside the machine, Julien didn't hesitate to begin. While waiting for the machine to warm up, Julien heard the fan above start to rotate. And then it got faster and faster. This fan, however, didn't blow air down towards Julien, the air sucked up out of the tube. Regardless, Julien could feel the extra water that hadn't already dripped off get sucked out of his fur. By time Julien was ready to get out of the machine, the fan continued to get faster and faster pulling with more force. This made it impossible for Julien to reach over and press the button as his arms were forced straight up. The fan continually got faster for the next few minutes until it just stopped. The door opened automatically and Julen stood there blinking, his arms still up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unbuckled the boots and got out, marveling at how nice his fur felt. Not thinking much of anything and getting through that ordeal, Julien decided it was best just to return home and rest on his throne the rest of the day. Being one of his lazy days, Julien spent the next few hours just on his throne doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much did Julien grow in that time?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julien couldn't help notice the 4 penguins packing up, most likely going on an extended \"mission.\" Probably one of his favorite times because he can wander into the Penguin's habitat whenever he wants. He likes to make the penguins think that their booby traps are still effective, but Julien figured out how to avoid them many months before. A devilish smile crept on Julien's face waiting in anticipation for the penguins' departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after, Julien saw Skipper barking some orders to the other penguins as Kowalski was messing around with an electronic keyboard, most certainly activating the habitat's security and hologram system. As expected a hologram copy of the four penguins were projected onto the top of the habitat. The penguins then hopped out and belly slid to the outer gates of the zoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mort, Maurice!\" Julien shouted out. Before Julien could look down, Maurice and Mort were standing at the bottom of his throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright Your Majesty?\" Maurice said panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is fine. We will be sneaking into the penguin home now.\" Julien replied. Maurice rolled his eyes knowing that their many trips into the Penguin habitat has never worked out. It's usually a whole lot of nothing. Despite his objections, there was no reason to argue with Julien so the trio of lemurs hopped the fence into the penguin habitat. On queue, Mort and Maurice went to their stations. Each of them had a specific thing that needed done to unlock the top hatch. Just as Julien tries to move the hatch, the unlock key-code pad opens and Maurice puts in the code and being the unlock-key code for the actual key-code pad located underwater on the north side of the habitat, Mort swam waiting for the pad to reveal itself. Upon doing so, Mort entered the code and heard the whoosh sound as the habitat unlocked and the interior defense system deactivated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulien and Maurice hopped in and did a quick glance. Nothing out of the ordinary. Suddenly a soaking wet Mort fell through the hatch and landed on Maurice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mort.\" Maurice said with a grunt knocking Mort off. Julien stood staring at the doorway leading into Kowalski's lab. He couldn't help but noticed a small crack in the door indicating it was slightly opened. The lemurs have never had any luck getting into Kowalski's lab before and Julien was ecstatic at the chance. Julien opened the door hesitantly and entered with Maurice soon after him. Upon entering, the lab lit up automatically and a voice from the computer turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Kowalski.\" The computer said in a voice, not too different from Doris'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening.\" Kowalski said from behind them. Maurice and Julien froze and turned around quickly, finding no one but Mort. A sigh of relief later and Julien said. \"I did not know you could be doing that Mort!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been practic...\" Mort cleared his throat. \"I've been practicing.\" He said in his normally high voice. Knowing that they were out of harm's way, the lemurs ventured further into the scientist penguin's lab marveling at all the amazing inventions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mort. How would you like to try out these shiny things?\" Julien asked. Always the optimist, Mort gladly accepted the offer and Julien led him to a particularly interesting machine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julien was looking around, mostly as a way to get back at Mort for scaring them with his voice stunt a little while ago and was planning on doing so by making Mort test one of Kowalski's inventions. Looking at the Crankatronic Spinal Straightener II as it was labeled on top made this invention seem very familiar. He then remembered back to one of his massage sessions with Maurice, while waiting for Maurice to arrive, Julien sat on his belly on his smoothie bar table and saw across the habitat into the chimp habitat and saw Private wheel up a machine to show off to Mason, the chimp. While slightly intriguing, Julien didn't see what happened as Maurice arrived and began the massage. Not long after Maurice finished the session, the penguins arrived asking for Maurice's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulien chose to try out this machine, just wanting to see what it does. He grabbed Mort and chucked him at the machine, and with a clang, he was locked in by shackles at his feet and hands. Without hesitation, Julien ran by the side of the machine and pulled the lever attached. A small mechanic whirring sound from the machine as the machine began to do it's work. As the shackles around Mort's hands and feet grew greater distance from each other, Mort couldn't help chuckle at the tickling sensation from the machine. Not too long after, the machine finished and Mort was released. Still laughing and wiping a tear from his eye, he walked in the general direction of King Julien and looked up. Almost shockingly, he was eye to eye with the ring-tail lemur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh. I feel all stretchy.\" Mort said admiring his new length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maurice! Do you know what this means!?\" Julien exclaimed excitedly. \"I can become the tallest king ever!\" Julien shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh. Are you okay there Mort?\" Maurice asked, seeing Mort having some trouble with balance. \"Uh-huh.\" Mort said, leaning against the machine. Julien was excited at the possibilities of this machine, but still he wouldn't be stretched too far at the machine's current set-up. As Mort was trying to regain his balance, he noticed a few buttons at the top of the machine that he was now able to reach with his new height. Never wanting to pass up button pushing, he pressed a button, and as the machine whirred, a pondering Julien stood around only to be hit in the back by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooorrtt!\" Julien shouted as he fell. Mort couldn't have made a more perfect mistake. The machine had itself stretched out a bit to accommodate for taller animals. This day could not be going more perfect for Julien. Even still, he wasn't sure if he wanted to try it out or have Maurice give it a go, just to make sure it was perfectly safe. </span></div></div>",
