You walk over to the center of the room where the counter is. You buy your ticket to the movie you want to see(Strangely, this theater is playing several old classic movies along with the new ones. They are even showing some XXX movies! A special promotion perhaps?) along with all the snacks 10 bucks will buy(Not alot with your bucket of popcorn that cost you $5). You thank the lady at the counter and walk down the dimly lit hallway that leads to your movie. You walk into theater 3 and walk down the rows of seats looking for a good place to sit. You see an empty chair up front and quickly sit down in it. \"This must be my lucky day.\" You say as you watch the screen light up as the previews start to play. You munch on your popcorn as you gaze excitedly at the screen. Suddenly it shines bright enough to light up the whole room. People gasp in shock and shield their eyes as the brightness envelops the walls and ceiling. You get up from your seat and stare in shock at whats happing around you. You are so amazed that you don't even realise the light is pulling you towards the movie screen. The last thing that passed through your mind before you are pulled into the movie is:\"How can this be happening again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's start with the rating of your desired movie this time, shall we?</span></div></div>",

After that incident you've been a little bit nervous whenever you put in a movie, so you decide to go to a theater for a change. This is not a normal theater however, and you just might be going on another wild adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. If you exit the movie the story ends unless you enter another movie.<br>\r\n2. If you would die you are instead ejected from the movie.<br>\r\n3. I'll add a lot of chapters myself, but if you come to the end of a storyline please add your own chapter even if its only a few sentances long. Its no fun if I decide everything that happens.<br>\r\n4. Keep all chapters as gender-neutral as possible, I want anyone and everyone to feel like this could really be them exploring these worlds.<br>\r\n5. You're in a theater, so if you want you can have other people join you in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: I'm sorry this was so late in getting put up, my computer had been giving me some serious problems. Everything should be fine now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow is a list of movies that have already been used, so don't add them (This list is currently incomplete).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrank<br>\r\nThe fast and the furious<br>\r\nDirty Harry<br>\r\nKiss of the dragon<br>\r\nRambo<br>\r\nRocky<br>\r\nThe matrix<br>\r\n300<br>\r\nSpy kids(1-3)<br>\r\nSpiderman(1-3)<br>\r\nLord of war<br>\r\nMeet the spartains<br>\r\nAustin powers (1-3)<br>\r\nClick<br>\r\nRat race<br>\r\nSouth park: bigger, longer, and uncut<br>\r\nDude, wheres my car?<br>\r\nThe pirates who don't do anything<br>\r\nBalls of fury<br>\r\nDodgeball: a true underdog story<br>\r\nMonty python and the holy grail<br>\r\nALL DISNEY/PIXAR MOVIES <br>\r\nThe mask<br>\r\nSaw (All of them)<br>\r\n30 days of night<br>\r\nDawn of the dead<br>\r\nThe happening<br>\r\nThirteen ghosts<br>\r\nThe exorcist<br>\r\nCloverfield<br>\r\nStay alive<br>\r\nHumanoids from the deep<br>\r\nHouse of 1000 corpses<br>\r\nThe dentist<br>\r\nWrong turn<br>\r\nThe grudge<br>\r\nThe 5th element<br>\r\nStar wars<br>\r\nMen in black<br>\r\nTransformers<br>\r\nStar trek<br>\r\nChronicles of Riddick<br>\r\nI robot<br>\r\nTerminator (1-3)<br>\r\nTitan  A.E.<br>\r\nThe iron giant<br>\r\nThe day the earth stood still<br>\r\nKnowing</td>",
