Now she was awake on large clothed metal surface and was in a patient gown. It seemed a little big on her, but she didn't mind. It was soft and warm, just the way she liked it. <br>\r\n\"Glad to see that you're awake, Commander Shepard,\" said a mysterious but sexy voice as a massive shadow moved in front of her.<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" Called Shepard as she squinted at the massive shadow as it got closer and and soon began to cover her. She then saw a beautiful and giant face of a very attractive and curvy woman. While she was scanning the giantesses body, she couldn't help but blush as she gazed into the nearly endless abyss of her cleavage. If she had to guess she would have to be at least an inch tall and was both intimidated and a little turned on by this situation. You have had thoughts about this with other past relationships, but never got to go through with it until now.<br>\r\n\"My name is Miranda Lawson, and I will be your liaison with Cerberus. I know you have questions so let me get the big ones out of the way. Cerberus has used a lot of money and resources to bring you back from death. They weren't able to get enough usable biological material, however, but we were able to bring you back at a great sacrifice to your size, unfortunately. There are some upsides to this though, as we have greatly increased your density, thus making you nearly indestructible, to the point it would take more then being repeatedly crushed by a mech to hurt you, let alone to kill you. The reason we brought you back was that we needed your help with stopping the reaper threat before it even happens. All you need to do is offer advice when we need it, and to talk to the crew if they have any requests or need to be convinced to do more for the team.<br>\r\nNeed any other information or will that be it?\" Miranda ends and looks at Shepard expectantly.<br>\r\n\"Where will I be quartered?\" She asked looking at Miranda's face.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you will have free reign of the ship, but you will be sleeping with a specialized crew member each night. Now come along,\" she says as she picks her up and carries to the Normandy. Shepard can't wait to get a tour of this new ship, but does it get to happen or does she meet the crew first? <br>\r\n(You can use females from the series to compensate for the male members of the crew if you want. Like Nyreen instead of Garrus, or something like that.)</span></div></div>",

Now she's waiting in her quarters, but seriously did you take the long way on purpose? She's been at it since you sent the <u><i>Shepard's awake</i></u> message' the red head asked looking the closest to irritated Miranda had ever seen her <b>'I had recommended a sedative for the last 34 and a half minutes, it was ignored'</b> a synthetic voice was heard over the speakers and coming from the pilot's sector 'Thanks EDI, but with everything that's happened between our species trying to put her under would have gotten me shot' Kelly replied to the pilot, no answer being returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It makes sense when you think about it, we did practically kidnap her' Shepard gapped at the casual way Miranda said that, though was partly amused why how violently Kelly's flinch at the word had been 'That's a little harsh a word for the circumstances, we partly manipulated her with the fact we were bringing back her former lover and continuing her work in combating the Reapers, as well as the fact assisting us either in her memory or because she would eventually be joining us would be a good idea... plus we needed an engineer and she was the best even the Illusive Man's resources could find' Kelly zigzagged her words and to Shepard it actually sounded worse... except it meant she knew exactly who the other red head was referring to, Tali the plucky Quarian with the enormous (especially now) crush on her that especially right now she was glad had been reciprocated, she'd played Fire Emblem and didn't need her own Tharja, especially when that would mean her stalker would be larger than a Dreadnaught would have been previously, probably with an ass that could crush a Mako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So are you going to bring her down?' Kelly asked with a hopeful smile to which Miranda sighed 'I don't know, on the one hand if I do I may not get her back for quite a while. But on the other if I wait too long we'll try her already Cerberus thinned patience and we may at best loose our engineer' 'You could try asking me' Shepard said, some of the tech built into her regeneration making her able to be heard by the humans 'Oh  there she is, she's so cute! Hi I'm Kelly Chambers and I think we're going to be great friends' Kelly chirped reaching out to hold her but missing when Miranda stepped back 'I suppose it is the best option. So Shepard, are you up for a reunion or would you prefer we get the rest of the introductions done and then I can give you and your 'friend' all the time you need?' the Australian asked after turning her head to properly look at the tiny woman on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shepard considered the 2 options... for a few seconds before her mind wandered to what a reunion with Tali would be like: <i>the purple covered cutie would be bouncing around in excitement before unclipping her mask, revealing her lavender skin, large silver eyes and long black tongue to her alone, said tongue now rapping itself around her body, it's tip filling her before the entire muscle shoots back pulling into the gaping maw</i>... Shepard caught herself, only now, sure she'd had these thoughts and fantasies before, about multiple women over the years but this was the first time they'd had any possibility of becoming reality, and she was probably being generous with fantasy Jane's height relative to her beloved Quarian. But she did have a mission to think of too not just her own (currently pulsing) libido, though on saying that it had probably been quite a while since Tali had seen her, though Miranda hadn't exactly been specific on such details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How long was I <u>dead</u>?' Shepard asked 'approximately 2 years' Miranda answered and that helped Shepard make up her mind: 2 years apart, she was struggling with the 3 months they'd been apart before her death 'I want to see Tali' Shepard decided Miranda rolled her eyes but nodded before heading to the elevator.<br>\r\nThe trip itself was short (someone finally fixed the elevators) though the waiting by the door took a couple of minutes before the green light blinked and they were allowed in, immediately slamming shut the moment Miranda's behind was clear, Shepard already knowing it was due to the decontamination protocols in the 'clean room' they'd set up for Tali as a gift for her agreeing to work with them, an area where she could be free of her suit if she so wished. Scanning the room Shepard found a Quarian but was unsure if it was even Tali: the pale indigo shawl with ornate silver designs were nothing like the amethyst or black envirosuits she was accustomed to seeing the girl in, as well as the fact she appeared to be calmly working on her Omni-tool, not the hyperactive bundle of energy Shepard had come to know and love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ms Zorah, Shepard wants to see you now' Miranda stated formally, the Quarian appearing to take a moment to comprehend what was said before yelling <b>'Jane!'</b> and hopping out of her seat to face them, the accented voice removing any doubt from Shepard's mind but this new angle showed her their 2 years apart did wonders for her young lover/girlfriend: she had absolutely no way of knowing what Miranda's bust size was but she could tell that Tali's was actually quite close if not just as large, which considering they were mid C's like her own when they'd last met was rather impressive, plus she could see part of Tali's ass from the front, meaning the Quarian's best asset had just continued to get bigger and rounder, oh they were going to have so much fun together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi Tali, I missed you' Shepard said shyly, surprised to be picked up by the happy Quarian, gently running a finger along her hair and then down her back 'Oh Shepard it's been much too long, I've finally got you back and I'm not letting you go ever again' Tali cooed as the tiny human rubbing back against her finger, both sides wishing it were skin to skin but this would have to do. They were in their own little world until Miranda coughed to get their attention 'Well this is nice but we need to get back to showing Shepard around the Normandy and introduce her to the rest of the crew' the woman tries to take her back but Tali practically jumps away from her <b>'Nope, mine'</b> Tali yells, accidentally crushing Shepard against her breasts, Miranda rolls her eyes 'This is really stupid, you can't just keep her like a toy she's a person' Tali frowns (not that Miranda could see her) but it softens when she feels Jane nuzzle against her boob. She looks down at those big green eyes looking up at her with a wide grin and smiled in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo do Jane and Tali get to have their little time together alone, or does she decide to stay with Shepard by coming along with Miranda in showing her around?</span></div></div>",

Before she does this, she tries to position her rear to land behind Vex, but she fails to realize that Vex was running to the back of the chair and was crushed under the center of her rear. Zahra feels this, but before she can get up she feels how nice Vex's struggles are underneath of her. She then decides to stay there for a while and study, quietly moving her butt around the chair.</span></div></div>",

These three are sick of Vox Machina messing with Clasp affairs and have decided to punish Vex for the groups transgressions.<br>\r\nDren is a halfling assassin that really loves Devan, to the point of where she would do anything she asks. She would keep Vex around as a plaything for when she didn't have Devan to \"play\" with.<br>\r\nDevan is a halfling sorcerer that really only likes Dren for the sex.

If she had Vex, she would keep her in her clothing all day to pleasure herself. She would also pleasure Vex as well, because an unhappy slave isn't an effective slave.</span></div></div>",
