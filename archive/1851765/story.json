She had lived for thousands of years and now it was her turn to pass on the gift or curse to the next generation. The gift was called many things over the ages and before her time. The most common term now was \u2018Vampire\u2019. However, there was so much fiction surrounding it that there was hardly any truth to it. For starters she was and would be the only Vampire to walk the world while she remained a Vampire. There was not turning her victims and as long as she had this gift she wouldn\u2019t be able to have children. There was no way to find companionship that would last as long as she has and did and that was what made this gift a curse. She had worked hard in developing a mythic and fictions base to surround her gift to protect whoever she handed it off to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Isibelle and she was at the end of her long life. One could only be the \u2018Vampire\u2019 for a period of 2100 years before their flesh and bone turned to ash and the gift/curse would transfer randomly to the next life form, human or animal. For this reason she needed to find someone that was worthy of the gift. She had been watching someone ever since she knew this year to be her last. She was both dreading and eagerly awaiting her end. She had outlived countless lovers, husbands, adopted children and their families. She was tired but also hopeful for this new blood she had been associating with over the last few months and she knew that if there was anyone to pass the gift to it would be this person. Although young, the one in question was exactly what she was looking for to pass her gift and curse along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person is you but who are you???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1) You are a young boy named Caleb, 12 years old. You had just entered Junior High at a private Christian school no more than 5 blocks from your home. Your family is a close and very loving family but also very strict morally. They have brought you and your 2 brothers and one sister up very well, according to other people that say how well mannered you are; going to church, helping out the elderly and you other relatives, and working for others for free to develop your character and work ethic. Despite not being very good at school and usually struggling to get a 2.0 GPA you and your family live happily and are content with life and loyal to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2) You are a young girl named Ashley, 11 years old. You had just entered Junior High at a private Christian school no more than 5 blocks from your home. Your family is a close and very loving family but also very strict morally. They have brought you and your 2 brothers and one sister up very well, according to other people that say how well mannered you are; going to church, helping out the elderly and you other relatives, and working for others for free to develop your character and work ethic. Despite not being very good at school and usually struggling to get a 2.0 GPA you and your family live happily and are content with life and loyal to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3) You are a young man named Broc, 17 years old. You are the Captain of the football team at your public school and Home Coming King 2 years in a row and hopefully making your junior year be the third. Your outside appearance is a very healthy, popular, prosperous guy that is out going and kind to the women in your life while rustic with the men. However behind the scenes your parents are grooming you to be the one thing that brings them out of their poverty. You are constantly beaten and thrown into activities that enhance yourself, sometimes more than you should. This makes you have a deep loathing toward them and hope to get away from your current life. However you are young and don\u2019t really know what is in store for you. School is the one good thing in your life and your friends there are your life line, just as long as they don\u2019t come to where you live you will be ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 4) You are a young woman named Andrea, 18 years old. You are the captain of the cheer squad at your public and very liberal school. You are in your senior year and, as far as school goes have a bright future ahead of you. Bright, beautiful, athletic, smart, outgoing, kind, and a sure winner for any bet one could make. However your home life is a literal hell hole. Your drunk father is always in his chair with a beer in his hand. Your mother constantly fills that beer in order to keep his hands off of you. However she feels you owe her for it so she lets you know in more ways than one. She knows you are looked over at school and is smart enough not to abuse you to make a mark that others can see. However that doesn\u2019t stop her from abusing you in other ways and making an actual effort to make sure you don\u2019t rise above what she has amounted to. Even to the point of sabotaging your school life, your one pride and joy. This area of your life has made you sympathetic to other kids that are down and otherwise picked on at school. While you are obviously popular and sought after at school, you make a strong effort to reach out and get to know the unpopular students that you would guess are in the same boat you are in but without your natural devices to get them out of it. It is just one of the many things that make you so attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 5) This spot is for you to fill if you don\u2019t see one you like above. However, since there are probably more than one option, make sure you leave at least one spot open for others to make a profile they can chose and write on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are not really the most popular person around. In fact you were pretty pathetic socially and were clueless when it came to relationships and the opposite sex. However your loving family was more than enough to compensate for that. You were overall average and nice guy by many standards. Brown hair, average size, brown eyes, a thick German build (from your father\u2019s side), skinny despite the average weight class in your family adults was 350 lbs and the children usually followed suit. You had glasses but wasn\u2019t exactly a book nerd. In fact if you were than you probably would\u2019ve gotten better at school. No you mostly worked with your father and your brothers with odd jobs for no profit at church, your multiple relative\u2019s homes, charities that your family and church was involved in, and other people around your neighborhood. Because of this you and your brothers had lots of naturally strong muscles but not a lot of show like those in your class that were already lifting weights and getting a desirable figure. Your older sister was starting to rebel a little as she hit high school, as well as trying to get some boys to like her. It was always fun to see your father talk with the boys that called for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things you did was mow the lawn and shovel for the entire neighborhood. And not with a snow blower or riding lawn mower, no those cost way too much. You and your brothers used three pushing lawn mowers for mowing the lawn and shovels for\u2026 well shoveling snow, and in Wisconsin you had a lot of it at periodic times. And of course after you got done with your neighborhood you still had your grandparents\u2019 houses and the church to do. But for all the work you did it did give you a sense of pride at the end of the day, that you were able to get so much done and make so many people happy. You loved to watch people\u2019s faces when they came to give you money for your hard work and you just told them that you wanted to do it and not for the money. They would first try to force you to take it but after you insisted not to they would look at you as if you were an angel in troubled times. Perhaps that is why your father made you and your brothers do it like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll have none of that young man. I insist that you at least get a nice cold drink for your efforts.\u201d Said a pretty young woman by the name of Isibelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one of the people on the block that you visited more often, and as you grew older your family teased you for how young she looked. She had insisted the first couple times that you take something for your efforts as she didn\u2019t liking being in dept. It took her talking with your father to have him rearrange your schedule to allow her to entertain you for your troubles. You don\u2019t know what she said to him as he was usually unmovable in such things but now it was a weekly thing to go to her house and talk with her. You almost got the feeling that she was older than she was letting on but you didn\u2019t mind as she talked with you about a lot of things, from philosophy to what girls you liked at school. She was like a younger version of your grandmother, on your mother\u2019s side. You two had gotten very close in that regard so much that she would tell you things that you would think to be fiction, as you didn\u2019t think she was old enough to remember WWII but the way she said it made you believe she was actually there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Miss. Isibelle.\u201d You said with a smile as she led you into her living room with a glass of ice cold lemonade ready for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you to just call me Isibelle?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my Papa always said to speak to my elders with respect.\u201d You answered nervously as she sounded like she was correcting you and you didn\u2019t wish to be rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Caleb, you can call me anything you want. You\u2019re such a polite young boy.\u201d she said and hugged you to her chest. You were just getting old enough where you were beginning to shy away from such affectionate touch and she seemed to get a kick out of exploiting that embarrassing age and her good looks. However, again, the way she said it made you thing that she was your grandmother or at least that old. Only older people talked to you and your brothers like that. She let go and sat in a chair to an angle but still facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Miss. Isibelle?\u201d you asked as you took a sip of your lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Caleb?\u201d she asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry but you seem troubled today.\u201d You asked as you noticed that, unlike her usual assertive nature, she was passive and reclusive today. She almost seemed like she was preparing to go away for a long trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Caleb, I don\u2019t suppose I can hide anything from you at this point can I? You\u2019re such a smart boy and we\u2019ve known each other a while haven\u2019t we. Yes there is something I would like to ask you Caleb.\u201d She stated to which you sat up and took a big gulp of your lemonade before placing it on a coaster and paying strict attention to her, trying not to look down her neckline or up her skirt. \u201cW\u2026 what do you think about vampires?\u201d she asked rather blunt but shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t really know what you mean.\u201d You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you think about them. I mean, you go to church and stuff so you must think something about them. Plus you have a rather open mind so I was wondering what you thought of them.\u201d she said. You knew that she also went to church and lately to the same one you and your family went to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Papa sais their fake\u2026 if that\u2019s what you mean. But I guess if they were real... I don\u2019t know. People at church say that they would be evil but I\u2019ve never really read anywhere in the Bible that says anything against Vampires in particular. I guess it would be hard to say without knowing what one actually is like. I mean if they are really evil then I wouldn\u2019t like them very much, but if they are nice like you then I wouldn\u2019t mind meeting one. Actually I really like movies with them in it and sometimes pretend at home that I am one. It is fun to play with sometimes and I always dress up as one on Halloween.\u201d You said as you rambled. But she seemed to really smile when you said you would like them if they were \u2018as nice as her\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, do you trust me?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 sure I do. Why?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was wondering\u2026 Ok you have to promise me something. You have to promise me that you will listen and trust that I would never harm you.\u201d she said. The way she said it made it sound like she was about to do something like shooting an arrow at an apple on top of your head. While you might\u2019ve politely declined and excused yourself from other people\u2019s houses you already did trust her quite a bit. Like you had thought, she was like a young version of your Grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise Miss Isibelle. I won\u2019t run away or anything. I will stay and listen.\u201d You said as you tried covering all the points you thought she wanted to hear. She then leaned forward in the room and in her chair to address you more seriously. Something that you had rarely seen her do. She was you usually very playful and kind so this was rather strange and nerve wrecking for you. It was a side you had never seen of her before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou see Caleb I don\u2019t have much time and you are perfect for what I have in mind. What if I told you I was a vampire?\u201d she asked as she partially rambled but looked at you with her blood red eyes that always fascinated you. From a distance they looked brown but when someone was this close they were unmistakably red. She seemed unusually serious and anxious as she asked you this. That made you wonder and almost accept that she might be one. You thought about it for a moment and she sat there patiently for your answer as the minutes went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess I would have a lot of questions and be skeptical to say the least. Like I said Miss. Isibelle, I don\u2019t know what one is like. So if you were one and you were evil then I would politely ask to leave or offer my life for you to spar my family in the future. But\u2026 if you were and you weren\u2019t evil than\u2026 I would have to say\u2026 I would be a little\u2026 nervous and full of questions. I mean, I\u2019ve seen you come out into the sunlight before and everything I\u2019ve ever known or seen in movies say that sunlight kills Vampires so\u2026\u201d you answered as you stuttered and nervously tried to tiptoe around how you said it but you weren\u2019t very good with words and more often than not put your foot in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2026 you really are a wonderful boy and will grow to be a wonderful young man.\u201d She said as she was obviously hiding something at this point and you had both a fear and hope that is was her being a Vampire. But if that was the case then what did she want with you? \u201cCaleb, I am going to be completely honest with you. I am a Vampire.\u201d She said bluntly but segmented it so that you were ready to receive the information. The fact hit you and you braced against the chair a little. You stared at her wide eyed for a moment but then looked passed her as you processed what she said. You brought the option of her joking but her expression had been strangely serious all day. All the little details about her made sense if you threw in the Vampire angle. Perhaps it was because you were so young but you found yourself believing her and wanting to know more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 M\u2026 Miss. Isibelle? If you are\u2026 what do you want with me?\u201d you asked, obviously nervous and she could obviously see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I told you already that I wouldn\u2019t harm you and that I don\u2019t have much time.\u201d She said as she put a hand on yours but you went rigid to her touch and wondered why her hand wasn\u2019t as cold as you would think a vampire\u2019s hand would be, granted it was colder than normal people\u2019s but not freezing like in the movies. She retracted her hand as she saw it doing more harm than good then waited for you to respond. She put on a smile that she knew you liked despite the fact that she obviously didn\u2019t like how you were taking it. This realization hit you and you calmed down a little, took a deep breath, then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I meant why you have me here?\u201d you asked with a clear sign that you were wondering if she was needing you blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 oh that\u2019s what you meant. No Caleb, I am not going to suck your blood. If it makes you feel better I am not evil. If I was, do you think I could go to church with you?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, if you were evil that God wouldn\u2019t allow you to go inside much less touch the Bible and other stuff inside.\u201d You answered and became a little more relaxed now that she revealed that much. \u201cMiss. Isibelle, I don\u2019t wish to be rude but\u2026 can you show me? I am having a hard time believing it. I trust you but I\u2026 well you don\u2019t fit hardly any of what I would expect from a Vampire. Like I said, I\u2019ve seen you in the sunlight and you aren\u2019t pale by any means.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I can show you a little.\u201d She said. First she smiled then lifted her lip and her fangs shot out about an inch passed her other teeth then she retracted them as you reeled back a little but stayed seated. Next she held out her hand and it evaporated into ash then came back. Lastly she produced some fire on it\u2019s palm then clenched it to put the flame out. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that is all I can do at the moment. You see, I worked hard over the years to put those conceptions of Vampires out there for the world to see. That way if someone were to say that I was one I could just walk outside into the sun and prove them wrong. I don\u2019t have to drink blood and when I do it doesn\u2019t have to be human. But blood is like gas for my vampire powers and I haven\u2019t drank any for\u2026 about 20 years. So I am understandably weak at the moment.\u201d She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but I must ask again; why am I here?\u201d you asked, not sure why she was telling all this to you, a 12 year old human all her secrets. It was as if she could read your mind as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, unlike the legends that I helped create, Vampires can\u2019t live forever. I am not Immortal in that aspect. And I can\u2019t infect others like the legends say. I am the only vampire and I can only live for 2100 years. Then, wither I want to or not, I will turn to ash and this gift will be passed to another randomly. The only way for me to ensure that the next vampire is one of my choosing is to pass on the gift myself to someone I deem worthy and I\u2019ve chosen you.\u201d She explained and the last bit hit you hard. You couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing. You had so many questions and so many concerns that you started to feel light headed. \u201cCalm down.\u201d She said in a voice that commanded your body to obey and you did as she commanded or rather your body did. It was obvious to you that it was one of her powers but which one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you want to make me\u2026 a\u2026 Vampire?\u201d you asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a Vampire Caleb, the Vampire. You would be the only one as there are no others, just me and no way to change that. I only added that part to the legend to add another reason why I wasn\u2019t one if one were to track me here. I know you have many questions but unfortunately I am running out of time. You see it will be 2100 years tomorrow and I have chosen you to receive this gift. I can answer your questions until late into the night but know that if you don\u2019t accept I must find someone that will. I won\u2019t force you Caleb.\u201d She said with her usual kindness in her voice. You never expected her to be a vampire, and now that she was one you didn\u2019t think she would be so nice and gentle. You had so many questions but she an answer or to find someone else very quickly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean I can but if I said no and you were as bad as the reason why I would say that then you\u2019d do it anyway. On the off chance that you weren\u2019t then I would be leaving you to die by yourself, and I couldn\u2019t do that either. And if what you\u2019re saying is true then if I don\u2019t take this\u2026 \u2018gift\u2019 then it is possible it will randomly choose someone that might do what I am afraid an evil Vampire would do. So I guess I accept but I have some major questions that need answering before you\u2026 well make me a Vampire, the Vampire.\u201d You answered. To this she couldn\u2019t control herself and gave you a hug, almost squeezing the life out of you. But it was one that you had gotten before and you just, slowly, hugged her back. If you were really going to become a Vampire then you would want people to treat you the same and being afraid of a hug because of you or her proximity to your neck wouldn\u2019t be something you would want. After about 5 minutes she let go and sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you were the right one Caleb, I just knew it. But you\u2019re right, you should ask all you questions now because I won\u2019t be around afterwards.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, when a Vampire gives their essence to another the thousands of years they lived are put into play, turning our bodies to dust. In a sense, this gift is the only thing that holds our bodies together after about 100 years. But don\u2019t think you are killing me by accepting. Like I said, I die tonight anyway and would rather you get this gift than some random guy who may use it to commit great evil.\u201d She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d you said as you looked down. You weren\u2019t expecting that she would die as a result of this. But before you could dwell on it you were pulled into her so that she was holding you on her coach with a hug of sorts like a mother does to her child when comforting. How you got from your chair to the coach was beyond you but you had to assume it was another of a true vampire\u2019s powers. \u201cOk, I better ask while I still have you here to answer then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you should.\u201d She said as she let you go and instead held your hand so you could talk while still feel her strangely calming touch to your skin. It was as if her very presence forbid you from panicking or feeling sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I should get this out of the way. What are the strengths and weaknesses of a real vampire that I have to watch out for?\u201d you asked. She smiled as she saw your mind turning to the possibilities of what your new life would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the only weakness we do have is silver but not in the way you think. Silver keeps me from using my abilities and you will find that I\u2026 we have a lot of them. I only ashed when staked by hunters to bring forth the legend that if you stab a Vampire in the heart or cut off our head we die. That isn\u2019t true. The ONLY way for us to die is to pass on the gift. However, Silver will prevent you from using your new abilities, even the enhanced strength and speed you will receive. I sometimes wear silver jewelry to live a normal life for a few decades, but we still don\u2019t age so it gets tiring but it is possible.\u201d she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo all the sunlight, crosses, garlic, wooden steaks, burning,\u2026?\u201d you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll lies that I\u2019ve spread over the years to protect you. I didn\u2019t always know you would be the one but with so many people already knowing, or think they know, what works on a Vampire it should protect you. Although the silver one is kind of a pain in the\u2026 butt.\u201d She interrupted to answer your question but also censoring herself. \u201cBut I guess not drinking blood could be perceived as a weakness as well. You see blood, like I said before, is like our gas for the abilities we have. If you use too many of your abilities then you will find yourself craving blood to fill your gas tank as it were. I would recommend a dairy cow or something big enough to sink your fangs into, a human will only attract attention if you don\u2019t know how to heal them afterwards.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeal them afterwards?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, you will receive the genetic knowledge of how to use your abilities when you fully turn. But I guess I could answer that on by showing you, if you will allow me?\u201d she asked as she raised your arm. You nodded to which she smiled and brought it close to her mouth. \u201cYou see my, and your future, saliva acts both as an anesthetic and a minor healing agent. So we can feed on people in their sleep without them knowing, like this.\u201d she said as she protruded her fangs and dug into your arm. You flinched as you expected to feel pain but instead it felt almost orgasmic. She only drank for a little bit, maybe a second or two, then removed her fangs and held your arm for you to see. It had some blood on it but not holes where her still protruding fangs had entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 that felt\u2026 why is there\u2026\u201d you stuttered as you wiped away the small amount of blood to reveal nothing where there should be at least an indent if not gaping holes where her teeth went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, it acts quickly and yes it doesn\u2019t feel bad at all, does it? Personally I think it feels as good as sex, especially on my end which is the last weakness we have.\u201d She answered then licked what was left of your blood from your arm and put it back down, embracing your hand in hers. \u201cYou see, you will find that drinking blood is like\u2026 eating sex I guess. That is why I suggest you drink from something like a cow or something that has a lot of blood to start. The human body only has a limited amount. So if you give yourself over to your cravings and urges like humans do, then you can easily kill your meal while draining them of all their blood, and without you knowing it until they lay limp in your arms. I\u2026 it will happen to you eventually, it happens to all of us at least once. So if you remember anything remember that your kindness and care for humans will save you. If you don\u2019t care about them then your mind won\u2019t remind you in the middle of feeding. But if you care for them then your instincts will stop you or at the very least act as a distant voice for you to hear.\u201d She explained.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She seemed to remember that as well. \u201cIs there anything else I should know?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, um\u2026 I guess there is two more things other than you will gain that knowledge after you are completely change. The first that you will look normal, even under a microscope, so you don\u2019t worry about people doing tests on you and stuff unless you actively protrude your teeth and stuff. The only other thing is that I am leaving everything I own to you, well when you get older. Your body will age until you are 21, then it will stop aging like mine has. When you hit 21, I have instructed that all my assets are to be given to you. My death tonight will be taken care of by the same people and you will be delivered home by the police from that group.\u201d She said as she rambled things off that she should mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPolice?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes, I am dying tonight so you being the last one to see me alive will cause them to suspect you of murder. However you will be out for a day while your body changes so they will take you home and say that you were attacked but are otherwise fine. I suggest you come up with a story to tell them. Perhaps someone was robbing this place and kidnapped you to get away but dumped you later. Anyway, you\u2019re right we really should get started. I would hate to ash because of a 2100 year typo in time judgment.\u201d She said as she turned more directly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH\u2026how does this work?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite simple actually. I drink you dry so you have no blood left then push my blood into you. With it you will retain all my powers and experience, as well as the experience of those that came before me. Oh, you will get one hot body to boot.\u201d She answered as she slowly forced you, almost seductively down until she was lying on top of you, grinding against you a little and getting you highly aroused. \u201cThat\u2019s it, get excited.\u201d She spoke  as she planted a kiss on your lips then moved to the side and started trailing to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this\u2026 necessary\u2026?\u201d you asked, more for future reference then for her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe faster the heart beats the faster the blood flows and the faster I can drink. But there are more ways to get the blood flowing then just running a few laps in gym class.\u201d She answered as she continued. It made sense that way and also why biting invoked a pleasure response and why vampires were said to scar people to death. As she said, there are more ways to get the blood flowing then just running laps. Your body was limp as you had never been like this with a girl before and definitely not a woman as hot as she was not to mention she was a Vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I ever see you\u2026 again.\u201d You asked through your moans. \u201cMiss. Isisbelle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps in heaven, but will always be inside you and not just like they say in elementary school. I am giving you my blood so I will be quite literally part of you from now on.\u201d She said seductively and something in your mind was preventing her from stopping anything she wanted to do. Just as you were about to explode and your heart beat reached its max she said.\u201dGoodbye Caleb.\u201d Then sank her teeth in and took what your body was using to fuel your stimulation and release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your blood flowing out of you and strangely enough you could feel it running down her throat and pool into her stomach where it was immediately digested and fused with her blood. You felt your essence leave your body and felt yourself die, which was the strangest feeling in the world. But you weren\u2019t dead as if your essence and spirit was attached to the blood that now was blending with hers. You could feel as it coursed through her veins and was pumped through her heart. It was like being on an orgasmic rollercoaster ride that never stopped. But then you felt cold as you were pushed into a cold vessel and it took a while to heat it back up. But by the time that happened you had separated from that feeling and was back to the feeling of you having a really nice dream. Your head rushed with images and memories of the lives the other vampires had. Some of them were gruesome, some were erotic, some were fun, while others were sad. Thousands of years were poured into your mind and understanding. You felt power as and strength then the feeling of Isibelle came through it all. The unmistakable feeling you got whenever she was around. You called out for her but she didn\u2019t answer. You did this a few times but then was pulled back to consciousness to find\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCaleb\u2026 Caleb\u2026 CALEB.\u201d Came a voice that snapped you out of your dreams of searching. You woke to find a bright light in your face but in reality it was the light in your room. You were in your room, in your bed, with your family sitting around you. Your father, or as he instructed you and you siblings to call him, your Papa was calling your name in response to you calling out probably. You were breathing hard as you took in what you were seeing. It was a head rush of sorts as information piled into your mind from around you. You could hear the heart beat of every person within a one mile radius. As soon as you got your hearing under control your sight was impaired by the bright lights. You slowly came around to answer your father\u2019s calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2026 where am I?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are at home. When you didn\u2019t come home on time we got worried and went looking for you. They said someone had broken into Miss. Isibelle\u2019s home and you were taken. We came home and prayed for you to return and just like that an officer brought you back. It must\u2019ve been horrible for you, can you remember anything?\u201d your father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t remember much. I remember feeling a rush, maybe a blast or someone hit me. Miss. Isibelle covered me and\u2026 nothing. I thought I felt her just now and tried to find her and that is when I woke up.\u201d You reported, weaving a tale of truth and lies expertly like your instincts were subconsciously helping you do. \u201cIs she ok, is Miss. Isibelle ok?\u201d you asked to which your parent sent the others to their rooms then shut the door to talk with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, they couldn\u2019t find Miss. Isibelle at her house. They only found what happened afterward. I hear that they are going under the assumption that she passed away and went to heaven.\u201d Your Father reported, trying to break it to you in a way that didn\u2019t make you that sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe died?\u201d you asked, this time it was for real. You were still halfway in denial as you did have strong feelings for her and even stronger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019m sorry dear.\u201d Your mother said then had a look as though she didn\u2019t mean to say it that way. You instantly recognized it as one of you powers. When you wanted someone to tell you something you didn\u2019t need to do more than wish them to and they would spill their darkest secrets to you. You didn\u2019t mean to use it just now and it was clear that while the blood running though you told you how to use your abilities and their specs, they didn\u2019t tell you how to control yourself when using them. then it hit you, the reason you still felt her presence was that, as she said, she was actually inside you. Or at least her whole life, memories, and blood were at least. You looked at your hand as you looked into it and saw the blood flowing through your veins. You looked at it as if the blood would speak to you like she would but you knew that was ridiculous. Soon the large hand of your Father came into and closed around your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some rest Caleb. If you need it, you can stay home from school tomorrow. I know you\u2019ve probably rested enough but just try so you can function tomorrow.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d. you answered as the generic response you were suppose to use when he said something it was more or less to communicate that you heard and understood him and you were trained to say it after he told you something to do. They stayed for a little bit as you closed your eyes and slowed your breathing and heartbeat to match a sleep like state. They eventually got up and exited, going back to their room. You immediately opened your eyes as they closed your door and turned off your light. As you suspected you could actually see better in the dark then in the light. As you thought about what was going on you started floating in the air without really thinking about it. When you realized  you almost fell but caught yourself and made a note of what it felt like so not to do it around others while you were thinking. But for the life of you, you just couldn\u2019t fall asleep. You tried counting sheep and even trying to knock yourself out. It appeared that the darkness gave you more power while the light was more of an annoyance but still you didn\u2019t mind it overall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you had to get a handle on your powers as quickly as possible you started experimenting with them. You snuck around the house silently, first normally and second as a sort of mist like fog. You could actually seep through otherwise invisible cracks to get to places you never thought you could. You even went to your family dog, who woke from the different scent in the air. You quickly adjusted and he went back to sleep. You then wondered if you could really go anywhere like that so you entered Duke\u2019s body through his mouth, nose, other holes just to see if it worked, and even his skin. You then wondered if you could feed like that and drank a little of his blood as you moved inside his veins. When you came out you noticed that he didn\u2019t even wake up to your intrusion. You experiments lasted through the night but stayed away from your family as you didn\u2019t want to suddenly get a craving for their blood. You had to keep yourself from draining Duke and you didn\u2019t want to test it on something that instinct told you would be infinitely more delicious and satisfying. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as you heard your parents get up you laid back in bed. Your Father usually got you and your siblings up with him, at 5:00 in the morning. Usually it bothered the stink out you but since you now needed very little sleep you got up right away and headed for the bathroom to shower. It was usually a race to get it before everyone else and if your sister got it first then it was occupied for at least an hour while your brothers left if an absolute mess. So you got in and took your shower. You noticed that you didn\u2019t really care if it was extremely hot or cold so you took a freezing cold shower, brushed your teeth which ruined your tooth brush as your new fangs kept popping out and shredding it. Luckily you had some sort of materialization ability and fixed it. You then noticed something as you checked for zits and such on your young teen face. First of all you didn\u2019t have any, which was weird because you usually had to deal with quite a few in the morning, and second you had in addition to your retractable fangs were the same blood red eyes that Isibelle had. With that little discovery you slapped on a towel, did your hair, and headed for your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, what happened to you?\u201d asked a drowsy Sarah as she almost ran into you on her way into the shower. She was looking at your upper half that wasn\u2019t covered with a towel. Being the only girl in a house full of boys she had seen it all but what she hadn\u2019t seen is that now you were completely ripped. Not overly so that it was bulgy but you were definitely and enviably toned and ripped. You didn\u2019t even notice as you usually didn\u2019t pay much attention to your own body, rather you usually got jealous of the ones at school that got them all the girls, or the staring at girls\u2019 bodies in general as per your age and introduction to puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you asked to which she looked too tired to take it any further and just walked into the bathroom to the dismay of your brothers, who now had to wait before they got their chance. Luke was only 13 months younger than you while Isaac was 5 years younger than you. While Luke was more popular that  you, Isaac was the momma\u2019s boy and more stylish when it came to his personal upkeep. However they were both too young to notice your obvious change and just scowled lazily at you for getting your shower in before they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to your room and got ready, inspecting your new body in the closet mirror you had. Isibelle was right when she said you would become \u2018hot\u2019. You messed with your hair and watched as it folded back to how you wanted it. You weren\u2019t growing any facial hair yet so you couldn\u2019t try out anything in that area but you looked at yourself for a few minutes as you flexed and looked at your shockingly toned and defined muscles. You put on your normal school uniform, dress code for a private school was strict at black slacks, and a various assortment of polo shirts with the schools logo on the left chest area and no black on black was allowed so you picked a red polo before slapping on some deodorant and grabbing your bag for school. You noticed that it was as light as a feather, despite you knowing that it had at least 30 lbs of books in it from your homework. You carried it down the stairs and put it by the door, ready to go like you always did, then walked into the kitchen where your mother was making breakfast and your Father was reading the Bible as he usually did in the morning before you the rest of you joined in for your family Bible study in the morning along with breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, so you don\u2019t need the day off?\u201d asked Papa as finished his reading and looked up at you. Your mother continued cooking but also turned to see you sitting in your spot at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I think it would be best if I get my mind off it by doing so good old fashioned homework and studies.\u201d You said with an obviously forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, if you need the day off you can have it. We were about to call the school after breakfast to call you a sick day.\u201d Mom said as she turned from just flipping a pancake. Your mother went to work in the day but not to support the family. Your father had bought part of Pepsi way back when he had the money and when their stock was low. Now that he was part owner he got a lot of money and more than enough to support the family. Although he never really used it, in fact he was one of the most tight fisted people you knew. No your mother went to work to have some extra spending money aside from that and because she enjoyed it, as she enjoyed being a Mom to not only her own kids but the kids that came home with you occasionally but mostly your other siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuke, not until you shower.\u201d Your father said as he came halfway down the stairs then went back up. Like any parent they could easily see what their kids were doing and instruct them before it became an issue, well mostly. There were times where you and your siblings got spankings and such but never to the point where it breached into the abusive area. Now that you were older, and definitely now that you had this new power, you silently thanked your parents for it and raising you the right way. After all, even selfishly, if they hadn\u2019t Isibelle wouldn\u2019t have ever passed this gift off to you of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I think I can handle it. If she were still alive I know exactly what she would say if I missed a day of school; \u2018A young man like yourself should be in school this time of day, learning what you need to be a great man someday\u2019.\u201d You quoted and they smiled as they had also heard her say that to you and your brothers and a few times to Sarah but they never really got along so not as much, not to mention she never mowed her grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds just like her. Well then did you get all your homework done?\u201d Papa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of it. All I have is a little left of my English paper due by Friday.\u201d You answered. You had actually just finished it last night as you normally would\u2019ve said the same thing but not done any of it until study hall at school. Although you found that all the usually really hard homework was a breeze and it only took up a small fraction of your night as you waited for morning and experimented with your new powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you should get that done tonight and show me to be sure. Now that you are in Junior High you need to get good grades to make it when you grow up.\u201d Papa said in a way that distinguished you as being older now but also that you had an added responsibility. For some reason your Father was always really good a controlling emotions. He could make you feel insanely guilty with a single look or insanely proud of yourself with a pat on the back for getting something done right or even just done at all. You knew that you now had that power as part of your new set of mind altering abilities but he had it and was just a human. No he was more than just a human, he was YOUR Papa, and like all kids you still thought your Dad was better than anyone else\u2019s Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCaleb, are you ok? I notice you were distracted most of the day and you skipped lunch.\u201d Asked Miss Bigler, your homeroom teacher. Since you were just in sixth grade they were just introducing the multiple class thing and as such you had a high majority of your classes in your homeroom with a select few outside, like elective based classes which included Gym and intro to different classes to be chosen for the next few years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just had a headache and a little indigestion. Nothing a good night\u2019s sleep won\u2019t cure.\u201d You said as you packed up your things from your locker. You had been avoiding eye contact with people and because you weren\u2019t that popular it wasn\u2019t that hard. However it was a relatively small private school and as such the teachers were more attentive to their students. She was right though, all day you were bombarded with new smells that you hadn\u2019t noticed before. Every person that walked within ten feet of you was pretty much downloaded into your memory, not to mention you couldn\u2019t really control the mind reading thing yet so their surface thoughts would randomly pop up as a loud distraction. On top of that whenever you thought of food you thought of the hundreds of throats around you and it made you sick of yourself. You didn\u2019t know what you were doing and you really could use your Dad\u2019s advice but was unsure of how to tell him. This was hard enough for a preteen to accept with a large imagination like yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope my headaches improve my learning skills like they have for you. I know you were struggling with your grades so I brought this to you myself.\u201d She said and you could\u2019ve sworn that she was flirting with you in her hand gestures and such. She handed you a spelling test that  you had\u2026 a 100% on. You hadn\u2019t gotten a grade that good for a very long time. Thing is you weren\u2019t even concentrating on that test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I got that?\u201d you asked, not really believing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, keep up the good work Caleb. You know I could\u2026 never mind.\u201d She said as she was about to say something and you were so curious that you entered her mind to see what she was going to say only to find an internal argument going on as she walked away. \u201cWhy is he so hot today? It\u2019s like he just sprouted out in all the right places overnight. I could just\u2026 no! that\u2019s my student I can\u2019t think that way. So why does he tempt me so much the closer I get to him and why does my heart flutter when he smiles at me?\u201d She asked herself and turned as you were walking toward her but in order to reach the stairs that were behind her and next to her class. She smiled then waved a goodbye to which you did the same only for her to blush and quickly dart into her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. That was weird.\u201d You whispered to yourself. You knew that you had persuasion powers but you didn\u2019t know that your natural appeal had skyrocketed as well. You didn\u2019t know you had any outward appeal to begin with and to have so much that it was tempting a teacher in her mid 20s was both intoxicating and hard to handle. Good thing it was the end of the day and you were going home. Your brothers would wait for your mother while your sister got a ride home and you walked. You never understood why they had to get a ride when your house was hardly 5 blocks away, laziness you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked down the stairs and hall like normal and noticed that some of the girls that usually didn\u2019t give you a second glace were following you with their eyes and hiding such a fact when you glanced their way. You wondered how far this attraction thing went and if you could turn it off. You didn\u2019t mind the attention but it could very quickly turn out to be a bad thing or at least too much at some point. After all, you were a 12 year old kid, now Vampire, but still a kid and didn\u2019t need or want the extra drama. The worst thing about the day though was Bible class. Your teacher was slightly distracted, as were you, but she taught on demons and used Vampires as a fictional example of one. Since you were THE only Vampire her teachings were like a sucker punch to you. She didn\u2019t actually prove Vampires as evil, more just a socially acceptable example of a modern day demon. You were no demon and you didn\u2019t like being called one, regardless if she knew you were the exact thing she was talking about, minus the evil rap that she was labeling them/you with. However per your kind and gentle nature you let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were walking home as you thought on how to break it to your family. You wanted to make sure you had a decent handle on your powers before confronting them and you achieved that, except your drinking of blood. You didn\u2019t really know what to do about it. You were obviously craving it but felt\u2026 bad about even thinking to take another person\u2019s blood and taking from a cow seemed like stealing. You really needed your Father\u2019s advice on this but how can you ask your human father on wither or not you should suck people\u2019s blood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Caleb, have a good day at school?\u201d Papa asked as he looked up from fixing one of the lawn mowers. You walked into the garage and handed him a tool you knew he needed. From working with him all the time you could read his mind without your powers and knew what he needed and when, as far as tools were concerned. At this point it was a reflex and you barely knew you were doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I got an A on my spelling test.\u201d You said as you tried to brighten your mood by brightening his. None of you, except your sister, was that smart book wise at least. However you sister knew she was smart and didn\u2019t try at school, earning her just as bad grades as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s great!\u201d he said with his uncanny ability to lift your emotions and make you feel proud. You put your bag down on a bench then sat by him as he worked and you helped a little, again out of reflex. You knew the others would be avoiding work and the garage was probably the most solitary place in that respect. No one came back unless they were getting a tool or doing a job for Papa. You were unusually quiet and distant, which caught your wise father\u2019s eye. He stopped his tinkering and looked over at you. \u201cCaleb, are you still thinking about Miss. Isibelle?\u201d he asked as he tried to figure out what was on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, yes, kind of. I\u2026 Papa? Can I ask you a weird question?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you know you can talk with your mother or I about anything.\u201d He said in a tone that indicated he was open to talk for a while if you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 what do you think about\u2026 Vampires, other than that they are fake? I mean, if one really did exist and wasn\u2019t evil, do you think it would be possible?\u201d you asked in way as you dodged the fact that you were one. However, with the sun shining in the garage your father didn\u2019t even suspect you were talking about yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, that is a weird question. Well, I guess I would have to meet him or her to decide if they were evil or not. If they turned out to be ok then I don't see why they would be a problem. But I told you before Caleb, Vampires are fake. I thought you knew that.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBut what if I could prove that one existed?\u201d you asked, still not looking him in the eye but seeing him ponder both the question, how he should answer, and why you were asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, are you trying to tell me something? I admit I would be skeptical if you said you found one. Maybe all those Vampire movies were too much\u2026\u201d he started but you shook your head as if to say that wasn\u2019t where you were getting it from. While it was well known in your family, both distant and immediate, that you like vampire things there was a seriousness in you that he hadn\u2019t seen before, as well as an almost fearful gaze as you looked down and away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa, what if I was a Vampire?\u201d you asked suddenly as you didn\u2019t want it to go further off topic and were too young to know a more gentler way of asking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, that\u2019s enough of this talk Caleb. Perhaps you need some rest then we should have a talk about this when you are feeling better.\u201d He said as he stood but was almost forced down as you allowed yourself to float above him, still looking down and away from him. You didn\u2019t go high, but just enough to look like you were sitting on air in relation to him. You stayed silent and waiting for him to do something rash. Your Father, like for most kids your age, was your whole moral center and life. Your Dad was better than everyone else\u2019s Dads, he was always right and always knew what to do. You feared that the thing he would decide to do would be to treat you like a\u2026 well Vampire exclusively and not part of the family anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa, I am a Vampire. I know it is hard to hear, I\u2019ve only been one for a day and it is hard for me to believe. I am having trouble with the changes and I\u2019m scared.\u201d You said as you buried your face in your hands. You hadn\u2019t cried in a while, well outside of spankings at least. But the thought of what might happen was too much and you started to cry. You didn\u2019t really know how long you cried and for how long you were floating or when your body had came down to sit like you were before but eventually a strong hand laid on your shoulder, your father\u2019s hand, Papa\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what happened to Miss. Isibelle?\u201d he asked to which you nodded. \u201cDid a\u2026 Vampire attack the two of you?\u201d he asked, probably not believing that he just asked that. But you shook your head. \u201cthen what happened?\u201d he asked. You looked up at him and began telling him everything, how you came over, what she said about her making it safe and spreading the legends and stories, her death and gift, all of it. You showed him to small and hardly noticeable scars on your neck and by the time you were done he looked like he had just been told an unbelievable story, the kind of look you gave when Mom read you one at night with your brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa, am I evil now?\u201d you asked. This seemed to shake him from his shocked glance to address his son, Vampire or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Caleb, don\u2019t you ever think that understand?\u201d he said as he gave a firmer grip to your shoulder. He shook you a little until you couldn\u2019t take it anymore and just hugged into him, for comfort if nothing else. He was obviously both startled and comforted by this as he held you, his son, in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok, you don\u2019t have to worry Caleb. We are your family and we\u2019ll help you through this and figure it out, just like that superman show you watch.\u201d He said. He could never remember the title, Smallville, it wasn\u2019t really that hard to remember but he butchered it with his lack of media prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa, I promise I\u2019ll be good. I won\u2019t do anything bad, I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d you started but was just shushed by him as he held you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that. We\u2019ll talk about that later, ok?\u201d he said as he pushed you just enough so that you were looking into his eyes, his deep brown eyes full of love. They almost shunned you for ever thinking he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. \u201cSo can you still eat food? Cause that meal Mom is cooking smells really good doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked as he changed the subject to something a little more cheery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I can. I just need blood for my other stuff.\u201d You answered with a smile and nod as you wiped away your tears from your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t we both wash up and get in there before it\u2019s all gone?\u201d he said as he stood and you did as well, grabbing your bag and heading inside like normal, as if nothing happened.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You laid in your bed as you looked up at the ceiling. Papa hadn\u2019t let the news of you being a Vampire spread or even alluded that anything was out of the ordinary. Although he did observe as you ate your meal and, without reading his mind, you could tell he was wondering why and how you could eat normal food as a Vampire. You used your excellent hearing, even through the sound proof walls of your room, to hear Papa tell Mother about you. She reacted a little bit skeptical, like he did, but in the end she became both nervous and concerned but not scared. He told her the story you told him and you marveled as he remembered every detail of what you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talked for a while but in the end they both calmed down and decided they needed to talk with you about it and figured, that if you were really a Vampire, you wouldn\u2019t be asleep at night. You waited as they came up the stairs then opened your door. You closed your eyes to pretend you were sleeping but the simply closed the door behind them as they entered. One of your projects with your Father was making your room sound proof. Part of it was because you were such a light sleeper that every random noise usually woke you and the other was that, at the time, Luke had got a new drum set and you were being driven crazy. It was he quiet room in the house and you were now glad for it so you could speak with them openly without Sarah, Luke, or Isaac catching on or overhearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, we are going to turn on the light.\u201d Papa informed like he usually did when doing so. You sat up in bed with your back now against the headboard and after the sound of your movement stopped he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, Papa told me what\u2019s going on. Are you ok?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little scarred still and confused.\u201d You answered as they both took the chairs you had in your room and sat on either side of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you won\u2019t be sleeping at night anymore.\u201d Papa stated as he looked at your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t really explain that well but the night makes me more powerful, I can do my\u2026 other stuff easier at night and although I\u2019ve tried, I can\u2019t force myself to sleep at night.\u201d You verify as you stole glances at both of them but still avoided eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, what other stuff do you mean?\u201d asked Mom, worried that you were talking about drinking their blood. Papa knew better but still was wondering about your other abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss. Isibelle explained it like this. While I still need food like a normal person to grow, the amount of energy required to live for me is significantly higher and when I use my heightened abilities it uses up more of that energy. Blood is basically the only thing that is like the gas for my energy tank\u2026 but I don\u2019t have to drink human blood.\u201d you explained, hoping the last point would make them feel better. It did but not as much as you were hoping it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t? I thought Vampires had to drink from other people.\u201d Papa said to you shaking your head in response. \u201cThen what can you drink?\u201d he asked more openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess anything with blood, although it is like\u2026 food for me. I crave certain blood more and certain blood has more\u2026 energy in it I guess. While human blood is at the top there are more than enough blood in, let\u2019s say, a cow for example.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you drank any yet?\u201d asked Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I am not sure where I should get it. Other people are off limits but going to a random farm and drinking from one of the animals seems like stealing. But I can\u2019t just go up to the farmer and ask to drink the blood of his animals. But I am getting really hungry.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we can\u2019t have you starving in anyway. But won\u2019t you turn those you\u2026 bite?\u201dAsked Mom. She had always made it a point to feed you and never have her children go hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, from what Miss. Isibelle said, I can\u2019t turn anyone and there are no other vampires. Although there are apparently a lot of pretenders out there that thing shaving their teeth and sinking them into people\u2019s necks make them a Vampire. But no, there is and only will be one Vampire and for now that Vampire is me. I wouldn\u2019t be able to turn someone even if I tried hard to do it. The most I can do is drink too much or not clean up afterward.\u201d You answered and this also seemed to lift some anxiety off their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good news.\u201d Papa responded as he must\u2019ve been worried that their little Vampire had to be watched so you didn\u2019t end up turning everyone in the school. \u201cWhat do you mean about \u2018clean up\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss. Isibelle showed me how to feed before\u2026 turning me I guess you could say. She said that my spit can do 2 things. The first is to make the spot not hurt anymore, before biting. The second is to heal cuts and stuff like that, including the bite marks. I really wouldn\u2019t have any control over it. If I bit someone you wouldn\u2019t see a mark like in the movies. I mean, how can I bite someone without getting at least a little spit on them?\u201d You asked as you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then we know that, if a pretender does show up that it isn\u2019t you.\u201d Mom said with a smile as if she just revealed a security to their sanity, and yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I do need your advice. What should I drink from? Perhaps I can use my mind powers to get blood delivered from the hospital but what if an emergency comes up? Do I find a farm or is it ok to\u2026 feed on people as long as I don\u2019t overdo it? I don\u2019t know what is ok and what is not.\u201d You asked them. They both looked at each other. They obviously weren\u2019t expecting that they would have to give you advice as to what blood to drink.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell Caleb, I think that drinking from complete strangers isn\u2019t and won\u2019t be right. You\u2019re right, that is at the very least stealing. I suppose it would be ok to do that hospital thing you were talking about and we can get a Refrigerator in here for your future\u2026 meals. As far as animals, there are plenty of wild animals you could hunt isn\u2019t there?\u201d Papa said as he thought on it and advised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, not so much in the city but there are a few deer running around. There is always small game but not blood in them.\u201d you answered as you thought on what you had sensed today.\u201dBut if I can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t drink from strangers then who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think it would be ok if the person was willing but never so much as to kill them or drink them dry.\u201d Mom verified as she also thought on it but then both of them looked at each other as your stomach growled and you blushed at it. \u201cYou\u2019re hungry now aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss. Isibelle hadn\u2019t had any blood for 20 years and I am on the same schedule as her. So\u2026 yes, very hungry or rather thirsty. It was distracting all day at school.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDistracting, how exactly?\u201d Papa asked, as he was astute when it came to matters of your schooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can sense other people around and the blood in them. I can even tell you what blood type they are and how much they still have, wither they are sick or healthy, as well as their heartbeat and stuff like that. So a couple hundred students with delicious smelling and sounding blood in their veins all around me as I was so hungry was very distracting. One at a time was fine but\u2026 it was very tempting to just\u2026 I didn\u2019t but it was tempting.\u201d You tried to explain. It wasn\u2019t really possible to exactly describe the feeling of seeing a couple hundred people and only recognizing them as meat and blood sacks. Nor was it easy to explain without sounding blood thirst, which technically you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but\u2026 you can have some of ours if you need it.\u201d Papa said and your head shot up with your Mom\u2019s in shock. You didn\u2019t even want to consider drinking your family\u2019s blood. What if you couldn\u2019t stop? What if they died or were too weak because of it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that. I\u2026 what if I take too much? Or what if I can\u2019t stop? I don\u2019t want to crave my family\u2019s blood.\u201d you said in rapid succession as you began to get worked up but with his hand on yours he calmed you almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, as your parents, we should really know what we are dealing with. I admit there are risks for us. However there were so many risks when you told me. I can see now why you were scared when you told me. You were afraid that we\u2019d treat you differently or not love you anymore. Other parents might\u2019ve reacted that way, most would actually. You trusted us and now we are trusting you. If we say it is ok to feed on something or someone we should really know what we are telling you to do from the other side as well. We really should be your first so we can understand.\u201d Papa said to both you and your Mother. She was a little nervous and her heartbeat showed that as it beat a million miles an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you actually want me to drink your blood?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, just a little. Like you said it is important for you to show restraint and not take too much.\u201d He said and you looked away from them in a form of preshame. But only felt the hand on yours to squeeze and it made you look back to him. \u201cYou need to start somewhere Caleb and we both trust you. But how about this, if we think you are taking too much we\u2019ll say so and try to get you to stop.\u201d He said. It might\u2019ve been that you still thought him to be the best in the world but it did make you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I guess I can just take a little.\u201d You said then looked at them until your mother started removing some of the shirt cuff for you to dig in but you shook your head. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do it that way. The veins in the wrist are just as good.\u201d You said, to her partial relief. She was still nervous about letting you do this but held out her arm for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly took it and then grew your fangs. This made your mother\u2019s heartbeat rise a great deal. You looked up at her as if to ask if she really wanted this to which she smiled in a calm way and nodded for you to proceed. You looked back at her arm and saw the blood inside of it, circulating and pulsing. You slowly put your mouth to it then, in one go, sank your fangs into it and sucking up the blood as she gasped and it rushed into your mouth. But you were determined not to give in to the pleasure of drinking it so you pulled out far before necessary. You let go of her arm and she took it back as she was short of breath and looking at you with actual desire in her eyes, something you really didn\u2019t want to see in your mother, towards you. Your Father was almost eager to see what excited her so much and held out his arm. You did like before as you approached the same area and he nodded to which you mimicked the procedure. Oddly enough, when you were done with him, your energy was back to full. Maybe it was because of that but your body felt\u2026 alive and coursing with power, more so then before. You soon realized that the feeling was that of their warm blood digesting and adding its power to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was\u2026 not what I expected.\u201d Mom said as she wiped away the residual blood on her arm to find, like you said, no wound. You covered your mouth as your tongue licked up any blood that escaped then retracted your fangs before looking to them. \u201cThat feeling was incredible, why did you stop so early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it was hard to stop at all.\u201d you admitted to which they changed from desire to concern ridden faces. \u201cApparently the pleasure you get when I bite is to help speed up your blood so I can get it out quicker and for you to\u2026 want me to drink you dry. If I had drank anymore, not only would I not have wanted to stop but you wouldn\u2019t want me to stop either.\u201d You explained<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that you have eaten you can do all kinds of things, right?\u201d Asked Papa as he wisely changed the subject. You responded by turning to mist big enough for them to see and traveled up and across the room until you reappeared in the air and in a sitting posture, smiling at their shocked expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I thought you died for a moment.\u201d Mom almost scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t die. You never have to worry about me dying, well not for 2100 years.\u201d You said with a smile and a slight amount of sarcasm. \u201cAlthough, Miss. Isibelle said she used that skill to make it look like she did die when she was pursued by hunters and was building the Vampire reputation. That is why the legend says that Vampires ash when they die. I guess it is true but I simply can\u2019t die until I pass this\u2026 gift at the end of my time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did she build a reputation that makes you viewed as a demon?\u201d Papa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said it was to protect me, or the next Vampire. If all I have to do to prove I\u2019m not a Vampire to someone is go out into the sun then it is easier than messing with their minds or killing them. She basically made it so that people think other people are crazy or something for even thinking such things. I mean you both thought Vampires were fake until today so I guess it worked.\u201d You explained. \u201cBut it does kind of feel bad when I am used as an example of an evil creature or demon in school or Church. I know that they don\u2019t know any better but it still hurts, even indirectly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Caleb, we\u2019ll be here for you to lean on when you need to.\u201d Mom said and you both exchanged smiles. \u201cSo what else can you do?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is a really long list. But none of it is magic or witchcraft. It is just abilities that Vampires have. I can lift a few busses if I need to, I can run just under the speed of light, I can hear a dog bark from a few miles away and smell blood in particular much further than that. I can affect the elements like fire, lightning or anything that can use my body and its energy to start itself, not water. I can teleport to premade points if a seal is there as an anchor point and take people with me. I can see on the microscopic level from at least a mile away and in different modes like heat vision and movement sensors or scent perception. Obviously I can hover and float but not really fly, jump and hover but not fly all by its self.\u201d You said then paused as you were counting on your fingers but looked up to see there stunned faces at all the things you could do and there was obviously a lot more, they already knew that you could read and control minds if you wanted, via your confession earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith so many strengths do you have any weaknesses? Should I hide the silver and garlic?\u201d Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do have a few weaknesses. First, blood sucking is ranked a higher pleasure then sex, apparently, like I would know. Basically what you were feeling times 10. Also, silver does affect me but not fatally. It just makes me more normal. If someone shot me in the head with a silver bullet it would be like using a funnel to poor my Vampire powers out instead of a pressured fire hose. So it just makes me more normal. I could be restrained easily by a pair of silver handcuffs but, like I said, I can\u2019t die until I pass on the gift. Light and the sun is like the opposite for me than it used to. When you go into a room you have to turn on the light to see. Well it is the opposite for me, when you turn on the light or I\u2019m in the sun it restricts me and hinders my natural powers. Obviously not so much as I am helpless like with silver.\u201d You said as you gestured to you still floating in a well lit room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Caleb, now that we know I think your mother and I need to talk about this alone for a bit.\u201d Papa said as they both got up and you gently dropped to the floor with noticeably little noise. \u201cI guess it is ok for you to stay up since you don\u2019t need the sleep as much anymore but try not to listen in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d you said as your Mom gave you a hug, realizing too late that she had just put her neck right next to the same fangs that already drank form her that night. \u201cI love you both so much. Thank you for accepting me like this. I promise not to be bad.\u201d You said as you hugged then let go as your mother smiled at your words and went over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know Caleb, we love you to, but we DO need our sleep so try to keep it down ok?\u201d Papa said as he smiled and lifted your spirits even more then they were already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight Papa, Good night Mom.\u201d You said before they closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight Caleb.\u201d They returned before closing the door. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSarah, Caleb, Luke, Isaac; time to get up.\u201d Papa called and you all yelled down your \u2018okays\u2019 to show that you heard him. You of course got the shower first but dressed in the bathroom and got ready in your room. Surprising enough you required very little cleaning. Your body regenerated so the smell that normal people had didn\u2019t apply to you and what you did excrete as B.O. was actually an attractant. You guessed that it was to help possible hunting of prey, human or animal. But you showered and got ready out of pure habit then packed your things. You had run out of things to do in your room so you finished a week worth of homework and read your textbooks multiple times. But by the second read through you had memorized it. The level that your mind was working was making it almost boring. You went downstairs and put your bag by the door like always and went into the kitchen just like the previous morning but this time your father was already done reading and waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Mom, Good morning Papa.\u201d You said before giving them each a kiss on the cheek before taking your spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Caleb, you sleep well? Oh wait\u2026 you have a good rest, wait did you rest?\u201d Mom asked. Asking if you slept well was just a habit from years of greeting you in the morning so it was slightly comical to hear her stumble on it while continuing to cook breakfast, eggs and bacon with some toast this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of, I couldn\u2019t sleep so I just did like a week worth of homework and read all the text books I brought with me. I didn\u2019t think that I would get smarter with this new deal as well, I memorized all the books I read last night.\u201d You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I guess we can expect straight A grades from now on?\u201d Papa joked but was slightly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t even try yesterday and I got perfect scores. Might have a little problem in Gym though.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, that is a class you and your brothers always got good grades in.\u201d Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t have to hide my skill before and Mr. Hale thought the Konel boys were going into wrestling so he likes us for that. That reminds me, do I have to pull out of wrestling when it comes around?\u201d you asked and they looked at each other then smiled and looked back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you can stay in.\u201d Papa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith respect, won\u2019t that kind of be like cheating and I could hurt someone?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s cheating for someone with naturally bigger arms or legs to compete do you?\u201d asked Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but they can\u2019t snap someone in half or lift a bus like I can. I mean, I want to wrestle but not if I\u2019m going to hurt someone really bad.\u201d You almost argued but it was clear that you were more concerned than argumentative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cCaleb, that is why these sports are there. They teach you about many things besides beating the other person. They teach you, work ethic, teamwork, and in your case restraint. I think that being in a stressful situation like that and training your body to handle people like that will only help you in that. Your attitude of not wanting to hurt them will help you and is the reason why I think you can handle it. Besides, you can heal them if you hurt them, right?\u201d Papa explained and you nodded at his question as you thought about it. \u201cGood, now we\u2019ve come to a decision.\u201d He said as he was obviously talking about you being a Vampire and how to handle it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our family has always operated in the realm of love, respect, obedience, and trust. So that is how we should handle this as well.\u201d Papa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we are going to tell\u2026 everyone?\u201d you asked, unsure about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll only tell those old enough to handle the information, except our immediate family. They should all know but as far as the rest, your Mother and I will have a family meeting about it and address them, making sure they know that you are not bad or evil but yes a Vampire. We can keep most of your abilities a secret as none of us really understand them to begin with but we they will know the basics. We\u2019ll leave it up too you to expand on things. Although this may cause them to treat you a little more hostile and pull your cousins away from you. However I think that better than them finding out after the fact and without knowing that you are good.\u201d Papa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d Greeted Sarah as she came down and soon after Luke and Isaac. He silently shushed you as they came in but you didn\u2019t need it as you understood. Each one of them came down, greeted the others in the room and gave your parents a kiss on the cheek. Sarah was beginning to get to that age where she was shying away from it but still did so out of habit that early in the morning if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk everyone, I have some good news. I called in and you have the day off of school today.\u201d Papa said and almost was able to time the response as the all thanked him at the same time, as did you but for different reasons. You understood that telling them something like this then sending them off to school was not t good thing. \u201cBut we do have to have a family meeting and we must stay home all day.\u201d He said and other than you Sister you were all happy with that as well. She liked going out in the evening with friends, and it was Friday so it didn\u2019t help situations that much. Although staying inside also meant no working either so they were in the end more happy than peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all finished breakfast then went downstairs to the basement and into the family room, sitting down in your assigned chairs. You each had gone to the store with Papa and bought a chair or seat that you liked and would be \u2018your chair\u2019 when watching TV, having family meetings, movie nights, or whatever the reason. That meant if you spilled a milk shake on your chair than you couldn\u2019t just leave it and use someone else\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, we need to talk with you all about Caleb.\u201d Mom said in a gentle voice to which the eyes in the room snapped to you and your brothers\u2019 were a little mocking as they thought you were in trouble and were rubbing it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all know Miss. Isibelle?\u201d Papa asked the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that Caleb\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d Isaac asked as he had a rudimentary understanding of things at best but it still got you to blush and everyone else to laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she went to heaven but gave your brother something before she died.\u201d Mom said once the laughter had subsided. \u201cShe made him into a Vampire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said this the room became deathly silent. But that only lasted a minute as Isaac was the only one that didn\u2019t really know what that meant if it was true, while Sarah and Luke were both in a combination of shock and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Vampire! Caleb\u2019s a Vampire, do you mean with long pointy teeth and can turn into a bat?\u201d he asked excitedly. You slowly grew your fangs for them then retracted them to both his enjoyment and to snuff out any leftover doubts from Sarah and Luke. \u201cThat\u2019s is so cool! Can I see some cool tricks?\u201d he asked but was brought back to his seat by mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, Isaac there will be plenty of time for that later. We need to talk about it for now.\u201d Mom said and he reluctantly sat in his bean bag chair and watched you as if you would do a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to be joking, Caleb as a Vampire. For starters he was in the sun all day yesterday.\u201d Sarah interjected as Luke followed her train of thought, although they still seamed hung up on how you could grow fangs if you weren\u2019t one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we are telling you the truth as we do in this family. We will have all day for him to prove it to you. But he has already proved it to Mom and I so that is not up for debate.\u201d Papa said in an authoritative voice that immediately purged all doubt from their minds and you helped push the rest out so they believed without doubt. \u201cNow, one at a time you can ask us or him questions and we\u2019ll answer them for you.\u201d Papa said as he pointed to Sarah, as she was oldest, to go first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you like the ones in the movies with the crosses and stuff?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Miss. Isibelle helped make up those stories to protect her and now my secret. They are as fake as before and I am nothing like them.\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d Sarah started but was cut off by a grunt from Papa that indicated it was passed her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to suck our blood?\u201d Luke asked rather bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not for a while at least.\u201d You answered to which you turned to Papa and Mom for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has decided not to suck the blood of people that don\u2019t ask him to do it, but if he does he has to be careful. But don\u2019t worry, he can\u2019t turn you into a vampire.\u201d Mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, so I can\u2019t be a Vampire?\u201d Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t even if I wanted to. It just doesn\u2019t work like that. There is only one Vampire in the world and you\u2019re looking at him and I can\u2019t make anyone else one.\u201d You answered to which he pouted but accepted the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can you survive in sunlight and eat normal food if you are a Vampire?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSunlight is just like night time is for you. I am weaker but by no means helpless\u2026 or dead. As for eating, I only need blood like gas in a car to power myself and any abilities I can do. As for the rest of the weaknesses, they don\u2019t really work. You have to understand that everything you know about Vampires is pretty much garbage, made by the previous Vampire Miss. Isibelle to protect the future and herself.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d asked Luke and so began the start of a very long family meeting as they went around d and you answered questions and did tricks for them. Papa told them the story on how you got your Vampire Powers and why you were the only one. It definitely was the going to be a long, tiring, but fun day as they seemed to be taking it very well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One thing your siblings didn\u2019t mind about you being a super powered Vampire was that your parents, more specifically Papa, would give you most of the work, leaving them with less of it. You went out to him and walked in as he was trying to get the car up so he could change the tire. The jack he used was old and hardly worked, well as far as going up was concerned. Once it was up it didn\u2019t have a problem, or when you went down. \u201cCaleb, can you lend me a hand here?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d You said as you grabbed the van and lifted it up almost effortlessly while he eased the jack up to meet it. You then lowered it onto the defective piece of equipment but you could also fix that as you touched it and it repaired itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that took less time than I expected. I needed to talk with you though. It has been a few weeks since you change and we had the big family meeting last Saturday and I thought you should know what they said.\u201d Papa said, the first part made you feel good while the last part was preparing your for not so good a feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid they think it was ok?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they did but they don\u2019t think it is wise for you to hang out with your cousins that much anymore.\u201d He said and you looked at him confused. \u201cThey just need some time to be sure you\u2019re not bad. We are around you all the time, so we know it but they are still in shock from it all. As you said, the rumors and Legends about Vampires don\u2019t help the situation at all. But they don\u2019t hate you for it and are willing to keep it a family secret and tell their own kids when they reach around 16.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can I still go to Christmas and stuff like that?\u201d you asked as you wondered how far it was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes you can. In fact Grandpa and Grandma Konel are wanting to see for themselves and are actually quite excited, as are Grandpa and Grandma Lon. Don\u2019t worry too much Caleb, they will all come around eventually. Our family may be a tad strange but we are all close and love each other. Sometimes we don\u2019t like each other but we all love each other.\u201d Papa said to your down cast eyes to the first part of his report. This little bit brought your eyes back up and smiled as you knew what he said to be true. Your family was loud, touchy, in everyone\u2019s business, and\u2026 yeah weird, but they were furiously loyal and loved each other very much. The only danger you had was if one of you cousins had some loose lips and it came back to bite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Papa, and for letting everyone get the tattoo.\u201d You said. You had experimented with your teleportation ability and learned you needed to have a glyph of sorts to anchor your area. Other than that you could teleport in mist form or many other ways to avoid detection upon arrival. However you asked them if they would tattoo the glyph on their bodies somewhere, anywhere, so you could find them if they were ever in any trouble. The glyph was just a symbol fang that mimicked the ones you had. Sarah put it on her ankle and the others in areas on their bodies that could be hidden easily even with barely any clothes on, like at the swimming pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a good idea. Now we just have to figure a way to call you and we\u2019ll be all set. But maybe it is better if we didn\u2019t. I mean that would be annoying to have all of us calling you all the time, maybe just to bring Luke a soda or Sarah her makeup.\u201d Papa joked and you laughed at it as well. It could very well be used as a leash, something that you didn\u2019t like the idea of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, can you help me with something?\u201d called Mom. You smiled and Papa gave a nod that he was done with you for a while so you went over to help her out. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You never really had a lot of friends at school to begin with. Usually it was because of you lack of social skills and you na\u00c3\u00afve behavior toward morals and personal preference that made you stand out and be pushed down by the others. Now that your body naturally attracted people they were being nicer to you but most people were far from kind or wanted much to do with you. After all, at that age, popularity was a big thing but not for you which made you, your Vampirism aside, weird. But you didn\u2019t care that much back then and certainly not now. You talked most often with your teachers than you did with fellow students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch where you\u2019re going. Maybe you should go put your glasses back on, four eyes.\u201d Said a kid named Brandon from eighth grade as he tried to push you out of his way with his shoulder, when you weren\u2019t looking, only to fall over yourself. You would\u2019ve chalked it up to your Vampire strength but your family never were pushovers. Naturally thick and strong you didn\u2019t budge and he was thin enough to fall over but his excuse ran hollow as you weren\u2019t even walking yet as you got your books out of your locker, but his bullying did get a good number of people to laugh at you. You simply shut your locker and went on your way, leaving the laughing students behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you sitting alone?\u201d asked a girl that you didn\u2019t know the name of but was in your grade. You were currently at lunch and partially enjoying a simple ham sandwich. While your taste in food had also changed you didn\u2019t mind normal food at all and as such ate just like any other kid your age, actually a little more since your metabolism was so insanely high now that you could eat an entire buffet and still not gain a pound or be completely full. In fact, the only time you were full since you changed was when  you drank your parent\u2019s blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on it, I just sat down and started eating. It just so happened that no one else sat down at this specific table.\u201d You answered. The tables were round and could seat 10 comfortably 8 with some elbow room but the curse or blessing of a small school was there is lots of empty space per class. The most in a single class at your school was 34 students and yours was 27.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I\u2019ll sit here to, if that\u2019s ok with you?\u201d she asked to which you just smiled and she took it as a yes. She wasn\u2019t the most popular girl because she was a \u2018late bloomer\u2019. Meaning that puberty hadn\u2019t set in yet, well at least not the part where she could grow out in places that made the other girls popular. However, despite her thin frame and black hair she seemed strong and athletic. She had just made it on the Cheerleading team, and got really good grades. Her black shoulder length hair was wavy like as she was slightly Asian, but not enough to effect a high majority of her features. She had bright blue eyes and darker toned skin like she was tan all the time but she wasn\u2019t. In fact she got lighter in the winter from the lack of tanning but still looked slightly tanned overall. Some girls teased her and said she was going to tanning beds to make up for not having any boobs like they did. But since you weren\u2019t really popular you didn\u2019t know her name as she had never came and talked to you, you two weren\u2019t even in the same class, same grade and her slightly younger but not the same class. \u201cI\u2019m Kelsey Dremer by the way, what\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked as she took out her lunch, which consisted of an apple and juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb Konel, um\u2026 do you want some more food?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why do you think I need it?\u201d she asked in an offended tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 no. I didn\u2019t mean it that way. I just\u2026 my Mom packs me so much and I saw you only have an apple and\u2026 well you used to have a juice.\u201d You said as you tried to explain yourself and she drank her juice in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, did you ever think that a juice and apple is all I need?\u201d she asked then took a chunk out of her apple. You obviously hit a button that you didn\u2019t mean to hit. This was why you didn\u2019t talk to girls in the first place. You never knew what to say and when you finally got something good you stumbled over yourself and made it sound like a monkey could\u2019ve said it better. Not to mention you usually always said something that rubbed them the wrong way and you didn\u2019t even know what it was. you were just trying to be nice and she was biting your head off for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean anything bad.\u201d You apologized and took out a plate with a piece of apple pie on it that your mother made last night. It was a big piece and as soon as you took the cover off you used your contact ability to warm it up just enough to cause it to smell but not catch an eye. Even if you liked the smell of blood over everything else, no one could really hate the smell of fresh baked apple pie. You took a hidden whiff then took a bite. You kept your eyes downcast so not to offend her again but you could almost feel her staring at the large piece of pie you were eating. The apple she had only lasted a few bites and she was just sitting there but when her stomach growled a little, not loud enough for anyone but you and her to hear, she blushed as you looked up at her and pushed the pie over a little to her. \u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t hungry? Because that sounded like your body was disagreeing with you.\u201d you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that my body is any of your business but\u2026\u201d she stopped herself mid insult as she looked at the still warm pie, filling her nose with its heavenly aroma. \u201c\u2026 as long as you are offering.\u201d She said and grabbed the extra fork you had. She took a bite and her eyes lit up as she tasted the little slice of heaven. Granted not everyone liked apple pie but she definitely did and your mom was simply amazing at cooking, as evidence to your overweight family. Luckily enough you had 2 milks as you were planning on drinking them both but it looked like she\u2019d need something to wash it down so you put the milk in front of her plate so she could still eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll need something to wash it down.\u201d You stated before drinking the other one. She finished off the pie and drank hers as well to which you cleaned up and crumpled it all up in the brown paper bag then tossed it into the garbage from your seat, granted the garbage can was only a few feet away but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat store did you get that from?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone, my Mom made it last night. Actually she made 3 but we had some extras so she sent it with me. She always says that a healthy kid is a well fed kid so she feeds me and my brothers really good, but my sister is on a diet so I got her piece.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how aren\u2019t you like a billion pounds by now? I\u2019ll probably gain a few inches because of that.\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t really know, my whole family is really big and\u2026 well naturally fat from eating so much all the time. My Dad says I have a high metabolism and my body just burns it off really fast. He also says that it will catch up to me some day.\u201d You answered. Not a few seconds after that the bell rung, signaling the end of lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s us I guess. Is it ok if I sit with you tomorrow too?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, as you can see, I get a lot of people sitting with me.\u201d You joked and she just smiled at it then walked off. You took a little longer but also went off to class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey bud, you want to give us a hand?\u201d asked Papa as he came into your room late one night. You were just reading some stuff in your history book and marveling at some vague memories that the other Vampires had experienced. Greeks, Romans, and more than a few errors that proved true that history wasn\u2019t always about facts but who wrote and recorded the \u2018facts\u2019. Either way, your family let you roam the house at night as they knew they couldn\u2019t stop you if you wanted to and it wasn\u2019t like staying in your room all the time would convince you to sleep, although on the rare occasion you did rest your eyes for an hour or two, but then be fully rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, what is it this time?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa and Grandma Konel were driving and rolled in a ditch after sliding on the road a little. They are fine aside from a few scratches and bruises but their car\u2026 the tow truck couldn\u2019t get at it and they are going to ticket them if they don\u2019t find a towing company to get it out of there.\u201d Papa reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 yeah I can help, as long as there\u2019s no other people around. They don\u2019t happen to have the glyph we told them to hang onto do they?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Grandpa has it in his wallet and Grandma in her purse. Why\u2026 oh I get it. Well this will be interesting, my first teleportation, how does it feel?\u201d Papa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that bad, kind of like accelerating in a plane accept the air doesn\u2019t come with you. Just hold your breath and it should be ok.\u201d You answered as you located the glyph inside your Grandpa\u2019s wallet and used it as a radar to see if anyone was around him. With the area located and accessed you held out your had to Papa. He took a deep breath then took hold of your hand. As soon as you got a good grip you teleported, second or two later popping up just behind your Grandparents on the side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJim, we just need some strong guys and a few trucks.\u201d Said the large man that was your Grandpa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa.\u201d Your father said, as he also referred to his father and your grandfather as \u2018Papa\u2019. Both of them turned around to see the both of you and almost fell over when they saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, I\u2026 Where\u2019s your van?\u201d asked Grandma as Grandpa quickly finished things with your uncle Jim then entered the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, come on and give us a kiss.\u201d Grandpa stated to your delight. He was a very wise man and noticed your hesitancy do to some of the welcomes you got from your other extended family members. No one wanted your fangs anywhere near them and definitely not close enough for you to give them a kiss on the cheek like kids your age did to your grandparents, well kids in your family at least. Heck, it was probably where your Father got it from. You went over a little shy and gave them both a kiss and a hug, despite the smiles they were putting on you could feel their blood pumping and heartbeat increase. But it did feel good to be accepted by your Grandparents, even if it was currently forced on their end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you dear.\u201d Your Grandma said after she got in on a hug, held it for a little bit then allowed you to back up a little so that they could get going on things. You were surprised that the police or emergence vehicles were gone but you weren\u2019t going to complain when you preferred it that way, well now you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re here but where\u2019s your van?\u201d asked Grandpa asked this time as he already had chains laid out to pull their car out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb teleported us here. That was why he gave you those glyphs, so he could find and teleport to where you are in order to help.\u201d Papa said to them and they seemed to think about it while Papa looked around and saw no one around, neither did you at this hour. \u201cCaleb, can you\u2026 you know?\u201d Papa asked as he gestured you to get the car out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, shouldn\u2019t be that hard.\u201d You said then jumped down to where the car was. It was a dangerous slope and not one that people just jumped down for kicks. It was one reason why a tow truck couldn\u2019t get at it, or more accurately wouldn\u2019t. You grabbed it on the frame and lifted the car, flipped it right side up, then jumped up and past them. With a final bit of maneuvering you sat the car down and repaired it with what you and your family were calling your \u2018outside regeneration\u2019. It was as good as new but you fell over after you got done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb! Caleb, are you ok?\u201d Papa asked as he came running over, the other 2 to shocked to move. He got you to your feet but was holding you up. \u201cI thought you said it wouldn\u2019t be that hard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting it out of the ditch wasn\u2019t, regenerating it was more draining than I thought.\u201d You said a little slurred and spaced out. Your fangs were showing as you were actively looking for something to recharge with, blood to be more specific. It was a good thing that Papa brought some of the bagged blood that you\u2026 convinced the hospital to donate. It was well over 2 pints of blood and he held the bag to your mouth. You immediately dug into it and sucked the bag dry in under a 10 seconds. \u201cThanks Papa.\u201d You said as you regained your footing, full of blood and powered up. You licked away some of the excess blood before taking the old blood bag and disposing of it in a quick flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNote to self, when asking Caleb to life cars and regenerate totaled ones, be sure to bring some blood with me.\u201d Papa joked and you smiled at it.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took a moment but, after silently consulting with one another they both turned to you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2026I\u2026 we are so proud of you.\u201d Grandma said and reached out for you but cringed a little as she held her shoulder. You looked into her body and saw that her shoulder was broken in 3 places so you gently went over and just touched her and she was healed, well it only looked like that. On the inside you injected part of your body into her, treated her injuries, then exited. You again backed away to let her recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Grandpa asked as he was obviously out of the loop that she was hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I saw Grandma\u2019s shoulder was broken so I\u2026 fixed it.\u201d You answered shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was broken?\u201d she asked to which you nodded. \u201cWell you\u2019re just a wonderful blessing aren\u2019t you.\u201d she stated as she came forward and gave you a hug and kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Grandma.\u201d You said as she parted from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear, what did we do to make you thank us?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were just\u2026 being you. I know my new self is hard to take in for people. I like it when it doesn\u2019t matter anymore and people are just being themselves again.\u201d You answered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you mind if I get the 5 star treatment as well?\u201d asked Grandpa and you nodded then went over and touched him in the same way, healing his wounds and headache before stepping back. But you didn\u2019t get very far before he pulled you into a large hug, literally. He was easily twice or perhaps three times your size. It took a moment but you hugged him back. It was longer then with Grandma but eventually you were able to step back from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this big guy still has school tomorrow so we got to get going.\u201d Papa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we give you a lift home?\u201d asked Grandma as Grandpa went and started the car, waiting for Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok Mom, Caleb is my ride. We\u2019ll see you both later and drive safe.\u201d He said as he waved then took your hand, took a breath, then nodded. You then teleported away and back into your room where you had started that evening, to see your mom on your bed waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where have the two of you been?\u201d asked Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa and Grandma Konel flipped their car in a ditch and we just went and helped them get out of it.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you did huh? That must\u2019ve been interesting, what did they say?\u201d She asked more Papa then you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that they finally understand Caleb, well as any of us can at this point. He was very good, got the car out of the ditch, repaired it, repaired them, and didn\u2019t go blood drunk even if we did have to use a bag of blood to help him recharge.\u201d Papa answered, giving you a proud pat on the back. Mom smiled then got up and gave you a kiss on the cheek, then followed it up with a giant hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of you Caleb. You see, they can\u2019t stay away from you forever.\u201d She said as just last week you were wondering how long it would take for the rest to accept you, to which she just said to be patient.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCan I sit?\u201d asked Kelsey as she looked at you to which you nodded and motioned to the nearest chair subtly as you ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat by you that one time but immediately after that she was pulled into the \u2018popular people\u2019 crowd. You didn\u2019t really care as you didn\u2019t really have any friends at school anyway, sure everyone was nicer to you now but most had their little groups that did everything between just hanging out to doing the 3 big ones, which is what your teachers called \u2018sex, drugs, and rock\u2019n roll\u2019. Even in a private Christian school it was segmented like that and things went on that \u2018good kids\u2019 shunned away from. You were one of those kids, although if you had to be honest, blood drinking would put you in one of the Vampire/goth groups that were around. Even with the strict dress code they still found a way to dress in all black. You never really got that, sure you liked black and the darkness but you could be wearing bleached white clothes and still sneak around just as easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you looking at?\u201d she asked as she sat down and you finished up your lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think that wearing the stuff they do and shaving their teeth makes them vampires?\u201d you asked comically as you looked over at the \u2018vampire table\u2019 they drank tomato juice and at things that could be cooked but left a lot of raw meat in them, like steak or hamburger. They had some unhealthy things they did but not in school. Although the blood from their lunch sometimes enticed you, but never enough to condone what they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, but it makes them feel better so I guess, to each their own.\u201d She answered. \u201cYou know they probably would take you in if you\u2019re interested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just content watching them. Think it\u2019s actually comical to see them acting like idiots and thinking they are real Vampires. I bet if they existed and saw them that they wouldn\u2019t be to impressed. Well, they at least got the whole arrogant part down, movie vampires would be so proud.\u201d You joked and she chuckled a little as well. \u201cCan\u2019t say that I agree with them not showering though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, apparently, they think that taking a shower is the same as the whole running water thing. Running water would kill a vampire, if the existed so they don\u2019t touch it. Well that\u2019s what Emily says anyway.\u201d Kelsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a girl on the cheer squad with me that is part of their little group. We keep telling her to take a shower, or at least bath but she insists that it would kill her because she\u2019s a real vampire.\u201d Kelsey said as she nodded over at the table with the Cheerleaders sitting at it and the one with black makeup was easily seen, not that the tomato juice and partially raw hamburger wasn\u2019t a dead giveaway. You had to admit you were hoping she was one but her scent immediately gave it away that she wasn\u2019t. Not that you doubted Isibelle or your genetic knowledge, but it still would\u2019ve been nice to have someone else to share your life with that was more like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I mind the company, but why are you over here rather than with them?\u201d You asked. She partially cringed at the question as she usually was at that table with the rest of the Cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that I wasn\u2019t very nice to you after the last time and you were so nice to me. They told me that I could come back to their table when I get a rack\u2026\u201d she said, the last part rather shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it really matter that much?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Of course it matters. All the Cheerleaders sit at that table and they won\u2019t let me back over there until I\u2026 bloom.\u201d She said as she gestured to her lack of bust but you didn\u2019t dare to look where she was gesturing to. It was a trap that girls that age used all too often, get a guy to look at their chest then paint them a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like but doesn\u2019t having\u2026 extra up there make it harder to do flips and stuff? I mean you have to be the most athletic girl in the bunch and my Mom said that late bloomers always bloom the best\u2026\u201d you asked and tried to compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you don\u2019t care if a girl has extra big ones?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is all they have then it is kind of a turn off to me. I mean, and excuse my forwardness, if I wanted just boobs then I could get some honkers on a stuffed doll or something. For me, I like people that are real. Dang that sounded really cheesy didn\u2019t it?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it did. Kind of like my Dad.\u201d She said and giggled at parts of what you said and your blushing to her response. \u201cBut it was sweet. I thought all you guys liked was girls with big ones. They\u2019re right, you are kind of weird, but that isn\u2019t such a bad thing. Hey, I know I said this last time, but is it ok if I sit with you during lunch?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d you asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you going into wrestling? And they have a table so\u2026\u201d She said in a way that allowed you to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see. To tell you the truth I don\u2019t really get into the whole sitting with the crowd thing. I mean, what is so great about sitting in groups to watch each other eat? Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the company but I don\u2019t feel obligated to sit with them just because they think I should or that I\u2019d be cool if I did. I\u2019m use to not being popular so it doesn\u2019t bother me\u2026 and this way the older kids can\u2019t take my food.\u201d You said, following it up with the little joke, getting her to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d She said as the bell rung and she was off to her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so, this time\u201d you said after she left. You walked out and was pushed aside hard by one of the people in that \u2018vampire\u2019 group as the whole table left the lunch room. You just shook your head and almost laughed. If they knew who you really were they would be bowing to you. But having that bunch of arrogant idiots bowing to you would only be a hassle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCaleb, wait up.\u201d Called a voice that you knew to be Kelsey\u2019s. You did as you were opening the door to go home. More recently she had been walking home from school with you. Her parents usually paid for after school care so it was a big help that she could just stay at your house until she could be picked up. You got a lot of your chores done at night to fill the time so you could entertain her mostly but not that much. Mainly when you got home you would help you father with whatever he needed then do day chores like mowing the grass and stuff while she waited. There were times when you got done in time to see her off but that wasn\u2019t too often. Mainly she just hung out with your sister and Mom while doing some of her homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kelsey.\u201d You greeted as you held the door open for her then headed on home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe\u2026 someone has a girl\u2026 friend.\u201d Teased some kid named Nick that got Kelsey to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone doesn\u2019t.\u201d you shot back to get the bully himself to get laughed at by and including Kelsey and yourself as you walked away. You didn\u2019t usually bully people, especially now, but you didn\u2019t mind turning it on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m your girl friend now.\u201d Kelsey lightly teased, causing you to blush a little as you both walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell kind of. At the very least you are a girl and you\u2019re my friend. But it doesn\u2019t have to be anything serious. I just get a kick out of making bullies like that seem idiotic. I mean what guy teases another about HAVING a girl friend when he doesn\u2019t have one himself to brag about. Isn\u2019t it usually the other way around?\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but if it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019d kind of like to keep it as just friends for now.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me. As you can tell, I\u2019m not exactly the most popular guy in the school so having someone around helps a lot.\u201d You said to her and she just smiled back. She did have a really cute smile, almost dainty but so innocent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Wrestling starts tomorrow for you huh?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they say it is going to be really hard but I doubt it. I mean my Father already has me work all the time. I have a feeling that it will be a breeze but then again he said that Wrestling is harder so\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask you, why Wrestling?\u201d Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell our school doesn\u2019t have football and all the others aren\u2019t physical enough. As you probably guessed, I was raised in a way that emphasizes being big, strong, and powerful\u2026 well physically at least. So I can\u2019t really see myself doing a sport that gives me fouls or penalties for every time I touch someone. Sure the spandex may be a little weird but I think I prefer throwing people around rather than tossing a ball through a small metal hoop. No offense to the Basketball players, plus at our school the other teams pretty much suck. I mean name the last time one of the teams besides Wrestling has actually won a game or match.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point, plus I can\u2019t wait to see you with your shirt off.\u201d She teased and got you to blush again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not that impressive.\u201d You said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come one, lighten up Caleb. I\u2019m sure you look fine under these things.\u201d She said as she pulled playfully at your shirt but not enough to be suggestive. \u201cSo can I ask you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d You answered, a little curious to her sudden serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you get all popular and stuff, are you still going to have time for me?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey, I thought we already established this. I told you that true friends are more important to me then the fake ones that being popular brings. I mean, where are all those \u2018friends\u2019 you had when you joined Cheerleading? Plus, I bet you\u2019ll be more popular than I will.\u201d You complimented and she just hugged into you as the two of you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s make a promise, that we won\u2019t forget our friendship if and when we become popular.\u201d She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t think I can forget you Kelsey. I\u2019m sure in a year or two you\u2019ll blow right by me in looks and that kind of thing. Like I said, I\u2019ve never been the popular guy at school.\u201d You answered to which she just squeezed your arm a little as the two of you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, and I won\u2019t go so far to forget you either.\u201d She finished.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOk, next. Hey the Konel boy. Step right up.\u201d Coach Hale said as he operated the scale to weigh in everyone. Junior High sports weren\u2019t as big as High School but they still taught everyone how everything was done and made a big enough deal about it to make the kids proud. You were already in your shorts and t-shirt then took a step up and waited for the scale to spit out a number. After it appeared to think about it, it displayed 145 on the screen. \u201cAh, big guy for so young. Go on and warm up in the practice room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as instructed and went into a small room that was usually the middle school Chapel room, where once a week middle school would come together like a mini and educations church service. But in the evenings it doubled as the wrestling room with the mats all laid out and such. You went in and put your new wrestling shoes on. You read up on wrestling as much as you could but in the end you still didn\u2019t know what you were doing so you waited for someone to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey new kid, don\u2019t just sit there. Start running with the rest of us.\u201d said a big eighth grader and obviously one of the big guys on the team. You did as instructed, warming up didn\u2019t do much for you though. You could run all the way up north, a near 5 hour drive, to your family\u2019s cabin and back within 20 minutes and still not break a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSprint!\u201d came a call as you all continued running. This part was hard for you to. Obviously you couldn\u2019t go too fast but you didn\u2019t want to be thought of as slow or weak either. So you had to gauge a good jog, run, and sprint speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of practice you made sure you were impressive enough to be noticed but not so much as to be considered abnormal, well no where near enough to cause suspicion anyway. A lot of the practice was conditioning though, lots of running, doing stairs, sprinting, pushups, sit ups, and pretty much every practical conditioning exercise the coach could think of. Afterwards you got your shower in and went home, not really impressed but felt more complete now that you were part of something like most other students. While the others on the team slightly looked at you in slight awe because of you now natural skill and athleticism they were far from treating like one of their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it, you could be really good.\u201d Matt said as he followed you out. You had drilled a little with him and he immediately noticed your skill was higher than his but lacked the experience and move set to beat him, well not the way you were revealing at least. You could always force him onto his back and win but not under the realistic realm of wrestling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt Malcame was a very large and very talented kid that was one of the few truly talented wrestlers in middle school, never losing a match before and wrestled 2 weight classes higher than you. He looked like a mini Brock Lesnar, with a very thick frame and just massive all the way around but not a giant as far as height was concerned. He was one of those guys that everyone you knew wished to be, including you\u2026 well you use to. Your muscle definition was now greater than his and your body fat percentage lower than his as well. The only thing he had on you was size, and from most people\u2019s perspective that didn\u2019t know better his strength as well. In wrestling he had massive amounts of experience compared to almost any other kid. His Dad was an All American but died after he joined the Marines and went on a mission. But his father\u2019s wish was to see him in the sport and do well so that is what his family did, from 5 years old he was trained and was no slouch by any means. He could easily beat other guys at the 189 weight class in high school but was wise enough to not push it too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense Matt but I\u2019m not really into wrestling for the long term. But it is fun and I\u2019ll train hard while in practice. Otherwise I can\u2019t afford to go to these wrestling camps and strength training things. I work with my Father a lot and even if I wanted to he wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d You answered. He was trying to convince you to go to a wrestling camp in Iowa. To be honest, the camp he was referring to was the one you researched when looking up moves and the rules before you joined. You knew it was an awesome camp but you didn\u2019t really need to strength train or learn wrestling like most people. Well you did but, again, no like most people. You had resorted to teleporting up north to your family\u2019s cabin and running all night as fast as you could in circles then digging a hole a mile deep then filling it back up and doing it again. You highly doubted that a human strength camp could push you to get stronger in such a way, especially if they didn\u2019t know how strong you really were and why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it. How can you have so much talent and strength and not be interested. I had to work hard for this.\u201d he said as he gestured to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost think I\u2019m just weird. I don\u2019t really care if I\u2019m popular or not and, even though I eat more than most of my family, I don\u2019t gain fat or weight like they do. I do the same amount of work and my muscles just retain more than my brothers. Although for our age none of my brothers are really weak by most standards. My family means everything to me and we are content with doing a lot for nothing. I mean we mow the lawn of our entire neighborhood for free and shovel in the winter. It is just the way we are I guess. So if you want me to go to one of those things then you only really have to convince one person, my Father.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a say in it?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I do. But in my family, what my Father says is law. He isn\u2019t bad by any means. But if he says jump I do it without question.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can respect that. I do what my parents say to. When my Dad was still here I never disobeyed him either. But you are at least going to stick it out at our school right?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to join, basketball?\u201d you answered back. Normally, wrestlers didn\u2019t play basketball. The muscles used just don\u2019t transfer and well, if you ever see a normal wrestler that has wrestled for a few years play then you know why. While it wasn\u2019t true for you, Matt knew this as well and smiled at the joke. Besides, with no football at your school, wrestling was the only \u2018man\u2019s sport\u2019 that there was. Sure the others took skill but nothing that let aggression out like wrestling or football did, and sense football wasn\u2019t there all the bigger guys that could take it were in wrestling\u2026 which in a small school wasn\u2019t many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk man, see you tomorrow.\u201d He said as you got to the doors and was about to walk out. You both waved and you went off to walk home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo how\u2019s practice going?\u201d asked Kelsey as you two sat together on the bus. As part of the school\u2019s attempt to strengthen the educational experience the schedule team building activities to bolster the grade\u2019s participation in school centered activities. For 6th graders it is a retreat to a Camp for 5 days. Your parents were reluctant to let you go but in the end it was mandatory and they just fed you a few pints of blood from your hospital stock to be on the safe side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is good enough I guess. The practices are pretty intense which I like.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be much worse than mine.\u201d Kelsey stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you, I\u2019m not a cheerleader or have ever been to one of your practices. But the first hour is usually just condition; sprinting, running, doing massive amounts of pushups and sit ups, stairs, and bear crawls. Then we drill moves for another hour and a half and finish up with some more sprinting and running to calm down. Coach Hale mixes it up a little to keep us guessing but that is basically what we do.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it back, maybe your practice is harder than ours. Damn, don\u2019t you men know what the word overkill means?\u201d she asked rhetorically. \u201cGosh I\u2019m tired, do you mind if I sleep on you?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, we got another hour or so before we get there.\u201d You said to which she leaned against you and fell asleep, using your arm as a pillow as she clung to it. You smiled a bit then just watched out the window as the bus drove along. You knew this place as you ran up north a few times a week. You had to stop yourself thinking that this was transportation as it moved at a snail\u2019s pace compared to what you normally traveled at. Instead you thought of it as a really long and usually quiet tour. You allowed her to sleep and sometimes held her with your mind to help her sleep peacefully. Other kids on the bus were sporadically noisy and would otherwise wake her up. But when you arrived you took your hold off of her mind and gently woke her. \u201cWhat excellent timing, we just arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I actually slept really good for being on a bus.\u201d She said then covered her mouth for a yawn then stretched a little. You all shortly after got off the bus and separated to your assigned cabins. Guys and girls were obviously separate and took up a few cabins each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s mine. You get the top Caleb.\u201d Stated one of the popular kids as he pushed his way and plopped his stuff on the bottom bunk just before you. You just shrugged and threw your sleeping bag and stuff on the top bunk. You had a poly hook that stuck to walls and stuff to put your bag just above you while you rolled out your bag and found a surprise latching onto the ceiling above your bunk. \u201cHoly crap! That\u2019s is a huge damned spider!\u201d said the same kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here big guy.\u201d You called as you sat up and against the wall your bunk was against. They watched as you reached up to the large wolf spider that was right next to your bag. It had bolted there after one of them threw their shoe at it. You ever trusty scent calmed it and your natural attractiveness kept it following your orders as the spider crawled onto your hand and sat there looking at you as you pet it a little. Funny though, you use to be Arachnophobic but now you actually preferred spiders and rescued them whenever possible from your house and the other members of your family that were still scared to death of them, especially Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re going to kill that thing aren\u2019t you?\u201d asked Nick, the kid from before. He obviously wasn\u2019t a spider person either, nor was the other 10 in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that would be unappreciative of me. Who do you think keeps this place free of other bugs?\u201d you asked as you pet your temporary pet. \u201cOr would you rather get bitten by a couple hundred flies and mosquitoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to get bit by fang boy there.\u201d Said Nick and being the more popular one he swayed the rest of the cabin as well. You thought about it for a while then saw a few spaces in the ceiling and walls that the big guy could effectively hide. You input the locations of these places to which he scurried over your body and out of a hole in the wall. \u201cHey, you let him get away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course I did. But I didn\u2019t ask him to leave either. He must\u2019ve sensed that he wasn\u2019t wanted around here so he left.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s just going to come back and bite us.\u201d Nick roared. \u201cI\u2019m telling Mr. Vance about this. If I get bit it is going to be all your fault.\u201d And with that he stormed out and left you there in bed and thinking how much alike you were to that spider. All it took was them to know he was there to want him dead, and he didn\u2019t do anything bad, in fact with him gone you saw some previously scared bugs coming in. Good thing you asked him to come back. You didn\u2019t need it but it would be nice to not get eaten alive by mosquitoes at night. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDon\u2019t even say anything you spider freak.\u201d Nick had said when Mr. Vance didn\u2019t back him up and told him that spiders were common and that you were to be commended for being able to handle a live one. So you laid in your bunk without receiving a wink of sleep. Luckily for you, your little friend came back and caught a good majority of any bug that approached you until they didn\u2019t bother you anymore. From that point you let the spider sleep on your chest while you pet him. You heard slaps and rustling all night as blood sucking bugs like flies, mosquitoes, and nats were ruthless all night. It wasn\u2019t as boring with a pet spider to pet as you waited for morning. You were allowed to get out of bed at 5 so you could go for a run, leaving the spider in your pillow that opened near the wall so he could escape if they decided to do something to your stuff while you were gone. An hour and a half later you came back and headed straight for the shower as they others were starting to stir. You took a short and cold one so they couldn\u2019t accuse you of hogging all the warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you didn\u2019t get bit up at all. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d Said Nick as he looked at your shirtless upper body. At first they were stunned at your impressive physic but then they noticed that you lacked the dotted spots that lined their bodies from head to toe, causing them to itch around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure it is, my little friend came back and helped me out last night. He caught every bug within a foot of me. I guess they figured that the rest of you were easier prey. Not my fault you didn\u2019t want him catching all the bugs around here.\u201d You defended as you slipped on a black sleeveless shirt, black shorts, and black shoes. Your shirt had a silver dragon design on the back and your glyph on the front. You then jumped up to your bed and whistled that brought you little friend out of hiding for you to pet. \u201cSeems like the spider freak is the only one without any bug bites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you freak.\u201d Nick said and pushed his way into the bathroom for his turn in the shower. The others were obviously not liking this at all and approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think he can protect us tonight to?\u201d asked Scott, a nerdy kid with thick glasses but president of the card club at your school. The clubs at school had to be run and financed by the students but approved by the faculty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps if you all stop throwing shoes at him he can do his job.\u201d You said and with a final pet you let him down and he scurried onto the ceiling and went about making more webs and eating a few bugs that were caught in the few that remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you do that? I mean, doesn\u2019t wild spiders like that bite people?\u201d asked Alex, a pretty popular kid shorter than you with sleek dirty blonde hair that was just short enough to follow the dress code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTons of practice and the experience to read what he is going to do and what his attack language is. If I were to just grab at him he would bite me without hesitation. Actually this one is well mannered as I was surprised it didn\u2019t bite me anyway. But that\u2019s just the nature of a spider, to protect themselves against big, scary, shoe throwing giants.\u201d You answered then hopped down and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Caleb, did you take a run this morning?\u201d asked Jacob, another popular person on the basketball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, from 5 to 6:30, threw some pushups and sit ups as well. I told Coach Hale that I would at least go for a run in place of practice.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you get up that early?\u201d he asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYears of practice, my Father gets my family up a 5 every morning so I\u2019m just use to it.\u201d You lied. While it was true, it obviously wasn\u2019t the chief reason. In truth you hadn\u2019t slept all night and didn\u2019t need to for another week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t even hear you get up at all.\u201d he argued and you just shrugged as if to say that it wasn\u2019t your fault that he didn\u2019t, which again wasn\u2019t true. It was completely your fault as you had made it a point not to make any noise. After that they didn\u2019t have any more questions so you headed off to go about your day until your first scheduled event as a class which was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After breakfast your class was given their first challenge. It was a survival/teamwork exercise that involved the whole class going out into the wilderness, well the woods as it wasn\u2019t wild enough to be considered the wilderness but still. From there the whole class would travel back to camp over the course of the next two days, or three if needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, pair up. No one goes anywhere alone and each has to look out for the other as far as food and shelter is concerned. This will also be your safety line in case something happens.\u201d Mrs. Vance said as she stood near a pile of tents. Her and Mr. Vance were obviously married and were in charge of your class. People began pairing up and most of the popular guys got girls but there was only one girl that made an effort to be your partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d Kelsey stated as she gave you a little punch in the arm then looked curiously at your lack of luggage. Most were told to bring what they needed, in which case they brought a whole pack of stuff. From flashlights to extra snacks they had relatively large packs. \u201cWhere\u2019s your pack?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need one.\u201d You stated simply as you were just standing there in your shorts and t-shirt with nothing else with you. She on the other hand had a small pack for what most people were carrying, especially the girls. \u201cI\u2019ll get the tent.\u201d You said as you went over to the teachers, got a tent, tied it to your back like the packs other people had, then went back to Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut won\u2019t you need a pillow and extra clothes?\u201d she asked to which you laughed a little. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought the point of going on a survival trip was to\u2026 survive not go on a vacation. Anyway it is good that you didn\u2019t bring any makeup and perfume like the other girls did.\u201d You answered. You knew that her parents didn\u2019t allow her such things, yet. She was \u2018too young\u2019 as her parents put it and therefore didn\u2019t wear or bring any, not that she needed it. Even if she thought she did, she had a natural beauty that most girls tried replicating with the application of makeup, and with them being so young they put way too much on and sometimes missed the mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Just don\u2019t put any on from the other girls or you\u2019re going to be batting away mosquitoes all day and night.\u201d You said as you told her enough for her to partially understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kelsey, I hope you weren\u2019t planning on any help from your\u2026 partner. It doesn\u2019t look like he will be good for anything except carrying that tent.\u201d Mocked another blonde haired and tall girl named Carly that was with Nick as they both laughed at your group. Kelsey didn\u2019t even have time to scowl as the teachers started to address the students again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we are in our groups you can form larger ones to help as you need, but we will all be traveling as a group. It will benefit you to band together in order to do things that you couldn\u2019t do by yourself.\u201d Mr. Vance said to which the pairs around you started to band together but shunned you. It wasn\u2019t as if they knew about your abilities but rather they just didn\u2019t like you. For the guys you were a popularity threat with your body and by now perfect grades and for girls you weren\u2019t very socially smart and they just thought you weren\u2019t worth it, that and they didn\u2019t like Kelsey very much for her natural beauty and lack of cupsize. In the end you two stood alone and she got worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my family does this kind of thing all the time. Most of you all are city kids so I will have the advantage, therefore you will have the advantage.\u201d You said while giving her a sideways hug, making her feel better but it still bothered her that she was so unpopular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey hate me, I\u2019m too ugly to fit in.\u201d she whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, none of that. You are the most beautiful girl here and when they finally figure that out you will know which of them would be good friends and what they are like underneath. Don\u2019t let them win by seeing their treatment of you cause you to feel bad like they want.\u201d You said to her as you turned her and locked eyes. She had commented on your red eye before but she was always memorized by them. Sure you could just make her feel better and the others more accepting with your powers but you didn\u2019t want to affect them like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, let\u2019s get going then.\u201d She said after she wiped her eyes and smiled at your words. The others brushed past you both to get in front but you held her back a little just so there was a good 10 feet between them and you two. \u201cWhy do we have to be so far back?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d You said as you pointed to a boy that smacked his neck when bit by a large horse fly. \u201cAll the colane, perfume, makeup, and even deodorant is attracting all the blood suckers to them and none of us brought bug spray so if the scent of them is up there and we are back here the bugs will be attracted to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, you have done this before. I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d She said as she saw a few of them batting away small concentrations of nats and mosquitoes from them and smacking the occasional bite. She silently giggled at the hard time they were having as the two of you, the unpopular ones, were free and clear. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t we travel ahead and with Mr. and Mrs. Vance?\u201d she asked. The two of them were equally ahead of the group as the two of you were behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait for it.\u201d You said then she smiled as someone went up to see if they had bug spray and the space was filled and the small amount they had with them was used up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou mind if we join you two?\u201d asked Mrs. Vance as she and Mr. Vance came by your fire. You had all stopped for the night and your spot was further away from the soft grass the rest of the students had found. You had insisted on the harder ground under the trees and had your fire going before anyone else but they were all determined to make their own and not give you and Kelsey any credit. On top of that you had caught a turkey and was in the middle of roasting it over the fire on a makeshift spit, flavored with different things you found around the area. At first Kelsey thought it disgusting with the rest of them but now that it was almost done it was smelling and looking absolutely delicious. However the reason why they were joining you was that your fire and place was the only one big enough to fit multiple people and was actually going at a steady pace, as the others had run out of matches and attempts to start their fires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, come on and take a seat.\u201d Kelsey answered as she pat a log you found as a bench then made a circle around the fire at a safe yet comfortable distance. She tended to them in that was while you turned the turkey again as it slow cooked above the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, but why are you two so far away from the group?\u201d She asked as they both sat on an empty spot around the fire so you were all facing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind knowing that myself.\u201d Kelsey stated as she nudged you to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there are a few reasons. The first is that the reason why there is a rich set of grass in the middle of the forest is because it is a swamp of sorts. Sure it\u2019s dry during the day when the sun is out, but when the morning due and precipitation come around it will get all wet and smelling like\u2026 well a swamp and all the animal droppings that have made the ground underneath it so fertile. That is why the fires went out so quick over there as well, everything\u2019s wet. The second reason was that they are all too loud to hope of getting any kind of sleep tonight. Along with all the perfume, cologne, and other things that attract the bugs and small animals will make their night not so pleasant. Finally they told us to get lost so\u2026 here we are, about to enjoy a warm meal and nice night\u2019s sleep.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou knew all that? Why didn\u2019t you say anything to the rest? It is suppose to be a teamwork exercise.\u201d Mr. Vance asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can answer that. We both tried to tell them about the perfume and Cologne but they just made fun of us that we didn\u2019t have any. They laughed at us when we tried to tell them so in the end we tried but they just don\u2019t like us.\u201d Kelsey answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, time to dig in.\u201d you said to changed the subject slightly, taking out a hidden knife that you kept in the sole of your shoe to cut a small piece and give it a taste. \u201cMmm, perfect. You two want some as well. We can\u2019t have any left over when we go to bed.\u201d you offered as you handed Kelsey the knife and she carved a little out for herself, dropping it into a small paper plate she brought with her then offered the knife over to them but Mr. Vance already had one out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s awfully nice of you. I think we\u2019ll accept your offer. We have to keep our strength up to keep an eye on the kids. The whole sleeping with girls thing is usually a hard thing every year. There is always a few or you kids that try to make it a problem and we have to keep an eye out for that.\u201d Mrs. Vance said to which Mr. Vance carved a little of the cooked bird out for him and his wife as you did the same on your end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking. Why did you do it that way, guys sleeping with girls that is? Usually it is strictly a no when even considering it, the cabins are even sorted by the gender barrier.\u201d You asked, as it had been a conversation stone for you and Kelsey as you walked together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is about introducing to young kids like you that just because a girl and a guy are sleeping under the same roof, or tent in this case, that it doesn\u2019t have to mean something bad. I admit it is a new way of approaching it but it works wonders later on in schooling.\u201d Mr. Vance explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you know so much about camping?\u201d Mrs. Vance asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy family goes camping all the time and we have a cabin up north that we vacation at. It is a constant contest between our family when we go camping to see how little we can bring and still last the usual week we go camping. I do have to say it is a good thing we don\u2019t have bears or some of the bigger things around here. Because for all the sweets it sounds like the others brought, it would attract many animals. The way it is they might get a couple uninvited visitors.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSound of it?\u201d asked Mr. Vance to which you all became deathly quiet and heard some wrappers open amongst the chatter and flashlight beams that glanced over your direction every once in a while. With no fire they had to rely on blankets and wrapped foods, not that they could catch anything like you could anyway. \u201cI see, or hear what you mean. Your food was much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it was, thanks Caleb.\u201d Kelsey agreed. You all talked a little more after the bird was all gone, than were interrupted by arguing and shouting as the others were getting all antsy and probably tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think this would be a good time to send everyone to bed. Be sure to put out your fire before you two head off to bed, but it should be in the next little while.\u201d Mr. Vance stated as both of them got up. You nodded as the both of you stood and you put out what was left of the fire. Kelsey took out her flashlight and shined it at the tent as Mr. and Mrs. Vance were off explaining the rules of the night like they had just talked with you two about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 we both sleep together?\u201d she asked as she looked more at the tent in preparation then at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I like sleeping outside. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t bring a pillow. Remember I\u2019ve done this before so I am more comfortable falling asleep looking at the stars then I am in a potentially small and overcrowded tent.\u201d You said to which she shined the light at you and you cringed as it hit your face, making her lower it in response but still on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen where are you going to sleep?\u201d she asked, internally and vocally relieved for the news. You looked around then leapt up and climbed a tree to a thick branch above your spot about 20 feet. You sat with your back against the tree and your leg dangling down, clearly relaxed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will do.\u201d You said down to her as she looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can never do things halfway can you?\u201d she asked comically and just accepted that you were right at this point, entering the tent after going into the woods to relieve herself. You let her have her privacy but kept an ear for her as she settled in and fell asleep. You of course didn\u2019t need sleep so you watched over the class as the teachers moved their tent but kept an extra close eye, or ear, out for Kelsey. Needless to say, you had a lot of time to think and observe throughout the night as Mr. and Mrs. Vance had to intervene at some points when they heard irregular sounds coming from only one tent, Nick and Carly. They, in the end, had to sleep with one of the teachers as they snored. The prospect of something similar kept the rest in line and sometimes as stiff as board next to their partners.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A scream woke most of everyone as you got back to your tent. You had just came back after running and doing some exercise, then washed off in the small waterfall that emptied into a stream. You were in the middle of rubbing a nicely scented leaf under your arms when Kelsey burst out of her tent in response to the scream. It was only 8:00 in the morning for them it was pretty early but everyone was up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d Asked Kelsey as she saw you shirtless and rubbing the leaf under your arms. Your highly fit and toned body gave her pause as she checked you out then looked up at your face as you looked back at her to answer her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just getting done freshening up. I took a run and did a little exercise this morning, and sense there isn\u2019t any showers around here I used a little waterfall that pours into that creak we saw yesterday. It\u2019s a little bit in that direction if you want to freshen up as well. But, I\u2019d hurry if I were you.\u201d you answered as you finished then slipped your shirt on. She could tell you washed up because your hair was still wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that, and what were you doing with those leaves?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe leaves are just really strongly scented so I thought they would do well as a natural deodorant, as for why you should hurry. Remember what I said about the swamp making people wet and smelly? Well they will all probably want to wash up as well. And if they see you going then they\u2019ll follow you to that spot and you can kiss privacy goodbye. Anyway, Carly was the one that screamed when she tripped over a raccoon on her way out of her tent and got a face full of what\u2019s left of their food when it goes through a the said raccoon.\u201d You said with a smile, to which she returned one then shortly after went to the waterfall and returned, with her shirt on obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mind if I get some of those?\u201d she asked as she saw you had some unused leaves. You handed them to her to which she rubbed them over more parts of her body then just her underarms, you had turned so she could do so in privacy.\u201d You don\u2019t have to look away for this.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the same, I found out long ago by one of my cousins that are halfway decent looking and crazy about her appearance. That peeking at a girl while she is getting ready is not a wise move, even if it\u2019s just rubbing leaves on yourself. I tell you, a few whacks over the head does wonders for a guy\u2019s perspective and learning experiences.\u201d You said, still looking over at the other students rather than back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so. Well your family sure rose you to be polite. Judging from the rest of your family that I\u2019ve seen, I wouldn\u2019t want to learn a lesson like that more than once either. Made you smarter at least though.\u201d She said then walked over to the side of you. \u201cI\u2019m done, you want some breakfast? I have some doughnuts and other stuff that I thought you\u2019d like.\u201d She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave it for later. I have a feeling that it will take us the full 3 days to back it back, judging on how long they are all going to be there and getting ready themselves.\u201d You said as you both looked over at the other students. \u201cBut we should probably get our gear all set so we can go and they don\u2019t decide to make our stuff match with their wet and soggy clothes and tents.\u201d You said to which she smiled and you both packed up your stuff, cleaned the makeshift fire bit away, and got ready to leave. By that time the other students were having a miserable breakfast and Mrs. Vance came over to you two as Mr. Vance helped the students take down their tents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad we took your advice and got to sleep in our tent before morning came. But\u2026 both of you look and\u2026 smell like you took showers.\u201d She said as she got a closer look and smell of you. Kelsey beckoned her closer to tell her about the waterfall and the creek the both of you used, separately. \u201cThen excuse me.\u201d She said as she headed over to Mr. Vance, whispered something, then went into the woods in the direction of the small waterfall. By the time she got back and ready to leave they were all standing around, to proud to ask you where you both showered. But Mr. Vance wasn\u2019t having any more of that so he called you two up to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now that we are on our second day it is about time that you all notice how well and easy these two have made it for themselves. They even got showers in, had a hot meal, and I do believe are the only ones here that still have food left and the capability to produce fire for tonight. Since we aren\u2019t going to make it back by tonight we will be camping out again. Which means if you all don\u2019t do some serious apologizing then it would appear that the next day and a half will be very uncomfortable for you all.\u201d Mr. Vance said and each part of the speech hit each person differently. The girls were shocked that you both found a way to shower while the guys were enticed by the fact that you two were the only ones that could offer warmth and food tonight. The only ones that were reluctant but willing to push their pride aside were the two big shots, Nick and Carly. Nick was a mess and looked like he didn\u2019t sleep a wink while Carly looked like she had a fight with a manure pile and lost. Her usually well kept blonde hair was mangled and had chunks of crap in it that was now smeared by her attempts to both straighten and clean her hair. Not to mention that all of their clothes were at least damp from the swamp land patch they just slept in, with their tents leaking water from their temporary resting places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you show me\u2026 us where to take a show before we go?\u201d asked Carly. To which Kelsey looked at you excited. She always and still wanted to be recognized by the popular crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on, you show the girls first. We guys will wait for our turn.\u201d You said to her. There was a collective sigh of relief from the group as the girls followed Mrs. Vance and Kelsey into the woods. You stood with Mr. Vance to which Nick finally approached you. He looked like a whipped dog and just as tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have any food do you?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, all we got left is what Kelsey has and she definitely doesn\u2019t have enough to feed over 20 people. I can help with dinner, later on tonight though. That is if you\u2019ll eat what I catch.\u201d You said, the last part with perhaps a little more venom then the rest. He cringed at the words and the tone as he was now suffering from the aftermath of treating you and Kelsey so bad before, that and ignoring your advice that would\u2019ve saved them this uncomfortable situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I\u2019m sorry man. I really am. I was s\u2026 stupid.\u201d He said, the last part was harder for him to get out that the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I guess there is one good thing about this whole thing.\u201d You said to which they/he looked at you confused. \u201cWell, with all that smelly artificial stuff washed off you aren\u2019t getting eaten alive by mosquitoes anymore are you?\u201d you asked and they thought about it as they looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you\u2026 darn, I guess it is good when you look at it that way.\u201d He said. You quickly glanced at Mr. Vance, who happen to be grinning from ear to ear as the trip was doing what it was designed to do. It was bringing you all together in a way that would never had happened otherwise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the day went on, you and Kelsey walked with the teachers and a few others would come up and talk to one of you. However the girls and guys insistency of putting on perfume and Cologne made you request they stay back as much as possible. They were significantly nicer about it but they still were city kids and wanted to be presentable to the others, regardless if their clothes were all still smelling like the swamp that soaked their stuff last night. That smell made their walk a little more livable, as far as bugs were concerned, but otherwise they were glad when you all stopped for the night. You had been asked multiple times to carry people\u2019s packs, including Kelsey, but insisted on them carrying their own junk so they knew to pack less the next time, if there was a next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting your, or Kelsey\u2019s, tent set up and showing the rest where to put theirs you made a fire then went out to hunt. Luckily you found a deer and was able to stalk it until you were close enough to use a mental persuasion of sorts. It was powerful enough to get humans to do what you wanted so, if you got close enough, it was child\u2019s play for wild animals. You were able to walk right up to it and sink your fangs into the backside of its neck. Luckily the act of biting didn\u2019t invoke panic and rather spurred the victim to want to have you finish. To that aspect you drank the deer dry then prepared it for a similar cooking job than before. In no time at all you had it turning over your fire and the students that opted to sit around your fire left at the current site. But you knew that they would be back later when it both smelled and looked good enough to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow you were able to hunt a deer without a weapon is simply amazing.\u201d Mr. Vance said as you knew he hunted a little but not more than a week during gun hunting season. You had\u2026 persuaded the DNR to give you a pass to hunt all year round and not register the deer or other animals you take down. You were still bound by the endangered species list but otherwise could hunter whenever and wherever you wanted, well in Wisconsin at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I worked hard at being able to hunt like that.\u201d You lied, while what you did was impressive it wasn\u2019t \u2018hard\u2019 for you in the slightest. Your abilities made it unfair to anyone, especially whatever  you were hunting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it seems you two are having less trouble getting along with the others.\u201d Mrs. Vance stated as she had been observing the interaction between the class. You had to wonder if they did the same thing every year, as in the swamp and all but pushed that thought aside as it was irrelevant. The point of the trip was a current success. You were all at least talking with each other and they didn\u2019t shun you or Kelsey anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you two are so cool.\u201d Stated a young blonde girl, named Dixie, with an extreme amount of fascination as she and a black kid, named Brian, sat down at the fire. They were part of the newspaper club at the school. While the middle school newspaper wasn\u2019t as big as the high school one they still took the job seriously, Dixie more than Brian. They did stories on anything and everything. They even did a few on the two of you and your apparent lack of popularity despite each of your athletic prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think so?\u201d asked Kelsey as she beamed with excitement at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, no question about it. The two of you are easily the least popular kids in the school right now but do the best, or close to the best, in grades and sports. It is like the opposite of what usually happens. This little trip has offset that a little but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that each of you are fascinating.\u201d Brian complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d You said as you turned the half cooked deer on the spit. It had just started to look and smell to the point that people were coming around to see if it was done yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd with all the things you two can do, who would\u2019ve guessed that Caleb was a cook to? Not me, usually wrestlers don\u2019t cook, they let their Moms cook and stuff their faces after weigh-ins.\u201d Dixie reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Kelsey after a silence hit the area and you seemed like you were distracted except for turning the deer every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN\u2026nothing is wrong. I\u2026\u201d you started then stopped, hoping that they wouldn\u2019t push much more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, we\u2019ve been friends for the whole year. I can tell when something\u2019s up.\u201d Kelsey stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you not feeling well?\u201d Asked Mrs. Vance like a mother or nurse, hard to tell which one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN\u2026 no, that\u2019s not it. I\u2019ve just never had this many people actually want to be around me before. I mean my family is different because\u2026 well their family. But I\u2019ve always been the outcast and never really that \u2018cool\u2019 as you two say.\u201d You explained as you looked over to Dixie and Brian then back at your task. \u201cI\u2019ve never really had a friend outside my family before. Now that I have so many people that at the very least depend on me I don\u2019t really know what to do. Acting like I usually act won\u2019t cut it. I can\u2019t just hide in the back of the room anymore. People actually want to hear what I have to say. It\u2019s just not something I\u2019m used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, so you\u2019re just confused, how cute.\u201d Kelsey teased as she grabbed on and hugged your free arm as you turned the deer again. Your face turned a little red from this and she noticed and giggled as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was only a matter of time Caleb. With how apparently talented you are, it was about time people crowded around you to dwell in the place of such talent. As for what you should do\u2026 it really is up to you. All the advice I can give is that you don\u2019t forget to remember where you came from.\u201d Mr. Vance said. It did feel better to have so many people looking to you for something good. It was almost the opposite of what you were expecting ever since you became the Vampire. But they didn\u2019t need to know that about you, hopefully ever\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though it wasn\u2019t as good as the deer you made Caleb, it was still a lot of food.\u201d Nick said as you all got back into your cabins. The deer was good but not big enough to feed everyone to the top. As such the morning was the same as before, minus an uninvited guest and soaking supplies. But in any case you all got back near dinner time and all ate your fill, except you. You were still full from the deer blood and combined with what you ate, or drank, before you left you estimated that you wouldn\u2019t have to drink any blood for a while. So in a sense you were full, just not from the food that the camp now provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, no kidding.\u201d Said another kid as they all unpacked their previously soaked but now dried and smelly things from their packs. They each took turns at the washer and drier to clean their sleeping bags first, then the rest of their clothes. On top of that they all took long, hot, and relaxing showers. You suspected that the others and especially the girls were doing the same. After a cold shower the first night and no shower this morning the city kids were all suffering from a slight withdrawal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d check your sleeping bag if I were you. Sure it is all nice and clean but there are probably like a billion bugs in the thing.\u201d Nick said as you hopped up to your bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoubt it, you\u2019re forgetting about our little friend.\u201d You said as he frowned confused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d he asked to which you whistled a little and a noticeable shadow branched off from the corner and scuttled across the ceiling, down the wall, across your bed, and into your hand to which you rewarded him by petting him gently. \u201cOh, right. So he kept bugs out of your stuff?\u201d he asked as he nervously looked at the stoic creature of his phobia slightly moving in your hand and against your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just mine, he probably feasted good as our scents would still be here to attract blood sucking bugs to the area. If you let him, he\u2019ll protect us tonight as well. Just don\u2019t give him a reason to attack and he won\u2019t.\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you say so spider\u2026 man.\u201d Nick said, censoring himself as he almost called you \u2018spider freak\u2019 like before. When he talked to you after his and their little change of heart he had to rethink his words that came out of his mouth. He was so use to picking on you that saying anything else was a new experience for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least I don\u2019t have to catch a deer tonight.\u201d You said as you attempted small talk with them. Usually you weren\u2019t good at that kind of thing but you were making an effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas it that hard?\u201d asked Scott in an informative tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of. Most animals run from us so finding one is harder than the actual hunt. Then you have to kill it and with only a knife it can be difficult. After that I had to gut it, drain it, skin it, and prepare it for cooking so not to gross out everyone else, and all this far enough away so that the remaining guts don\u2019t attract a bear or wolf to our camp. So yeah, it is harder than just going to the dining hall to get a meal.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can hunt animals with just a knife?\u201d asked Nick in a surprised tone. He knew you got the deer but obviously never hunted before. While he was confident that he could if given a gun and the opportunity he knew that doing so with only a knife was far beyond him or possibly whatever father figure he had in his life. Like you, most your age think that figure is the best and almost all powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that hard once you get the sneaking part down. Thing is that the sneaking is the hardest part cause most animals are insanely skittish. A single twig snap is enough for them to run off. But I have a lot of practice so I can do it pretty easily. After that it is all downhill, having a sharp knife and the proximity to use it is all you got to worry about after that point.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut where is your knife? I saw you had one but, unlike Mr. Vance, you didn\u2019t have it in your pocket. For starters you don\u2019t have pockets, right now at least.\u201d Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense Nick, but the point of keeping a hidden blade is to keep its location\u2026 well hidden.\u201d You answered to which he smirked instead of the expected scowl at your refusal to answer his question the way he probably wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wrong before Caleb, you might just be cool enough to talk to.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there is a backward compliment in there somewhere, in which case, thanks.\u201d You said back to him and you all continued talking about the survival trip and what to expect for your last day at the camp. Eventually they all went to sleep and your little friend was given free passage by most to catch his feast as he saw fit. But after a few hours the other bugs retreated and went to the other cabins, to which he came and sat on your chest and accepted a petting position. Although you could tell that it was too cold for him and his small life was about to end. But you didn\u2019t want to think about it. He was like a pet now and you didn\u2019t want to think about him dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the spider didn\u2019t seem to share your passive and distant point of view on the subject. Just like any other creature, he knew his time was up and that it was too cold for him to survive another night. Even IF he was able to mate with a female it would be pointless as she would also be dead or close to it by the time she was able to manufacture eggs, in which case he would definitely be dead after that. He seemed to notice where he was in relation to you, you being an actual predator of sorts and not some ignorant and oversized threat like the rest of the humans around. So after a few hours of your gingerly petting he started moving toward your face. This behavior would\u2019ve scared you silly when you were still phobic about spiders but now it was just more movement. You had already allowed him to crawl everywhere on your body when you met that first night so you didn\u2019t feel any type of bad feeling to him slowly crawling toward your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached your neck he climbed the short distance then waited on and around your chin but just underneath your mouth. After a few minutes of doing nothing and you just observing what he was doing he tried to push himself inside. You didn\u2019t know what to do to this. You didn\u2019t want your pet to die and you sure as hell didn\u2019t want to be the one to kill him. At your age you had a deep emotional connection to pets but your body seemed to react differently than your emotions were telling you to. Your logical mind was repeating the spider\u2019s situation to you and what it intended. It wanted the superior predator in front of it, that gave him so much food and respect, to be the one to eat him in return rather than allowing the cold or age kill him in the next day. Your fangs grew at this new development and your slowly opened your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would\u2019ve been a nightmare to you before was now making you shed a few tears as your loyal pet spider, that you only knew for a few days, slowly climbed into your mouth. It occasionally scratched itself on your fangs as it entered then waited for you to finish as he had pushed as much of himself into you as he could, his back legs and tip of his thorax still outside the confines of your mouth. You had to decide what to do and decided your couldn\u2019t bare reducing your little pet and friend to mush with the same fangs and teeth you used to suck blood from others. So you used your tongue to guide him back to the throat, impressively you didn\u2019t have a gag reflex anymore, perhaps to keep new Vampires from gagging at the idea and feeding of their new life. Anyway it took the hint and helped you feed itself down your throat and in a couple of swallows your little pet was going down to your stomach. You had to admit that the feeling of something living going down and wiggling around in your mouth, throat, and stomach was amazing but you didn\u2019t feel good at all at the moment. The moment it got inside your stomach you regretted not ending him quickly as your acids started working on him along with the remaining blood and human food. Unfortunately your power reserves were all at full so you couldn\u2019t speed up digestion to fill them like your body could do if running low on power. So the pour thing suffered for about an hour trying to come up your throat, down to your intestines, and even started painfully biting the inside of your stomach. But in about an hour he slowed then stopped moving. You definitely felt bad about putting your small friend and pet through so much apparent pain and decided never to do it again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo how was it?\u201d asked Mom as she greeted you coming into the door. You had gotten back from your week on Friday feeling a little better but not by much, however enough to fool anyone to thinking something was wrong. Papa was up north working with Grandpa at the cabin with your brothers, which left Sarah, who was usually at a friend\u2019s house on Friday night or out in general. That left only you and your Mom in the house. A couple months ago it would\u2019ve freaked her out but not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was good, I got a bunch of new friends and we all had a really good time. The trip definitely did what it was suppose to. Should I go up north to help Papa?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, Papa said that you should whined down from your week before you start lifting cars and tractors for him.\u201d She said with a smile. You smiled back, talked for a bit about events that happened and the lack of exposure to anyone then went to your room. Once inside you laid on your bed, looking over a similar looking wolf spider that you were keeping in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d You said to it, as it scuttled along the wall and into the corner. It made you feel a little better, as if apologizing to the digested spider\u2019s family. Even if you knew it was impossible to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for what?\u201d asked a little voice, barely noticeable and definitely out of a human\u2019s hearing range. Your head turned slowly to find the source of the voice but the spot the voice had come from was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said that?\u201d you asked quietly so Mom wouldn\u2019t hear but whomever talked would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, you heard that. Please don\u2019t squash me!\u201d said a frantic female and small voice from underneath your end table. \u201cPlease don\u2019t find me, please don\u2019t find me, please don\u2019t find me.\u201d She repeated over and over again, as if willing you not to find her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t look for you if you don\u2019t want me to but at least let me see who I\u2019m talking to.\u201d You said with an equally small voice but very calm, allowing your natural calm presence embrace whomever was under your table. You felt just the slightest consciousness under it that you wouldn\u2019t have noticed otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t squash me?\u201d she asked after a very long pause in conversation and noise from her end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise that even if I want to I will allow you at least an hour head start to run away. But I will do my best to refrain from squashing you at all.\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, here I come.\u201d She said then crawled from under your desk to on top of it. She was a spider, how strange that you had never sensed her before, because she was definitely sentient, not just by the fact she could talk but also you could sense she had a mind, unlike the thousands of spiders you\u2019ve both killed and saved. She was like a mini tarantula. Very\u2026 hairy but pitch black and, by evidence of her movement, very fast. However she was currently no bigger than a quarter with her legs spread out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d you asked after you observed her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d she asked, still frightened and clearly ready to bolt at the slightest sign aggression from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it so bad to want to know the name of someone I am talking to? Here, my name is Caleb. Now that you know my name, can you tell me yours? I can\u2019t go around calling you spider now can I?\u201d you asked, the second question rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t have a name. I was just born and have been chased here. I don\u2019t even know my mother or father or anything. But I do know that everything just wants to kill me.\u201d She cried to which you spat a sort of solid spit made needle that looked to be coming at her but just before she cringed to accept her fate a small screech was heard from another spider just behind her that was 3 times her size and ready to kill/eat her. The spit made needle stuck through its head and an outstretched arm that was about to touch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not good. Here, come on and I\u2019ll give you a name.\u201d you said as you placed your hand on the edge of the table. She looked at the dead spider behind her then figured that if you could do that to it then you could force her to come with you, or kill her if she refused so she scuttled over and onto your hand. You sat up in bed then brought her somewhat close to your face but not enough to openly scare her. \u201cHow about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However she still was looking like she was going to run at any moment. \u201cNow that I have a name, what are you going to do to me? Because if you even think about squashing me I\u2019ll make sure to bite you as many times as I can before I go. I already know that my venom can kill a dog, cat, and a horse.\u201d She said in an attempt to scare you but was both calmed and nervous that it didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you before Eve, I\u2019m not going to crush you. No I think I\u2019ll help you. Is there something you need? I could take you to your home if you remember where it is.\u201d You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 are going to help me. Why?\u201d she asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really want to know? I would prefer not saying.\u201d You said in a sad tone as you thought to your friend that was probably out of your stomach by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, currently there is no reason to trust you over any other human.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept that I can talk to you.\u201d you returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but I\u2019ll ask about that later, for now just answer the why\u2026 please.\u201d She first demanded but then remembered her vulnerable position and added the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I just came back from a trip that I and a bunch of other humans went on. When I arrived I met this large wolf spider that everyone else was trying to kill. I know you guys do wonders for us humans in pest control alone so I saved him and in return he protected me from the nasty blood sucking insects. It was mutually beneficial as he got a lot of food and I got a lack of bug bites. He wasn\u2019t sentient and ended up being my close pet by the end of the week. However\u2026 he was old and the cold was coming. He was going to die that night or at most the night after so he\u2026 fed himself to me. I didn\u2019t want to but in the end I thought that biting him wouldn\u2019t be nice so I swallowed him whole. But it was the opposite. I thought that he would just fall asleep when he arrived in my stomach then peacefully die instead of being crushed by my teeth. However I didn\u2019t count on the you spiders didn\u2019t need so much air. So he was slowly digested alive over the course of a few hours. I didn\u2019t mean to but I caused him so much pain that if I can help you, maybe I can make amends for that.\u201d You said with a tear rolling down your cheek that you quickly wiped away in an effort to hide your emotion from the small spider in your other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s it. But I don\u2019t get it. Sure that answers why you personally want to help me, a sentient spider, but why as a human do you even care. I mean you humans kill us all the time don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked as she had obviously seen such in many ways and places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Eve, but I can only tell very close friends that secret. I just like spiders, which is why I try to save as many as I can from my family, who are highly afraid and hostile toward spiders in general. But now that I answered another of your questions. Can you answer mine? Can I take you home?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know where that is either. I have been running and hiding for a week now. It was getting cold outside so I came in here a few nights ago and was amazed at all the spiders in here. Most tried to kill me while others just left me alone. But I thought that this was some kind of safe haven for my kind. I never thought that it was because of a human. I guess, if it is ok with you, that this can be my home?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to live with me? I guess that\u2019s ok. As long as you don\u2019t bite me or my family. From what you said, it would not be very healthy. We humans are deathly loyal to our blood family and similarly to our friends. But if you are sentient and want to stay in this house then it isn\u2019t really up to me. I can take care of you but I need the approval of my parents so they don\u2019t mix you up with the other spiders the crush daily.\u201d You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m poisonous, why would they let me stay if they kill normal spiders that easily?\u201d she asked, worried that she would have to run again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you promise not to ever tell anyone, even another spider that isn\u2019t sentient, then I can tell you.\u201d you proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I won\u2019t.\u201d she returned in an urgency that defined her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not human. Well I was born human but I was turned into a Vampire, the only Vampire. I know very little about the world that I belong to but I am much more dangerous than any human and I drink and crave human blood. I can tell you about it later but that is why they would accept you. They still wouldn\u2019t be able to hear you but if I asked them I think they would allow you to stay. Probably only if you stayed in my room. Like I said, they are all deathly afraid of spiders and will kill any they see. I doubt that even if they see you that they would notice it is you until it was too late.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVampire, my genetic knowledge says that you are dangerous, very dangerous.\u201d She quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have that too? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve only been a Vampire for a few months now. While I am really powerful I won\u2019t harm you without a really good reason, like if you think it is fun to kill my family then I would stop at nothing that you joined them. But I don\u2019t think that was you plan.\u201d You said as both a statement and a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I won\u2019t I promise not to hurt them.\u201d she squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t have anything to worry about. So do you still want to stay with me? You would have to stay in this room for a long while and pretty much be my slave. Well not a slave but you would have to do what I said for a while.\u201d You told and asked her so she could make her decision with all the facts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know how big you\u2019ll get but as different things become no longer a concern then you can really do what you want. I didn\u2019t mean it like I would force you to do anything.

But I guess I should introduce you to my Mom, and eventually the rest of the family. But I think we\u2019ll wait for you to get a little bit bigger before doing that.\u201d You stated but then came up with a question. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know how large you\u2019ll get do you?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I\u2019ll be as big as one of those long metal things on wheels that I saw all those human go into.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bus! You can really get that big?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly after a very long time I think. I don\u2019t really know, this genetic knowledge is hard to search for an exact answer but perhaps a little smaller than that thing you called a \u2018bus\u2019.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you\u2019ll get so big. But for now let\u2019s go see Mom.\u201d You said as you got up with her still in your hand then walking out to see your mother in the living room by the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Caleb, how\u2019s it\u2026 Caleb! What did I tell you about bringing your pets out of your room!?\u201d she almost screamed at the sight of Eve in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Mom she\u2019s different, let me explain.\u201d You said as you put up a hand to defend Eve if necessary but also to calm your mother down. She seemed to calm down but was still on edge as she looked at the slightly moving spider in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt better be good Caleb. Just because you\u2019re a Vampire doesn\u2019t mean you can just bend the rules.\u201d Mom said as she nervously sat down on the far side of the room from you and more importantly the spider in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Um\u2026 she can talk.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2026 can talk?\u201d Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, not that loud and right now only I can hear it. But she\u2019ll get bigger and soon you will be able to hear her too. But she is definitely sentient. I\u2026 we were wondering if she could stay here?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe can understand me?\u201d Mom asked to which you nodded. \u201cThen she better remember that any spiders outside your room are dead, including her. Maybe when she is big enough to talk to we can negotiate a little but until then she is to stay in your room. That way there is no confusion. If I see a spider it dies, well at least the ones outside your room Caleb. How many do you have in there?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were about 30 but they were all trying to kill her so I sent them away into the forest in near the border. She\u2019ll be the only one in there, well the only one until she gets big enough to protect herself. And she said she won\u2019t bite anyone in the house and never a family member.\u201d You said, trying to further convince her. Eve could see that you were trying to argue on her behalf and she more than heard your mother\u2019s warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither way, just remember that I don't care who she is or how hungry she gets. She stays in your room.\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, thanks Mom.\u201d You said to which she just waved you off, mainly to get the spider away from her. You went into your room then went back onto your bed, putting your hand back at the end table for her to scuttle off. \u201cThat went better than I thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought she was going to kill me.\u201d Eve whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe probably would. Like I said, they hate spiders. I would hide if they ever come in here. Even if they told you to stay in my room they might still panic and crush you if they see you. And I have no doubt that they would kill you if you came out of this room. Please don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want you to die.\u201d You almost pleaded the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really care for me that much?\u201d she asked as she saw this urgency to stay alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re my friend, why not?\u201d You responded and if she had tear ducts she would\u2019ve been tearing up. She was at the very least whimpering but this time in joy of what you referred her to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thanksgiving went by without too much problem, well except that you weren\u2019t invited. But when your family assured you that Christmas everyone was being forced to come, including you. Mainly because your Grandpa and Grandma were really liking you at this point and you were extremely helpful when they needed it. However a week or so after that, Sarah made the mistake of going into your room and saw Eve on the wall. She had gotten big enough to be considered a small tarantula, as she could stretch out and cover a third of a basket ball. Coupled with the fact that she was all black, moved fast, and your family\u2019s natural phobia of spiders made them call an emergency family meeting about your new pet/guest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, when you told me that she could talk I just figured you had found a spider that you really liked. When you showed it to me it was no bigger than a quarter.\u201d Mom said as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 thing, was really that small?\u201d asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw her as well and she was rather small. Are you sure you saw a real spider and not a fake one?\u201d Papa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she saw Eve correctly. She has been growing due in no small part to the bugs coming in for the winter. But I assure you she is sentient, and I think she is big enough to speak at a level you can hear her, if you\u2019ll accept it.\u201d You stated and confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe can speak?\u201d asked Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, previously she was too small to be heard by any human, but I have better ears.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpiders can\u2019t speak.\u201d Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize you are telling a Vampire, that most people think is fiction; that a talking spider doesn\u2019t exist right?\u201d you asked rhetorically. It did sound rather ridiculous when you put it that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, why don\u2019t we let\u2026 the spider talk if it can. As long as it won\u2019t bite anyone.\u201d Papa concluded but asked the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe already promised that she would never bite anyone in the family, even in self defense. Basically because her venom is really poisonous and a single bite when she was really small took down a horse in seconds. Should I call her or should I go get her?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you leave your door open?\u201d Sarah asked with a little fear, both at the poisonous part and that the spider she saw might already be in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but she is strong enough to open the door if she needs to.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease go get her and make sure she realizes that she is not to leave your person during this\u2026 evaluation.\u201d Papa stated to which you went to your room and went in to see Eve retreating under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok Eve, it\u2019s just me. They are ready to see you now.\u201d You said. It was a short pause before her form was seen scuttling out from under the bed and into your hands. She now felt safe there, in your warm embrace. You had to hold her with two hands to make her comfortable while carrying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they going to make me leave?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really hope not but they are really scared of spiders. You being so big won\u2019t help matters. Just don\u2019t make any sudden moves and they asked me to remind you to stay on me at all times. No running off if they startle you. You don\u2019t need to worry, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d you answered and instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll try to make myself look small.\u201d She said as she bunched her legs into and under herself, making a neat furry little ball in your hands. You smiled down at her then took her to the living room where they were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere she is.\u201d You presented as you sat down and held out your hands a little so they could see, Isaac being the only one young enough to get closer than the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe looks like a furry ball.\u201d Isaac stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to scare anyone.\u201d Said Eve\u2019s voice but was small to them, about the volume of a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly\u2026 she can talk!\u201d Sarah burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course she can, I told you she could. But please don\u2019t make so many sudden outbursts like that, it is hard enough not to move with all that is happening.\u201d You defended as they all looked bug eyed at Eve.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So when she came to me she needed a name. Couldn\u2019t go around calling her \u2018spider\u2019, that would just be rude.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Eve, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, how big can you get?\u201d asked Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know, I grow in stages and over a long time. I will grown to maybe dog size in a year and human size in 2 years then stop near 3 times that in 5 years. The growing process after that point is a mystery to me, I could stop all together or keep going.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat big?\u201d Sarah asked in shock and horror. She was going to be sharing the house with a giant spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, is that bad?\u201d Eve asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 I mean no\u2026 Well it is a little hard to take in.\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that Mom?\u201d asked Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Caleb calls you Mom and I thought that was your name, is that bad?\u201d Eve asked for the second time as she was worried she would be killed or kicked out into the cold and literally freezing weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Mom said as she seemed to take it in. Was she really going to get an unofficial, adopted, and arachnid daughter along with her Vampire son. She didn\u2019t mind it from that stand point but she had to be either the luckiest or strangest Mom in the world at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d asked Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to stay with Caleb. That\u2019s it.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t have to return to your kind, whoever or whatever they/you are?\u201d asked Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know my birth family and I have a suspicion that I don\u2019t want to. All they ever did was try to kill me and I can\u2019t even remember much of that. Caleb is as much family as I have anywhere. He protects me and helps me.\u201d Eve stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are your plans for food. I am sure Caleb mentioned that we and other humans are off limits, especially with you being venomous.\u201d Papa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? I would never eat Caleb\u2019s family.\u201d She almost shrieked and spread her legs in reaction to her sudden spike in emotion. Her legs spilled over and connected to your arms and hands. \u201cAnd Caleb has told me that I am not to eat any humans or their pets. I don\u2019t need to eat more than once every 6 months anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good to know.\u201d Luke said as he was the first to recover from her sudden change in look and movement, other than Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if one of us accidently steps on you or hits you without knowing it?\u201d asked Sarah. \u201cWill you bite us out of reflex or instinct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever. Caleb\u2019s family is off limits, even for accidents.\u201d She stated as if it were law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much as we fear you we can\u2019t in good conscious do that to you, especially when you have nowhere else to go and in the beginning of winter.\u201d Papa stated which got a slight cringe from the others in the room, knowing that meant she was going to be staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Papa! Thank you very much!\u201d Eve stated and he too was taken back by her use of such a intimate word to call him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever we can\u2019t have you roaming free around the house. If for no other reason as to we aren\u2019t that comfortable with spiders in general. I\u2019m sure Caleb has said that we all have a rather large phobia of spiders in this family.\u201d Mom stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he told me. But you don\u2019t have to fear me. I will never harm any of you.\u201d She defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever the less, the fear still remains. How would you feel if you feared something and found one among many that would do you no harm? Even if you believed you would still have to worry about the rest of that of which you fear and the fear of confusing the two. It only stands to reason that if you were born like you are then there are others. What if we become trusting of you then reach out to a similar person that isn\u2019t you?\u201d Papa inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be killed.\u201d She admitted solemnly. She didn\u2019t know her parents but she knew from her genetic knowledge that they were no friendly to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor that reason you must stay in Caleb\u2019s room unless called and accompanied by Caleb. Only he can truly tell the difference regardless if we become close to you. That way we can ensure that your presence and that of any\u2026 uninvited guests are easily distinguished.\u201d Papa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do that, if Caleb doesn\u2019t mind being crowded when I get bigger.\u201d Eve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI definitely won\u2019t mind.\u201d You answered down to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, this is getting weird.\u201d Sarah stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormal people don\u2019t live like this. But so many not normal things happen around here that it is becoming more normal than anything else. Vampires, talking spiders, giant spiders, what is next?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t say that. It is like saying \u2018what could possibly go wrong\u2019.\u201d Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Eve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a human saying.\u201d You explained to her. \u201cSomehow, whenever someone says it something goes wrong. It happens so frequently that it is now a superstition that when you say it something will go wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I get a spider sister?\u201d asked Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly looks that way.\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I hold her?\u201d he asked that got the whole room to become quite. He had been looking at her since she came into the room and seemed fascinated with her. You both looked over at your parents and after a short thought Papa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, if she says ok and you are careful, both of you.\u201d you instructed as you looked down at her. You could feel that she was just as nervous as the rest of the family, except Isaac who was still too young to understand why that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I hold you?\u201d Isaac asked as he got up and leaned down so his face was about a foot away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess so. Just please be gentle.\u201d She pleaded. He smiled and went to grab for her but you pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, but she said I could.\u201d Isaac whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that was very rude Isaac. You can\u2019t just grab at her like that.\u201d You defended and Eve was noticeably glad for it. \u201cJust hold out your hands and let her come to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry Eve.\u201d Isaac said in response as you rose her back to where she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, this is all really new isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked back to which he nodded then held out his even smaller hands compared to yours. She hesitantly and slowly crawled onto the relatively fragile surface and both of you could sense Isaac\u2019s heart beat race as she did so. Eventually she was supported solely by Isaac and you backed away, as did he, sitting back down with a plop onto his chair and gazing at Eve still fascinated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really soft and feel nice.\u201d Isaac said as he held her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 thanks Isaac.\u201d She said, not sure what to say to a compliment from him. \u201cThank you for being gentle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s safe?\u201d Papa asked you as the two more or less bonded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust her. If she was wild then I\u2019d say definitely not. Her venom is really poisonous and I can\u2019t even cure it in others. I can barely take a bite myself.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe bit you?\u201d asked Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly after I asked her to. I thought it would be a good idea to become immune to venom and she has the most potent so I thought that she could help me in that area. Turns out I was right and I am getting use to it but I still wouldn\u2019t be able to heal anyone she bit besides me. They would be dead in seconds.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t really make me feel any better.\u201d Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh just relax, this is no different than Caleb.\u201d Mom stated as she saw Eve start to crawl all over Isaac and play with him. His laughter in this made her ease up. \u201cJust because something is dangerous doesn\u2019t mean they are evil or will harm us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d Papa stated as he took her hand in his while watching the large spider and Isaac play. You even saw a smile crack on his face, despite the danger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since you were still in middle school, there wasn\u2019t an abundance of wrestling events set up. It was basically just an intro so that wrestlers were better prepared and trained for high school. But this was the big one for your team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got to be kidding me.\u201d You heard as you all weighed in for the event. You were taking the 145 weight class, while the only other person of note, Matt Malcame, was taking 189. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was the case, most of the weigh-ins were done naked or close to it to allow referees to look over the contestants for skin baring diseases that would spread due to the close nature of the sport. While it wasn\u2019t required to do so naked, some needed to shed that last bit of weight to just make the class they were trying for. Most of the kids were scrawny or fat as most middle school kids aren\u2019t that impressive in comparison to their later high school years. However that didn\u2019t apply to you and Matt. You two were highly toned and highly developed in the area most didn\u2019t touch until college. The result being that you were each at your desired weight class with 2 or 3 percent body fat that only made your defined muscles stick out more. This was not a very welcomed sight to the ones opposing you two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think their scared of you.\u201d Matt said into your ear as you all waited for your turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore you than me, after all, you are the bigger one and has more of a record by this point.\u201d You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue that, but they don\u2019t know your strength. But they will. Heck man, we both are real freaks for our age.\u201d He said and it almost could\u2019ve been taken as an insult but he definitely meant it as a compliment. If only he knew how true his statement was for you then he wouldn\u2019t have said it. Fact is, you let him win in practice but not bad enough to suggest as your strength was hard to mask. So you pretended that your lack of experience was why he beat you all the time, which was kind of true, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I sure hope you don\u2019t switch schools on us. Knowing my luck I would be the one they pit against you.\u201d You complimented back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries about that Caleb. I don\u2019t think my Ma would let me leave even if I wanted to. Besides, who would I get to practice with if not for you?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but when I finally get my experience up I may end up beating you for a change.\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I better not slack off.\u201d He retorted then smirked and pointed as your weight class was called and you saw what he was almost laughing at. The boys that were stepping up were not very impressive and mostly far or\u2026 well rounded, as their Moms liked to refer to it. There was one kid that looked like he was halfway decent and knew it. He smirked at the others until he saw you get in line with him. Unlike the others, you were no tub of lard and nothing he could push around on the mat. Finally your name was called to which you stepped up to the Ref then onto the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c145 exactly, damn and built like a brick wall.\u201d the Ref operating the scale said as he jotted down the weight and passed you along. You gave Matt a knuckle pound then went to change into your singlet and warm-ups. It didn\u2019t take you long to which you were out and sitting in the bleachers with the rest of the team as you all waited for things to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck Caleb.\u201d Came a voice from behind you. You looked back to see Papa as he landed a hand on your shoulder just as Matt was coming around. Your father wasn\u2019t a giant by any means but at 6\u20194\u2019\u2019 300 lbs he was very solid and recognizable and not for a mean or hard persona. Quite the opposite, he was calm and gentle but one of those people that you didn\u2019t WANT to disappoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa, I thought you had some work to do.\u201d You said as you weren\u2019t expecting him to show. Not that he wasn\u2019t supportive but with all the work he did for other people he never really had much time for much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is my oldest son\u2019s debut in his first tournament, I thought I should at least stick around for your first win.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You said and he could see that even if you put a brave face on, you really appreciated that he was there. It made you feel like he was proud of you and it was a great feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Konel, it is good to meet Caleb\u2019s father. You\u2019re son is as strong as an ox, I can hardly stay ahead.\u201d Matt said as he shook hands with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you must be Matt Malcame, Whenever Caleb speaks about wrestling, you are in the conversation somehow. You must really be drinking your milk.\u201d Papa stated and Matt laughed a little at the joke and compliment as he nodded. \u201cWell it looks like it\u2019s starting so I\u2019ll leave you to it. Good luck, and be careful.\u201d Papa finished but the last part was directed at you, even if Matt didn\u2019t notice. You nodded to which he nodded back then went to take his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re dad is a cool guy.\u201d Matt said, as if longing for someone like that for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has his moments, as I\u2019m sure all parents do.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kidding? What could possibly be bad about him?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we work from sun up to sun down for other people and we do it all for free. I still get spankings from time to time, although I haven\u2019t needed one in the past few months. Not only that but he is the best wielder of the guilt trip that I\u2019ve ever seen, well maybe second to my Grandma, which is probably where he gets it from.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you seem to get along well enough.\u201d Matt said as you both walked over to start warming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely, for all his faults I have never found myself wanting a different Papa before.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, we can discuss the meaning of life later. Time to warm up.\u201d Matt said then you two joined as he leaded the team in doing so then stretches before the tournament\u2019s start.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For most that don\u2019t know the people or things going on, a wrestling tournament is insanely boring. You wait around as the 4 mats are occupied by wrestlers for each match per weight class then gets restarted at different points in the tournament and at different levels. Not only that but every wrestler has to wait 45 minutes between matches. So even if you came to see one of the wrestlers you would have to wait at least that long then an additional allotted time for each round. However for you it was a learning experience. You watched, analyzed, and learned many new moves as they were displayed as well as possible weak points to them and ones you already knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c145 starting Ceritage Christian against Saint Joe\u2019s military academy.\u201d Called an announcement as you observed and headed over to the mat. You already had your singlet on and only thing else were your shorts and one of your t-shirts over the top. You met your Coach at the corner and took off the shorts and shirt then strapped up the upper half of the singlet and head gear. The cocky kid was first as you looked at them as he did the same. Although most that were watching took one look at your almost overly developed body and were whispering about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, this is your first match so go out and do your best.\u201d Mr. Hale said as he gave you a pat and sent you on your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice contacts.\u201d Said the other boy. You knew his name was John but other than that he was just a big bully as evidence to the way he pushed around his own teammates when he could. His statement was an attempt to get under your skin as you both approached the table for the Ref to assign colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not contacts.\u201d You said before the Ref assigned you as red and him as green. You thought it fitting but otherwise went to the middle, put on the ankle strap for the color, then got in your stance at your assigned line, marked by a red line. Your form and stance was irregular as most wrestlers, specifically at your level and age, would use more of a square stance but you had your legs more spread and angled than most. It was like a mix between a wrestler\u2019s stance and a sprinter\u2019s. Normally your coach would\u2019ve corrected this but it was prime to how you normally started the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShake hands.\u201d The Ref stated to which you both did. He tried squeezing your hand tight but when you didn\u2019t react it unnerved him even more than seeing your now flexing body. Your muscles were preparing for sudden burst of action but also to restrain themselves. In fact you had to devote more strength to hold yourself back then to defeat your opponent and that would result in high stress on your muscles. But for now you were like a spring, ready to take off as soon as the Ref blew his whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the whistle blew you sprung before John did and caught him in a picture perfect double leg takedown. You were quick but not quick enough to arise suspicion. You were also strong as he tried to sprawl but your grip didn\u2019t allow it. You lifted him then took him down as you were taught, careful not to injure him but hard enough to cause an opening for you to throw a half nelson in then turn him to his back with ease and more importantly in a believable fashion. In all it was a whole 6 seconds before the Ref hit the mat and whistled to call the match a pin for you. As the sound hit your ears you released him immediately then went to the center, taking of your color band as you went. The kid slowly got up as if he didn\u2019t know what just happened. He probably wasn\u2019t use to having to lose so quickly or at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reluctantly went to the center to which you shook his hand and the Ref raised your hand in victory. It was only then that you listened to the crowd. Mr. hale rarely had to give you any advice in the match, and to be fair it was over before he could. The people in the stands were both cheering and admiring you. The feeling felt really good and it even got better when you saw your father standing with the rest of them and clapping to your win, a proud look on his face. You didn\u2019t really care at the moment that you had just won, or that you had done so quickly, or that everyone was admiring you; the guys for your win and the girls now seeing your flawlessly sculpted body. That all was white noise to you as your reward was in his eyes as he nodded to your gaze and you felt like you had accomplished something beyond winning a simple wrestling match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn Caleb, that looked like a drilling practice session rather than a match.\u201d Mr. Hale said as he handed you your clothes and you started putting them on and unstrapping your singlet and head gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s why we practice it right?\u201d you asked as if gauging if you did something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but most have to really work hard to pull off a move as flawlessly as you just did in a real match. Good job and keep it going.\u201d Mr. Hale ended as he shook your hand and went to advise the next wrestler. You saw a few of the girls that were there watch as you were now topless then sigh as you put your shirt back on. You then stretched a bit before moving back to your seat, where Papa was waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was short but sweet.\u201d He complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I think I only hurt his pride.\u201d You said as you both glanced over at him brooding his loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I do have to get going now. These things tend to take all day but I just wanted to say that you did a good job. However for the sake of the others I would suggest you allow them to last a little longer. You will obviously win regardless so might as well make it fun for them as well.\u201d Papa said. You were still beaming from his compliment so you just nodded. While you weren\u2019t really a touching person he was so he gave you and handshake that pulled into a one armed hug then went down the bleachers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You won all your matches as easy but not as quick as the first. You usually allowed them enough time to take a few shots before you pinned them in a variety of different ways. Papa was right to suggest such, even if Mr. Hale didn\u2019t necessarily agree. But in the end you were winning and by a large margin, so he couldn\u2019t really complain. It was similar with Matt but he had somewhat of a fan fair around him of girls and what not trying to appease him. If you had to think of one main flaw with Matt, it was that he didn\u2019t treat women like he should. Even if he was raised by his mother, he had seen more of one minded coaches and trainers than he did of her. You didn\u2019t really know where he got it from but he tended to treat women like pieces of disposable meat. Perhaps in their young minds it attracted some girls but to you it was pathetic. For a guy that had almost everything he was sorely lacking in morality of this part in particular. You had tried to tell him but he was older than you and the only thing you two had in common was wrestling so he didn\u2019t really listen to your advice when he was, in his mind, doing fine with the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later in the day when the tournament was almost over and you just got done with your final match that you saw Kelsey show up. She had watched your match and you could almost feel her gaze as you strapped up then returned afterward. Since she seemed to be hiding you didn\u2019t bother going over to her. You just went back to your seat to watch the rest of the tournament. However you had her scent on record and could sense her coming as she approached. She was trying to surprise you so you weren\u2019t going to ruin it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess who.\u201d Said a voice as two small hands covered your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Kelsey\u201d You said, after you said her name she hugged into your back then slid into the seat beside you, although they were bleachers so she was technically all the same seat. There were a few eyes still on you from people that were either to proud or scared to come near. Their gazes turned into glares that shot holes in Kelsey, well if she noticed and it was near impossible to tell unless you read her mind. But you hadn\u2019t done something like that for weeks, Papa had said it was too intrusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know it was me?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a very distinctive voice, that and you have very soft skin.\u201d You said as you tapped her hands as they retracted. You wisely left out the part of her scent. You had told her that you could smell her one time at lunch and she didn\u2019t speak to you for a week. How were you suppose to know that she would take it that way, and it wasn\u2019t even a bad smell to begin with. You found her scent rather\u2026 delicious actually but also calming. It was a different feeling when you were around her. While you still felt a large ping of loyalty, you also felt something that only resembled the content feeling that you got when Eve was on or near you, which was all the time at home. Kelsey only knew Eve as a pet, a very large, hairy, black, spider pet that she strangely enough didn\u2019t mind holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home you had actually moved out your bed and other relaxing furniture to allow Eve freedom in making her own specialty ones for you from her finest silk. You currently had a woven silk Hammock, that despite their bias against spiders your family did covet. She also made you a few seating areas that she could climb in and around. The webbing made it insanely comfortable while her constant maintenance made it always clean and the sticky parts caught what few things that felt it wise to invade your room. Other than her, Eve was the only bug and/or pest in your room. Kelsey sometimes got to your house and jumped into the webbed furniture since she didn\u2019t have to worry about hitting something on the ends or hard spots. She would even get tangled in it so the Eve had something to do. Eve couldn\u2019t communicate with her as Kelsey was still ignorant of your secret but they still had fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thanks for the compliment.\u201d She said with a smile then leaned into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d you asked as you heard her sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey, I can tell when you\u2019re lying.\u201d You stated. She stayed silent for a moment as she played with your zipper that was closing your warm up top around your body and over your t-shirt underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just be like the other guys and not notice or not care?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t be me. I prefer me and I think you do as well. But I could switch and take a serious approach if you want.\u201d You countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks. You\u2019re right, I like you the way you are. We are good friends aren\u2019t we?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we are, well I think so at least. I remember the last time I answered an emotional question for you. My arm is still sore.\u201d You joked as she play punched you just like the reference you were alluding to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I see how the others were looking at you when you were down there doing your thing. They will probably not admit it until later but most of the girls our age and some beyond were drooling over you while the guys were jealous of you. It won\u2019t be long before you fly right by me.\u201d She said, a little depressed. She must\u2019ve had a rough day with her looks again. People were always picking on her for her lack of\u2026 development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them drool, it gets their pants and skirts wet.\u201d You said to which she chuckled a little. \u201cWe made a promise, remember? No matter how popular either of us get, we\u2019re friends. I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m going to hold you to that. Cause when you finally do\u2026 you know\u2026 you are going to make everyone\u2019s head snap to you and zoom way ahead.\u201d You said, trying to comfort her. Although you couldn\u2019t help feel like she was hiding something from you. You weren\u2019t going to pry or read it as you had your secrets so you let her have hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always say that.\u201d She said, giving you another slug in the chest. She watched from her position as you looked out at a match while some girls walked by, trying and failing to get your attention. She giggled at the girl\u2019s impartial reaction as they changed from you to Matt and the herm that followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked down to her as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are clueless, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Kelsey asked rhetorically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d you asked as you were missing what she was saying, as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I like you that way.\u201d She returned to which you shrugged lightly then returned your focus to the mats and the matches going on. If you had any clue about women then you would\u2019ve seen she was dreamy about you. She had to in order to bypass Matt completely for you. Matt had even asked her out a few times as if in conquest, but she told him \u2018no\u2019. She seemed that, while she still looked at boys, she only had eyes for you. Again you were to clueless to see it but then again, that is the nature of hindsight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYour room is locked right?\u201d asked Mother one last time before people started arriving. It was determined that people accidentally walking into your room and finding the webbed surfaces would not be a good thing, and especially if they saw Eve. Like your immediate family, your extended family also had a deep phobia of spiders. Eve didn\u2019t mind though as she liked the solitude but you apologized anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, both with the lock and materialization. No one is going in without me being there.\u201d You confirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, just in time.\u201d She said as she went to the door in order to welcome the incoming guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father was the most wealthy and as such had the largest house. The only reason no one came for thanksgiving and your family had to go elsewhere was because of you. However, your Grand Parents on both sides agreed that EVERYONE was coming for Christmas. The way it usually worked was that people would come in and visit for a while after putting presents they brought under the tree. When it was determined that everyone was there you would all migrate to the table and eat your fill of the wonderful dishes that people brought. After that the men of the family usually relaxed to let the massive amounts of ingested food to settle while the kids played games downstairs and the women talked while cleaning up from the meal. A few hours later you all would gather again for opening presents while drinking eggnog and listening to the Christmas story from Grandpa Konel. He had a deep authoritative voice that made it sound like a heavenly voice was reciting the story down. Afterwards the presents were handed out and a form of wrapping paper dodge ball was played by all until it was time to go. Usually someone always left something at your family\u2019s house, so they were back within the week to collect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d Greeted Mom as Papa sat in his chair but stood to his parents coming in. You stood off to the side, nervous at what might happen this year because of you. Kids your age and older, that could handle it, were also aware and you were wondering how they would treat you. You and your siblings stood in the room awaiting their arrival so they could go down the line and greet each other. You already knew they would accept you but weren\u2019t sure about the ones coming in at their heels; Grandpa and Grandma Lon. They usually were the nicer of the two sides but also more opinionated. Things they didn\u2019t like they made sure that other people were notified and understood, even if you didn\u2019t want to hear it. They were like that when they learned of your old fascination with Vampires and like topics. But now that you are one you didn\u2019t know how they would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you all have grown so much.\u201d Grandma Konel stated as each of you exchanged hugs and kisses with her but when she got to you she held you tighter than usual. \u201cYou make sure you have a wonderful Christmas no matter what.\u201d She said as she hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will try.\u201d You responded with a smile as you hugged her back, planting a kiss on her cheek. You were glad that your fangs were retractable as that would just be another level of awkwardness to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny of them give you a hard time, you come over and let us know.\u201d Grandpa Konel stated as he bent down to give you a kiss as you exchanged one in like manner to Grandma. You marveled at how Grandparents could make everything ok with a few hugs and kisses. But now was the test as your other side came, the ones you hadn\u2019t seen since you changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come her Caleb.\u201d Grandma Lon said as she just grabbed you and hugged you tighter then Grandma Konel had. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about a thing. We all love you here.\u201d She said as she backed off after a round of quick pecks on the cheeks but held her hand to your face to comfort you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Grandma.\u201d You responded to which she moved on for Grandpa Lon to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot the girls chasing ya now I take it.\u201d He blurted out. He was the blunt one out of all your relatives. One of those grandparents or relatives that you didn\u2019t ask anything unless you were ready for a straight and short answer. If you were doing something he didn\u2019t like he told you in such a blunt and obvious way that an infant would be able to understand. He also joked around about touchy subjects, mostly other people\u2019s dating life or embarrassing subjects that no one will touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a few I guess.\u201d You responded with a smile as you were just glad he was acting like he usually did. You both exchanged hugs but no kisses. He was the Grandparent that wasn\u2019t very touchy in the physical manner, which is probably where you got it from yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet, you staying out of trouble though?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as I can.\u201d You answered to which he smiled and accepted the answer. Once they sat down it was ok for you and the others to do likewise, well until others arrived that wanted to go and play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the most nerve wracking part as you waited for others to get there. With the whole of your heart you wanted them to accept you but you weren\u2019t going to force them like you were able nor were you expecting them to. You knew that it was at the very least hard to understand. Although your Grandparents had spread around the good you had done, as well as your parents doing the same among family. But while Luke, Isaac, and Sarah were invited to sleepovers and parties. The invitations actually requested that you NOT attend. You just hoped that this would not show its self at Christmas of all times. If you couldn\u2019t get them to show you at least a little understanding at this time then you wouldn\u2019t bet on anything after that point.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHello everyone!\u201d came a joyous tone as one of you Aunts and their family from your Mother\u2019s side came in. This all took a predictable pattern as more and more came in the house. You had taken a spot to the far end of the room in order to give them space. However it didn\u2019t stop them from almost glaring at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandma, Grandpa, so good to see you!\u201d came another voice as the kids from their family came in and rushed into their Grandparent\u2019s arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would greet the others in the room but when it came to you they were pulled, sometimes forcibly, away from you and told to go play with the others. They would look at you with a question in their eyes until you smiled and waved, which got them to go on their way more easily. Some saw this and appreciated your help, even if it was only helping them to distance you from those that didn\u2019t know why. Those that were children and old enough to know what was going on went downstairs to play games with your brothers or into Sarah\u2019s room to play with her stuff. The most over used trick that was done, even by the more passive extended family, was wearing sliver jewelry. You could always tell where Sliver was in something or around so you immediately sensed sliver specs in some of your favorite human dishes that they brought. You took note of the ones without for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Caleb, it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d said Aunt Carol as she came close to hug you like a few of the others. You could tell that she aimed her sliver bracelets toward skin and hugged you close to tell you something. \u201cJust be sure to stay away from my children bloodsucker.\u201d She whispered. All of them said something along those lines, well the Aunts did while most Uncles simply glared or avoided eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Ma\u2019am.\u201d You said back quiet enough for hardly anyone to hear but loud enough so you didn\u2019t have to repeat. You had to force a smile to appear everything was still ok. But as you had been called everything from \u2018blood sucker\u2019 to \u2018demon spawn\u2019 it was wearing on you quite a bit. But you were determined to make sure everyone else had a good time so you didn\u2019t give anyone a reason to fight over you. They would place their presents under the tree and each and \u2018accidentally\u2019 forgotten yours or got you something that reeked of silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, can\u2019t you come and play the new Playstation game I got?\u201d asked your cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid!\u201d whispered your Uncle to which he looked at you with a \u2018sorry\u2019 look as did most of the other cousins then went on their way. Most of the cousins that knew about it were eager to see something cool from you and were definitely wondering why they couldn\u2019t hang around you so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk everyone. Now that we are all here let\u2019s eat.\u201d Called Grandma Lon and like a locust storm everyone gathered at the table. You subtly moved to your spot between Luke and Sarah on your family\u2019s section of the table. When everyone sat down it was unusually quiet until both Grandfathers prayed over the meal and it started, the food being passed around to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you usually gorge out on the stuffing, what\u2019s up?\u201d asked Luke as he noticed you had random things on your plate. You could still enjoy human foods so most were surprised you had anything at all. But since there was trace amounts of silver in a good number of the dishes and ingesting silver would make you weak as well as show your fangs all day, you had an incomplete plate of food; mashed potatoes without gravy, Ham without rolls, no stuffing to which you usually grabbed extra of, and other things that obviously went together that you only took half of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust not that hungry I guess.\u201d You replied as convincingly as you could. No, it would ruin the whole thing if you revealed what was actually going on so you settled for what you were able to get and ate, despite their disappointment that you didn\u2019t take any \u2018silver dishes\u2019. Most left it alone as they were shoveling their portions down and Duke was licking up things that were falling onto the floor from the little younger kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation went on but no one dared touch the subject of you one way or the other with the smaller and younger children being currently ignorant of why things were as they were. Instead most just avoided eye contact with you while observing you when they could for different reasons. Eventually everyone was done and you excused yourself from the table and went back to sitting in the living room. Most of the day after that worked the same way as you just listened in on conversations. Papa noticed you not playing with the others but smiling none the less and knew something was fake about it. However he also seemed to save his objections for another time. As present time came each family would hand out presents to the others and of course conveniently forget yours or would have given you silver, the best thing being a silver chain with a ring on it from Lord of the Rings, or so was their excuse. However your turn finally came so you stood to address the room about your gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know a lot has changed and what I may give is not enough so I used my new\u2026 gifts to pay everyone\u2019s mortgages off completely along with clearing all credit card dept. I\u2026 I hope it is ok that I didn\u2019t wrap them. However I do have these that I can give. You can just call them my mark.\u201d you stated then sat back down after handing each family a set of cards that displayed your glyph on them. You didn\u2019t look any of them in the eye as you handed your cards out but you could tell by the silence that they were definitely not expecting it. The card was a type of spell but without the magic. As soon as the person\u2019s skin touched the card the glyph was planted on their body but under the skin so not even they knew it was there. You knew that none of them would allow or choose to tattoo your glyph themselves, especially if they knew you could teleport to them because of it. However you wanted to protect your family so you didn\u2019t give them the choice in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d You said to your Grandparents as they left. There would be more to tell if there was anything to tell. After the gifts people were anxious to leave, both to get away from you and to confirm what you said. You still were closed off mostly from the events as things moved on and people itched to leave despite the protests from their playing children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After all that you felt a little exhausted, so you gathered the few presents you received and headed to your room. The odd assortment of sliver trinkets and stakes jingled a little as you opened you previously sealed door, put the box of stuff in your closet then went to lay on you silk bed. With the door closed you were able to drop the act you were previously using and just lie there, looking up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019d it go?\u201d asked eve as she crawled from under your swinging bed to a spot on your chest. \u201cIt sounded like the party or whatever it was went fine but then again\u2026\u201d she started back up to you silence but stopped midway as she saw a single tear running down you cheek. \u201cCaleb, what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2026 they all hate me.\u201d You stuttered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 I thought you said your Grandparents loved you.\u201d she argued lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do, but they and my folks are the only ones. My cousins were shunned away from me, wither they wanted to or not. That whole box of gifts are silver trinkets that have no real meaning accept trying to expose the one physical weakness I have. Even the food they brought was laced with silver. They acted like me in the open but when they got close they said anything but nice comments and demands including; die you bloodsucker.\u201d You answered back, another tear rolling down your cheek as you remembered the words and actions of the day. You were only 12 years old, so having a high majority of you extended family that use to love you say such things took its toll. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind Eve, I would like to get some rest.\u201d You said before she could come back with anything worth saying. You turned slowly so she could get off your body. You laid partially curled up in the webbed bed facing the wall, trying to forget what happened that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened you didn\u2019t notice, nor did it register that Eve was the one that opened it and left your room like she had been told not to. You could follow her movements but were too distracted to comprehend what she was doing as your mind observed but your body didn\u2019t register it. She scuttled to the living room on the ceiling then to the wall near where your parents sat. She knew better than to get to close. As you did your homework and research she had been on or near you, learning with you as she had little else to do. She now knew a good amount of the world from a human education standpoint as well as what a lot of animals were like, including other spider types, from your science book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa, Mom.\u201d She called from her spot on the wall. She was nearly plate sized by this point and easily seen when she revealed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve, what are you doing out of Caleb\u2019s room. We thought we made it clear that it you\u2019re not with Cal\u2026\u201d Papa started but she interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is the reason I\u2019m out here.\u201d She interrupted and they went quiet as she had always been passive and never intrusive, neither by nature or mindset. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the rudeness but he is in there crying and I don\u2019t know what to say to him.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrying? Why is he crying? I know that their welcome wasn\u2019t necessarily that welcoming but I thought he had a rather nice day considering what could\u2019ve happened.\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said he only acted that way but won\u2019t really go into details with me. I know I\u2019m not supposed to come out but please speak with him. I don\u2019t really know what happened but he never cries so I don\u2019t know how to help him.\u201d Eve said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026 Thank you Eve for telling us. We\u2019ll talk about it out here then go see what we can do. Why don\u2019t you go back in there before Sarah sees you and shrieks so loud it breaks glass.\u201d Papa said in a way that portrayed his thanks to her but also reminded her of why she needed to return to your room as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Eve said before scuttling back to your room. Again you heard the whole thing but it was like a security monitor that the guard doesn\u2019t look at. It still records and stores the information but doesn\u2019t cause any awareness, not immediately anyway. Shortly after Eve returned and went to a corner the door opened again. Papa and/or Mom rarely came in your room anymore, due in no small part to Eve and her webbing. Even if they knew it was safe it was still a phobia none the less. They hit the light dimmer so that it was just bright enough to see where they were going but not to the point where it would overly effect you. Soon they sat in silk chairs next to your bed and after wondering on the comfort that they provided they addressed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, are you ok?\u201d Mom asked. You knew better than to just blow off when your parents talked to you. At the very least you had to be formal about it. You turned while wiping your face but after crying for a while it is usually hard to get the effects free of one\u2019s face. \u201cMy dear, why were you crying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 no reason, I\u2019m fine.\u201d You said as you almost told them about what happened but didn\u2019t want to ruin a perfectly good day, for them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, what did we teach you about lying?\u201d Papa said in a tone and expression that forbid you from keeping them out of it. You looked down then sat up and sideways so that the swaying silk bed was now a makeshift couch of sorts. \u201cDid you not have a good day? We are in this together Caleb so you need to tell us so we can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell Grandpa and Grandma on both sides were nice. They were really working hard at making it a good time for everyone. So I didn\u2019t bring any of the bad stuff up. For me, it was better if I have a bad time then everyone else. So I Just acted like everything was ok and that they were all accepting me like they wanted.\u201d You started then waited for Papa and Mom to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad stuff? What do you mean \u2018bad stuff\u2019?\u201d asked Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess for starters I was told be pretty much everyone to stay away from their kids then mixed a racial slur for good measure; Blood sucker, demon spawn, little devil, abomination to name a few. They also were all wearing silver things like rings and bracelets that they touched to my skin when they hugged me and whispered their sentiments. The silver didn\u2019t hurt, just like their presents, but it was not their intension not to harm me, which hurt more.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe they would say such things. I was wondering why you weren\u2019t playing with the others. I thought you were just trying to relate to your Uncles and Aunts.\u201d Mom stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d Papa asked as you could see the wheels turning in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt dinner, I could sense something off about the food. There was trace amounts of silver in most of the dishes they brought, specifically things I usually ate a lot of. If I would\u2019ve ate some then I would\u2019ve gotten really sick and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to retract my fangs for a month, making it impossible to go out or even back to school until they came back. Again, I don\u2019t think they were too happy when I bypassed the dishes with silver in them. Then after the meal it was the same old thing from before. Presents came and I\u2019m sure you notice how most of what I got was silver things that didn\u2019t have that much of a purpose other than exposing me as a Vampire or sending hidden messages. The Silver steaks are obvious ones to interpret while the rings and necklaces are a little more difficult. That about sums up my day and what they think of me.\u201d You explained, keeping it together until the end line to which you stopped and tried to hold back some tears. But as a 12 year old kid you were understandably bad at hiding such emotions once they had surfaced, relatively speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wonder why they left us so much food. They\u2026 Caleb, why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristmas is supposed to be a happy time. I didn\u2019t want it to be a bad experience for anyone else just because I had a few changes.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is rather noble of you, more so than those you are suppose to be looking up to.\u201d Papa complimented but also you could hear an edge to his voice when he referred to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least they all have your glyph. You can track them all right?\u201d Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, everyone that received one got a glyph and no one was left out. I can feel them and if I press I can feel near 50 feet around them.\u201d You reported, glad to get off the subject of their treatment of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was also nice of you to wipe all their dept. How did you do that?\u201d asked Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I convinced the people at the banks to wipe the slate as well as the credit card companies. It took a while to find each of the companies and banks they were members of but I\u2019m glad it worked.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith your mind control?\u201d asked Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly. I don\u2019t have mind control like Professor X on X-Men. It\u2019s more of a persuasion, I am able to make them WANT to do what I need them to do. If it was mind control I would say walk to the living room and they would do it but not have the ability to open the door first. Personally I think it is much better. In this case I convinced them to wipe the dept so that it was gone by this morning and no later or earlier.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is dangerous, would you be able to do the same to us?\u201d Papa asked, concerned that there was another ability he needed to keep an eye on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of, it works better if the person doesn\u2019t know I can do it. So the less aware of my nature as a Vampire the better. But I can suggest things and make you more prone to doing them. I\u2019ve only done it once though, to family.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d asked Papa, suddenly getting very serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I told each of you what I am. I could tell from hearing your heart rate that you were panicking. So I entered your mind and emotions and cause you to become more calm. Other than that I\u2019ve not really done it to family. I thought it would be too much like mind reading, and that is intrusive.\u201d You answered, you answer seemed to calm them down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I take it that is at the heart of Vampire seduction?\u201d Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 and no. Apparently I give off a scent to all ways of sensing me; sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch that make me more attractive and appealing to\u2026 anything. I use that when hunting. If I can manage to get close enough to a deer for example, I can calm it and attract it. I\u2019m sure it works different on humans but I can made a deer come to me and offer its neck willingly for me to drink. All that without entering the mind so I assume that if people still don\u2019t like me then humans must be different in some way at the basic level.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m proud of you that you don\u2019t use your gifts on humans. I\u2019m sure it would be much easier if you could just force people to like you. The fact that you don\u2019t speaks volumes about you.\u201d Papa complimented and you beamed with his compliment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At your age and her size she covered your chest and most of your overall torso. You brought one hand up to pet her as she relaxed in this position. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I overstepped. I only meant to help. You scared me when you were all sad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI scared you?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ve seen you angry and happy before, along with most of the emotions in between. So I know how to deal with them. However I never have seen you cry before and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know if you needed help or just to be left alone to cool off. But now I understand, you were crying because of an overload of emotion, the emotion being sadness.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you Eve. I really am thankful that you helped out, even if you broke the rules.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, still nervous of the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Perhaps in time they will allow you to roam a little more free. They are all getting use to you, well accept Sarah but even she is beginning to accept a little.\u201d You answered her. \u201cHowever you shouldn\u2019t push it. This time they allowed it but don\u2019t think that their seriousness about the issue has weakened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Caleb, only when you are around.\u201d She verified, glad that her actions were of help and she wasn\u2019t being punished for it. You knew she was just trying to help and you were grateful now for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut still, I do thank you for it. I really did need to talk with someone about it and you always being here helps a lot.\u201d You said in a thankful expression as you looked into her many eyes and she looked back into yours. You continued to pet her gently as she laid on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the least I could do. You stick up for me all the time and I do nothing to help you.\u201d she almost whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you do more than enough. Plus, you\u2019re family now. It doesn\u2019t matter to me if you do a little or a lot, as long as you are here. You being here is not a burden at all.\u201d You interjected in a confirmative tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really mean that? I\u2026 You\u2019re my family?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m living proof that you don\u2019t have to be the same species to be family. Human, Vampire, Spider, or whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter what you are only who you are.\u201d You answered, gingerly petting her as she took in what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels really good to hear. Thank you Caleb for that.\u201d She said as she fiddled a little with her mandibles. \u201cAre you tired? Cause I was wondering if I could cocoon you, just for practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you remember that I got to get up in the morning and when Papa or Mom call. Beyond that, I wouldn\u2019t mind at all. It actually feels pretty good to be cocooned, but why do you need the practice?\u201d you asked and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell when I get bigger I am going to have to catch bigger game. Not humans of course but bigger stuff and I need practice wrapping bigger things to eat. Does it really feel good?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your silk is very comfortable and even if it gets a little cluster phobic it still is very soft, smooth, and insanely comfortable. I think it would be scary if you were going to actually eat me but as that\u2019s not the case I can just lay back and take it in. It\u2019s kind of like me petting you. Humans can\u2019t really understand what it feels like but you say it feels good, really good when you don\u2019t have to worry about the person squashing you. Same thing, kind of.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so it\u2019s that kind of thing. Well I guess we just have to take each other\u2019s word for it. Thanks.\u201d She said then moved to start the process while you put your arm down to your sides to allow her to work. It wasn\u2019t like you had a time restraint and she worked quickly when spinning web so you just lay there and let her do what she willed, having complete trust in her as she lifted, spun, heaved, and weaved around your body. It felt good as she wrapped you, her soft gentle legs pressing you at certain points and her similarly but silkier webbing wrapping you as she scurried around. Without worrying about her eating you it was a rather interesting and relaxing progress. The pressure from both her and her webbing massaged your body from its exertion. Her natural smell was very appealing, as was her webbing. You thought it was to help such a large spider draw in prey. But ether way it was an overly pleasing experience and you liked that she enjoyed it as much as you did, very similar to petting indeed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time passed at a fairly quick pace. With the middle school wrestling season being so short you were out of it by mid January. However you still came in once in a while to help spar with the high school team, both to boost your experience and to give the person there a heavier work out. You didn\u2019t mind, the High School practices were harder and more challenging and therefore more fulfilling at their conclusion. Matt of course was there as well for the same reason. However there was a slight problem shortly after spring break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring spring break the snow melted in sudden hot weather along with record rain falls. The area was flooded in most areas and even though it was dealt with rather quickly the bugs and animals were fleeing into free areas. For animals it was further south of uphill in wooded areas. However the bugs found it easier to just accommodate the houses and buildings while things like mosquitoes and such bugs thrived in the sudden increase of mold and other damp based environments the aftermath of the flooding and the continued rain provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeek! Somebody do something about all these bugs!\u201d Sarah screeched as she ran from her room for the third time that day. School was closed for another week while the cleaned the mold from parts due to health department standards. The first time it was another spider, second was a centipede, and now you guessed something other than that as you and Eve sat comfortably in the living room. She was now near the size of a cat or small dog and therefore sat on your lap, protecting you from any invading bugs. She knew your blood wasn\u2019t tasty as a Vampire but she was determined that the only \u2018bug\u2019 that was allowed to suck your blood while she was around was her, which she didn\u2019t do. Your room was full of meals as it was already covered in webs for her and by her. It was safe to say that you and Eve were not doing that poorly when it came to this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they\u2019re going to be around for a while. At the very least until the flooding goes away and it is more habitable in their normal settings. But the mosquitoes will be around more cause of all the mold.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I mind.\u201d Eve stated as she leapt and caught another fly that she eagerly devoured. Her sudden movements between you and Isaac got most to flinch but Isaac had grown to liking Eve\u2019s presence even more for the fact she could catch all the \u2018mean bugs\u2019 around him. Isaac even slept in your room in a cocoon like you did. Eve had become really good at cocooning you and hanging your\u2026 bed like a self regulating hammock without you having to help her by moving in the slightest. You had even begun simulating struggle so she could get a better idea of what to expect in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, nice catch Eve.\u201d Isaac cheered as she caught a spider that was attempting to drop on him to take part in the feast like Eve was doing. However she was becoming overly protective when she could of her family that was your family. Not even other spiders were allowed a bite of one of you if the family member allowed her close enough to ensure it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d She said as she tickled his face with her leg then leapt to catch another fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally not fair. Why do you get a bug catcher and we don\u2019t?\u201d Sarah complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t rip on Eve like that. It\u2019s not her fault you don\u2019t like spiders. She did offer to help during the day but you told her to get lost as I recall.\u201d You said in a protective tone to Eve that she always appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right Sarah. We that are hesitant to let her close can\u2019t expect her to clean up for us. But I guess I wouldn\u2019t mind a once over of our room and house before you all go to bed.\u201d Papa stated and asked Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I can do that in about 30 minutes if no one stops me. But they will still come in so I can put a layer of webbing on your bedroom walls to catch a bunch of them if you want.\u201d Eve offered. \u201cOf course it would better if you came into our room so I could\u2026 sorry forgot you don\u2019t like that.\u201d Eve said, the last part as Papa and Mom gave her a look. The first time they saw you cocooned they almost freaked. You told them about what she was doing and the comfort it was so they let her keep doing it. As Isaac got bitten up by mosquitoes the first night of the bug raid they let her cocoon him as well in your room. The cocoon even helped when he wet the bed. It absorbed the urine and forced a webbed like sack for Eve to dispose of during the night and he slept better than he had in his own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the thought Eve but I think we will accept your house cleaning and web treatment. Perhaps the house cleaning after everyone meets in Caleb\u2019s room.\u201d Mom accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can pump out some attractants so they all come for us and get stuck your webs.\u201d You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be perfect. I can even put a web over the door to catch all the flying ones.\u201d Eve said in an excited tone. \u201cOh if this keeps up I\u2019ll be dog sized by the end of the month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that.\u201d You stated after she leapt and got another fly then stroked her a little before she scuttled over Isaac to chow down on an approaching centipede. She could eat one of three ways. She could drain the victim of their bodily fluids, or she could cocoon them then produce and enzyme that breaks down the whole body into a soup to be drank at her convenience, or if it was small enough she could swallow the thing in her mouth. Her razor sharp teeth weren't very far rooted so she couldn\u2019t tear things apart or chew but they could keep a partially swallowed victim from getting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither, you\u2019re so cool Eve.\u201d Isaac agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re so cute.\u201d Eve said back as she danced up to his head and leapt for another few flies, landing on your head like a circus act. \u201cOk, so what do you all want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go with the option that keeps me from getting wrapped up.\u201d Sarah blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s comfy.\u201d Isaac protested as Eve continued to work around the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all fine for you Isaac, we are just not that comfortable with that kind of thing, no offense.\u201d Mom explained to Isaac but targeted the \u2018no offense\u2019 toward Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone taken. Caleb lets me study with him so I more than understand why some humans don\u2019t like me very much, or spiders in general. Although that girl that comes by named Kelsey seems to like me.\u201d Eve said in understanding after swallowing a beetle looking thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, since it is near bed time, let\u2019s all meet in Caleb\u2019s room so Eve can get to work.\u201d Papa stated to Sarah\u2019s displeasure. You all got up and went into your room. The usually white surroundings of clean webbing was wiggling with black dots and sometimes the occasional larger prey like a mouse or anything small enough to think that a house was more preferable than the woods with the other animals, mainly insects though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh I\u2019ll be eating good tonight.\u201d Eve said as she scuttled around the room, biting a few of the bigger pieces of prey caught in her webs before returning to the door as you all were now sitting on the clean side of the bed, and silk made chairs. She then went to work on the outside of the door frame so there was a strong barrier of webbing at the threshold. \u201cOk Caleb, I\u2019m going to go make a pass over the house so you can let loose you attracting thing.\u201d Eve said as she gave the all clear and headed off to her task. You did and flooded as much attractant as you could that you usually kept down for obvious drama and complicated reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Caleb, that really does smell good.\u201d Sarah said as she sniffed the air but was brought back from the usual daze that people and animals had when letting the scent posses them. Her attention was brought to the door as the webbing wiggled with bugs trying to get in but getting stuck, some of them rather large. Soon the door was a literal black doted mess as bugs crashed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I think. I usually use it for hunting but it still works to help Eve catch her prey as well.\u201d you said with a matter of fact tone. Isaac however wasn\u2019t as strong willed as the others so he came into your swinging hammock of a bed and cuddled into you and exposing his neck to you. \u201cAnd this is why I don\u2019t do it all the time.\u201d You said as you gave his neck a pat then just brought him down into a firm hug where he settled then went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I have to admit this is very strange.\u201d Papa stated as Luke was more distant from the feeling but Sarah seemed to be itching to follow Isaac\u2019s example and offer herself to you. \u201cI know you told us about this but I didn\u2019t think it would be this strong. I actually find myself desiring for you to drink me dry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, it is why I don\u2019t use this all the time. But this isn\u2019t even a third of what the scent is capable of.\u201d You revealed to their shock, not that they didn\u2019t understand it before but now it was more\u2026 real since they can feel the effects. \u201cNo offense but if I really wanted to drink a human dry, even if they have an advantage of knowing who I am and what I can do, I could get them to force my fangs into their neck and yell for me to drink. Suicidal almost insane levels of desire would follow if I didn\u2019t oblige or knock the person out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that part of the legends is fake as well, the part of vampires drinking from screaming and struggling women?\u201d Asked Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. I can also use this scent to invoke fear and a host of the other emotions. Not directly but more of a presence that invokes fear\u2026 like this scent it is easier to feel then explain. Anyway, there are primarily two ways that a Vampire would get someone\u2019s blood pumping faster; fear or arousal. Even if I can do it, making someone fell sad, depressed, happy, or glad is useless in a hunting standpoint and especially if I want them to increase blood flow.\u201d You answered and they tried to accept what you said with varying levels of success, enough though to be aware of what your scent was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you ever\u2026 drink our blood?\u201d asked Sarah, half the thought came from before but she was too afraid to ask. But now with your attractant scent out that little hindrance was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah! You shouldn\u2019t even tempt him.\u201d Mom stated. However she was also suffering from the effects of your scent and was wanting to experience you biting into her again, since she and Papa already had felt how good it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, she isn\u2019t tempting me\u2026 well no more than usual. But my answer is, not now. Anyone that is too young doesn\u2019t have enough blood in them to drink safely from. It is hard to stop drinking fresh blood so it takes a bit of self control to pull away for both sides and that usually is beyond the safe limit for people too young and what their bodies can handle.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you would drink from us later?\u201d asked Luke, partially disgusted but partly aroused again by the effects of the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, that wasn\u2019t what I meant\u2026 Darn this is hard to explain. It isn\u2019t like it is bad but it isn\u2019t good either.\u201d You said as you scratched your head at a loss on how to explain this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Papa answered for you and you were glad he was taking over and they could tell with a sigh from you. \u201cHe can and it isn\u2019t a horrible process for either side, in fact it feels extremely pleasing. However he wouldn\u2019t drink from a human or person without good reason or unless the situation was right, and even then not to drink them dry. It is like killing, a soldier can do it but we can\u2019t. But both are killing so which one is wrong? It is a difficult question to answer and a very fine line. What Caleb can do is no different and holds the same weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Luke replied. You could tell he understood the soldier reference better than anything since that was what he wanted to be when he grew up. Sarah on the other hand was smart and caught a few things that were said. However for the sake of your brothers she didn\u2019t ask them. Truth was, her body carried enough blood to allow you a drink but she was family and as you had the no human policy she wasn\u2019t tempting in that regard. Like a beer to someone that decided not to drink again. Sure they think it would taste good but they feel no compulsion to drink the beverage, even if it is right in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went over to you then climbed up until she was attached to and around your shoulder facing front. When she said it you stopped emitting your attractant to which everyone began feeling normal again. Isaac however was still sleeping on your bed as it swung contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of them?\u201d asked Sarah with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll that were around. Some more will come in during the night but I put bait for them to get stuck in so it won\u2019t be so bad.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you also web up the walls of our room?\u201d asked Papa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, not sticky enough to have a human stuck to it but more than enough to catch anything mouse size and smaller.\u201d She answered.\u201dI can take it down in the morning, along with all the treats it holds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please.\u201d Mom interjected as she was concerned about the clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, will do.\u201d Eve confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve, thank you for your work. I know we may not act like it all the time, but we really do appreciate you.\u201d Papa complimented which left her speechless for the moment. She had never been directly complimented like that before. She had heard you describe how it felt but didn\u2019t understand why you worked so hard for just some words. Now she understood as she didn\u2019t seem to have a comeback ready for this occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 no problem\u2026 I\u2026we\u2026 anytime.\u201d She stumbled as she tried to respond to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you cocoon Isaac now?\u201d you suggested to which she quickly took the out of her embarrassing lack of verbal prowess to respond to Papa\u2019s compliment. The all watched as she scuttled over to him then started her process without waking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI she ok?\u201d Papa whispered to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she just isn\u2019t use to being complimented by you guys. She doesn\u2019t do really well with surprises and emotional stuff. She is actually really happy right now.\u201d You interpreted for them as they watched her do her work. It was fascinating if you knew she wasn\u2019t eating the person she was wrapping. She would wrap the entire body with  a thin layer of silk then a thicker layer attached to the ceiling like links in a pulley system that she used to pull the person up, in this case Isaac, and move them around the room. After that she would have more room to quickly cocoon the person. If she was going all out she would cover the head as well but since she wasn\u2019t eating him she left the head free but supported in the back and sides. All this was done without her waking Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I think we\u2019ll leave you with her and go to bed ourselves.\u201d Mom stated to which they all left you with the working Eve. Each looked back at you as if forgetting something before exiting and shutting the door behind them. Eve worked quickly and in about a half hour Isaac was completely wrapped and snug for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk missy, just one more and you can feast all night.\u201d You stated as you lay down on the bed she started Isaac off in. She started almost immediately as she was anxious to start her feast. Unlike humans, she could eat all she wanted and she only got bigger not fatter, well until a certain point. It went the opposite was as well. While she could eat a massive amount she could also survive for months on just a single fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were right.\u201d She said as she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d you asked as you placed your arms to your sides for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa has that mysterious power when he compliments people like that. I can tell he is just a normal human but there is just something about how he says it that makes all the work and hardship worth the single bit of praise from him.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it, I thought that he was some kind of hybrid after I knew that Vampires were real. I have to use my abilities to do what he does just with a look. But he was right, as he usually is, you did a good job. I mean I always know you do but now they can see it in real life scenario. Came a long way from when you first got here and being worried about being squashed, didn\u2019t you?\u201d you asked to which she stopped her work for a moment to think then started up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed I have, but that is all because of you Caleb. I mean any other human would\u2019ve killed me and definitely not saved me the amount of times you have from other humans, your family, other bugs, your dog, and the weather to name a few. The creator must\u2019ve had a plan when he sent me here.\u201d She stated, referencing God in her own unique way. Your parents and had thought she was proclaiming a different religion when she did such but soon realized, along with you that it was just her way of referring to him. She even went to church a few times with you when she was smaller. That and you going to a private Christian school, she had learned so much by watching you study. Studying not only your scholastic courses but your Bible class as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you start that again. You\u2019re family and that is just what we do with family, take care of each other. Besides, we are beginning to switch roles.\u201d You answered back, stopping her before she started getting to emotional for what she was capable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018switching roles\u2019?\u201d she asked as she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell think about it. I use to carry you around and use to be the big one to explore and protect you. While you are still smaller than I am for the moment you are getting bigger, protecting us from these pests and such. Eventually you will be bigger than us and it will be us clinging to you, well I will\u2026 probably not the others but even so. While I still will have the power of a Vampire, you will be stronger and bigger than the rest of them in no time. Maybe that is why you were sent out of wherever you were born. If you were evil you would\u2019ve been dead a long time ago but if you find someone and grow to be worthy and capable of restraint you live and become a protector rather than a\u2026 demon. I guess that is similar to me and my power, now that I think about it. It was why Miss. Isibelle watched and did similarly with me, to see if I was worthy of this power. I don\u2019t know how well I\u2019m doing after the fact.\u201d You answered her and spoke while Eve scuttled around your body, lifting and pulling you as she worked in her usual massage like fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow my turn; none of that mister. You are a wonderful Vampire and kind person. Maybe you\u2019re right and my family doesn\u2019t want to kill me. I mean my blood family that drove me away. But if they ever made me choose between this family and them I would choose this one hands down\u2026 or legs down.\u201d She joked as she didn\u2019t have hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice one. Well let\u2019s both work towards being worthy\u2026 whatever we are.\u201d You suggested as she now lifted you off the bed like she did for Isaac then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d She said to which you both talked as she continued and until she started eating the massive amount of meals she had around in your webbed covered room, getting it clean again before morning and growing her to near dog size. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When doing this she now had to condense her legs as she was a large dog sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, it must be serious if we are ALL at the family meeting including cousins and all.\u201d you stated as you looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, but first I do believe that most of us owe you an apology Caleb.\u201d Uncle John Lon stated as he addressed you and looked to have the backing of the rest. \u201cWe were terribly hostile toward you at Christmas and while we still have our reservations we assumed the worst and even after we made you feel so horrible as loving family should never do, you gave us such a gift as if it was nothing. If for no other reason we decide that we must repay you for it and that is why we all agreed to having a family summer up at the cabin, all of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d you asked as you stopped petting Eve in shock then shook your head to clear it then started again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have been training to remain human all this time as well as mastering your powers so not to harm us and we are all grateful in our own way. I think all of us are glad you aren\u2019t the demon that legend says you would be.\u201d Grandpa Konel said in a gesture of compliments to what you\u2019ve already done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever we also are aware that you have not trained to improve your vampire powers. Even running up north and back a few times a day isn\u2019t that taxing for you. I know that if something is truly taxing you would need blood to replenish you power and you rarely do so and if so never human blood from someone. We aim to fix this by helping you train while we are all up there.\u201d Papa revealed as the others didn\u2019t know how to say it quite as easily to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 why would you all want me to advance in Vampire power? I thought that would be a threat if I was too powerful or needed blood all the time.\u201d You asked, confused why they were so insistent about you getting stronger as a more powerful Vampire rather than trying to kill you like some were trying to do before, no more than a few months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think you are the only freak out there do you?\u201d Grandpa Lon said bluntly. You knew he didn\u2019t mean anything by the word \u2018freak\u2019 so you were just taken back by his directness, but that was the way he was; blunt, obvious, and to the point despite popular opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat he is trying to say is\u2026\u201d Aunt Penny said as she took over for his explanation. \u201cYour little friend there is all the proof we need that if there is a Vampire out there and talking giant spiders then some of the other myths and legends must be out there to. If nothing else, having a highly trained Vampire on our side in either case would be better than not. If you are part of our family then we aim to make you the family\u2019s, forgive the term but\u2026, freak project.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have a point Caleb.\u201d Eve said to their amazement. They had been told about her but actually seeing and hearing her speak was something else. \u201cIf I had a mother and father than at the very least there is a society of my kind out there. If they ever came for your family because of me then it would help if you were better equipped to handle them. Not that you are weak by any means but still. Plus your room is getting cramped and I wouldn\u2019t mind stretching my legs in the forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026 I guess I see the point\u2026. Wait, if I am going to need that much blood then where will I get it?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that obvious.\u201d Said Grandma Konel. \u201cWe are your blood sources. There is over 20 separate families at the uncle level with your parents as well as their kids and some of their families here. Even if we are able to run you empty every day and night, which I doubt, we will have more than enough time between individual feedings for our bodies to recover and generate more blood. We will be making hardy meals for you and ourselves to ensure this as well.\u201d The idea caught you so bad that you sat there stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. You want me to drink your blood, each of you wants it? You want to become Vampire food?\u201d You asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a sense yes, but also no. We are training your Vampire side so it is only natural that we offer you your main source of instinctual food that Vampires crave the most. We are not asking you to suck us dry but we are saying that we are willing and able to provide you with it. It also will help those of us that are still doubting you to know that you feeding isn\u2019t a bad thing in the sense we understand it. That is a human response in face of our natural predator. The only difference is that you won\u2019t be killing us either during training or feeding. Do you understand?\u201d Grandma Lon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I just need a minute. You said as you thought heavily on this. You were worried about what they were suggesting. Sure you saw the benefit but you had been trying to avoid using humans as food and wasn\u2019t sure about suddenly only accepting human blood. There was also the issue of feeding on children, would that be ok or was that not part of it. They weren\u2019t telling you everything and if you agreed then you would have to if they told you to. You knew there would be lines but you didn\u2019t know where these lines were. I mean how often is it that a family is doing this for a Vampire member of their family. Then again how can you refuse? They were right, you were a pathetic Vampire at the moment in word and deed. You didn\u2019t have to be evil but you didn\u2019t know the first thing about instincts in your new life and how to use them in a battle situation if one ever arises. What to do???  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All we need is for you to teleport all of us up.\u201d Papa stated as they all stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about my stuff?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour stuff?\u201d asked Mom with a cynical grin. \u201cCaleb you don\u2019t get any of your human things while training to be a Vampire. We are taking this seriously. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d She commanded as they all held hands and Papa\u2019s hand was extended to you to which you looked at them as if wondering how much planning they had done to do this. If their stuff was already up there with all the kids and those that were missing then it must\u2019ve been some major string pulling. You sighed then took Papa\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, here we go. Everyone hold your breath.\u201d You advised to which almost all of them took a breath at the same time. To this you teleported them all Up North in front of the cabin where your glyph was. As soon as you got there you let go of his hand and caught yourself on the ground. You hadn\u2019t drank any blood in the last month so the act of teleporting over 100 people over a couple hundred miles drained you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, already?\u201d asked Uncle Jim as he saw you heaving on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he hasn\u2019t drank any blood for about a month. Even back home where he doesn\u2019t do that much, relatively speaking, he would need a pint of blood by next week. Teleporting all of us up here probably wasn\u2019t as easier as he made it look either.\u201d Papa said as they all looked down at you while Eve scuttled from your back to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Caleb here is your first rule. You are authorized to feed at your leisure on us as long as you follow a few rules.\u201d Grandpa Konel started to which you stood up, unable to retract you fangs at this point. But the idea of blood at the end of this talking point made you pay close attention. \u201cFirst; you must never suck anyone dry but you don\u2019t have to stop at operational time. You can drink them until they are unconscious but not in mortal or will take longer than a day to recover. Second rule; you only get one free meal a day and after that you must use your persuasion and other powers to steal your prey\u2019s blood as if we weren\u2019t willing and we can stop you any way we wish, even steaking you with silver. Your free meal will be rotated so we ALL get a turn. Right now it is your father\u2019s turn as he and your mother have already experienced it.\u201d He said as Papa came over to you and you reached for his arm but got a shake in response. \u201cThe last rule is that you may only drink from a human\u2019s neck as a proper Vampire would, or at least what we think a proper Vampire would. While in combat training you can do otherwise if desired in achieving your goal but not as your meals are concerned. This also limits you from animals, you can\u2019t have any animals or human food; ONLY from a HUMAN\u2019s NECK.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know if I feel comfortable with that yet.\u201d You said as the move to do so was rather aggressive and you weren\u2019t sure about doing it to family. The wrist was more pleasant as far as human interaction was concerned. That and you had never drank from that spot before and were understandably nervous, ironically more nervous than the humans around you that were watching and would be your meals, your family. Instinctually your body was telling you to go for it but your human part was saying that you shouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey you don\u2019t get to eat. But this time I must insist Caleb. We need you at top shape to start out.\u201d Papa said as he bent down and offered his neck to you subtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2026ok.\u201d you obeyed as you hesitantly came in for a hug then in one move buried your fangs deep into his neck, causing him to gasp and fresh, hot, delicious, human blood flowed into your mouth and down your throat. You almost hit a blood haze before you remembered what they said and pulled out. It was near double what you took before and he was hugging your head in for you to keep going in his near dizzy state. \u201cAny more and you will pass out or die.\u201d You said as you licked the area of residual blood that hadn\u2019t made it into your mouth. Through the bliss he was aware enough to understand and allowed you to back off and he was helped to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how\u2019d it feel\u2026 both of you?\u201d asked Grandpa Lon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredible, I didn\u2019t want him to stop.\u201d Papa stated in a more slurred speech as evidence to his new state. Mom was there to hold him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 it was good, really good actually. Is it bad to say that human blood is the best tasting blood of them all?\u201d you asked nervously, not sure how open you could be about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, we want to help you Caleb and learning how and what it is like is all a part of that. I guess we are glad that we taste good and especially that we are the best. That means we can really train you like we said we would\u2026 as a true Vampire.\u201d Aunt Anna answered and slowly they all agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more thing Caleb. None of your abilities are restricted. We want you to mind read and fully explore the entire time. This is your time as a Vampire not as a human. Sure you are to follow rules of each exercise and stuff but other than that you are free to act within that. Using our desires and exposing them included.\u201d Grandma Lon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to read your minds?\u201d you asked as you were always told that was rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, like she said, this is your VAMPIRE training. So yes, we want you to read our minds. Well maybe not but we are saying do it anyway.\u201d Grandma Konel verified<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOk, now that you\u2019re fed we can begin, and we\u2019ll start by describing the type of setup we will have.\u201d Uncle Paul stated as he was the oldest of the Konel Uncles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others went to one side in front of the cabin. The Cabin was huge as it was made to accommodate all of our family plus some. The Sleeping area was naturally larger than anything else as there was over 300 rooms, small rooms and some that had collapsible walls but rooms all the same. That area was connected like a hotel to the main area that could house the people in those 300 rooms rather well and as it was a cabin it was more rustic with a wood burning stove for heat along with a boiler and other pieces of older things to make it what a cabin its size would be. There was of course garages and storage but the biggest part was the land itself. Over 500 acres of wooded land with the DNR on one side and a deer farm on the other. Your family\u2019s connection kept the authorities out of the way if your family wanted to do anything besides murder people, which you could probably get away with. The area over top was a no fly zone and your Grandfathers\u2019 military background allowed enough pull to keep people looking down from orbit. Mainly because your family allowed the military branches to train on your land as part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor starters you don\u2019t get to sleep in the house. And the house\u2019s main section is a free zone where you are not permitted at all this summer. However you are allowed in the bedrooms via your hunting while we sleep if you can. I guess you could sleep in one of the rooms but as you are not afforded a room we are authorized to expel you any way we want if we find you in there, and I do mean ANY way we want.\u201d Uncle Paul said as he got the situation down for you. \u201cYou see we are also training so that we are ready for other freaks like you in the future. Eve will be on our side to make the odds a little more fair and help her train as well. It helps that her venom is strong enough to cause you some damage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t bite Caleb!\u201d Eve almost shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Eve.\u201d You said as you gave her a pet. \u201cI can\u2019t die remember and you all need the training as much as I do. At least with you over there helping them they stand a better chance. Can\u2019t imagine them being that good at sensing me right off the bat and it will help me train to avoid you. I promise I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess so. But we get some serious R&amp;R after this summer. Oh what about my hunting?\u201d she asked the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to that.\u201d Uncle Jim said as it was his turn to explain. \u201cDuring the night we will be up and training you on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays with hunting exercises where we set a goal like defeat us all without a sound, or transport us all to a prison of some sort. During this time we will provide resistance. At dusk, like it is now you will receive your fee meal Caleb as a sort of sacrifice if you will but not really. We need your power up high at night so you can thrive in your natural element and figure things out that you didn\u2019t know before. One the off nights you are free to roam as are we. You can choose to hunt some of us, play with us, or whatever and likewise for our side. Don\u2019t expect mercy if you are caught on an off day. Sundays will be the only exception as we will all be going to church but you are still not allowed in the house at that time. At dawn the bell will sound and we will begin athletic training and other things that we find useful like digging holes, balancing on top of a tree all day or whatever. But more importantly it is our time to sleep and Eve\u2019s time to hunt the animals that are around if she wishes as long as she cleans up after herself, although I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t mind her leaving a web up if it captures you.\u201d Uncle Jim finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is getting exciting. I\u2019m already thinking of traps I can set for you.\u201d Eve said to you as she scuttled in a circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, other than during dawn when we tell you what drills you need to run or at dusk when we tell you what hunting objective we are doing along with the activities themselves you are free to do anything more or less. Mainly we need you to be hostile toward us so we can train along with you. If you want to make one of us your slave as a result of your power than that is up to you. Like we said we want you to use ALL of your Vampire Powers so you can train like a Vampire. You know you are doing it right it you are needing blood every day. Understand?\u201d Grandma Konel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so. It will be a little bit weird hunting my family but I think I can handle it. What about tonight?\u201d You asked. It was Monday and it was dusk so you were wondering if there was an activity for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTonight is a free night but you are to establish your domain and get a feel for your area. We will not tread in the forest tonight and you are to stay away from us until we meet tomorrow morning at dawn. After that your training begins.\u201d Papa said as his body began to strengthen but not enough to look as strong as it usually did, just enough though to keep from tipping over and slurring his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026 I hope you all don\u2019t feel bad if I win all the time.\u201d You said with a final smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you remember Caleb.\u201d Uncle Matt said, catching your attention. \u201cWhen we catch you, for whatever reason we have from then till the next scheduled event to play with you whatever way we want. And since you can\u2019t die we can play out scenarios of torture and death without worry. So don\u2019t think we hate you or are betraying you for doing it. After all, thinking up consequences for being captured for you, we will need to be more ruthless and sadistic than normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d You said after a gulp that got some of them to laugh. It was true though. Some might not do it but some were new to being nice to you and probably hoped to get the big bad Vampire to bleed. Some looked like they might do some other morally questionable things to you if caught. You could see each person\u2019s minds turn as they thought of things they wanted in that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright now, it\u2019s almost night time so you have to get out of here.\u201d David, your cousin, said nervously to which you smiled and nodded then vanished from their sight. You had sped to the top of a tree and observed the crowd as they looked around for you in a combination of shock and concern. They had just told you that you could go all out so you let your natural scents and things you usually held back out. They were all yelling and such trying to find you, in case you were still around until the dark patch you knew as Eve directed their eyes to your figure at the top of the tree you were in. It was the tallest but bare tree in the whole place. She didn\u2019t find you right away though but they were glad she helped so you said something you knew only she could here before disappearing into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think you will be their Hero from now on. I\u2019m sure they will all love you to death, no pun intended. Good luck.\u201d You said as your last official compliment before starting that you knew she would like. The others were a little unnerved at how well you could disappear into the night like that but they were glad that Eve at least gave them a better chance and that made her all the more happy. This would definitely be an interesting summer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You got a good layout of what the area was like but 500 acres was hard to explore and regulate. Luckily for you your body didn\u2019t require sleep, or that much of it. But since you didn\u2019t know how bad the next day of training was you practiced on using only a small amount of power so you had enough for whatever the exercises were. As it turned out they met you at Dawn and had you dig holes with no tools. Not small holes either. They were 50 feet deep by 100 feet wide then after you were done with one hole they would have you fill it back up and dig another in a different spot. At first you thought it ridiculous but you soon found that you could grow your nails like claws. In this instance it helped dig up the dirt from the hard clay underneath. Afterwards it was near dusk so they afforded you a little time to wash off in the river and get back for your meal. No surprise it was Mom as Papa was last night. You repeated the process, she came down to your level and you gently approached then sank your fangs in. It was a surprise that you actually did need the blood after the day\u2019s events. You stopped at a similar spot as Papa so she was woozy but not incapacitated. Of course she had a little less self control than he and told you to keep going to which you had to enter her mind and force her to let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now that part is done we all have 10 minutes to allow the other side to retreat into our respective elements before hostilities can be performed.\u201d Uncle Mike stated to which you nodded and disappeared. You could see their flashlights glance the tops of trees to find you and they were right, you were in a tree observing them but behind the trunk and only showing one eye which they had no hope of seeing as they retreated. However you kept an eye on Eve, as you knew she would be your biggest obstacle in this new system. And you were right, about an hour later you saw her scurry into the forest. You avoided her for the most part as you observed the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot you.\u201d she said as you stepped in one of her webbed traps she must\u2019ve set during the day when you were training. You quickly used a bit of electricity to fry the webbing and move out of the way only a split second before her form came down in an attempt to get at you. Unlike at home, this time her poisonous and dripping fangs were poised at you as she descended. But she missed and you ran up a tree before she hit the ground, keeping a better eye on your footing. \u201cDarn it, no fair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course not. You all did tell me to go all out. But I\u2019ll give you props for an excellent trap. If I didn\u2019t already know how to use electricity like that then you would\u2019ve got me for sure. See we are learning stuff already. I learned I have to watch my footing at the most obscure times. Stepping on any one of your webs could be dangerous. But remember, I am free to attack you to.\u201d You complimented and warned as your feet were connected to the tree by another power you just learned. Before you always used a combination of floating and static connection to attach to certain surfaces. You never thought that you might have a separate ability that allowed you to walk up walls and stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks and I already know that Caleb. But you shouldn\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d She said just as you heard a snap and saw a log coming toward you. You leapt and attempted to spring off the end but the pointed end was just a distraction and it was also covered in webbing that got you stuck just long enough for Eve to scale the tree and leap to you. You both fell and she attempted to use her cocooning experience to bite and capture you. But you used a flame from the hand restraining her and sent her and her severed webbing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, Eve are you ok?\u201d you asked as you could smell some of her hair burnt completely off and the impact of the fall could break human bone. But as you neared her she sprung into action and took another leap towards you, fangs out and ready to sink in. This one got closer than the others and you should\u2019ve expected her to play possum to get you. But you were on edge at this point and just barely dodged it so she sank her fangs in the tree and got stuck, but that was all the moment you needed as you pushed her body so she couldn\u2019t retract her fangs and remained stuck. \u201cNice trick\u2026 This is going to be harder than I thought\u201d You said as you caught you breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, I knew you were good but I thought that I could get you.\u201d Eve pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got closer than I even thought possible. But you really should have some of the others help. They may not be as good as we are but all you really needed tonight was a good distraction to get my eyes off you and you would\u2019ve got me for sure. I definitely can\u2019t overlook you. I guess that just means it is going to be just as fun as we thought it would.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how do you know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get all moody on me. You all told be to read your minds. Anyway, you can\u2019t say that you aren\u2019t looking forward to this.\u201d you retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI guess not, I\u2019ll get you next time.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but you also have another area you need to protect, don\u2019t you. With you out here I can easily enter the cabin and get a few pints of blood for my troubles. But tonight I\u2019m not really hungry. Even so this is going to be fun won\u2019t it.\u201d You stated but also asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d She said as you let go and disappeared again. She could only follow your movements a while until you lost her. She was stuck for about 5 minutes and after that went back to the cabin to report. Yes, very fun\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day and another set of physical training. No one else came for you the previous night as you could hear them all talking to Eve about it both that night and the following day, what worked and what she could improve on, along with how you countered her moves. But finally after washing off the dirt from another day of digging, this time a vast tunnels system underground, it was meal time again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2026 be\u2026 please be gentle.\u201d Sarah said as you approached her. Unlike your parents and other adults, you didn\u2019t have to stretch to reach her neck, nor did she have to bend down for you. That and her neck was thinner than the two relatively thicker necks you drank from so far. Coming from a family that the average adult nears 300 lbs, thinner people weren\u2019t in the majority and Sarah had been on diets this entire year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Sarah. It actually feels really good.\u201d You stated as you put a hand on her shoulder. You could feel her blood racing as you approached her for what she knew was food, her neck. Unlike Papa and Mom, she never had an experience with you sucking her blood so she was anticipating bad things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know? You do the biting, not the other way around.\u201d She asked nervously, knowing that there wasn\u2019t a way she could back out of this so she didn\u2019t want to anger the Vampire that would drink her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had my blood drunk by Miss. Isibelle remember. But the feeling you get is only about\u2026 maybe half or less than that of what I get on my end. They weren\u2019t joking when they said you won\u2019t want me to stop.\u201d You said and she nodded and you back to her as you hugged into her then brought your mouth to her neck, licking the spot first. Her flesh was different tasting than your Parents, perhaps it was because she was younger or something but she tasted and smelled more\u2026 pure. You could feel her heart beat increase as she felt this to which you tightened your hold on her and sank your fangs in. She reacted similar to the other two with the gasping and arousal but there was one main difference other than a better taste and less blood to draw from, her hand shot up to your head and pushed you into her neck as hard as she could. When it came time to end you had to force yourself out of her despite some moans to the contrary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 come on, just a little more.\u201d Sarah begged as you pulled away, to woozy to stand on her own, to which Papa and Mom caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that bad, is it?\u201d Mom asked rhetorically to which Sarah looked up at her with a dreamy set of eyes before she passed out and Papa took her in his arms, taking her back to her room to rest then returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the activity for the night?\u201d you asked to which the Uncles held up rifles as they loaded bullets into them as the others had silver striking weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are having a multi hunt.\u201d Grandpa Konel stated as he chambered a bullet into his rifle as well. \u201cWe are going to be hunting you and you will be taking us down. All of us will be wearing this red LED light on our wrists and Eve on the base of her front leg. It blinks so we know who is who and you are not permitted to acquire one to prevent confusion that could get us shooting each other. Since you can\u2019t die, we will hunt you to the presumed death. You on the other hand have to take each of us down and transport us to that cage. Once inside we are not allowed to leave until the exercise is complete one way or another. However we can decide to attack you from inside so ridding of us weapons would be a good idea as well as transporting us there. Not that you need to but you are also not permitted to use one of our flashlights or lights in general, again, to prevent possible fatal confusion. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. No restrictions on how I take each of you out?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther than the loss of life than, no. You will also be healing each of us if injured at the conclusion of the exercise so keep that in mind.\u201d Uncle Rusty stated as he cocked the hammers on his shotgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, when do we start?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen the sun goes down, so I\u2019d guess about 5 minutes.\u201d Grandma Lon responded. She was to frail for a gun so she had a silver charm and flashlight in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then I better get going. Good luck\u2026\u201d you said with a smirk than vanished from sight. You ran up to a tree like usual after running around a little and noticed some of the traps Eve set during the day. You watched as they organized in groups and such Isaac was in Eve\u2019s group as everyone were ok with her but he was the only one that was comfortable with her to the point of turning his back to her without fear. A few more kids his age and a little younger were in bigger groups but there was another in his group, Dana. She always liked Isaac the most out of the Cousins and they were always together at family things. She wasn\u2019t that sure about Eve but was getting closer to her as well. Either way that group was the #1 target with Eve in it. While the kids their age were only armed with at most a set of silver brass knuckles, Eve was the main threat among all of them but then there was the army, Navy, Marine, and Air Force trained people around with guns. You would need to be careful in approaching any of them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright, the person that takes him down gets a prize afterward.\u201d Grandma Lon stated, which further motivated the crowd. Grandma Lon\u2019s prizes were usually something personal and something deeply desired by the person so for her to offer it was not a small matter. They all moved into the woods like what you\u2019d expect a horror movie would look like, with their flash lights and weapons out and ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area was large so they had to spread out a bit in order search the entire thing. You were at a loss at who to take out first so you just went with your instincts and followed Eve\u2019s group. Her\u2019s was the smallest with just three and you needed to get her instinct out of the equation. Besides, on a more primal level you had never actively invoked fear before and this was a perfect opportunity to do it. You stalked them at a distance until they were alone for the most part, enough at least for you to make your move. You turned to mist small enough to fool Eve then brought it around them, careful to avoid the silver pieces Isaac and Dana had on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d Dana said as she walked with them, jerking her head back and forth in the dark forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Dana.\u201d Isaac said as he hadn\u2019t really grasped what was going on yet. \u201cEve is like the best hunter in the world. She can catch anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you Isaac. You\u2019re such a nice boy.\u201d Eve said as she looked around for you. Her hair was on end and from this you could tell she knew you were close but couldn\u2019t locate you. \u201cKeep an eye out though. You never know where he could\u2026\u201d she started but then noticed that area around them was different as if the little bit of scent and fog that the humans couldn\u2019t hope to see was staying away from their silver pieces like they were providing a barrier. \u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d she yelled but you had already hid and attached her own webbing to her legs and in a single pull you tied her up into a ball which then fell onto the ground as lights responded to her shout and your form faded out of the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun kids.\u201d Eve said to which they did. The way you appeared stimulated their imagination as well as Eve\u2019s helplessness at the moment. \u201cSo you got me.\u201d She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot only that, I do recall hearing that I can take you in any way I want and the more\u2026 Vampire like the better. So\u2026\u201d you stated as you picked her up in the wiggling hairy ball she was in, still growing back the hair you burnt off the night before, then growing your fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to\u2026\u201d she stammered as you brought her body up to your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid so, I didn\u2019t really get enough blood from Sarah so for all the power I\u2019m going to use I need a little more. Plus, I\u2019ve never had your blood before. I\u2019m curious to see how it tastes.\u201d You revealed and with that you sank your fangs into her thorax and it made her spasm as you drank her black colored blood. As she wasn\u2019t that big you only got a sip but it was enough for a taste test and she healed up nicely. Meanwhile the others got to the area so you raced into the darkness and appeared next to the cage you were to put them in. You had to admit that her blood wasn\u2019t that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2026 Wow, So that\u2019s what it feels like. H\u2026 how did\u2026 I taste?\u201d she asked as she came down from her version of mountain of desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad actually, a little tangy and understandably not as refreshing as human blood but I don\u2019t think I have to explain about blood taste to you. Overall I wouldn\u2019t mind a longer drink when you get bigger. But for now I have a few little children to round up and bring back here for you to look after.\u201d You answered as you placed her down in the cage and sliced a key strand before backing out and getting on the outside before she could stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to scare them that badly are you?\u201d She asked as she stood up. You didn\u2019t take enough of her blood to prevent basic movement but enough that she didn\u2019t mind resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that bad, but I\u2019ve never really invoked fear before in people. Isn\u2019t that the point of this exercise? To win like a Vampire would in the situation. I highly doubt that actual hunters would use little kids but even so a Vampire would probably not make it too pleasant if they did. But I\u2019m just not use to being anything near sadistic yet so I won\u2019t scare them that much. But with the main obstacle out of the way I can have fun with the rest of them.\u201d you said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell have fun.\u201d She said as she made a quick web on the ceiling corner and rested there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I will.\u201d You stated with a grin then rushed off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You rushed into the woods and followed Isaac and Dana\u2019s scent to another group and watched as they soothed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe just\u2026 I didn\u2019t even see him until he got Eve.\u201d Isaac said with a whimper and Dana was shivering into the other shoulder of Uncle Fred, the more silent but relational Uncle of the Lon side. His group was his Family of Aunt Nancy, Amy, Tom , and Phillip as they kept an eye out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, it\u2019s just a game ok. Eve is ok and in that cage waiting for you.\u201d he said to them. You felt kind of bad that you had scared them that much without even trying. So you decided that you needed to take them there right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing a small rock on the other side of them made Uncle Fred and the others to look that way and put the two in question behind him as he leveled his rifle to the noise. You whispered in the wind so the children took a few steps back in fear then quickly grabbed both of them and teleported back to the cage, using your mist to rid them of the silver items they had and put them on the table next to the cage so the weapons you confiscated didn\u2019t end up in the mud. Then put them in the middle of the cage via your mist so Eve couldn\u2019t bite you as you entered. The whole thing took maybe a second but the initial grab got them to squeak and the end of a scream as they appeared in the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d You said as they looked around and noticed their change of scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 where is Eve?\u201d asked Isaac in a whimper to which you pointed at the approaching spider to which he ran and hugged the large spider without thinking about where he was hugging her. She didn\u2019t mind though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I got to go now so be sure to laugh at the people I bring back.\u201d You said with a smile and wave, then took off again and started watching the group you just left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, he just took them without us even seeing him. Who\u2019s going to be next?\u201d Asked Tom as they all scanned the deep and dark forest for you. However it was getting tiring to run back and forth to the cage every time so you had put two glyphs there on your last trip, one for the table so you could send their weapons there and one for the cage so you could send them there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited as they all looked around and you threw another rock in a direction to which they all snapped to the tree it bounced off before realizing what happened you were able to grab Uncle Fred and send him and His weapons to their spots. You did the same to the increasingly scared and panicking family until only Amy was left. She was the same age as Sarah and although a red head it seemed like that all the kids were becoming more liberal and going on diets, however she had a rather large sweet tooth and you wondered if all that chocolate would affect her taste. You assumed Luke was tomorrow\u2019s meal so she was free to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026 where are you?\u201d she whimpered to which you decided to play with her a little. You rushed passed and sent all her weapons and sliver items to the table. She knew you were there and that you had saved her for last so she screamed and started running, alerting the others of what was going on. You watched from a tree as the lights from other groups snapped to the sound of her scream. \u201cNo, no, no,\u2026 I can\u2019t stand for all this suspense.\u201d She whimpered as she slunk down the length of a tree in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll be straight forward. I plan to drink from you.\u201d you said from the darkness that got her heart to race even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You already had your meal.\u201d She said in a scared tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, but I need more and was always wondering how you tasted with all that chocolate you eat. Sarah tasted better than the other two, was that because she was skinnier, younger, or something else? Either way, they told me to hunt and that is what I\u2019m doing\u2026 my prey.\u201d You said, the last part as you dropped in front of her and slowly stalked your way to her. Normally you would use your attractant to make her more calm and willing but you wanted to know what it was like to feed on her and more importantly on someone scared rather than aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d She begged as you bent down over her and approached her neck with your fangs showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I want to.\u201d You said as you pulled her away from the tree and sank your fangs in and started to drink. You were surprised that she tasted just as sweet as you thought she would for the amount of candy and chocolate she ate. Humans were such an interesting meal, each one tastes different and insanely delicious. She gave a scream as you did this but the heightened fright the plunge into high arousal rendered her unconscious. You drank enough but not as much as the others as you didn\u2019t need it. Then licked the rest up so there was no evidence then teleported her to the cage with the rest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Most of the exercise was going as expected as you tracked, found, stalked, and took out each group. They had mostly separated in groups according to immediate family, including yours. You made a trip back to the cage once as you dropped off some of the smaller kids and noticed some of the weapons on the table were gone. It only took you a moment to find and turn to mist; taking them away again and locking the cage door. Something you should\u2019ve done before as no one said anything about them having to stay in the cage. Finally you reached the last group. You had actually tried them before but Uncle Rusty was an excellent shot with the pistol he had and was able to get a hit on you. You of course healed right away, well as soon as you took the silver bullet out but still you healed while taking some of the other groups out. He also had found one of Eve\u2019s large trapping spots so he and his immediate Family could be protected, his family being; Aunt Karen, Mitchell, and Teresa. They were the family from the Lon side that lived in California and were naturally in the best shape, probably because Uncle Rusty was the oldest on that side, Aunt Karen didn\u2019t cook or serve as large of portions as the main family did, and of course California near beaches motivates the kids to be\u2026 well beach worthy and they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you got caught.\u201d Mitchell teased Teresa as she hung from one of Eve\u2019s large webs that she put on ground level in attempts to catch you. She was trapped with her arms out and legs partially stretched apart, completely helpless and the others weren\u2019t about to get stuck themselves but they were sticking around to protect her from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shut it.\u201d Teresa said back as her prized straight and golden hair was also stuck in the sticky web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you be silent. Caleb might be our family but he is also a Vampire. We pushed him away before because we were able to locate him. But we can\u2019t with you all making so much noise and not paying attention.\u201d Uncle Rusty said as he looked around. There was no way that you were going to be able to sneak up on them as they had a rather good line of sight. Two of them looking at the tree tops and the other two looking at ground level. From their minds you could tell they were looking for motion first and shape later, smart for the situation. You had already made fools of even Papa as he was looking for you rather than the effects your movement would have on things around him. That and the rest of them had long rifles to swing around while Uncle Rusty had his pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you got an idea as you looked at Eve\u2019s traps around the place. It hadn\u2019t failed yet to cause a distraction and get the last one in the rear for your catch. The only thing was that the trap you were going to set off would put Teresa in the rear and you didn\u2019t have enough time to take her and vanish before your Uncle would wheel around and shoot you. The next one would be Aunt Karen, yeah that would work. Sure Teresa would see you but she couldn\u2019t do anything about it other than scream, which would only help scare the other two. With that decided you spit what you had now come to call a \u2018saliva needle\u2019 at the trap in question to which it activated and mad a log with webbing on it crash to the ground. If you had stepped in that trap it would\u2019ve effectively knocked you out cold with the weight and sudden speed that Eve had put on it. But it did more than enough to wheel everyone to what happened and you made your move for Aunt Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Teresa screamed but it was too late as you rushed passed Teresa, grabbed your Aunt, and took off like a shadow with the whole thing done in maybe 3 seconds. Enough for them to see it but not slow enough for them to do more than that. You sent her to the rest and her weapons separate from her then focused again on the 3 remaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear laughter as she arrived. At first there were only screams but now when someone was deposited in the cage they laughed at how scared the person was. In Auntie Karen\u2019s case you had first heard her scream almost louder than Aunt Anna but were very scared. Her scream was replaced with laughter. However the laughter was switched by a type of physic barrier that made it sound like the captured prisoners were being tortured or something but far enough away for them to think something bad was happening. It wore on their nerves nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw them panicking a little and so you waited and got Mitchell as well as he ran off into the woods. Now it was just the two of them. You stalked them and whispered into the wind in order to freak them out even more, putting emotional attractants in the air to cause fear. You then was about to make a move when you stepped on a trap and had to dodge a webbed spike but you couldn\u2019t dodge the few bullets that were fired at you while in the air. You knew now why Vampires were hit by silver bullets if they were faster than the bullets\u2019 path, well in the past at least. As the silver gets closer the effect of weakening you becomes stronger and you become slower, not slow enough even with them inside you to keep from running away but slow enough to prevent you from dodging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d you yelled as you felt 2 out of the 4 shots rip into your torso as you vanished into the night. It was the second time he was able to put a bullet into you, and this time it was two bullets, one in your stomach and one close to your heart. An inch to the left and he would\u2019ve pulled a huge upset in this game. But as he reloaded his revolver of a pistol you raced from behind him and dove to send him and his gun to their proper places. You were glad he only brought that as you didn\u2019t have enough strength at the moment with the bullets deep in your chest and stomach to search him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2026 wait are you ok?\u201d Teresa asked as she saw you lean against one of the trees facing her and panting like she hadn\u2019t seen or imagined you could. She saw the blood flowing out of the bullet wounds as you breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of. These things don\u2019t tickle you know.\u201d You answered as you took a deep breath and dug the first one out of your stomach and caused blood to squirt out of the wound until you did it again to the other one and threw the bullets away from you. You then let out your breath in a severe panting as she saw your body heal its wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that even close?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredibly close, Uncle Rusty was the only one tonight to put a bullet in me or stop me at all. Not only that but he did it 3 times and if this one would\u2019ve been a single inch to the left you two would\u2019ve won and I would be pretty dead until someone took the bullet out. At the very least I would\u2019ve been weak enough for him to finish off or you could\u2019ve if you didn\u2019t get yourself caught in Eve\u2019s web.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you won huh?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the last one but I need a drink.\u201d You said as you stood up, a little wobbly and trudged over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you can\u2019t just finish it already?\u201d she asked as if trying to change your mind. You were now leaning on her body with one arm over her shoulder and around her back while the other was barely able to lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t even have enough strength to make you afraid or aroused.\u201d You stated as you hung from her a little, to rest before drinking so you had more control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAroused?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is usually only 2 ways that a vampire gets their\u2026 prey to pump blood faster. Usually I arouse the person as it is the nicer of the two. But I tried the fear one on Amy earlier and it works really good to. But I don\u2019t have enough energy to do either so\u2026 now I just\u2026 need.\u201d You said and was going to finish but needed blood more so you lazily sank your fangs into her neck and as her blood flowed to nourish your body you became stronger but only took enough to get back basic power settings. After all, you still had all night to hunt them after they return. That and it didn\u2019t feel as good without it gushing like when you really get their blood flowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh! Please don\u2019t stop.\u201d She pleaded as you retracted and pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou taste great Teresa but I think I prefer it if I can really get you excited one way or another. If I had to describe the difference I would say that it\u2019s like a ripe and juicy grape verses a partially drained and warm one. So maybe later if you think you can handle it than come out here instead of going to bed. Of course you\u2019d have to sneak out but then again I wouldn\u2019t mind the free meal.\u201d You answered and she seemed to understand the reason.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perks of being 5 years older than you meant she was mature, smarter, and wiser than you are, like most of the people around. The only difference between her and them was she was older than you and didn\u2019t start out hating your guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well I just said I could, not that I would. I COULD also feed on the family in the bathroom or shower as you wouldn\u2019t be expecting it but I don\u2019t think I will. I mean I still have my dignity and pride and I prefer my meals aware of what is happening.\u201d You agreed and explained to which you touched the webs and shot an electrical current through them, effectively disintegrating them and she fell to into your arms to which you transported her into the cage and you just outside of it, going over to a bench just outside the cage to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there you are, having a little fun before you finished?\u201d asked Luke from the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf your definition of fun is pulling out silver bullets out of my chest then yes.\u201d You responded as you unlocked the door from where you sat and it swung open. They all filed out and stood around you, now able to see the blood stained clothes and bullet holes in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s start with the evaluation of each other so we can get some sleep.\u201d Grandma Konel said. \u201cI have to say that you did a good job completing the objective and scaring the living daylights out of most of us. You used abilities we never knew you had and I truthfully expected no less from our first time trying to hunt you. But it does look like you have a weakness in dodging silver bullets.\u201d She stated as she gestured to your ripped shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuestion, if 3 bullets to the chest doesn\u2019t kill you than what does?\u201d asked David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did have to drink some blood to recover the power I lost from the wounds. And like I was telling Teresa, as I was pulling the last 2 out, if this one would\u2019ve been one inch to the left then Uncle Rusty would\u2019ve gotten the win. It just barely missed my heart and I was lucky that Teresa was trapped by one of Eve\u2019s webs or she could\u2019ve finished me as well. I had barely enough strength to reach her and suck her blood, I definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to run or fight if she wasn\u2019t trapped like she was.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk so now your turn to evaluate us.\u201d stated Grandma Konel after they all looked at Uncle Rusty with surprise that he was the one that almost won the whole thing and buried all 3 of the bullets that actually made it into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, first is the grouping. You all chose groups by popularity and relation instead of what would actually catch me. I guess kids as young as Isaac and Dana wouldn\u2019t be thrown into hunting parties in real life but you could\u2019ve used them as extra eyes in another group. Even so, most groups were well communicated but not diverse enough to cause any kind of challenge. Next is the equipment; unless you\u2019re going to shoot me from long range than a rifle\u2019s long barrel and slower rank of motion is why I was able to avoid them being fired anywhere near me. Uncle Rusty\u2019s pistol and his ability to use it made it difficult to approach and it took more than 3 attempts before I figured out a way to grab someone, and that was only when Teresa got caught. Lastly, you are all still scared of Eve. She is the biggest obstacle for me to figure around because she can sense me many times better than any human. Her many eyes can see my mist enough to warn you, her sense of smell can perceive when I am getting closer, her hearing has better tracking, and I could go on. She is the only other predator around and on your side, yet you distanced her from helping in any way that made sense. She is the most powerful asset among you, so use her and help her.\u201d You lectured to which they all nodded and looked over at the bashful dog sized spider that was moving about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never thought I would be mad that I didn\u2019t shoot you.\u201d Papa said with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was fun, hard, but fun.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d Grandpa Konel said then they all began retrieving their stuff. \u201cOk, we all have 15 minutes to get where we need to be. After that we are back at protecting and hunting while we humans\u2026 and spiders try to get some sleep. We got a hungry Vampire out here so let\u2019s not slack off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell said, I am rather hungry. Hope I can catch one of you.\u201d you said then disappeared from view after a smirk that got some of them that you had scared especially bad, like Amy, to get worried and hurry themselves up. Others laughed and yet others felt a slight pull to just let you do it, unknowingly it was more of the your attractant effects than their own reason and desire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were slightly glad that they didn\u2019t come out to you. This early in your training it would only serve to complicate things on what was supposed to be a challenging experience. You waited about a half hour then observed them as they walked around the cabin. Mainly you kept an especially sharp eye on Eve as she scuttled around but she was still slightly shunned by those that had a higher phobia of her than you, at the moment. You decided to fix that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve, please clean up after yourself. You can\u2019t just leave your webs everywhere.\u201d Josi said, another of the girls in the same age bracket as Sarah from Uncle Paul\u2019s family. They had been more difficult to take out that night but not hard enough to be any kind of challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I thought it would be good so Caleb couldn\u2019t just walk around when he snuck in here.\u201d Eve asked as she stopped at her spot on the ceiling to address the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust leave them out of my room.\u201d she retorted then slammed her door. She had a few silver charms in her room but nothing that hindering to you. Most of the rest had asked Eve to secure their room and windows but she was more phobic that most. Some of the smarter people had brought silver nets that they put over the entrances of their room. It was a good idea but you could just use the cracks in the floor to come in if you really wanted, while in mist form. You watched as each went to bed as did Eve, although her legs were spread so she could feel the webs she placed as silent alarms for her use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosi was the only one that didn\u2019t do anything to her window and even forgot to lock it. You thought that maybe she did it on purpose but a quick intrusion into her mind told you otherwise. You didn\u2019t even need to change to mist to get into her room after she was fast asleep. You looked around and noticed the door locked as she seemed more worried about someone just walking in than what you were capable of doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d You heard her whisper as she talked in her sleep. It was then you got an idea to help both her understand and Eve with her acceptance issue. You used a combination of mist and physic power to enter her mind more literally and input yourself into her dream. You found yourself stalking her in the woods while she ran, very similar to how you caught her the first time but less severe. Now you couldn\u2019t have that if you wanted her to fear you more than Eve, well during this family vacation of sorts anyway. However, unlike in real life you didn\u2019t have to stop at letting her live. You weren\u2019t actually drinking her blood so you could take this a ways further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going Josi?\u201d you said, again in her dream and you had to use your mist outside her body to keep her from talking or, for what you had planned, screaming in her sleep. She continued to run toward the cabin but no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere does it look like? You aren\u2019t allowed in the main area of the Cabin.\u201d She said as she reached the door that led into the main area where you weren\u2019t allowed, again you were in her dreams so you could go and do anything. To that effect you altered the dream in a way you usually didn\u2019t want but you were going for scaring her. So when she got in she slipped in the dark on something that coated the floor. \u201cHey, turn on the lights\u201d she demanded and at the eerie silence she went to the light switches herself and switched them on, slipping on whatever fluid covered the floor. As the lights flickered on her eyes widened in horror. \u201cNo\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fluid she was slipping on was blood and she found all of the family scattered around the place with what was left of their blood dripping out and covering the floor in areas while some hung from the ceiling by their insides in a way that only you could pull off. She slipped and slid over to her immediate family than to Grandpa and Grandma of both sides. Every one of them had one thing in common, other than they were dead, which was fang marks on their necks. You even put the extra added recognition that you were the only one that could do this, which was technically correct as this was a dream and you were the only one that could mess with it. However, as you have explained before, that you couldn\u2019t leave fang marks even if you wanted to but you just left that part out and let her stumble and slip around the blood covered room. Realistically the amount of blood on the ground was over 4 times the amount that they could possess, even if you decided to do it for real and not drink any. But realistic things are rarely supported in dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening\u201d she said as she pinched herself to wake up but you weren\u2019t allowing it. You needed her to lose her phobia of at least Eve and that meant she needed to take the threat you posed seriously. She slipped and did a face plant into her younger sister\u2019s body, which made her scream in horror that she couldn\u2019t wake up and therefore accepting this as real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have a full belly of blood and a room full of dry husks that say otherwise.\u201d You said as you walked in the door that she left open. You added some blood on your clothes and around your mouth for good measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?... How could you do this?\u201d She asked in horror as you came closer and she got up and started backing away from you, tripping on the odd body or excess of blood but never taking her eyes off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a foolish question. I did this because I was hungry and I thought it would be fun. Ever sense you all sent Eve away I was waiting for this moment when all of you let down your guard and leave your silver weapons. Without her here you all don\u2019t stand a chance, so thank you Josi, you were the one that drove her away and made all this possible.\u201d You answered as you pressed her against the wall she had backed into. You ripped off her top and grabbed her by the throat while you explored her body a little bit, she was family so you didn\u2019t go too far but just enough to allow her imagination to take over before you came back up to her neck and horror stricken face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t do this. I thought you loved us.\u201d She whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoved your taste? Definitely and I have yet to taste you.\u201d you said back as you held her rather roughly as you kinked her neck like her imagination dictated so her neck was exposes and you stated to lick it sadistically. \u201cMmm, I just knew it was right to save you for last.\u201d You finally said as you dug into her neck, stimulating pain instead of arousal. Of course you weren\u2019t actually drinking but you played along and let the dream version of you rip her throat out as you dug in and slowly drank her dry. Her eyes still worked as she died in her dream. \u201cMmm, perfect timing.\u201d Your voice said as she woke with you on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect as she was so scared that her body was actually sweating so much it had soaked her sheets and clothes. Her heartbeat was so high that you almost had to drink to calm her down from a possible heart attack. However in this close position it very closely resembled what she had last seen in her dream but you had your had over her mouth and sank your fangs into her tender neck and very shortly silenced her as she fell unconscious in a faint, not the result of you drinking too much. To be fair you only drank a little and enough so you didn\u2019t have to visit anyone else that night. However the last part of your plan came about as Eve heard your voice and barged in to the room. You left a little blood on her neck but dashed out the open and exposed window. Everyone around was up and moving about at this point and you smiled as Josi woke and clung to a shocked Eve, saying how sorry she was and what not. With that done and a full belly of blood you went to get a little rest yourself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two months of training was very structured to the point where there wasn\u2019t a lot of variety, other than learning to deal with new things with new abilities. You all learned so much, for starters you could harden you skin rather than turn it to mist in order to fend off bullets. You could use your mist to filter and drink blood that was on the ground for a variety of reasons; food, tracking, information,\u2026 More importantly you increased your power by almost 4 times, including how much blood you needed to power your abilities when used. You made a lot of progress in your Vampire mindset as well. You now had no hesitation to drink from anyone but an insane amount of control to drink just a little from anyone or no one. However the others also improved. Eve grew to a little larger than a large dog but gained, along with you, a lot of battle and hunting experience. She also became a more than valued member of the family with no one shunning her anymore, while they deeply respected what you could do but didn\u2019t fear you for it. A better way to put it was that they were glad that you were on their side at the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the summer it had been accepted that the woods were an extremely dangerous place. You could now us a more dispersed mist without strain like Eve uses her webs. You couldn\u2019t control anything with the stuff but you could cover all 500 acres of the land with the fog like mist as a sort of surveillance and illusion based ability. No one that was in their right mind went into the woods, especially at night while you were out there. Only at dawn or dusk was it safe to approach as you came out for day training or event instructions. They all knew about your dream entering ability as you used it sometimes to help them think on mistakes, other times to seduce them into going into the woods for a free meal, while other times scaring the crap out them if they needed the kick in the butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end they all finally got it and were light sleepers and highly trained in hunting and/or fighting you. Their teamwork had improved and even Isaac and Dana had been able to score a few hits on you, although with them you let them get more shots in then the others, if for no other reason than to show you still were watching out for them and making sure they felt part of the group. When you were caught you were tortured to the point where a few times you wondered if they loved you or not. But at dawn or dusk they released you and the thought was just an afterthought. But now you all met with your bags packed and ready to leave. Those that drove had their cars packed and the Cabin locked down. Some had to be back by the beginning of August so that was when this fun little vacation ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you all think?\u201d asked Grandpa Lon as you all gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was hard but worth it. As much as it stunk at times I can\u2019t wait to do it again.\u201d You answered as people crowded around each other. Even if you were dangerous they had all been fed on at this point and knew that, while you could make it a horrible experience, it was more enjoyable then dreadful. You and Eve were now the most popular people in the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise, I\u2019m going to be thinking all year how to get Caleb next year\u2026 are we doing this next year?\u201d Eve asked as she thought it might be a onetime thing, but hoped not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it was a good bonding experience. It would be well worth the effort to come back every year for this. We have all year to study and try to think of ways to kill you.\u201d Uncle Rusty said as he smiled at you, as did many others with similar ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus by next year, Eve will be like huge and can really make Caleb work for it.\u201d Aunt Penny stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough\u2026 going back to normal living will be a pain.\u201d Jordan said, she being one of Uncle Jim\u2019s daughters around your age. Everyone looked at her as if to ask what she meant. \u201cWell after keeping one eye open all the time, even when sleeping, for Caleb to come around. If nothing else I\u2019m going to be double checking shadows by habit alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, the transition will be hard. Going from fending off a Vampire to homework, sports, and video games.\u201d Jacob, Jordan\u2019s brother, agreed with the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could always come around randomly if you want.\u201d You offered with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the offer but I think 10 months of peace and quiet will do me just fine.\u201d Uncle Matt said to the other\u2019s laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all knew that while you weren\u2019t restricted like you use to, you still couldn\u2019t hunt like you did for the last 2 months. If someone let you drink from them that was one thing but you couldn\u2019t force your way once you were suppose to be living as a human. Although\u2026 they did say they would be calling you if they got stuck in a ditch or got kidnapped. To be honest, who really cared about people kidnapping them when they could call you to save them? Although, in the back of their mind, they would keep an eye out for other \u2018freaks\u2019 in their life that wouldn\u2019t be as respectful, gentle, kind, and\u2026 human as you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, who\u2019s first?\u201d you asked as you were about to teleport each family back to their homes, even the ones that lived far away like Uncle Rusty and his family to California and so on. They all got in line with the grandparents at the back and your family last. No one was shunning anyone anymore, including you and Eve. Your abnormal abilities had become so expected that it was no longer shocking when you did something they hadn\u2019t seen you do before. All in all this was a great summer and you looked forward to next year, even if it would be harder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last month of Summer break was used as an actual BREAK. Eve had requested at least a week where she and you could hang out for her and your R&amp;R. She had suspected but you told her about the times you entered people\u2019s dreams and scared the fear of her out of them. She still had been wondering how Josi in particular had changed from such hate and loathing toward her to deep love and admiration in the span of a few hours. She thanked you deeply for it then you both just hung out for a very long time doing nothing in particular, just sitting with each other and letting her cocoon you at night once more. After trying to kill each other all summer it was nice just to relax. Others came over more often as well and Eve was afforded the luxury of being unrestrained around the house, well minus only making large webs in your room. Mom still had to keep the house clean but she didn\u2019t mind a few to catch some pesky mice or whatever. Weird thing was though that you hadn\u2019t seen Kelsey all summer. You had told her that you would be gone for most of it but when you went to her usual hang outs you couldn\u2019t find her. So you just waited for school to start. It was hard to take school seriously when you had done so much over the summer. But you really didn\u2019t notice how much physically you changed until you walked in the front doors and was greeted by a girl you almost didn\u2019t recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb!\u201d blared Kelsey\u2019s voice from the young girl the threw herself on you, hugging around your neck and swinging before coming to a stop. \u201cWow, you\u2019re so big.\u201d She said and it was then you noticed yourself. You were now about 5\u20195\u2019\u2019, and for a 7th grade student it wasn\u2019t small at all. That and your body mass almost doubled. You were still lean but, unlike last year, you didn\u2019t start out as a scrawny kid with a new gift. You had trained all summer and it showed on your new body. But then you looked at her, she was way different and was turning every head in the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so, but look at you\u2026 I guess what my Mom said was right huh?\u201d you complimented as she blushed while you two parted. \u201cDo you mind if I take a look?\u201d you asked. Usually guys just check out girls wither they got permission or not, and especially if they were too shy to do anything but look. However you had told her that when she finally did \u2018bloom\u2019 that you wouldn\u2019t until you asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she nodded and backed up a little then did a little but slow turn so you could take her all in. Her now slightly longer wavy but still silky black hair draped over her shoulders a little and almost made it to the top of her well form breasts. For them, if you couldn\u2019t see deeper, it looked like they were fake due not only by their sudden size but desired shape from those that went in for that kind of thing. But no they were real and they balanced nicely with her butt, both were big but not so much to attract only people that like large butts and breasts. She still had a highly athletic but slim figure and nothing was to out of proportion. Lastly her eyes shined a radiant blue that were more catching than before. This part hit you the most as her height and other small details were registered but usually eyes didn\u2019t change unless\u2026 Yes, now that you were thinking about it you could smell that her scent had changed slightly as well. She still smelled like Kelsey but now had the tint of something else that wasn\u2019t there before. She was definitely hiding something like you were but since she never hassled you about revealing anything you just let it slide for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 what do you think?\u201d she asked in a shy but cute posture. Again you were slightly clueless when it came to girls flirting with you and apparently the ignorant flaw of yours was one of the things she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think both of us will be having a harder time this year keeping our promise.\u201d You answered, referring to the promise of being good friends no matter how popular each other get. She smiled and hugged into you but you both were shoved out of the way by the Vampire Clan, or the school\u2019s faction of it. This new trend had actually become a slight problem as it had spread to other schools, even across the country and the ones that graduated started gangs. Figured that their headquarters for this gang was in Milwaukee where you lived. You were just glad that they resided downtown while you were in one of the counties just outside of it. Your family were slightly put off by this as were you, understandably so. It had been a new topic recently that kids that graduated while in those clans went straight to the Vampire Clan gang and fanged murders had been popping up more recently. This made each clan become more feared in the school they were in. Even teachers sometimes catered to their wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a bunch of creeps.\u201d Kelsey said once they were out of earshot. Not that she was afraid of them with you nearby but, even if she didn\u2019t know you were a real Vampire, but she didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble and neither did you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo question there. Hey, you know they are probably going to like you to right?\u201d you asked as you both started off toward class. With 7th grade came the full implementation of separate teachers for each class. You two tried hard to get each class with the other and got a high majority of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo being popular will have an ugly side.\u201d she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell our parents always said, \u2018the grass is always greener on the other side\u2019.\u201d You quoted like a teacher that got her to giggle and laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me, it\u2019s still cool that I come over after school right?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely, Mom and Papa would like to see you not to mention Eve.\u201d You answered which shot a light bulb of sorts on in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s right, your pet spider. How big is she now?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019ll see her later but she is near this tall when standing.\u201d You said as you lowered your hand only a little to show her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat big!?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cShe has to be the world\u2019s biggest spider, either that or there is a whole army of them somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know too much about that but she is just as friendly as before. The family even likes here enough now to let her around the house instead of just my room. Scared the crap out of the pizza guy though.\u201d You joked and she laughed at the thought of a scrawny pizza boy being greeted by a 3 foot tall spider like Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see her then.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she\u2019s always like you so she\u2019ll be excited as well. Hope you don\u2019t mind her swarming you when you walk in, it has been all summer you know.\u201d You said which made both of you laugh at the prospect as you started your day in class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were right, the Vampire Clan was becoming bolder and with Kelsey\u2019s sudden attractive body they more than once demanded she come to them. More accurately they wanted her body more than anything, which disgusted her with more fire in her new eyes than you had seen before. Luckily you were there most of the time to talk them down, being that you were bigger than most of them and even when they ganged up on you and you didn\u2019t use any powers they were still no match for you. Not that many of them tried. They were just humans, no matter the efforts to become something else, and knew that you impressive physic was more than just for show. However you weren\u2019t always there and this was one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are tired of waiting little morsel. Come with us now.\u201d Said a boy that was in high school and had been gawking at her for a while now. He was too weak among his own \u2018clan\u2019 to challenge them but he was more than big enough to take on any middle school kid, well except you or Matt from last year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve had it with all you Vampires.\u201d As you walked toward them the phrase hit you a little but knew she didn\u2019t mean it to you and definitely not if she knew but it still hurt coming from her. \u201cTouch me again and I\u2019ll wipe the floor with you.\u201d she threatened. It was impossible to know if she was bluffing without reading her mind, which you had restrain yourself not to do. Unlike Up North, you couldn\u2019t just use your powers around here and that included mind reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey, are you ok?\u201d you asked but she did something that surprised what you thought she could and would do. She must\u2019ve been in a sever fight mode but when you put your hand on her shoulder she turned and struck you with a blow that sent you into the wall a foot behind you. You immediately could tell she was holding back on reflex alone but the punch was still strong enough to cause a few cracks in the wall as you bounced off it and hit the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were no stranger to high impact shot from the traps Eve made Up North that actually hit. One time she had made a spiked set of trees slam together with you in the middle, that one hurt a lot. This shot she gave you wasn\u2019t much on your list but for a human it would be enough to break at least a few bones. Luckily enough the Vampire wannabe picked a dark alley of the school, typical, to ambush her so no one but you and him saw this in different ways. He ran as he saw that he could be next as Kelsey was suddenly shocked out of whatever fight mode she was in by what she did. You didn\u2019t think you needed the hardened skin you developed that summer so you had left yourself vulnerable and as such she effectively knocked you out. You kept your body so weak so that when the Vampire Clan issued a surprise attack they could get you on occasion. Having a metal pole hit you and it break instead of you would only bring more eyes to you. Even in this state you were stronger than a normal human but not stronger, apparently, than whatever she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb! No, I\u2019m sorry. Caleb!\u201d she yelled as you faded. This wasn\u2019t the first time you passed out or got knocked out so you just waited. Unlike humans, you didn\u2019t fall into a sleep of sorts when passed out for whatever reason. In fact, the one thing you wished you had that you lost with this whole Vampire thing was the ability to dream. You thought at first that it was just because of how short of rest you needed that a dream just couldn\u2019t take its time to form but the few instances you were unconscious threw that out the window as you were out each time for about 6 hours or so. This time was no different, you could hear and partially sense what was going on around you but your sight was obviously gone with your eyes closed as was you interactivity to the outside world until you awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard yelling and then felt movement. You couldn\u2019t tell how fast you were going but it was faster than any person could carry you so you assumed it was a car or something. Light and dark hit your eyelids as you waited for your brain to heal and allow you to wake. Then you felt warmth and not just a warm room or basking in the sun warm. It was more like inside your body, accelerating your healing and what not. You began to hear voices more concrete than before and knew immediately that they weren\u2019t your parents or anyone you knew, well accept one; Kelsey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find out in a minute, he\u2019s coming around.\u201d A old male voice said as you regained consciousness and opened your eyes to see Kelsey and what you assumed to be her family. But you recognized them as her family because they looked like her as in what they were. You had a feeling they were different and now you knew for sure as you looked at them. Their form being\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author\u2019s note)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of suspense and additional options I will present the reader/writer with 2 choices without any designation on what they are. I only ask that if you write for a different choice of you preference that you leave room for a different preference if someone wants something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is very few rules as to what she can be and as this is a fiction story I don\u2019t care if you make Kelsey and her family all, part, or not all whatever she is. Like my version of a vampire, you can even change the basis on which your desired \u2018freak/monster\u2019 type is portrayed. Please keep this in mind as you read. Just because someone is writing a type of monster different than a traditional set means only one thing, that they are writing and expanding a FICTIONAL story. We KNOW that it isn\u2019t what normal ones do or are capable of doing so don\u2019t mess with them or me about it if you didn\u2019t write some yourself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly the creature type has 2 rules that it must abide by. 1) it can\u2019t be a Vampire. 2) The main character is or can be more powerful than whatever you choose. Perhaps not now as a 13 year old Vampire but the Monster/freak type mustn\u2019t be something that is ALWAYS higher than the main character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, end of author\u2019s note.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As your eyes opened you looked around the room. You were in a bed similar to the ones in a hospital with the back raised slightly so you could partially sit up without a strain. Next you were in a room that was anything but a hospital room. It had thick bars on the windows and even thicker ones bracing an obviously thick metal door that sealed the room. It was like being in a dungeon with a slightly comfortable but firm hospital bed. You glanced at the people in the room to find only a few of them were human. There was an old man with a cane next to Kelsey, who was directly to the left of you. At the foot of your bed was a butler looking human with a dazed but concentrated look in his eye, similar to when you control someone\u2019s mind and have them do something for you. Lastly to your right was a woman that was like a mirror image of Kelsey but older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest thing that separated the two of them from the other two, other than being female, was the parts growing from them. Both of their eyes were now not glowing but more radiant than traditional human eyes they usually had out. From their backs they had a set of black furry wings that were like a velvet covered version of bat or dragon wings. The Tail from their backsides whipped around and was the same color and equally as velvet looking as their wings with a spade end to it that looked sharp enough to cut brick. You could tell that their red nails could come out and be like very long and sharp claws, similar to yours but maybe a foot longer at full length. Finally it looked like all their female features were enhanced but not overly so; for instance their hair was always good looking but now it looked like angel hair\u2026 if an angel had black flowing hair. So it wasn\u2019t a huge difference but more than enough to enhance the allure of their bodies to any man that would look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, you\u2019re awake.\u201d Kelsey said as you looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah, well I think I am. Assuming this isn\u2019t some kind of dream.\u201d You said as you took another look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence human!\u201d said the woman to your right as she grew a single nail and held it to the underside of your chin. One move and she could skewer your head from bottom to top. \u201cHow dare you speak to a Succubus so casually!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, no! Please just let him recover.\u201d Kelsey pleaded. You put on a slightly scared face just to make Kelsey\u2019s mother feel like she was making her point. Besides, you had just found out what she was; a Succubus. Your family was right, there really was other \u2018freaks\u2019 like you out there. Although you could tell these two weren\u2019t even an eighth to your level you were still just a human to them. You preferred it that way. Sure you would love to reveal to Kelsey what you are but this little situation had you currently in a mode of caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey, your powers have awoken and you still don\u2019t understand their place. You brought him here after you couldn\u2019t control yourself at school. But I do admit, even I understand why. He is a wonderful example of man meat for such a young boy.\u201d She said as she traced her nail down your throat and slightly dug into your chest as she raked it down your body and stopping just above the navel. Then she brought her nail to her mouth and licked the blood off with a talented and longer tongue than you would guess she had from her slightly slender face and mouth. \u201cNot very tasty though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Kelsey stated as she placed her hand on your bleeding and quivering chest. A light came from your new wound to which it healed almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now my two girls. Debora, you fell for me remember so shouldn\u2019t she be afforded a human to play with?\u201d Asked the old man beside Kelsey. \u201cKelsey, I hope you understand what you\u2019ve done. Now that he has seen you and your mother, he can\u2019t just leave. You know this and you still brought him here. If he must die than it is only your hands.\u201d He said to her and she bowed her head in part shame. Then the Man turned to you with an intense gaze. \u201cAs for you young man. I hope you understand what hot water you\u2019re in. There is a solemn rule about their kind. A Succubus can have as many slaves as they wish but only one mate. That mate must be human and they are only allowed one child per 100 years and since they can only live to be 200 they tend to only have one child. If an outsider such as yourself sees them like they are now, in their true forms, then that human must be silenced one way or another. Normally they are killed and disposed of but Kelsey brought you here. So you are quite literally on the edge of death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, you\u2019re right my darling.\u201d Kelsey\u2019s mother said as she gazed lovingly at him over the bed. \u201cBut he stays here until you decide Kelsey. You either kill him, mate him, or seduce him; or I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes mother.\u201d Kelsey said, still bowing in guilt and shame for her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharles, the door.\u201d She commanded as the butler looking human, that must\u2019ve been one of the \u2018seduced\u2019 she just spoke of, heaved open the door for her as she helped the old man out then closed the door with Kelsey still inside with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I finally meet your parents, strange but the look loving enough in their own special way.\u201d You stated in a carefree tone to try and get Kelsey to smile in which you failed horribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you be this calm? I just\u2026 any way we do this your life is over. I did this to you.\u201d she whimpered as tears began falling from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I see it is this. Either I am in a really involved dream or you just made a mistake. We all make mistakes and you being a\u2026 Succubus?\u201d you asked to see if you were getting it right to which she nodded slightly as she looked at you to continue.  \u201cWell, being a Succubus must mean that your mistakes are just bigger than most. I\u2019m not going to hate you for it. Me waking up at all means something right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m too young to seduce you or mate with you. I just got my powers so I could just as easily kill you while trying. That means I only have one option left.\u201d She said as she grew some nails and looked at them but then shook her head and retracted them. \u201cBut I just can\u2019t kill you. We\u2019re friends and you are the first to be my friend. Oh why did you have to interrupt my fight?\u201d she whined as the weight of her impending decisions came down to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I just touched your shoulder in an attempt to see how you were doing. I didn\u2019t know you were strong enough without my help. I mean sure you have always been strong at school but I obviously didn\u2019t know you could crush me into a wall.\u201d you defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you should\u2019ve known! Here\u2019s proof!\u201d she yelled back and dug her nails into your leg, impaling it but not hitting anything that would matter as far as bleeding out. She was obviously too emotional right now to think straight. \u201cI hate you! Just stay here and die!\u201d she screamed as she ran toward the door crying, opened it, slammed it shut to which you heard some bolts and what not lock the door into place. You could see the trail of blood and what was dripping from your leg. You quickly sealed it off with a strip of bandage that was lying next to the bed. You didn\u2019t think exposing yourself would be good right now even with her saying and doing such things. She was just upset and in the middle of a Succubus puberty, which might be a little more complicated than a normal girls which you far from began to understand. So all you did was stop the bleeding and wrap it up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So the only option for a favorable outcome was to stay for a while. But you needed to let your parents know so you reached out with your mind and found them at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d you said as if asking if they could hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, where are you? You didn\u2019t come home from school yet and we were getting worried.\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell something happened at school.\u201d You said and felt their minds start to worry. \u201cNothing bad on my end but you all were right about there being more than just me as a \u2018freak\u2019 out there. I was stopping a fight when this girl knocked me out. You know how I make myself weak for appearances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s like that. Are you ok?\u201d Papa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore or less. They don\u2019t know about me being a Vampire but I might have to tell them to avoid killing them. The girl panicked when she hit me instead of the bully picking on her and brought me to her house. However she has a mother as the same thing she is and a very strict rule on what happens to keep their secret safe.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of \u2018freak\u2019 is she?\u201d Papa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t spread this as I don\u2019t want whatever they decide to do effecting you but she and her mother are both a Succubus. That means she has a human father and, from what I\u2019ve seen, seduced servants.\u201d You revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Succubus? What is your current situation?\u201d Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they treated me for being unconscious and knocked out by the girl, not knowing I\u2019m a Vampire and all. But otherwise I\u2019m in some kind of dungeon with really thick doors and bars around the windows, not a problem if I wanted to leave but then again I\u2019m not sure how many people know I\u2019m here so if I miss one on the way out they will make a connection that you two know and come after you, I\u2019d rather not have that.\u201d You started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither would we.\u201d Papa stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever the situation is a little complicated. Apparently there is only 3 things to do when a human sees them in their true forms; mate, seduce, or kill the human. It is up to the girl and she is\u2026 well she physically can\u2019t do the first to options yet. But she doesn\u2019t want to just kill me either. She just stormed out after ripping my leg up pretty good. She\u2019s all emotional about it, which I guess is understandable.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not human.\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever we are, I see your problem Caleb. Even if you reveal yourself as a Vampire they still can\u2019t let you go back to an all human family with their secret. You may have to stay there a while.\u201d Papa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. If it comes down to it than I can tell them over killing them but I would rather them figure a way around it than me forcing the issue. Either way though I thought I should let you all know that I might be gone for a while. I don\u2019t want you to get involved beyond the concerned parent that you would usually be. So I can\u2019t reveal who they are. But is it ok if I tell them eventually?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe understand, but that last part is up to you. We are more than willing and able to keep your secret Caleb but it is up to you to spread it if you wish. I guess we\u2019ll see you when you get out of wherever you are.\u201d Papa responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you Caleb.\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you all to.\u201d You responded then cut the connection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the for the waiting as you were forced from the bed by some seduced servants and was left with an empty dungeon cell. Soon enough you were able to realistically take off the bandage, after about a week, and heal the spot but left the scaring just in case they inquired about it. They weren\u2019t large scares but noticeable if one knew where to look. You probed the mind of the slaves they sent in to feed you. It was just bread and water but you didn\u2019t need blood for another few months at this rate. The minds were somewhat void but did retain some individual memories of their lives in the service of Kelsey and her Mother. You learned a bunch about them through this. For starters, mating with one of them is how they contract those they mate or seduce. In that instance a chemical is shot up through a man\u2019s organ as he unloads to which the Succubus in question has to decide wither to use her 1 in 100 year supply of mate designation or to turn them into a slave. A kiss from them to the lips of a human would brainwash them for about a day and their natural hormones they give off in Succubus form make them unresistable  for human men. They also ate humans on occasion as a special delicacy but not like you or a snake. They ate the human, usually raw but sometimes cooked, like one would eat a thanksgiving turkey. Carving the prey up and sending them down to the Succubus\u2019 stomach. However they didn\u2019t need human flesh, only craved it and only once in a few years. The rest was pretty standard modes of physical increase; speed, flight (with their wings), strength, sight, smell, and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could sense everyone in the castle as you sat against the wall of your cell. Kelsey would look at your cell door then run away while her mother and father would scold her on waiting. She really only had one option unless they could come up with an alternative.

Kelsey came in with her then shut the door but was not looking you in the eye, more down at the floor. This told you more than what you needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve.\u201d You called. You had communicated with your family and had a plan set up. If it looked like they were going to kill you and made you tell them your secret than you would teleport them to the family room and put them on one of Eve\u2019s webs. The web was strong enough to hold you for about 10 minutes even while encased in fire so it would have no problem holding these two. But having such a device read was hard so you had to call her and have her ready and standing by to maintain once you got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey going to kill you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably, please bring the family and be ready. Be sure to remind them that they are succubus and are masters of seduction.\u201d You warned to which she went off and you cut the mind link just in time for Kelsey\u2019s Mom to start talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems like Kelsey is having a hard time doing what needs to be done. She keeps you in here, hoping to prolong your worthless life but for what?\u201d she asked as she looked at the still guilt ridden Kelsey. \u201cCan you guess what\u2019s going to happen to you human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a fairly good idea. It helps that she doesn\u2019t want to, well for me at least. The way I see it the option is quite clear. If she can\u2019t seduce or mate with me than there is only one option left.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem awfully calm about this. You are going to die, most humans try to beg or offer themselves as slaves.\u201d She stated curiously. Not even full adult men acted like you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell living as a slave wouldn\u2019t be living at all from what I\u2019ve seen of your slaves. As for begging, I never really got into the whole frog posture thing. I mean how impressive is bending down and trying to resemble a wart covered toad while pleading meaningless sentiments that you\u2019ve probably heard a thousand times? Sure I prefer living but if that isn\u2019t an option then might as well live the rest of my life on two feet.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a strange human.\u201d Debora, Kelsey\u2019s mother, said with a giggle of sorts. \u201cHowever, since Kelsey doesn\u2019t seem up to finishing you, maybe you would like some pleasure before you go.\u201d She offered. This invitation got Kelsey to look up at you than her mother as if betrayed. \u201cWhat? I\u2019ve never had a boy or man that was like him before and you are incapable. If he\u2019s going to die, might as well do it with his desires fulfilled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the offer Miss. Dremer but my parents taught me not to use a woman like that, Succubus or not. Doesn\u2019t matter WHAT someone is, they are still a person first and everything else second.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you refused me? Well not again.\u201d She said as her eyes glowed and you could sense the hormones around her form double in strength to ensnare you. \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do believe I answered that already, and as polite as I could.\u201d You said back, making her take an angered step forward but Kelsey a step back in shock. Obviously no one had told her mother \u2018NO\u2019 before, especially not a human male. With an angered motion she plunged her hand into your gut, curving it up so that her nails were stretching into your organs. How unfortunate for her that only silver worked like that, fortunate for you though. You coughed up some blood but then looked her in the eyes and grabbed her arm that was half impaled into you. \u201cYou know, I really wish you didn\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026 there\u2019s no way you\u2019re still alive.\u201d She stuttered in shock but could retract her hand from you as you held it firm. You took a step forward despite her attempt to restrain you and free her arm. You kept going until you were in arm\u2019s reach of Kelsey. With that you turned to mist, teleported, healed, and dropped them into the prepared web, compliments of Eve as the rest of the family sat waiting with Eve on the ceiling and dropped on you when you finally formed back up in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d Eve scolded as she landed on your back and scurried around you, hugging and embracing as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, you missed me that much?\u201d You asked as she settled on your torso while her legs gripped around your back and you pet her while she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I missed you. Since when does anyone miss you more than I do?\u201d She almost sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. Ok, next time I get captured by someone I\u2019ll talk with you every night, deal?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal, you better not break it.\u201d She stated then jumped back onto the ceiling so you could address the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey? The Succubus is Kelsey?\u201d Sarah thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know what we are?\u201d Her mother demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to talk. Caleb does something nice and gets killed for his efforts.\u201d Mom snapped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo answer your question, Caleb was in telepathic communication with us the entire time. He didn\u2019t tell us who you were for our safety but now we do know. And don\u2019t try any of that seductive stuff, we are pretty well immune to it.\u201d Papa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Caleb does attractants hundred times better than that all the time. That might work on shallow men and other people but not us.\u201d Luke boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you\u2019re blushing?\u201d you asked to which the others laughed at him except the two in the web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck is going on?!!!\u201d Miss Dremer hollard in frustration. She couldn\u2019t get free of the web made by a talking and huge ass spider, everyone was just laughing off her attempts at domination, and she couldn\u2019t figure out you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it obvious by this point, I\u2019m not human.\u201d You revealed as they all looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey what are all of you?\u201d She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t listening little Miss bossy pants. He said HE isn\u2019t human, we are accept Eve. She is obviously a spider.\u201d Sarah said back with a little sass to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou keep talking that way human and you\u2019ll be ripped in half once I get out of this.\u201d Miss. Dremer threatened but got no sign of fear from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to get it. I am not letting you go until I can guarantee my family\u2019s safety. After that point, if you were to harm them in any way I would make sure you regretted it before sucking you dry and having Eve here turn the rest of your body into goop and eat the rest of what I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve never actually killed anyone before but I would gladly do it if it meant keeping my family safe from someone like you.\u201d you said in a tone that got her to shut up with a quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb?\u201d Kelsey finally called from her spot to which you looked over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey, I know you didn\u2019t mean anything bad. I read your mind just to be sure. Your family\u2019s rules stink so I don\u2019t really hold it against you. I definitely don\u2019t hold it against you that you kept this a secret. Look at this family and you\u2019ll see we keep a boat load of them. If anything I am glad you aren\u2019t human. Having humans are nice but I wouldn\u2019t mind a few more non human friends.\u201d You said and tears trickled down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Her Mom asked, this time nicer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Vampire. Wasn\u2019t one until early last year when the former one passed on her gift to me, which is why I have a human family. I am the only one.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026 V-Vampire\u2026?\u201d she stuttered out in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I told you that Vampires are feared. I don\u2019t even know why myself but I do know that you still make my instincts go crazy.\u201d Eve said from her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I wonder is why Vampires are so feared. What did Miss. Isisbelle do to scare them so bad? Or was it one of the stories she passed along to help like the others?\u201d Luke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it has something to do with the immortal genetic knowledge part. I mean I can\u2019t die and I don\u2019t have a weak moment as far as starting out and even before we trained this summer I was still leagues away from these two.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou trained with humans?\u201d Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s where we were all summer. We went up to our cabin and property and we trained. I hunted them, they hunted me; it was a lot of fun and we all got much needed experience and training. It is probably why they are so use to seductive attractants and why Eve has a web strong enough to hold you. It can hold me for about\u2026 20 seconds, more than enough time for her to get a bite in to knock me out for a few days.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hunted your own family, and you are scolding me?\u201d Miss. Dremer snapped at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho ever said I killed any of them. Yes I drank from them and hunted them. But I never once killed anyone, and especially not them. No matter what you try you can\u2019t make them turn on me so stop trying.\u201d You hissed back that got her to brace back against the webs that held her. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to speak about morality and relating with humans to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, can I get down?\u201d Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot right now. We all trust you here Kelsey but I don\u2019t want you to be put in a position where you have to choose your mother or us.\u201d you answered and she inwardly thanked you for it.

They are humans and we are their betters. They live to feed and serve us, not to be friends with.\u201d Miss. Dremer exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about this Caleb.\u201d Papa said as he was previously listening to this whole thing and thinking on it. \u201cI know we don\u2019t want for you to kill anyone but we can\u2019t let her go either. I\u2019m not about to have her in our house acting like this and possibly getting loose, no offense Eve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone taken, even my webs can\u2019t last forever. I got to agree. I don\u2019t see this Succubus changing any time soon.\u201d Even replied back. You began floating in the air as you started to think deeply about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might have to kill her Caleb.\u201d Mom stated rather bluntly, the half naked and seductive woman in her living room not helping her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Please don\u2019t.\u201d Kelsey pleaded as he Mother started to realize where this situation was going. If she didn\u2019t make a major change she could quite possibly be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey, I don\u2019t want to kill anyone. But if I let her go and she just comes back and kills some or all of my family than\u2026 I can\u2019t take that risk. I am willing to hear other options but I won\u2019t let her do as she wills with my loved ones. Give me something.\u201d You almost challenged and it got them both to think. For the first time you saw them both on the same thought pattern. Her Mom seemed to finally get what was going on. They both saw what you were saying and were thinking of a way to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Miss. Dremer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should be very obvious. Even Isaac knows.\u201d You answered and you all looked over at Isaac as he noticed he had the floor sort of speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be nice, no being naughty.\u201d He said in an innocent tone of voice. He was good at that. Whenever you or the others wanted something from your parents you always sent him to ask. He was just too cute for your parents to say no to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it. You don\u2019t want anything. Just for me to be \u2018nice\u2019?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it make you feel better if I had you strap on a big bird costume and sing children songs while flying over the city?\u201d you asked and she almost looked offended. \u201cDidn\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t want slaves, or people treating me like I\u2019m some kind of terrible master of sorts. Why can\u2019t we just get along? I know it sounds elementary but why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I don\u2019t get you. I was fully willing to be your slave. A boy your age with a full grown Succubus at his disposal and you just want next to nothing. You\u2019re so\u2026\u201d Miss. Dremer started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 weird.\u201d Kelsey finished for her. \u201cHe\u2019s always been like that and that\u2019s what I like about him the most. He doesn\u2019t want my body. He wants me, as a friend, nothing more or less complicated\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s Caleb for you. The loyal, strong, kind, gentle, but sexual idiot.\u201d Sarah joked. \u201cHe could have every woman in the city falling all over him but passes on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I have no idea what you all are talking about. How about I just take it as a compliment and move on.\u201d You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Caleb, it was a compliment but yeah let\u2019s wrap this up. I need to get some sleep.\u201d Sarah stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I accept your deal. I\u2019ll be\u2026 nicer, as your brother put it and never attack your family in anyway, even if they ask me to.\u201d She said, adding the last part when she thought about what could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do? Well that\u2019s a relief. I should probably send you two back then. Your whole house is probably looking for you at this point. Oh, and if you don\u2019t mind keeping me and Eve\u2019s secret? Well you don\u2019t have to but I\u2019m sure you get the idea.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLips are sealed.\u201d Miss. Dremer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk kids, time for bed now that is over.\u201d Papa stated and got a pleasant response as they were all too tired to argue, even the usually tired Isaac. \u201cCaleb, you still have a week\u2019s worth of homework to do before the morning so get to it when you\u2019re done here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d you responded as he Mom both exchanged kisses with you then went off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve, can you cocoon me?\u201d Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, race you to your room.\u201d Eve said to which both of them were off and left you in the room with the two succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCocoon him?\u201d asked Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve cocoons me when I rest in place of a bed. After you know she isn\u2019t going to eat you it is insanely soft and comfortable. Isaac likes it and still wets the bed so the cocoon filters that and Eve cleans up the little sack that appears as a result. You\u2019ve been in my room so you know how soft her webbed silk is.\u201d You answered then moved to Miss. Dremer and rose your hand, looking like you were going for her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally taking me huh?\u201d she asked seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 don\u2019t really know what that means but whatever.\u201d You said as you placed your hand on her shoulder and she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2026 where did she go?\u201d Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeleportation, I just sent her back to that cell we were in. Only place inside your house I have my glyph to teleport you both to.\u201d You answered and came over by her and reached for her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Caleb\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for the\u2026 well everything.\u201d She said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey, I told you before. You don\u2019t have to apologize. Everything worked out in the end and I don\u2019t have to be alone at school anymore. Now no sense bringing up bad memories ok?\u201d you said to her and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d she said right before you teleported her away. After that you didn\u2019t get much rest as you caught up on homework and some more R&amp;R with Eve.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some of them being; They seem comical to me and when I fight them I can\u2019t just wipe them out so I have fun with them. Stuff like standing against a wall and moving at the last second so their fist hits the wall instead of me. That way they can\u2019t accuse me of picking on one of their own. Not to mention that even using none of my strength I can still beat most of them without a problem. I guess another reason would be, it brings to much attention to me and why in the world would I reveal myself to that bunch of idiots?\u201d You asked in conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense. But you don\u2019t have to deal with them hitting on you all the time. Ever since I matured they\u2019ve been hounding me for a piece. It is so disgusting.\u201d She said in a shiver as a few were glowering at her, some actually drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my fault you\u2019re so hot now. Here, have some pie.\u201d You said as you pushed a plate with some lemon Morang pie on it. You then got an idea and winked at her, licked your fork clean so your audience could see, then gave it to her. She seemed to be on the same wave length and used it herself. Not like your saliva was disgusting with all the healing properties in it. Plus the desired effect caught on as a sigh and groan could be heard as she used it to which you both chuckled/giggled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me, if you\u2019re a\u2026 well different how can you eat normal food? Does it even taste good?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only need blood for nourishment when my reserves run low, and that only happens when I have to use my powers. Miss. Isibelle, the Vampire before me, didn\u2019t drink any for 20 years cause she didn\u2019t use her powers for that long. I\u2019ll admit that normal food is a little less\u2026 amazing in taste now but it is hard to say no to my Mom\u2019s cooking.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you ever\u2026 want to drink from me?\u201d she asked in a blush but shoveled some pie into her mouth to hide her flushed color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course and now more than ever. I\u2019ve never drank from your kind before. Although I think I would like to try it when fully in your other form to see if it differs from humans. So far though I like human blood the most. They are so diverse and delicious it is hard to describe what it feels like to feed on them or what it tastes like for me.\u201d You answered, subconsciously licking your lips at the prospect of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe they are just ok with you feeding on them. Doesn\u2019t it at least hurt? What if they turn?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really have to experience it for yourself to understand but no it doesn\u2019t hurt and no they don\u2019t turn. Even if I wanted to turn someone I can\u2019t, well not for 2100 years when I have to give the gift to someone else. But even then it isn\u2019t like what you\u2019re thinking. When I give the gift it leaves me and I die and I don\u2019t have a choice in the time frame. If I don\u2019t give it to someone then it is taken and goes into someone randomly. As far as pain\u2026 the bite stimulates arousal so the most common thing that happens when I suck their blood is they don\u2019t want me to stop, even knowing that if I don\u2019t they will die.\u201d You revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I might not be up for experiencing it for a while, no offense.\u201d She said after finishing her pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool, I\u2019m not desperate or always thinking about it like the stories say. I\u2019d rather have you as a friend than a feeding sack in any case. Just if you\u2019re curious you don\u2019t have to be shy about it.\u201d You offered casually enough to be an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m hot?\u201d she asked, again blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ve always said so even before you hit maturity.\u201d You answered as you tossed your garbage and hers in the trash like usual. \u201cBut it means nothing to me without the person behind it. I could get any girl if all I wanted was a body slave with no substance or depth. Although that\u2019s coming from someone who\u2019s only real friends are a 3 foot tall spider who is still growing and a Succubus. Can\u2019t really say that my opinion is unbiased.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right about that. As for me, I can\u2019t really accept most guy\u2019s opinion until at least High School. Most of them are still in the middle of puberty and don\u2019t know what they want, and most just want an ass to slap.\u201d She commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least you can have kids.\u201d You said, trying to cheer her up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d she asked as if heartbroken and sorry for you at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. I can\u2019t turn anyone until it\u2019s time and that includes passing on my enhanced DNA to children. Still have all my normal functions down there but they\u2019re just for show. It\u2019s a good thing when you think about it. If a Vampire could have kids than there would be a bunch of arrogant ones around like in the movies and such. For the world\u2019s sake I\u2019m kind of glad I can\u2019t or that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d You said with a cover smile. Secretly it bothered you that you would never be able to have a traditional family of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here I thought we had it bad only having one kid for 200 years of life. But at least you have a huge extended family you can hang around with.\u201d She said partially sad about 3 things; first that you couldn\u2019t be her mate, second that you could NEVER have kids, third that she could only have one. But she added the last part to lift both your spirits up. It seemed to work as both of you exchanged smiles just in time for the bell to ring for lunch to be over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo these are the two trouble makers.\u201d Grandma Konel said as she looked at Kelsey and Mrs. Dremer imposingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Hi Mrs. Konel, my name is Kelsey Dremer, a friend of Caleb\u2019s and this is my Mother.\u201d Kelsey introduced. Only the two of them came as her elderly father was too old and weak to make the trip. They rarely celebrated Christmas because the excitement of such an event was too much for his heart but he insisted them come to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes. Caleb has told me all about you two.\u201d She said which made it sound like she was mad at them. But that vanished when she Gave Kelsey a full on hug then let her breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about fitting in around her. After we all got use to Caleb a few more, \u2018freaks\u2019 as we like to call you all, are more than welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, we are happy that he has someone other than Eve to hang around with that isn\u2019t human.\u201d Grandpa Konel stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe told you?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course, there are no secrets in this family but we also know how to keep them from others. We even made a rule about it. The only people outside our family that get to know about this kind of stuff must go with us to our big family vacation in the summer.\u201d Grandma Lon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVacation?\u201d Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did it this last year. Basically it is our time to train Caleb to be, what we guess, to be a proper Vampire. Since he works so hard in being human he needs to work on his other side to. Not to mention we need education on how to protect ourselves against \u2018freaks\u2019 like him. It is more of a double sided boot camp where he physically trains during the day and works on his Vampire moves during events that we set up. He hunts us all other times but isn\u2019t allowed in the cabin main area but can go into the sleeping area. It is so much fun trying to find ways to kill him.\u201d Uncle Matt interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou try to kill him? How can you do something like that?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked, more confused than concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s easy, I can\u2019t die.\u201d You said as you walked into the room. \u201cThey have got me good a few times though. Uncle Jim managed to cut off my head once. Maybe you two would like to join us some time. They need all the help they can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they all know what we are?\u201d asked Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you can transform if you want. Just try to keep the seduction down. It is a family thing and there are kids around.\u201d You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they are humans.\u201d Mrs. Dremer interjected. \u201cThey will run and hide and panic.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so? Watch this.\u201d You stated then went over to Katie, one of your cousins that was begging you to drink her blood but kept her desires to a minimum for the event. You sat by her and whispered in her ear. She smiled and then you grabbed her and sank your fangs into her neck. The two that watched couldn\u2019t figure out what was so interesting; that you would just do that on a whim or that no one even gave it a second glance. It wasn\u2019t that they were under a spell, they just didn\u2019t care. The few that did look seemed to be jealous if anything but just went on socializing. You didn\u2019t take much then retracted and licked her neck clean then your lips of any excess blood. You whispered in her ear again a thank you then went back to them. \u201cSee, they don\u2019t really care. Sure they may think you are a new and interesting, \u2018freak\u2019 as they like to call us, but unless you do something morally bad they aren\u2019t going to care that much. They may even ask you to do something. But it is up to us to say no. After all, we are a Christian family so some of your\u2026 talents would be a little too\u2026 much for them but they might still ask you to do it. In which case they trust us to say no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they won\u2019t react badly?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt depends on your definition of \u2018badly\u2019. The kids are kids after all and misbehave just like any other. With us they just have a larger variety of things they can do. They like to put silver tacks on my seats and sometimes draw blood and wipe it places to tease me. But if you are asking if they will put you to the stake or something than the answer is no. Some may be a little rough until they get use to you but that is only natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t mind if I\u2026?\u201d Kelsey asked as she gestured to her back as if referring to her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, they won\u2019t mind.\u201d You answered to which she did. Wings sprung from her back as did her tail, along with the other enhancements that came with it but her clothes kept her from being too provocative. Everyone in the room looked over at her in stunned silence and she began to blush and get nervous at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss. Kelsey, you are really pretty.\u201d Said Little Samuel as he reached and grabbed her soft tail, all of his \u2018r\u2019s were pronounced in an adorable \u2018w\u2019 sound. Kelsey smiled as she saw him rub his face into her soft tail to which she wrapped him a little with it and he laughed as the velvety surface tickled him. Isaac ran from the room then returned with Dana and pointed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, told you she looks like an angel.\u201d Isaac blurted out which made Dana\u2019s eyes sparkle. Pleased with how her daughter was fairing Mrs. Dremer did likewise as her wings and features came out. She too was wearing a more conservative piece than before and those that were in the room gazed at them both with wonder. She watched in delight as Dana\u2019s eyes sparkled even more with this development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, with looks like that I bet you both have a whole line of boys for ya.\u201d Grandpa Lon blurted out and it got both them to blush and everyone to break the silence they were in with laughter. The way he said it was in his usual comical manor that only a Grandpa like him could do. Soon both of them joined in the laughter and the evening continued.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWow, you\u2019re family is so nice. I didn\u2019t know humans could be this much fun.\u201d Mrs. Dremer stated. She obviously was use to just using humans to get what she wanted and not much more than that. Finding out that they were was intriguing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, believe me, last year was way different.\u201d You stated as you three looked over the room of people as kids ran by, people talked, and all the business of Christmas. The 3 of you were getting a lot of attention, particularly them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell can I ask why your kind fear Vampires so much?\u201d you asked and they slightly looked down and away before Kelsey turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur history says that the succubus race was once a larger race with hundreds of branches. But they/we made the mistake of threatening the Vampire lord at the time and he rendered the entire population down to 3. Thousands of years has passed since then as the story was passed down but we were always told that if we were to meet a Vampire to run to prevent accidentally offending the Vampire in question and having him or her destroy the rest of us. There are only 20 of us in the world right now.\u201d Mrs. Dremer revealed then looked hesitantly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. You don\u2019t need to worry. It would take a lot for me to kill anyone, much more to wipe out an entire race. Too young for all that kind of stuff. As for last year; As you can tell the rumors and fiction surrounding Vampires did not paint a good picture of me to them. So last year I received more death threats than anything. They have come to accept people like us more, probably because of our little vacation. Each day they would provide me with a free neck to feed on and all of them were required to take a turn to show them that it wasn\u2019t a bad experience.\u201d You responded back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked, slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust biting alone stimulates pleasure in the body to increase the willingness of the prey and blood flow. By the time I pull away it is like\u2026 well my Aunt said it is like stopping in the middle of an orgasm, have to take her word on it but it does feel really good. And since Miss. Isibelle had to bite me to pass it on I know what it feels like. It is near double of that feeling for me so it takes a lot of control to stop. Trust me, beginning is the easy part for both sides.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind if I felt it?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked to Kelsey\u2019s shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom?\u201d Kelsey almost scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you never let him drink your blood? You two are like best friends.\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with it. Unless we are on the vacation, I don\u2019t force myself on anyone or let them ask me on peer pressure alone. If they really don\u2019t want to than I won\u2019t feed on them, even if I\u2019m starving.\u201d You intersected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s noble of you. But do you have a good reason why I shouldn\u2019t?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked more her daughter than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 No, I guess not. I just kind of wanted to do it before you.\u201d She revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you two think about it for a while. I wouldn\u2019t do it right now anyway. My Mom and the other women in my family made a lot of food and she\u2019ll smack me a new one if I ruin my appetite.\u201d You again interjected to prevent any kind of arguing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are free to join your meal?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked to which she heard Kelsey giggle at her question. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot you never saw the Konel\u2019s style meal. If there is one thing I know about Caleb\u2019s family is that they can cook and they can eat, a lot. I\u2019ve never seen his Mom make too little of food, you\u2019ll see.\u201d Kelsey stated. And none too soon as Grandma Lon yelled down that the meal was ready. The 3 of you waited for the rest to pass before heading up, their wings taking extra space but when the 3 of you got to the table they were all waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d Mrs. Dremer gasped at the massive amount of very good looking food that teased every single one of her senses. But she was wondering why they were all looking at you 3, actually you were wondering the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, last year we all embarrassed ourselves badly with Caleb so all the \u2018freaks\u2019 get their spots first and we\u2019ll fill in after.\u201d Grandpa Konel stated to which Eve took a spot on the Ceiling above the table, and you guided the two winged angel looking succubus to seats next to you. After that they all were more than anxious to sit and, after prayer and a few words, the feasting began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be shy. How much you want?\u201d Mom asked as she passed the stuffing to Kelsey on one side of you. \u201cCaleb is just going to eat it all if you don\u2019t take some.\u201d Mom stated to which she put a good portion on her plate. It was no exaggeration as you took a huge mound of the stuff before passing it along and they finally got the message and ate their fill along with you. Unlike last year, you didn\u2019t have to dodge the silver dishes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Neither of them let you drink from them yet, they were too afraid of Vampires through the legend to allow it but were starting to come around. Vampire clan moved in on Kelsey on more than one occasion but the school versions were nothing much and you made a mental note to deal with them sooner or later. Papa had told you to wait until next year as it was almost Summer and you all had your vacation to look forward to. However a strange man came to the door one day at the beginning of summer. It was 2 weeks till your whole family along with Kelsey would be free to go up. Her Mom was watching over her dying husband but insisted on Kelsey going. However this man was strange as he came to the door and gave a few solid knocks to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, can I help you?\u201d Mom asked as the large man, near 7 feet tall and build like a tree, stood above her. He had a black cloak on and underneath was a robe with your glyph on it. However he was obviously not someone you had entrusted it to. Your mother took note of it but didn\u2019t flinch as she looked up to him and Papa joined her at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was and always will be a servant of Lady Isibelle. I am here on her last order to me and I will complete it.\u201d The man said in a deep ominous voice as he looked down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsibelle? Yes, come in. Papa, can you lead him downstairs while I call Caleb. I have a feeling this man would like to see him.\u201d Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish to see the one she gave her gift.\u201d he almost demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb is our son.\u201d Papa said after shutting the door behind the entering and towering man. \u201cHe is the one that inherited Isibelle\u2019s\u2026 gift. But we don\u2019t talk about such things in detail where others can easily overhear. We have a soundproof room downstairs where we talk about such delicate matters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d he said then followed and sat in the room. You didn\u2019t arrive for another half hour to which you Mother told you about the man and escorted you down to see him. He stood immediately when you walked into the room and bowed. \u201cMaster Caleb, I am honored with your presence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, but if I recall I don\u2019t remember enslaving you. Not that I mind the respect but why are you calling me \u2018Master\u2019?\u201d You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lady charged me with your training once a year after you had a full year to adjust to the gift she gave. I am here to fulfill that duty. Until you are what compares to a proper Vampire I am to remain and instruct.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr\u2026?\u201d You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVale.\u201d He answered with another lighter but still noticeable bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Vale, we are going to go up north for such training in 2 weeks. I admit we don\u2019t really know what standards are meant for a proper Vampire but we do work out there.\u201d You informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, with respect, you can\u2019t learn how to become a Vampire from humans. You must learn from other Vampires, as weak as they would be compared to you.\u201d He interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Miss. Isibelle said I was the only one. How can I learn from other Vampires?\u201d You asked as your parents listened in silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lady worked with fictional stories to not only spread lies about Vampires to protect you but also to construct means of which to enter those stories to learn from the Vampires she created. In each \u2018realm\u2019 she has established a lesson to be learned and abilities to awaken as you live in them. She also estimated that that time would be an issue. So while you would spend years at times inside a realm it would only be the length of the realm from this side that passes for both you and those outside of it.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second. Are you trying to tell me that she had links so that she could create Vampire Movies and stuff so I could enter those \u2018realms\u2019 and learn?\u201d You asked. You had to admit that without sleeping you\u2019ve been daydreaming about kicking around some of the Vampires in those movies and T.V. shows. But you never thought that you would be presented with the ability to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master.\u201d He said with yet another bow. \u201cIf you have a time restraint than we should start right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like I have much choice if Miss. Isibelle went through all this trouble just to teach me. Papa, Mom, what do you think?\u201d You asked as you looked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2026 We agree Caleb. As long as you are back by the time we have to leave I see no problem with it.\u201d Papa said after thinking on it a bit and looking at Vale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe should be back in a week\u2019s time from this first one.\u201d Vale answered then turned to you. \u201cOf course it will be longer for you while inside the realm. Are you ready Master?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so. So where am I going?\u201d You asked to which he pulled out a series known as\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOk then Master I will escort you to the Headmaster.\u201d Vale stated once he had brought you inside the realm of Vampire Knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, you sure it is ok to tell him about me being a Vampire? I never actually watched the series you brought me into.\u201d You asked him as you walked down a long path into an expensive looking school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave no fear Master. As this will be your first I visited the realm before you and made sure that you would be accepted in any way you wish. Beyond that it will be up to you to make the best of it. It is training after all, not a vacation. However that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a little fun.\u201d Vale answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Mr. Vale.\u201d You replied as you looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am here to serve Master. No need to thank me.\u201d Vale responded in a respective tone that you\u2019ve heard in those old king and queen movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently so but Papa and Mom always said to respect my elders and thank people when they do something for me, no matter how small. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re just going to have to accept my thanks cause I can\u2019t help but give it.\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lady Isibelle chose well indeed. I can see you are inexperienced but have a pure heart.\u201d Vale said to you as he took a rare direct look at you then returned it to scoping out the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply blushed a little at the compliment. You then looked around at the beautiful area as the sun hit you and you soaked in the rays. You stopped in front of a door and waited. Maybe it was because it was a different realm but the sun\u2019s warmth felt especially good as you sat on a bench waiting for admittance into the school. You lost yourself in the feeling as you took in the sound of the wind around the trees, the scents that came with that wind, and the warmth of the sun on your skin. Vale was inside and you didn\u2019t notice them approach until they were right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is our new guest. Funny, I\u2019ve never seen your kind enjoy the daylight so much.\u201d Said a man that seemed carefree but as you snapped out of your trance and looked over at him you saw he was analyzing you deeply, despite his calm and inviting gaze. You stood and bowed to him like you had seen him do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I get that a lot. Well for people that know about me anyway.\u201d You stated then straightened. \u201cMy name is Caleb, honor to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and polite as well, how wonderful. I am Headmaster Cross and the feeling is mutual. Why don\u2019t you come inside and we can start.\u201d He suggested to which you looked at Vale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where we part ways Master. I will be back to collect you when the time is right but for now your training begins. I have helped you all that my Lady Isibelle would allow.\u201d He said with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again Mr. Vale.\u201d You said and he continued his bow until you followed the Headmaster inside then almost vanished, probably outside of the realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after being led down a series of hallways you entered a room that looked to be the Headmaster\u2019s office to see 3 other people. One was as tall as you were with black hair and generally attractive features. The second was a girl that was shorter than all in the room with similarly black hair. The last was a white or silver haired boy, now standing but his sitting spot was facing and away from the boy in with the black hair. Their scent gave them away as different then Cross\u2019s scent and you assumed that they were all Vampires but since only one of them were wearing a different color set of clothes, white instead of black, you figured that the other two either were hiding their nature or it somehow didn\u2019t awaken yet. Since it wasn\u2019t the same with your gift you didn\u2019t intend on pressing on it. Besides, the girl actually smelled rather delicious from a food standpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, may I introduce Kaname, Yuuki, and Zero. Besides me and the other Night class students they will be the only ones that know about your being a Vampire. Compliments of your Mr. Vale, we have been told slightly of your unique strain of Vampirism.\u201d Headmaster introduced. You presented a bow to which only Yuuki returned. It was a good thing you didn\u2019t try to go for a hand shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Zero scowled and they all sat down in different reactions to his comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo where do you come from?\u201d asked Kaname as he seemed to be gauging you like the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s tricky, didn\u2019t Vale say anything about that?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe told me you were from another world but that was it. I thought he was joking.\u201d Headmaster said as he laughed and the others continued to look to you for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty accurate. I still come from earth but a different version of it. I was sent here because on my\u2026 world I guess\u2026 I am the only Vampire. The gift is passed down from person to person but can\u2019t be spread any more than that. The former Vampire determined me worthy and passed it to me about a year and a half ago. Mr. Vale was one of her servants and was instructed as her last command to help train me by going to different worlds that had Vampires and learn from them. So that brings me here.\u201d You explained as quickly as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be possible.\u201d Yuuki stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the only way to prove it would be to take you to that world. Since I can\u2019t do that and Vale holds the Key I\u2019m stuck here. But I am different from what legend says normal Vampires are\u2026 I think. Like I said, I was sent here to train. I don\u2019t know what I am capable of without someone to teach me a little. I got a handle on some of it though.\u201d You replied nervously scratching your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re different, how?\u201d Zero asked, concerned that he didn\u2019t know something that could help him fight them/ you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense, but why would I tell you that?\u201d You asked. \u201cI mean it just doesn\u2019t seem smart to broadcast my strengths and weaknesses. Unless it is a common thing around here, in which case I suggest you go first so I can see how it\u2019s done.\u201d You clarified to his sulking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are only referring to things we NEED to know. If you are different and need certain things to survive than as you would be living here it would be wise to learn such things to provide for you.\u201d Headmaster stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, well I guess that\u2019s ok. For starters I don\u2019t know what others can do but from the legends of my old world I\u2019ll take off from there; I actually like the sunlight although my power increases in the dark. I\u2019m not affected by any symbol as part of a cleansing or slaying effect. I can eat normal food and don\u2019t leave ANY evidence of feeding when drinking from someone. In a sense I only need blood if I use my Vampire powers. My former was at the 20 year mark without drinking any when she passed the gift onto me. I\u2019m not that strong but if I don\u2019t use anything then I can last for about a year or so. But considering just walking around wastes energy I\u2019d need some blood at some point, especially if you wanted me to do something that requires a lot of power\u201d you explained, trying to hit all the big points without saying anything that would come back and harm you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd people just let you drink from them in your world\u2026 disgusting.\u201d Zero snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, well my human family does but that\u2019s different. It actually feels good when I do it.\u201d You defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Now I\u2019m interested. How does ridding someone of their blood feel good to them.\u201d Kaname asked, obviously it wasn\u2019t the case in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my saliva acts as a healing agent to seal up the holes of feeding so there is no scares or worry of scares. The bite itself forcibly arouses the\u2026 uh prey I guess\u2026 to speed up the blood flow and increase the willingness of the one I am feeding on. By the end they are actually begging me to continue as the feeling multiplies until they are bled dry. I have had to knock them out to get them to allow me to stop a few times. Either way the ONLY ill effect they have upon me drinking from them is loss of blood. I can\u2019t turn anyone even if I wanted to nor could I leave my fang marks on anyone, again, even if I wanted to.\u201d You explained then looked to Zero who was obviously fighting the urge to do something unpleasant to you. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better. I usually get blood from packaged blood via hospitals and such and I never drink from anyone that isn\u2019t willing beforehand, and truly willing not because I made them so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Yuuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is only my second year as a vampire and my whole family is still human. They raised me to respect others and my Mom would rip me a new one if she found out I did otherwise.\u201d You joked and it lightened the mode a little. As a happy by product of making her smile Kananme did as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, why don\u2019t you try this.\u201d Headmaster said as he handed you a glass of red liquid that smelled like blood but also different, like a synthetic version. You sipped at it then drank the whole glass down in one shot but like using a straw without one visible. \u201cYou like it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is tasty, more so then juice or some other human drink. But if you are asking if I can use it to replace actual blood\u2026\u201d you said then paused and looked into yourself to see if it would work, it didn\u2019t. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it. It doesn\u2019t have any life in it. The point of me drinking isn\u2019t to satisfy hunger, although that is a part of my craving it. It is more to replenish power and that only comes from blood that was once in a living creature, human or otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you can drink from something else other than humans?\u201d asked Zero, strangely it looked like he was hoping it would work for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, to be honest human blood is leagues better but I can replace it with animal blood or\u2026 dead blood from corpses if I have to. But please don\u2019t make me drink dead blood, even if it works that stuff is like drinking rotten vinegar with turd chunks mixed in\u2026 yuck.\u201d You answered and shook your head to get rid of the memory. \u201cBut otherwise, if is ok, I can just hunt for animals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think that would ok.\u201d Headmaster stated after thinking on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you ever NEED human blood?\u201d Kaname asked as he was still figuring things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if I was to do something really strenuous and there was no other blood around. But like I said, I would rather starve then drink from an unwilling source. It\u2019s only happened once but if I were to get that low then my fangs would show and I would be passed out until some blood entered my mouth for my body to process. Before my Mom had to manually sink my fangs into a bag of blood before I could drink on my own again. But if you are asking of the danger level to humans\u2026 none, I won\u2019t force myself on a human ever and obviously if they do allow it I will not drink them dry, even with them begging me to do it.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2026 that\u2019s your name isn\u2019t it?\u201d Zero spat, still very hostile and not liking you at all and didn\u2019t even bother waiting for your nod before continuing. \u201cIf another Vampire at the school were to attack a human, what would you do?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably knock them out. I\u2019m not too into the whole killing thing yet, I\u2019m only a year and half old vampire and turning 14 in general so too young for all that. But if I felt I could do something about it, regardless who or why I would try to make sure both were safe. Well unless\u2026\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless what?!\u201d Zero shot back and the others following your answer intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell unless there was a legitimate reason agreed to by the human or what I think are good moral humans. Like when my family took me up in my first year to train. Basically they had me work hard during the day and we hunted each other at night. I got to feed on the ones I caught, wither they wanted to or not, and they got to go all out in killing me. Since I wouldn\u2019t drink them dry and I can\u2019t die it was fun, but potentially scary for the human being drunk from. If there was a similar situation here then\u2026 I guess I would have to trust the people I know that support it.\u201d You answered. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLet me get this straight. Your family, your human family, let you hunt and feed on them?\u201d Kaname asked in a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 well maybe not. The whole point was to train me in being a Vampire and them defending against Vampires. Plus they were having some acceptance issues that my Grandparents thought needed to be fixed. So each day I would get a free meal and a different one just so they could see that my feeding wasn\u2019t necessarily bad if controlled by both sides. The hunting part was at night so both of us learned and that was the unwilling times. But I have never killed anyone or turned them, but I physically can\u2019t do the last one so.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, all that is left is to appoint you to the night class and give you your dorm clothes. I am happy that we have yet another Vampire here that agrees with my ideas of Vampires and Humans living together in peace.\u201d Headmaster Cross said as he set a bag of clothes and stuff for you with another set to get changed into before you left. You went into the bathroom and changed then came out in your new white uniform. You quickly memorized it\u2019s structure and incorporated it so you could mist with it and have it self clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way.\u201d Kaname said after a round of thank you and a scowl/glare from Zero, as well as after the sun was out of the way. \u201cI sense you have another question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy that must be what it feels like when I say it. Anyway, yes I do. I notice that most of you are just letting out your normal attractants. I assume that most can\u2019t control it but what is the limit in my case?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we Vampires have scents that attract\u2026prey I guess. I can control mine and limit it. Usually I have it off so humans don\u2019t notice me but the way Yuuki was falling all over you it seems like it is less of a concern. However my normal scent projection could make all the humans slaves if I wished. So what is an acceptable level?\u201d You explained and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you release a little bit and I\u2019ll tell you when you smell right. Then it will be up to you.\u201d he suggested and you nodded then started releasing it. \u201cOk there would be sufficient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if it is the same to you all I think I\u2019ll keep it as low as I can. It was just good to know what was normal.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, is that what you must do to live among humans?\u201d he asked, referring to your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know if it makes sense to you but I can\u2019t stand it when they treat me differently. When I have my scent out they\u2019ll do whatever I want them to do in hopes of me drinking them dry. I want to be around my family, not some love drunk mind slaves. Does that sound stupid to you?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it is very noble of you. But listen, about myself. You\u2019ll need to start referring to me properly. I will allow it to slide a few times but as a pure blood it is only proper. Please address me as \u2018Lord Kuran\u2019, understood?\u201d Kaname asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll do my best\u2026 Lord Kuran. I\u2019m sorry if I was too formal with you. I didn\u2019t realize you were so high in this world.\u201d You apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is quite alright, I am not a tyrant by any means but I do require respect.\u201d He said as the both of you walked toward your new temporary home while in this world. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad and things were currently going very well so your spirits were up, even if that Zero guy still wasn\u2019t liking you very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I sense you have a question for me.\u201d You stated as you noticed him deep in thought and glancing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow powerful are you, really?\u201d he asked. He must\u2019ve sensed your power as you had his. But in his case he would only be able to sense that yours was higher, not like you who had a level to relate to his for a more concrete calculation. You looked down for a moment as you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you have to understand about that is that because there is only one Vampire in my world I have all the power they had. I have a sort of genetic knowledge and process with my power. All that is needed beyond that is the age and experience to use the power that the others before me have learned and passed down. When I pass the gift in 2100 years I\u2019ll have added my lot to the mix as well. So I guess what I\u2019m saying is I am not sure how powerful I am.\u201d You paused for a moment as he looked at you and your eyes were down at the ground. \u201cBut as I am now and what I know\u2026 and what I sense from you. Forgive me for saying so but I am near 10 times what your power level is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok Caleb, but let\u2019s keep that little bit just between you and me. I don\u2019t need the extra complication of those under me. Is there an ability that you don\u2019t mind sharing with me?\u201d He asked and it got you to look into his eyes with a slight smile then back to where you were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess one that I don\u2019t mind people knowing about it I can heal people of almost anything.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can?\u201d he asked as he seemed to be putting his mind to work on things that it could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but like I said before. Every ability I have has to be powered by blood. So the more serious the injury the more power I need to heal it. A scratch is barely any trouble at all but healing Cancer or repairing a heart and other vital organs would take considerably more. The most I\u2019ve ever done was regrow a limb for someone, but that took almost all my power. It does have other limits though, I can\u2019t bring people back from the dead and I can\u2019t mess with DNA to a certain degree. Which is why I wouldn\u2019t be able to purge this world\u2019s Vampirism from someone that got caught in the cross fire. I could destroy the initial bite and what was left of the\u2026 whatever you call it before it starts changing the person, but after it starts I can\u2019t stop it.\u201d You explained as you tried to give as much information to him as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is an amazing gift. I am sure it will be of use around here. I am not going to ask what other gifts you have but I do want to know who blood crazy you get.\u201d He complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m starving then the craving is very high, but otherwise it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I can be right next to a vat of fresh blood and not care. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know the value but I can more than control myself.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is refreshing to hear.\u201d He replied as you both got to the door to which you opened if for him with some invisible mist then followed him in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You simply looked at him for a while as he said this then glanced at each of them. Each of them were even weaker than Kaname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I seem that way. But that is what I was going for to fit in.\u201d You replied, not sure who you had to impress and who were scum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no reason to apologize. I believe he is a Vampire and that is all any of you need to know.\u201d Kaname stated that got some of the mumbling in the room to silence. You gave him a light bow of thanks. \u201cCaleb, you may take any room that doesn\u2019t have a scent in it but class starts soon so be on time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lord Kuran and thank you.\u201d you stated then walked out of the main area, up the stairs , and down until you found one void of any scent then entered. It was a somewhat large room for just a bedroom. You put your bag that the Headmaster gave you down and opened the drapes to allow the sun in. You floated in front of the window as you thought on what to do. Kaname seemed nice but the looks you got from the other Vampires were a little cold, literally and figuratively. You closed the drapes then floated around the room as if laying face up in mid air with your feet propelling you around the room, as you strayed deep in thought. You already missed everyone. You hadn\u2019t even got time to say goodbye to more than your parents and Eve. Eve was a little cross that you would be gone for a whole week, her time, but let you go without too much fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, you can fly?\u201d asked a voice that broke your train of thought and you looked over to who it was. The same blonde haired boy from before with an orange haired one next to him. You straightened and slowly stood on the solid ground before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You answered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Lord Kaname asked me to apologize to you but now I see why. I shouldn\u2019t have been so quick to judge and disrespect.\u201d The boy with blonde hair said then straightened to be more formal. \u201cI\u2019m Hanabusa, nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Akatsuki, it is also good to meet you. Also good that even if you smell halfway delicious that you are one of us.\u201d the orange tinted hair boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Caleb, and it is an honor to meet you as well. I hope I can prove myself.\u201d You responded with a light bow similar to the one you gave Kaname. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost time for class and we usually all walk there together.\u201d Akatsuki informed then left with the other with a clear instruction to follow, which you did. They didn\u2019t seem very accommodating, as if you were some unclean thing or something. Not exactly what you were expecting from other Vampires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you find a suitable room?\u201d Kaname asked as you joined the group. They were all putting on a good face but you could tell that inwardly they were doing it only to respect his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it will do just fine.\u201d You answered as respectfully as you could. It was obvious from the actions of the others that he was a big shot in this world and you needed to keep that in mind. Sure you were here to learn but what you were going to learn was still up for debate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is good, now let\u2019s go.\u201d He replied to which the whole group followed him out the door as if they were his private security force with happy faces. Although you were almost pushed to the back. As you went and then was observed but the massing Day Class students they would look at you as if wondering why you were there. Basically it was because you didn\u2019t have the natural beauty they did but was far from unattractive either. They also let their attractants go and you held yours back, you accepted that they couldn\u2019t control it like you could and left it lay where it was. As far as your attraction to the other Vampires, it was minimal at best. To be perfectly honest you had a giant spider at home that you adored and two of the Succubus that were leagues ahead of them, probably because that is what they specialized in as their \u2018freak\u2019 designation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better know your place around here.\u201d Whispered one of the female Vampires with pale brown hair. You were just out of the class room when she stopped to tell you this then went on inside. You did as well and the only empty seat that didn\u2019t result in a deathly glare for sitting was in the back top row, furthest from Kaname as he sat. You had started placing invisible glyphs around so you place on here as well so you could teleport you and others around. Since fighting was apparently not allowed you would be able to teleport people away to other spots in exchange for it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cJust look at his eyes they don\u2019t even glow like a Vampire\u2019s\u201d Hanabusa said as he took a spot right in front of you and looked into your face. You weren\u2019t use to people being so close, strangers specifically. Family and close friends like Kelsey and Eve were ok but definitely not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I want to let my eyes glow? It only gives away my position in the dark to any prey or hunters that I am stalking. Out of habit alone I don\u2019t show them.\u201d you replied, not giving him any satisfaction for squirming. It was evident that the \u2018Night Class\u2019 didn\u2019t do a lot of learning but were there merely to follow Kaname\u2019s order or in direct respect of him. There was a few classes but with the heightened intellect in the room the daily learning was done in no more than an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you expect from a low level like him?\u201d asked the one that you heard called Ruka. With a defiante huff Hanabusa moved away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there flipping through the text books, reading them and committing the text to memory. You were able to learn a lot of the world you were in, including the order of things. Apparently Vampires that use to be human were at the bottom of the social ladder while purebloods like Kaname were at the very top, both in social status and power. They were also one of the only things that could turn a human into a Vampire. It also seemed that sunlight was ok for them while not preferable but other things like religious marks, crests, and magical things effected them more so. They could also easily be killed in multiple ways and stay dead, turning to ash most of the time. You didn\u2019t mind this as you could easily fake your death if you needed. You also learned of a thing called a \u2018Level E\u2019 that was void of all morality and almost dead. You prepared yourself for the idea that you might have to kill them as they were mostly dead already. It also explained why both sides were so hostile toward you. Apparently most human turned Vampires turned to Level E, more than enough reason to look down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go hunt now if you wish.\u201d Kaname said as he addressed you before exiting the room. You took that as a sign that it was free time, more or less and nodded before finding a spot that was clear and teleported you to one and your stuff to the desk in your room. Of course you did so after they all left. You didn\u2019t want them to know your abilities yet. You walked around the grounds and amongst the trees, placing glyphs where you thought would be good spots and explored the grounds. So you had a decent knowledge where you were. After that you stalked a fox for a while then as you were about to take it a rustle made it run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d came a voice from Zero as he came out from the brush and trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was about to have dinner but you scared it away. Kaname said it was an ok time to hunt.\u201d You answered as you straightened and faced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunting what?\u201d he demanded from you, looking to see if a human was near that he thought you would feed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was a fox but it ran off. Well if you\u2019re going to be scaring everything off tonight then I might as well just go back to my dorm so I \u2026\u201d you started but your head snapped to a scent of fresh human blood in the air to which you vanished from his sight and raced over to find Hanabusa intimidating Yuuki, drawing a little blood from her hand with his fang. You were able to grab his arm in a way that allowed you to squeeze and force him to let go. \u201cI thought it was forbidden to drink a human\u2019s blood, especially if they didn\u2019t want you to do it.\u201d You said as you tightened your grip enough to cause discomfort to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, let go. How dare you\u2026\u201d he tried saying as your grip increased to his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDare me what? I wasn\u2019t the one drinking her blood. I can\u2019t stand it when the strong bully the weak just because they can.\u201d You said, glaring at him as your grip tightened even more and he was forced to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can let go now Caleb.\u201d Came Kaname\u2019s voice to which you did so immediately and Hanabusa slunk back with Zero now there and Kaname making his entrance as well. You then walked over to Yuuki to which she pointed a rod at you and Zero his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I see your hand? Please?\u201d you asked in a calm voice. She hesitated but held it out to you. You slowly extended a finger and touched it, not thinking that grabbing it would be a good idea. With the touch you healed her scratch and bite like nothing was wrong in the first place then bowed to Kaname and vanished, teleporting to your dorm room before they could recover enough to bombard you with questions. You didn\u2019t do anything that couldn\u2019t be defended by Kaname so you left it to him. Besides you didn\u2019t feel like being in the middle of such hostility. Perhaps that was one of the lessons you were to learn. However it just reminded you of how your family first reacted. You floated around for a while, trying and failing not to think about it but soon after someone was knocking your closed door. You opened it from your position as and looked to see who entered. It was the same three people from before. Akatsuki was there but didn\u2019t do anything but the three came into the room to which you turned to look out the window from your floating and almost relaxed position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that really what Vampires are supposed to be like? I have been raised but Humans so I can\u2019t really say what SHOULD be acceptable behavior. I was always taught that the strong defend the weak.\u201d You asked as you gazed out the window, waiting for an answer. It was a question that was bothering you. What if this Vampire training left you feeling that Vampires should be above humans and should be served by them. The arrogance that the Vampire clan back home always had that you detested.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you wore you favorite Black sleeveless and shorts with your boot like shoes like you did when relaxing at home. Eventually you dropped down to your feet and turned to them, waiting for their answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are superior to humans but we have our own beliefs in where we should be in relation to them. Some think they are merely cattle and no more. Some think them as slaves that should serve their betters, being them of course. I on the other hand think they should be treated as people. So you are meant to be what you choose to be.\u201d Kaname answered, a little uneasy about what he had so far witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume that isn\u2019t a view shared by many.\u201d You stated, looking at the two beside him as examples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe apologize, we were not acting like we should.\u201d Hanabusa said with a bow to you, probably because Kaname was there and the other near him followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the thought. On my end I also acted to rashly. I assumed that you were drinking from her without permission, without asking. Even if that was the case I should\u2019ve asked before acting. I just haven\u2019t been around other Vampires before.\u201d You replied back. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something else?\u201d Kaname asked and the other two straightened to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean no offense by this Lord Kuran. However I still feel a very strong attachment to humans and particularly the ones that are being picked on by someone or something stronger than they are. I can\u2019t simply stand by when I smell blood and I see someone suffering in anyway, like when someone is being fed on unwillingly. I\u2019ve never taken a life before but if it were to come down to a choice between a Vampire\u2019s hunger and a human\u2019s survival, I would choose the human and protect them to the expense of any that are attacking.\u201d You replied and to this you let your power increase and your eyes glow like what they were referring to before. That only happened when you were allowing your full Vampire side to emerge and that was only when you were readying for a large use of your power. The effects usually allowed your mist to partially come out and control things around you like elements and even gravity, making the whole area very heavy. One thing that also came out in this and you didn\u2019t have control over was your fangs. They came out because your whole body was in full Vampire state and not hiding anything. But as quickly as you entered this state you ended it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 was\u2026 that\u2026?\u201d asked Akatsuki as he got up. The only one that could remain on his feet was Kaname, the other two had fallen to their hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA small fraction of what I can do so any doubt in your mind is cleared. I am a Vampire and not a weak or pathetic one as you seem to think.\u201d You answered, they still were breathing heavily as they recovered. You left your eyes glow their blood red color as they looked into them. \u201cI apologize if I was too forward Lord Kuran.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, it was rather informative and I appreciate your stand and your previous protection of Yuuki, the one that I hold dear.\u201d He answered to your apology then had to settle the others as they came in response to the power they felt. All they could do was gaze at you with your eyes still glowing until they were ushered from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then went back to gazing out the window as dawn broke and the sun\u2019s light crept over the trees in a beautiful fashion. You wondered how things would play out and hoped it was better than that encounter. But knowing that it was a type of training you doubted it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day and another class. You were more accepted into their ranks as a legitimate Vampire of worth after your little display. You also stopped a few of them from pursuing a blood scent that ended at a human, well inside the campus anyway. As it seemed to be a high mode of conflict, you placed an invisible glyph on Yuuki so you could teleport to her without too much trouble. However, even with their acknowledgement of you, the other Vampires and those that knew about such things still weren\u2019t really what one would call friendly to you accept Yuuki and Kaname, both for different reasons. Yuuki trusted you ever sense you healed her hand rather than drink from it, further protection over time had also solidified her stance. Kaname was the only one in the Vampires that you slightly connected with. Maybe it was because you had help protect Yuuki a few times or perhaps that you were so far ahead of him in power (that didn\u2019t happen a lot). But either way he highly respected you and made it known as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after class started and unofficially ended as the instruction part was over a scent hit you. Yuuki\u2019s blood was well recognized in your senses and every time it hit the air you located her via your glyph and sensed the area around from the point. Sometimes it was just her scraping herself on a branch when out on patrol or something but it had become a habit. However when you checked this time you sensed Zero in immediate contact with her and almost sinking his fangs into her. Both you and Kaname had been waiting for him to make a move while the others just knew it might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that identified and no one else to help her in the area you teleported to them and was able to form a sword out of your blood. This was an ability you picked up in your free time. You could use your body manipulation and mist to solidify blood in weapons for multiple purposes. Before either of them could react to your sudden presence you sliced at pressure points in his arms that made them let her go and fling to the sides and his head real back. You then grabbed Yuuki and within a second had spit Saliva needles big enough to impale his limbs to the wall behind him while retreating Yuuki to the top of the stairs where the 3 of you were. Without missing a step and letting her balance herself you thrust your blood made blade into his chest, easily slicing through his shirt and entering his body. The whole action was faster than a normal human could follow but just fast enough for the approaching Kaname and Headmaster Cross to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! Don\u2019t kill him!\u201d Yuuki exclaimed when she finally caught up with and comprehended what was going on. If you were really going to kill him it would\u2019ve been done by now. No, you saw the bloodlust in his eyes and while your blood wasn\u2019t very tasty to them it was more than enough to bring him fully out of that state, as if he had just drank a dozen humans dry. Your blood had a lot of power in it so it wasn\u2019t surprising that it was capable but Yuuki and the others didn\u2019t see that. All they saw was you impaling a pinned Zero with a sword blade made of blood against the wall he was pinned to. Yuuki was to shocked to say more than that while the other two that approached simply watched, preparing to deal with you if you had killed him or render thanks if you were doing otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw what you were doing when Zero\u2019s blood lusted eyes came down and he came back to himself oddly more disgusted with himself than freaked out of the sword that you were now pulling from his chest. You quickly dislodged the blade from him and most were surprised to find no wound. You pulled the blood from the instrument in your hands back into your body then stumbled back onto the stairs, sitting down to cope with the loss of your blood that you had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d asked Zero as he was still pinned but looked down, still expecting to see a gaping hole in his chest or perhaps hoping that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you before. I am not ready to take a life yet. I merely stabbed my blood into your organs to use instead of continuing to bloodlust like you were doing. You know this would\u2019ve been a lot easier if you would\u2019ve just asked.\u201d You answered and informed as you pulled yourself to your feet, your body now use to the loss of blood. You didn\u2019t lose a lot but enough to need to hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get here so fast, faster than I?\u201d Kaname asked as he walked up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope you don\u2019t mind but I put a glyph on Yuuki. It is nothing harmful, more like an invisible tattoo without ink. The only function is to allow me to track her and teleport to her position if I need to. I apologize if I overstepped my bounds.\u201d You answered, bracing yourself on the rail but bowing a little as he came up to tend to Yuuki who was in some shock and not really hearing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need for that Caleb. You may have saved her life. If it were anyone else I would have you gutted.\u201d He replied then turned to Zero. \u201cDid her blood taste good? Did you enjoy the thought of drinking from her?\u201d he asked then carried her off and leaving the guilt ridden Zero with you and the Headmaster. He did nod another thank you to you before leaving your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, can you let him down now?\u201d the Headmaster asked as the two of you talked on the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah. Don\u2019t worry, no residual damage to the wall or Zero.\u201d You said and quickly dissolved the needles into mist, healing what they punctured as they left, leaving no evidence of their presence and allowing Zero to fall to his feet. However in his state he crumbled to his knees. \u201cWith your permission Headmaster, I would like to go hunt. I don\u2019t think I am the one he wants to see right now.\u201d You asked as you both looked at the almost teary Zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, at least for now. Go ahead and use the rest of the night to hunt. It is a good feeling that I don\u2019t have to say to leave humans out of your hunt.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet you said it anyway. Thanks for the compliment though.\u201d You said then vanished, teleporting into the woods and starting a hunt for some of the animals you hadn\u2019t drunk from lately. Yuuki had caught you about to feed on a rabbit once and asked you not to kill the \u2018poor little bunny\u2019 as she called it. You complied and had to catch 3 others to make up for not finishing them but as a favor to her you didn\u2019t drink any of the animals dry either. It was definitely harder than just hunting but then again so was not hunting humans. Humans that didn\u2019t know better were supremely easier to hunt. Heck even humans that half knew what they were doing weren\u2019t much of a challenge if you really wanted to them. The biggest problem you had was when people like the other vampires would scare some prey off before you could enthrall it. But for now you just concentrated on finding something big enough to satiate you low power level. If you were lucky you would get a bear of deer, but lately with all the Vampires around you would be lucky to get something dog sized.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mornings were different for you than the rest of the Vampires. Normally mornings for them were when they would be heading or already in bed. You on the other hand didn\u2019t need the sleep and didn\u2019t want to get in the habit of doing so when you would otherwise have to be up at home. So you worked out behind the dorm in the mornings. You practiced some martial arts that you had been trying after wrestling was over at school the past year. With nothing better to do you would raise you power level a little and if you were lucky got a sweat going. You felt good if you had a reason to wash off outside before coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning you were slightly distracted by the previous night\u2019s activities. You got a rare deer like animal to replenish from but it was still heavily on your mind so you were more or less just going through the motions as you worked out in your comfortable shorts and sleeveless shirt. Eventually you hit a stopping point and washed off at a small water spicket. You kept your short on for modesty but usually it was private enough to wash off without a shirt or shoes. In this case, about halfway into your usually quiet and secluded wash off you heard a gasp. With a sigh you knew you would have to cut your much deserved wash off to deal with whomever was behind you. You knew that no one outside the Vampire information circle could get into the night dorm or where you were so you stood from where you had to kneel to get you little slice of delight. With a shake the residual water that wasn\u2019t in your hair shot off and you put your shirt back on then turned to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re there.\u201d You said to the figure behind the tree near the entrance to the dorm. A squeak could be heard and you saw Kaname glance into the spot you were in from a window as Yuuki came out of her hiding spot. You were still steaming from the lack of cooling off and the water that was on your skin, under your clothes and on the exposed skin with your hair in its natural spiked position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you really do like the sunlight.\u201d She said, trying to break the uncomfortable silence as you looked for her to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides all out hunts and raids it is the only time I can get a good workout. Plus being human for so long, I can\u2019t really get use to the whole staying inside all day thing. I enjoy the feel of the sun on my skin, even if it is a little bright out here to be completely comfortable.\u201d You answered as you stood there with your shoes in your hand. Your muscles were still tensed and strained from the work out you did and caught her eye. By this time Kaname had also picked up on your clueless nature with women, otherwise he would be having a talk with you every time Yuuki looked at you the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you always steam like that?\u201d she asked as she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it is the effect of the water cooling my body down. Usually I would be under that spicket for another 10 minutes to cool off but I didn\u2019t think that would be indecent with you watching.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you feel different than you usually do?\u201dshe asked as she felt a strange draw toward you that she usually didn\u2019t feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologizes.\u201d You said then turned your vampire abilities down again. \u201cI don\u2019t like people treating me different, mainly humans, so I seal my Vampire abilities from those around. I usually let them go a little when I train so I can get more of a workout. My attractant can be quite potent, again I apologize Yuuki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, it\u2019s my fault for coming back unannounced.\u201d She assured that got you to feel a little better about it. \u201cI just wanted to thank you for what you did, and didn\u2019t do last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no trouble at all. But thanks for coming out to say so. I usually don\u2019t get a lot of notice for what I do.\u201d You answered with in turn brought any anxiety out of her like she had done for you earlier. \u201cI hope it was ok to put my glyph on you. I didn\u2019t mean to intrude, I just meant to help. You seem to find the most trouble so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026No, that was ok, really it\u2019s fine. I suppose I don\u2019t mind as long as you aren\u2019t spying on me in the shower or something.\u201d She stated, part of it as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t work like that. It is just a beacon that I can teleport to if necessary.\u201d You returned with a smile to her slight joke and she smiled that she had succeeded and to your information on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot! I got to get to class.\u201d She said as she heard the bell ring. You held out your hand to her. She looked at it then took it to which you teleported her with you outside her next class but remained in mist form so the people coming wouldn\u2019t accidentally see you. \u201cIf you can hear me, thanks again.\u201d She said then headed into class and you back to where you had just been. You then picked up your shoes and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun?\u201d Kaname asked as you made your way to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore or less, I assume it was you who let her back there?\u201d you asked to which he nodded. \u201cThanks, I needed a little bit of Yuuki magic to lift my head a little. She is rather good at that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, think of it as my way of thanking you as well for keeping her safe and untainted.\u201d He said then headed off and you bowing to his leave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your encounter with Zero made him slightly respect you more but not enough to address for you anything. He still had a natural bias against all vampires, despite him being one now. However there was one thing that worked your nerve with him. After a few instances Yuuki had offered to let him drink her blood. You apologized to Kaname for this but as was your standard you couldn\u2019t do anything if she asked for it. He understood and it was now something between Zero and him. You still checked it out whenever her blood hit the air and healed the fang marks so she didn\u2019t have to wear the bandages anymore. But that wasn\u2019t your current problem. There was a new teacher that also happened to be a Vampire Hunter. Toga Yagari was apparently the top ranked Vampire Hunter in whatever organization he was with. He did seem more competent then most people you were used to dealing with that just pretended to be tough. However he did have his side that was confrontational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut before I go any further.\u201d Yagari said and looked up at your class almost in defiance, egging all of you on to attack if you dared. \u201cHello Vampires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the ethics teacher was a little biased but he still taught it well enough for you to learn some things from it. A lot of what he said hit nerves in the room, most of them being straight at \u2018Kaname Kuran\u2019 as he called him every time he referred to him and even put in a possible assassination threat. However when his gaze got to you, you didn\u2019t react like a traditional Vampire would. In this case the Vampires didn\u2019t mind your strange behavior as it seemed to push the hunter\u2019s buttons for not being able to mentally effect you like the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t figure out if this human had a death wish or he was looking for an excuse to fight the Vampires he was teaching. A definitely strange teaching strategy but there was a part that you didn\u2019t mind about his attitude. He didn\u2019t treat you any different or rather he didn\u2019t hide what he was thinking. Most people held at least a little bit back so not to completely offend you or the other Vampires. The man didn\u2019t hold anything back and spoke like anyone would who had no fear of you. You kind of liked it, arrogant as it was it kept it a welcomed change from the usual Vampire teacher you had. Plus he kind of reminded you of your uncle Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClass dismissed.\u201d He ended and started walking out but stopped to deal with a dagger that was thrown his way. But you dealt with it first a well placed saliva needle, pinning the dagger to the desk as it passed it rather than implanting into the book Yagari was holding to shield himself. He had enough experience to trace the trajectory back to you. \u201cMuch appreciated.\u201d You finished with a tip of his hat to which you teleported away as class was dismissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wandered in the woods for a little bit. You weren\u2019t really hungry but it was a routine and you kept to it. You crept up to a deer then just enthralled it enough to lay beside you as you sat against a tree, looking into the woods and petting him. His fur wasn\u2019t even close to Eve\u2019s but you caught yourself petting animals before or after you fed on them in memory of her and anticipation of eventually seeing her again. You were starting to miss her a lot more than you thought you would. Plus the deer had antlers, large ones, but you just accepted it for the moment until a twig snapped and a rifle wielding Yagari appeared. You looked over at him then whistled a little to tell the deer to go off and be on its way. It did so to which you stood and turned to the Vampire hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the feel of you.\u201d he said as he had his gun trained on you. You could tell when you moved more into the open that he could more than hit you with a shot under normal circumstances. He didn\u2019t even need to have it in normal firing position to establish a deadly amount accuracy. \u201cYou aren\u2019t like the other Vampires, what the hell are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a Vampire sir. If you want the specifics I suggest you ask the Headmaster. I am frankly too tired of repeating it over and over again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything that warrants this behavior though\u2026 unless I did something without knowing it was a problem, did I?\u201d you asked in a quizzical tone. It took a moment but he lowered his gun but still had it pointed in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. I just don\u2019t like a Vampire I don\u2019t understand. Stay in line or I\u2019ll have to put you down. I have no time to discuss wither an attack is warranted. If you do something questionable I won\u2019t wait to understand, I\u2019ll just kill you.\u201d you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d You answered. \u201cIs that all Mr. Tagari?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing so formal isn\u2019t like a vampire either.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve only been a Vampire for almost 2 years and still have my human family. So you can blame them for raising me to respect my elders. If it bothers you too much than I apologize but I can\u2019t just appeal to your definition of what Vampires are like.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever met a Vampire that apologizes to a Vampire Hunter either\u201d he said. You felt like doing something to get him to shoot you. You had already figured out that Zero\u2019s gun did nothing to you and wondered about this guy\u2019s gun. However his little slice of peace was all that was keeping him from going into fight mode so you left it be for the moment. Besides, you didn\u2019t need your new teacher against you right away. You had a feeling that it was better to have him on your side than not. \u201cBut I suppose for intercepting the dagger in class you deserve a little faith, but not much. Understand Vampire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d You answered with a light bow to which he smirked a bit, obviously hadn\u2019t been treated as such by Vampires too often. He turned and holstered his rifle on his back to which you vanished by the time he took a second look. Why was it that every time you wanted a little rest you were interrupted more times than not?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it I\u2019ll try to be gentle.\u201d A Vampire said as he broke from the floor beneath Yuuki to grab her. You had followed her after she went running after Zero. You had smelled trouble but wasn\u2019t sure why. Now you were certain why. You had yet to encounter a Level E before. An old fossil of a Vampire came to the dorm but Kaname asked you to stay out of it. Showing you to the leader of the Senate of Vampires would only complicate things. You agreed, especially because you felt him as he entered the dorm and you thought he was far too arrogant for your taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is a Level E.\u201d you said as you teleported next to Yuuki and tapped the grip it had on Yuuki\u2019s ankle with your foot, causing him to let go and her to leap up, grabbing her rod and face the impending Vampire. You were in you casual attire with your hands in your short pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother meal? Another meal!!!\u201d it screeched as it leapt from the floor and came toward you as you shut your eyes to blink. Too bad for him that it didn\u2019t lower your guard at all. All it took as a few Salvia needles to sent him into a wall and pin him there with his arms and legs stretched apart with at least 10 needles in each, along the length of the limbs and into points to keep him from getting loose. To the observer it appeared you had made your mouth into a silent machine gun with them shooting out just as fast. It hissed and still tried to get at you from its position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Caleb.\u201d Yuuki said as Zero came into the picture with Senri and Seiren coming from the other side with you and the needled Vampire finally shutting up with the situation becoming clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just lucky that I was board enough to play tag along.\u201d You joked and she frowned in a comical sense then ended in a slight smile as the others came into the mix. \u201cSo what are we suppose to do with him now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth sides look like we\u2019ve been sent on the same hunt.\u201d Senri said in an almost monotone voice. To this Seiren readied a blood made whip and Zero his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have to kill him?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLevel E\u2019s have lost all their reason and humanity. They are just a mindless feeding machine with no loyalty. So yes, he must die to stop his rampage and save whatever may be left of his doubtful level of humanity. In most cases no humanity or sense are left, like a Zombie.\u201d Zero answered, taking aim with his gun. He still didn\u2019t really like you but he did respect you enough and knew that you wouldn\u2019t allow someone to kill another unless there was a hell of a good reason. So explaining it to you was the only real way to let this one die. You got the concept and saw that both sides wanted the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen sense I stopped it I guess I should finish it. Not really my style though.\u201d You stated and shot on last needle into the Level E\u2019s head and turning it to ash. You had other ways of doing so but you didn\u2019t want to show all your tricks and the Saliva Needle was one they all knew you had, along with your teleportation and strength/speed. \u201cNow I\u2019m a killer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt needed to be done, you didn\u2019t have a choice. It saved both him and all his future victims.\u201d Yuuki said in an attempt to comfort you. The others weren\u2019t expecting you to have a problem with it. You were so insistent on protecting humans to almost any cost that they didn\u2019t think you would have a problem killing the most Evil thing that most would ever see in that world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it feel any better.\u201d You said in thought then shook your head to wipe it from your mind. \u201cAny of you need a ride back?\u201d you asked to which they accepted your offer and you teleported the group back to the academy. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh, this is going to be fun!\u201d said a voice from the front of class one evening. You weren\u2019t out of your seat as you were ready for class to start, so you just looked up at her and observed the new girl. She was a Night Class uniform and if she was there that meant she was a new student. You would wait until she introduced herself but that was done by Kaname as she almost immediately started pushing internal warning and comfort buttons, jumping and gliding from place to place while doing so, doting on Kaname with a little extra brown nosing. You had the fleeting suspicion that she was merely acting as such though. You didn\u2019t even need to read her mind to know that the mind inside the body wasn\u2019t a match and sensed two minds inside, one possessing the other but the first not fighting it so you left it alone. You soon learned her name, or at least the name of the body that both were using, Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t you smell scrumptious.\u201d She said as she landed on the desktop in front of you, if you were a pervert it would\u2019ve been easy to look up her skirt from your sitting position and her squatting and staring one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so. Thanks for the compliment\u2026 I guess.\u201d You said as you gazed into her eyes without flinching in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Vampire to.\u201d Senri said in his impassive tone said from his position. The way he said in made a few of them chuckle a little. You however didn\u2019t waver as you looked into her eyes, retrieving information from her such as what type of person was in there on top of this presumed Maria. She had the feeling that you got when you spoke with Kaname. It either meant she was overly ignorant or a pureblood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is, then why does he smell like a tasty human?\u201d Maria asked as she jumped one desk back and looked to the others in an innocent mask of emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans aren\u2019t allowed in the Night Class.\u201d Mr. Yagari stated as he came in. \u201cGet to your seats, this is a class room not a amusement park.\u201d He looked at Maria a little longer than was necessary for his teacher act but then moved on as soon as everyone did as he said. Although you saw Maria look back and up to you a few times, trying to get a reaction but when it failed she stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou teleported away after class, not to keen on her impulsive and confrontational attitude, plus, you would only have a problem with her if she attacked a human at the school. Vampires could ask for you help but were usually too proud to do so and they were less helpless then humans were. You were in the at the end of a animal meal and letting it go off when she finally caught up with you. You turned to her midway through retracting your fangs and licking the residual blood off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow disgusting, you drink from animals instead of humans.\u201d She stated in an almost arrogant attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes well it is better than nothing. I\u2019ve yet to meet a human here that would allow me to feed on them of their own free will. Yuuki is the only one that might and she already satiates Zero\u2019s hunger.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are here for us to enjoy.\u201d She retorted in a almost shy sense but still had that underlining arrogance that you detested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell not around here they aren\u2019t. I\u2019m not about to debate the philosophy of feeding on willing and unwilling humans with you as it would be a colossal waste of time. However I am one of the people that protect the humans around here. I would advise you not feeding on them or trying to.\u201d You said back, the last part more serious in an obvious warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you could stop me huh?\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to test it Miss. Hio.\u201d You said and her eyes narrowed at the named you used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d she asked, suddenly more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did my homework and the only one that could posses someone and would as you have done with your personality was someone named; Shizuka Hio, a Pure Blood. Wasn\u2019t hard after that to figure who you were. I guess with your point of view you should know that I don\u2019t really care what you are, my warning still stands. Please don\u2019t force me to do anything against you. If you are after a Vampire then you can go about your business. Most of the time they are too pride filled to ask for my help. But if you threaten a human while here, I don\u2019t care if you are a Pure Blood, I\u2019ll choose the human over you without hesitation.\u201d You answered her eyes narrowing at your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are dangerous words for such a low level Vampire to be saying to a Pure Blood.\u201d she said with a glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake them as you will. You\u2019ve been warned and now I can protect the humans without being morally conflicted in roughing you up a little if necessary. Other than that\u2026\u201d you said then changed postures and bowed like you did to Kaname. \u201c\u2026 it was an honor to meet you and I will not spread your information unless Lord Kuran asked me to. Have a good night Lady Hio.\u201d You said then vanished, teleporting to your dorm room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You even stayed out of it when Ms. Hio told Yuuki that she would help Zero if she offered herself to her or Kaname Kuran\u2019s corpse. Ms. Hio was also watching you when she could. She watched intently as you trained in the day and your other activities. You could feel her eyes and as such you served as a perfect little distraction for Kaname. He only looked at you once to confirm both of you were on the same page and that was all you needed. The Ball was not much for you because your attractant was always down and no one even noticed you were there watching. However when Yuuki ran from the building and Zero after her you appeared next to Kaname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to protect her? She won\u2019t need it with Zero there.\u201d You asked after he was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, as much as I wish Zero\u2019s end in his participation with Yuuki, it is necessary for him to face this and deal with it. I can trust him in that much at least.\u201d Kaname answered, obviously not ok with her being in danger as more glass shattered behind him in due to no small part to his temper and ability. \u201cHowever you did do well in distracting her for me without me having to tell you anything, I thank you for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was her own arrogance that led to this. I did nothing more than I usually do, but I\u2019ll take the compliment while I can get it.\u201d You answered. \u201cI would like to speak with you about something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it have to be at this moment?\u201d Kaname asked as he was looking to get moving for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can be on the way.\u201d You answered as you walked with him. \u201cDo you trust me Lord Kuran?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Came a simple answer as you two walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all trust you Caleb, or you wouldn\u2019t be afforded the privilege of staying here among us.\u201d he answered then glanced over at you. \u201cWhat is this all about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t feel very trusted. I can clearly help in many instances. I understand that sometimes you shelter me as you know I don\u2019t like killing people and I appreciate it, such as what you are about to do. I don\u2019t know what you are going to do but you have that death feeling around you. But I can\u2019t understand why in other instances I am excluded.\u201d You replied, parts of the statement turned Kaname toward you but as you kept walking so did he. In the end he was content and ready to answer, more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile we trust you we do not want to get you involved in our affairs. It is our problems not yours.\u201d He stated in a formal matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all due respect Lord Kuran that is full of crap.\u201d You retorted and he was slightly put off by your forwardness. \u201cI am already part of it until I take my leave. You can\u2019t say you are looking out for my life because I can\u2019t die. The only thing you accomplish by that is distancing me from what I am trying so hard to achieve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriends and family. I learned the moment I knew my life was changed that race and species don\u2019t determine a family. I am trying so hard to connect with you as you seem to be the only, Pure Blood, that is halfway decent. I like all of you\u2026 minus Ms. Hio and that old fossil that visited the other day. But when you all push me away and not allow me to help I feel\u2026 unwanted, not trusted, and a burden to those I wish to help.\u201d You answered. Kaname looked down a moment and was struggling to remain focused and also to think on your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I will think on this later on tonight and later. If you will wait I will answer you but the task I am currently going to needs my full attention as does your matter. Allow me to finish this first?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I wish you well Lord Kuran.\u201d You said then stopped and let him continue on to his objective. You stood there for a long while then teleported back to your dorm and laid in the air above your bed still thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a constant pang on your mind. You were suppose to be learning from the other Vampires but in the end they kept you at an arm\u2019s distance and never included you in anything. In a way you did it to yourself as you put a high emphasis on humans and such but you had got the feeling that they appreciated it, especially Kaname when it came to your protection of Yuuki. However even her wouldn\u2019t ask you to heal her like you offered. You lay there awaiting whatever Kaname was up to, to end and he would address your concerns. It didn\u2019t help that you were well rested and couldn\u2019t just sleep until morning so you just floated there and dwelled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCaleb.\u201d Called Kaname one day in class. It had been a while since that night and you had sensed one Ms. Hio expire and Kaname grow stronger. You could also smell his blood in Zero\u2019s veins. To this effect you had let it slide but Zero had joined the class this time and the others, who had significantly increased in number, were now silent as he addressed you. The teacher was either late of this was now a private session and the presence of Zero almost confirmed that, as scorned as he may be by the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lord Kuran.\u201d You replied as you stood out of respect. But you were hoping he was about to answer your question to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have shared your thoughts with the others and thought about it a great deal. I have now figured out the main reason why we don\u2019t depend on you for tasks.\u201d He said and your attention grew with rasp focus. \u201cYou won\u2019t kill.\u201d He said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d You answered as you had always thought that was a good quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs noble as our company is we are above humans and at odds with others that think as both you and I hate. However we all know that even if you were facing down a level E you would try to find a way to save the person that is already lost. You told me that you were sent here to learn from Vampires and this is what you might be needing to learn. Vampires must be able to kill without hesitation although the reason for killing must be found as well. But once that reason is reached the Vampire must not falter.\u201d Kaname answered you as the others looked on in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I can\u2019t be a proper Vampire as long as I don\u2019t kill?\u201d you asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a race you are no doubt a proper Vampire but your actions as a race point toward your human mindset. You are still human at heart and until you learn this we can\u2019t give you more than what we think you can handle. Which is why I am charging you with the human\u2019s safe keeping at this academy. Hopefully in your completion of your task you will find your reason for killing.\u201d He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy reason? What reason could I possibly have?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is up to you. Most of the arrogant ones we both hate do so out of just that, arrogance, believing themselves better then all else. Some think that all life under them should be taken for their pleasure. Some do so to serve, some to have fun, and some to protect. You need to find your reason and make it yours and part of who you are. However when the time arises you should feel no ill feelings about carrying the sentence of death out. Do you understand?\u201d Kaname asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Lord Kuran. I\u2019ll protect the humans at this school and in so doing find my answer.\u201d You replied after a long thought. \u201cDoes that mean I should leave the protection of you and the other Vampires to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you are only responsible for the humans.\u201d Kaname answered to which you bowed and Zero exited with that being decided. One thing that was in his mind. Even if he didn\u2019t like Vampires, despite him being one himself, he had grown accustomed to you protecting the humans already and knew that this only solidified things.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cEnough!\u201d you boomed finally as you looked down from a flight position above Rido on the roof. As per Kaname\u2019s instruction you had been protecting the humans but had yet to find a true reason to kill, until now. You had watched this Rido Vampire since he possessed Senri\u2019s body and was at a loss at how someone could be that emotionless about taking so much life, even the innocent lives of his family and their children. You just didn\u2019t understand but from that understanding you found your reason and now floated above the scene as he ordered his\u2026 followers and such to attack and feed on your Vampire friends while he was preparing to feed on Yuki, use to be Cross but now Kuran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you finally arrived you pitiful excuse for a Vampire.\u201d Rido stated and the others laughed as they continued to do as they willed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said enough.\u201d Your voice was ominous as your power spiked and the effects from it doing so were in full swing. Howling winds that blew at your violently while the elements around you took effect. Gravity increased while winds blew at the Vampires as you got closer. Lightning was branching from you while your eyes glowed and your body looked to be radiating heat, as small flames and static were just barely rolling over your skin. With your touch down on the roof all the hostile vampires that were attempting to feed on your friends, with the exception of Rido, were turned to ash. You had been taught Kaname\u2019s trick and didn\u2019t mind using it as it cost lest then running around and slicing their heads off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you killed them.\u201d Hanabusa said. \u201cDoes that mean you have found your reason to kill?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I have chosen that I will only kill those who take life themselves. Any that take life one way or another are legitimate targets but my personal moral choice will be to those that do so to me, mine, and to those who have yet to take a life. Such as this piece of garbage.\u201d You answered then glared at Rido as he held Yuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so useless. You can\u2019t do anything while I have this one can\u2026\u201d he started until a gunshot was heard and he was forced to let go by a bullet from behind. This allowed Yuki to use her rod and escape and use it to bring Zero under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m a fool?\u201d you bellowed in your current ominous voice, void of its regular kindness and passive vigor. Instead the area around you seemed to shake and light up with energy, both dark and light as they swirled around within a 200 yard radius. It didn\u2019t damage anything you didn\u2019t want but it was far from pleasant. All the level E Vampires that were still out there and hostile Vampires were turned to ash, well those that were in the confines of that area anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible, no Vampire has that much power.\u201d Rido declared as if wondering how he could obtain it. But before he could finish that thought you zoomed forward and underneath him in a position to knock him with a charged uppercut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to impress you. I\u2019m here to kill you.\u201d you said as he recovered from the small shock of you being within striking distance so quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so quick that there was actual indent and uprooted stone from your sudden decent then more when you brought your fist up and sent him into the sky with a resounding \u2018THUME and CRASH that could\u2019ve been easily mistaken for the lighting that was discharging around the campus. But you didn\u2019t stay where you were for long as you were far from done with him. You flew with like quickness as before and struck him again, and again, and again. Your goal was to break every bone in his body while playing a Vampire pinball with his body up in the air with your strikes, wither it be a kick, punch, or what have you. As the hits became more intense parts of his body were evaporated as the separated from his body. You made sure his non essential parts were first then moved on to other parts and saved his head and heart for last. Even pounding his skin and other organs apart separately until you split his being and he was pounded and ripped down further than the ash you had rendered the others to so easily. There wasn\u2019t even a trace or smell of him to shower down to the people observing. All they could do was watch as their enemy was reduced to a voidless pulp without the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his demise the sun started coming up and you were starting to lose some of the power that was making your current action easy. So as you floated down to the roof again you used your dwindling power to fix everything that had been destroyed by the whole ordeal, including what you destroyed.  By the time you were done you dropped onto the roof in a slump the rest of the 5 feet as the sun hit you and your power and effects from it was gone from the area, minus your severely drain body as it laid between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You found that you were being held up by someone as your fangs were buried in their neck. They must\u2019ve forced your fangs in as you sure as hell didn\u2019t have the strength previously to bite anyone. Another spike of energy coursed through you as you were getting more than just blood, you were getting power. Not just the power from feeding either. You were getting a boat load of new power. Finally you were able to stand and react to a Yuki in your mouth, well her neck anyway, and her blood flowing into you. You took her gift and drank but stopped well before than you had to and you could tell she was liking it, perhaps too much. But finally you pulled out of her and opened your eyes to her looking longingly into your eyes as you had come to expect from feeding on people, now you were holding her as she recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuki, you\u2026 Thank you Lady Kuran.\u201d You said as your fangs retracted. Strange, for how much you drank you would normally need ten times that much to replenish like she had done for you. Perhaps it was the extra power from drinking from a Pure Blood. You ended your embrace by taking her hand and holding it properly, bowing then backing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, that felt\u2026 really good. It felt nothing like the Vampires of this world.\u201d She admitted as she touched where your fangs came in then you both were forced back to your surroundings but the people around. You were in the courtyard with Kaname, Zero, The Headmaster, and of course Yuki. You then looked at a side glance from Kaname to see Mr. Vale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb.\u201d Kaname called as he came closer from where he had advance to Yuki\u2019s side. \u201cI am glad I was able to help you find what it means to be a true Vampire. I am also at a loss to thank you for what you have done for us after you found your reason. It was a sight both horrifying and awe inspiring at the same time.\u201d He said in his usual tone when addressing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an honor Lord Kuran. You have all taught me what I needed and I find that to be more than a fair exchange. I am glad that the Vampire before me had put this world in my path to learn from.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, your family awaits and Eve is very instant that I bring you back immediately so she can have some R&amp;R with her. Lady Kelsey has also expressed a desire to have you back as soon as possible.\u201d Mr. Vale stated and you smiled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do have girlfriends at home. Can\u2019t believe even humans in your world would actually fall for a Vampire.\u201d Zero stated in his normal biased tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all they\u2019d kill you for saying that. Second they are not humans, well Eve and Kelsey aren\u2019t at least. Eve is a sentient spider that I helped when she was really small and now as a 3 foot tall spider she is just part of my family. Kelsey is a really close, similar to my relationship with Lady Kuran but more involved, nothing romantic. Although she is a Succubus so we do hang out a lot at our human school. Humans in my world are just as ignorant as here, except my family.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I thought our family was weird.\u201d Yuki stated with a blank look on her face with the rest of them at the things you just rattled off. They would ask if you were kidding but they never really saw you kidding before like that. That and it was just too crazy to be a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeadmaster Cross. Thank you very much for allowing me to attend your academy.\u201d You said to him with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stay?\u201d he asked in his carefree tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid not. My Mom would rip me a new one if I missed our family vacation.\u201d You joked back, it was even funnier to them because it looked like the Vampire that just did what they just saw was actually afraid of the human woman in the world they couldn\u2019t follow to. \u201cOk Mr. Vale, let\u2019s go home.\u201d You stated and he accompanied you in walking away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye Caleb!\u201d called Yuki with a wave that you returned in a pleasant manner without looking before you stepped out of their world and back into yours as if stepping through an invisible and undetectable door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d a voice said as you were shot from your feet by a large hairy ball with legs you knew to be Eve. You floated back to your feet and held her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m back.\u201d You said as you looked down at her many eyes as they gazed up at you from just below your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou smell different.\u201d Eve said as she whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree. Where the hell have you been?\u201d Kelsey asked in her Succubus form, obviously cross that you hadn\u2019t told her before leaving her for a whole week. She wasn\u2019t as possessive as Eve but with you being the only other \u2018freak\u2019 she could hang around with at her age it did effect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about story time to make up for it. I\u2019ve been through a lot in that short time.\u201d You countered to which Isaac jumped up and down with anticipation and they all agreed. Nr. Vale had already disappeared before you could thank him, as was his way. You sat in the air as you started.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, you have fun?\u201d asked Mrs. Dremer as you teleported into their home to drop off Kelsey after the Family Vacation. It went remarkably similar to the previous year, even as far as hardness factor. You talked with them about the lessons you learned but you didn\u2019t need to. The whole experience was captured on a single copy of overwritten series. You watched both the original and the one you were involved in to see the difference but they were proud of how you handled things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I had loads of fun. I even killed him a few times.\u201d Kelsey stated as she embraced her mother, very glad to be home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever thought you would be so happy about that.\u201d Mrs. Dremer stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb was right, it is rather fun. He can\u2019t die and he doesn\u2019t kill any of us. Eve and I were like awesome and were able to help turn the tide more than once.\u201d Kelsey stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery true, last year my family only had Eve to help them from the instinctual side. With two predators or \u2018freaks\u2019 on their side it was a lot harder for me and more rewarding for us all. That and she really got along well with my cousins and family.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to come up next time to see what the fuss is all about. Did you\u2026\u201d she started as she nudged Kelsey to which she blushed then nodded. \u201cSo how did she taste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she tasted wonderful. To be honest though\u2026 not as good as humans. I think that Humans are just Vampire\u2019s natural feeding source. But that by no means made her taste bad at all. A full blooded succubus is definitely a rare treat to have.\u201d You answered with a little bow, something you were use to from your little time with Lord Kuran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what on your end, is it really\u2026?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked Kelsey and she nodded with an even deeper blush that almost made her completely red. \u201cI hope I can work up the courage later, if you wouldn\u2019t mind another succubus snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t mind that at all. But I don\u2019t think of anybody I drink from as a snack. I have seen how Vampires that treat others like that are and I strongly dislike them.\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it Caleb, was just teasing you.\u201d she said in return. She was insanely good at covering herself and without reading her mind she had at least a hundred years of personal experience over you to make it believable. Although you could see a little tell that she was glad you made that distinction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat aside, I think a few of my family have a crush on you.\u201d You said to Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, it must be really bad if you noticed it. A few of your cousins were really flirting at the end there.\u201d Kelsey agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we had the flirt patrol out at least.\u201d You stated to which you both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlirt patrol?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few of the younger more mischievous cousins pulled pranks on the guys that were to forward with Kelsey, or in their terms were getting to \u2018gross\u2019; pulling down shorts, tying together shoelaces, blowing air horns, giving them laxatives to name a few. Between Isaac, Samuel, Dana, and a few others it was rather comical to watch.\u201d You responded after you and Kelsey were slowing the laughter down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you had fun. You need some blood before you go? I got a few slaves you could drink from.\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the offer but I can\u2019t. Remember? Not unless they are themselves willing. Your slaves can\u2019t think for themselves anymore so I can\u2019t drink from them.\u201d You stated, again with a bow that got her to smile both in appreciation and in growing understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later Caleb.\u201d Kelsey said after a hug from each of them. You waved then teleported away to finish up the rest of your transportations.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having a Police Captain on your side in case of legal trouble could be useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have been a royal pain in the butt. Are they really that bad behind all the scenes?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I can\u2019t say much outside of the office. Do you have some kind of relation or connection to them?\u201d Doug asked as he wondered how you could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore indirectly and very distant. Quite frankly not more than thinking their irritating but more than enough to cause an impact if I wanted to. Papa, can I\u2026 work on this with them for a little bit?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did say last year that you should wait a year. I\u2019ll trust you to do what you need to do. It is your decision on all the rest, we trust you.\u201d Papa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get the feeling that this is something that should be discussed somewhere else.\u201d Doug stated to which you just nodded. \u201cOk, you ok with riding in the back of a police car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, never been in one before.\u201d You said with a general intrigue to which you all said your goodbyes and last bits of cryptic advice before them driving you off to the Police Station and Doug escorted you to his office. It was definitely a neat experience as people came and went. You were glad that you didn\u2019t wear shoes with hidden knives anymore. It would\u2019ve just been strange and suspicious with the metal detectors and whatnot. They didn\u2019t bother checking you for weapons as you still only had on your usual black shorts, black sleeveless with the silver dragon on the back and glyph on the front, and black running shoes that replaced the old boots with the knife you use to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, why don\u2019t you start by saying how you know the Vampire Clan.\u201d Doug said as he closed the door to his personal office. You looked around and saw the camera was on. He noticed this as you looked at it then at him. He in return looked at you with a questioning glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of what I can say with other people listening and watching is not very informative.\u201d You stated and he narrowed his gaze a little. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anything illegal or bad like that, just not something I can have too many people knowing, and definitely not on any record. I promise you that it is worth only you knowing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll trust you on this one. We have been in the same church for all your life and your Dad has mentored me a lot. Which is why I am so high while so young.\u201d He said as he unplugged multiple surveillance systems and locked the door, as a final precaution after closing blinds and anything else that people could use to spy or gain intel on what was said in the room. You also materialized things so that people outside couldn\u2019t \u2018accidentally\u2019 overhear or see. \u201cOk Caleb, what is this big secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, this is going to be really hard to believe but I promise you it is true and that I can prove it.\u201d You said then thought carefully about it for a little while then, with a loud sigh, continued. \u201cThe reason I can help is because I AM a Vampire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Come on Caleb, are you going to tell me or not?\u201d Doug asked as he got up but you did as well but in a way that made him fall back into his chair. You floated up in a relaxed position along with slightly dimming the lights in the room. You also turned your eyes red and protruded your fangs. He looked up at you then at the case he placed his gun then back at you. But you lowered yourself again then retracted all the theatrics along with teeth and eyes. \u201cCaleb\u2026 you are\u2026 please explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI became a Vampire near 2 years ago from the last one. Without going into the true history and what is B.S. for a few weeks I\u2019ll just answer what you need to know. Yes I am a Vampire, no there is not anymore, no I am not officiated with the Vampire Clan, no I can\u2019t turn anyone, no I can\u2019t leave fang marks when I feed, and most of what you think you know about Vampires is B.S.. However this is what your current situation is. You have the only Vampire of this age offering you his services, as long as this remains our little secret.\u201d You answered and he seemed to be in \u2018Police Captain mode\u2019, listening and archiving everything you said in order to perceive what to do next. You just hoped it would be an option that didn\u2019t make you do anything drastic.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cS..ss\u2026 So you are a\u2026 real Vampire?\u201d he asked to which you nodded. \u201cWait a minute, it is the middle of the day and you aren\u2019t turning to ash or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, like I said, most of what you know about Vampires is B.S. You see the Vampire before me created those stories to protect herself and the next one when she passed the gift on to me. Basically it helps that all I have to do to disprove someone saying I\u2019m a Vampire is to walk into the sunlight.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 You\u2019re right, it would take a very long time to get up to speed and I have a feeling that you aren\u2019t too thrilled about people knowing in general.\u201d Doug stated to which you nodded in agreement. \u201cSo the question remains, why tell me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first reason is I really am getting irritated by this \u2018Vampire Clan\u2019 that is making me look bad. They are so annoying and are really starting to push my buttons. Second is that it would only help if I had a friend this deep into law enforcement to help if there is ever a misunderstanding between me and something I do. Not to mention the talk of some of my nonhuman friends.\u201d You answered, that last part catching his utmost attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I thought you said you were the only one.\u201d He almost demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only Vampire, definitely, the only predator or what my family refers to as Freaks, no. Currently I have a 5 foot tall sentient spider at home named eve and a Succubus. Before you ask, they both are good people and while they both have their moments they don\u2019t cause trouble. Eve, the spider, stays in my house and never leaves\u2026 for the moment.\u201d You answered for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2026 I can\u2019t really say that I can just roll over with this. If what you are saying is true, then you all are huge security risks. I also don\u2019t like the idea of me being your scapegoat.\u201d Doug said in a stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mean it that way. It just would be helpful if someone accuses us of something or we help someone that we have someone that can vouch for us doing exactly that. Those of us that aren\u2019t human\u2026 it is hard enough to remain defending humans without the ones we are trying to save turning us into lab rats or something. It would also require you to actually ask us if you think we did something so we can explain ourselves. Such as; the fang marks on the murder victims that I hear about on the news. I have multiple reasons why I had nothing to do with it but without someone like yourself to buffer hard line accusations I wouldn\u2019t be able to explain myself before we both did things we wish we hadn\u2019t.\u201d you tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026 That makes me feel a little better. Even so, now that you brought it up, can you prove that it wasn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. You almost felt offended but, like he said, you did bring it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for starters I was up north all summer. The other reason is\u2026 well my saliva is a healing agent amongst other things. Even if I wanted to I can\u2019t leave fang marks on anything. I would show you but I don\u2019t think you would let me bite into you just to prove it.\u201d You said to which he held out his arm after rolling up his sleeve. \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the Captain. If I am going to vouch for you then I need to know for sure. Now hurry up while I still have the guts to do this.\u201d Doug stated as he held out his arm to you with obvious anxiety about it. You took the arm then bit into his wrist. Then started the normal reaction base that people had with you doing so. You only drank a little but he got the picture as you separated then he wiped away the excess blood to see no fang marks. \u201cWow\u2026 not what I was expecting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get that a lot. But it makes sense when you think about it. The bite itself stimulates arousal so that blood flows faster and increases the willingness of the\u2026 prey I guess. But only I can make it feel like that. These others from the Vampire Clan are just pretenders and feel the same as if you bit yourself. They can\u2019t even drain a body properly.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re willing to help with this little problem?\u201d He asked as he regained his composer and cleaned himself up a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. As a friend, I\u2019ll help you when I can. But understand that asking me to do something that takes a considerable amount of power will require me to drink some blood. In a sense, blood is like fuel for my Vampire powers so if you want me to clear a building of terrorists while not drinking from them then have something I can drink. Usually Papa grabs a pint of packaged blood that we get delivered from the hospital when he needs me to do something overly strenuous\u2026 or lets me drink from him.\u201d You replied to his question, making sure you were clear that you doing this as a friend not a dictator or slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Dad allows you to drink from him?\u201d He asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. You felt what it feels like. Sure there are limitations but they really don\u2019t mind. My whole family knows what I am and we all help each other. I help them get cars out of ditches and what not and they let me drink their blood if I want. Actually, some actually beg me to do it, which is a little weird to say the least.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am guessing so. Forgive my rudeness, this is just hard to take in.\u201d Doug said as he thought about it for a while. You didn\u2019t interrupt as he seemed to be deep in thought until he sat up again to address you. \u201cI will accept your offer. I will be the only one in the station that knows for sure. Others may become curious but I won\u2019t formally tell anyone without you here. That goes for your\u2026 friends as well, well the nonhuman ones at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand and thank you Mr. Doug. Now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah, take a look at these.\u201d Doug said as he recovered from the little information overload to bring the conversation back to what this was all about in the first place. He handed you a folder to which you opened it on the desk. You flipped over pictures of the presumed leaders, their locations, and photos of crimes linked to them. They were very horrid pictures indeed, even for your eyes. \u201cAs bad as this sounds, I can\u2019t do anything about this. This Clan may be annoying to you but it has infiltrated and has ties with almost every agency in the country. Even if I started a campaign against them I would be out of here before the ink dried on my order. It would be fine if it was a halfway decent group but these people literally get away with murder while I have to just sit here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, so who\u2019s their leader? Maybe I can talk with him about it. I don\u2019t really want to reveal myself to them but. Perhaps I can appeal to the pretenders as the being they are attempting to be. Either that or I have to deal with them.\u201d You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anything is better than what we got now. Even if you stop them from just murdering one person it would be a start. To answer your question though, their leader is named Dracula.\u201d He said and got a comical face from you. \u201cI know, but with how powerful they\u2019ve become it has failed to be a laughing matter. Apparently this leader is the head guy and is like the DON for their group. While he hands down orders and responsibilities, whatever he says is what happens. One time we saw all of them stand on one leg whenever they went anywhere and found out he ordered them to do it just for kicks, and they all did it without question.\u201d Doug finished as he flipped the folder in front of you to the picture of the man. He looked like a modern day giant. You wouldn\u2019t know until you met him but the stats said he was over 8 feet tall and weighed 400 pounds, and by the looks of it there wasn\u2019t any body fat on the man. His demeanor was rustic but also arrogant like one would expect for a someone in his position and someone who watched too many Vampire movies. His suit didn\u2019t have the traditional long collar or cape but it was all black with the lining being red. Finally his eyes were red, but you could see a sliver of brown where the contacts were too far over, and his fangs that were obviously surgically implanted. They were actually a little longer than yours if you had them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is the guy.\u201d You said as you analyzed the image. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have a way in do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 yes we do but it is not something I would normally recommend. You see we send people to him from time to time in order to retain some diplomatic relations and control over him. But lately they\u2019ve rarely came back in anything more than a body bag\u2026 of course with their throats dug out by fang marks.\u201d Doug reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you go to them?\u201d You asked more directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis building is where Dracula resides. He doesn\u2019t even bother hiding that fact anymore.\u201d Doug answered as he flipped to a skyscraper with dark colored glass around it. It was abnormally designed in a clear attempt to keep sunlight out. You had seen the thing being built in record time but didn\u2019t think that the Vampire Clan was the one doing it. If they had enough pull to make such a loud proclamation then they could obviously do some nasty damage. \u201cIt is a place that we, or more specifically I, can\u2019t go. The amount of money he brings in to the city even has the Mayor and the Governor protect him from their positions. If you can do something about it than I beg you to do so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to beg. Like I said, they are getting insanely annoying on my part. That and as a friend I don\u2019t really need a reason to help out.\u201d You answered him to which brought the first genuine smile that you had seen on him since this whole conversation started. He was obviously under a lot of pressure from people all around. \u201cOne more thing, here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked as you gave him the magical card that implanted your glyph in him like your family. He looked at the design and realized it was the same one that was on your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my symbol or \u2018glyph\u2019 as I like to call it. Once you touched that card it was magically transmitted into your body. It is nothing more than an anchor to teleport to if you are in trouble. I can\u2019t spy on you or anything. I just give them to my friends and family so if something happens I can be there in the blink of an eye\u2026 well as soon as I find out something is wrong.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Caleb, I think\u2026\u201d he said as he looked at it then put it into his desk. \u201cNow, do you need anything for this? I mean like supplies to help or anything. I may not be allowed to help you directly but I can donate something to a friend in need.\u201d He asked as he verbally sidestepped in a way that could help you with things if you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, wouldn\u2019t want you to get in trouble. I can handle it. Thanks anyway. I was really nervous about sharing my secret, always am in fact. After all, it isn\u2019t exactly the easiest thing for people to take in. It helps a great deal that you are ok with it\u2026 perhaps not comfortable yet, but ok.\u201d You answered as you stood and shook his hand while taking the darkening effect you were still doing out of the room, along with the materializing and sealing things you were doing to make the room secure. As a final precaution you closed the folder and moved it with your abilities to where he pulled it from the filing cabinet. \u201cI\u2019ll stop by to let you know how it went.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be careful, I don\u2019t want you getting into a bad situation. I\u2019ve lost too many good people to this bunch.\u201d He said with a legitimate concern as he finished shaking your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Remember, I can\u2019t die.\u201d You said with a smile that he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am guessing I\u2019ll be awed by your abilities more times than not. I better get use to it.\u201d Doug said as he started plugging things back in. You heard the whir of motors inside the devices as they powered up and started doing their jobs. Then he straightened with a smile. \u201cThank you for your help Caleb and I hope to see you again soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can count on it.\u201d You said with a sly wink as he opened the door and escorted you out. You could now feel the eyes of many people on you. You couldn\u2019t tell if it was people that were Vampire Clan plants or officers that didn\u2019t like their Captain having a secret conversation with you. Either way the crowd was somewhat hostile and you hailed a cab to take you to the V.C. (Vampire Clan) building. He shook slightly as you told him this but punched it in and started to it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you got out of the Cab and it sped away, almost before you paid, you looked up at the massive structure before you. On the outside it looked to be made of sheer black glass. If there wasn\u2019t any lights around a human could easily walk right into it without seeing it. You tapped the ground with your foot and the vibrations told you that there was a large complex underneath as well. But your eyes weren\u2019t deceived as you could easily see inside and cameras watching you as you walked toward the entrance and entered the building. Inside it was dark with a red glow around. You almost chuckled as it seemed very cheesy to you but once the door closed you found that it was quite ideal for your preference of color and light range. The sun was still up but almost over the horizon so the woman at the desk shielded her eyes until the door closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area in front of the door was wide open with people in offices buzzing around, some of the glass walls were tinted or becoming that way. You thought it was really cool as you saw someone observe your entry as someone brought a young woman into his office and he dimmed the tint so people outside couldn\u2019t see what he was doing. You didn\u2019t like what he could possibly be doing but found it interesting how such a see through wall could offer such visual protection to those that willed it. The Woman at the desk glared at you as you took a moment to look around from your spot then walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want human?\u201d She almost hissed at you. Despite her very attractive, secretary type figure, her persona was easily recognized as was her smell. As the others at your school and such, she didn\u2019t take traditional baths or showers. Although you did sense that she was clean, just not washed. As if she had substituted a diaper wipe for her much needed shower. You could also smell the hint of old blood on her as if she had spilled some on her and didn\u2019t clean it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am here to see Mr. Dracula.\u201d You stated as politely as you could with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what makes you think that he wants to see you?\u201d She asked coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fail to see how that matters. If I am an inconvenience he can just deal with me like any other human. If I am worth his time than he will want to see me too. Either by food or worth there isn\u2019t really a reason why it would be a bad idea.\u201d You answered, using your attractant a little to make her more compliant but not overly so to be obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see even a useless human has a point from time to time. Ash, take this meat sack up stairs to Lord Dracula.\u201d She ordered to which a blonde and slender version of the attendant behind the desk quickly got up and just motioned you to follow her. You could feel her look at you as you glances around. It was evident that she expected the looks she probably got in bulk from the others. But for you it wasn\u2019t that impressive, heck you had two Succubus women at your disposal if you wished it. This Vampire wannabe wasn\u2019t even in their league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI catch you looking at my ass and I\u2019ll drink you dry.\u201d She threatened as she ushered you into an elevator then stood in front of you and the door as it rose. The Elevator was also glass but the reflective kind from the inside. It was probably like that so that people outside wouldn\u2019t be the ones surprised by those that came out. The woman in front of you seemed slightly put off that you weren\u2019t even trying to notice her body. Perhaps that is why she said what she did but either way, compared to what you were use to, she was nothing. Her scent didn\u2019t improve things either in the small box as it rose to the top floor before the few roof floors. You quickly wondered why there were 5 floors labeled for the roof but left it there for now. \u201cOut.\u201d She stated as she got off and stood aside to command you out of the elevator then led you into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like the other rooms. This one was just one large space with a clear floor that you remember being black from the bottom. As evidence to the man fitting Dracula\u2019s description at the far end of the room with a twirling chair that was looking over the city at the present moment. The dark glass kept the sun out while not impeding hit view. As you were brought forward you noticed a guard on the perimeter every 20 feet. They looked like ninja or something, each with a different weapon; some with swords or like weapons and some with guns. There was even one large guy with a Rocket launcher strapped to his back as he stood at attention like the rest. They stood so still that if you couldn\u2019t sense the difference you could easily mistake them for statues. You looked down again and noticed that the floor had a zoom feature of sorts and you could see all the way to the front door without using your Vampire sight. You guessed it was Dracula\u2019s way of keeping his people on their toes and honest\u2026 well with him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lord, a human has come baring your name.\u201d the woman said after kneeling and bowing. She glared at you as you just stood there but didn\u2019t move while the man not more than 50 feet away now turned in his chair to look at you. One of the quieter guards came up behind you and forced you to your knees and put your head down. You could\u2019ve easily stopped him but the room was dark enough that a normal human wouldn\u2019t be able to see it coming and that was what you were disguised as, so you let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be all my child.\u201d Said the deep voice that easily targeted the man as he stood. The woman backed away in a bow then quickly left into the elevator. You waited for her to be out of sight range (for them) before standing again. \u201cWhat insolence, humans kneel before me.\u201d You saw now that the profile picture wasn\u2019t lying as he stood 8 feet tall and was rather intimidating looking without losing the whole arrogant Vampire thing that established most people and \u2018Vampire Clan people\u2019 like him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because humans kneel before their Vampires and I am the leader of the Vampire Clan.\u201d He answered then waved his hand to which the guards came toward you. They didn\u2019t see the need to draw any weapons, big mistake on their part. You mimicked his motion but used the ability you gained from Kaname to forcibly restrain the others and send them against a glass wall, locking them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the stupid one. You work so hard to become something you\u2019re not and are blind when what you are trying to become is standing right in front of you.\u201d you said as the sun went all the way down and you let your eyes glow in the relative dark, of course all this was done after you disrupted the surveillance systems he had for recording your antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 are you?\u201d he asked in almost shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should be obvious. I am an actual Vampire, not this fake version that you humans have come up with.\u201d You answered as your voice became ominous in the large space. Your heard the ding of the elevator as it was about to open again but pinched with your fingers to meld the doors together, locking the dozen guards inside of it. \u201cNow, let\u2019s talk Mr. fake vampire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk? Fake Vampire?\u201d he asked in a combination of anger and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is unless\u2026\u201d you started then lifted him up then brought him closer to you as you took to floating to his eye level. \u201c\u2026 you want to fight.\u201d You stated as you slowly grew your fangs so he could easily see them you then put a finger to one of his fangs as if to test them as he was held suspended in the air. \u201cCute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026 I\u2019ll talk with you.\u201d he almost whimpered to which you dropped him to the floor and stayed hovering there above him for a little bit until he backed away then you went back to standing properly. \u201cMy Master\u2026 I apologize for my forwardness.\u201d He said in a kneeling bow like the woman before him had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnlike you, I don\u2019t require people to kneel or bow in such a manner.\u201d You stated and used your power to lift him to his feet. \u201cWhere you got the idea of resembling a frog to impress someone of your loyalty is beyond me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lord\u2026\u201d he responded with a slight bow but realized that he didn\u2019t know your name yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Caleb and I\u2019ll be rather angry if it is spread that I am what I am. Both I and the one before me has worked hard to establish an aura of secrecy about us. It pains me that I have to reveal myself to you to keep you in line.\u201d you answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lord Caleb.\u201d He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stick with \u2018Master\u2019 so my name isn\u2019t common knowledge.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish Master.\u201d He corrected. It wasn\u2019t a designation you were happy with but with Mr. Vale already calling you that it was just easier to incorporate and hear. \u201cIf you forgive me for saying so Master, I have waited my whole life to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you want me to turn you or something like that. It amazes me how little you know about what you proclaim to be.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster?\u201d he asked and you looked at the large man towering over you as he bowed but looked at you with longing eyes. It would be quite comical to see as even with him kneeling like before he was still taller than you were. However he obviously didn\u2019t get what you were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see I knew from the first moment that you weren\u2019t a real vampire because Vampirism can\u2019t be passed on. I wouldn\u2019t be able to give the gift to you even if I wanted to, which I don\u2019t. It is given every 2100 years to the next person if the current Vampire deems that person to be worthy. I was given the gift 2 years ago by the last Vampire so you see it isn\u2019t possible for you to be one as I am. The fact that she didn\u2019t pick you means that she didn\u2019t agree with your image that you plastered over her and neither do I.\u201d You answered as you walked past him and stood in front of the window after pushing the bound guards to the side without a thought on the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever it was her that spread all those rumors, legends, and myths to protect me. So I guess I should thank you for keeping her work alive, even if it has gotten a little out of place.\u201d You responded then let the guards go from your grasp to which they all stood at attention awaiting orders but were unsure who\u2019s orders to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, if I may be so bold as to ask. Even if I can\u2019t be turned, can I at least satiate your hunger?\u201d he asked in a weird sense of duty that you had expected but not really wanted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to get it Dracula. I am not here because I think you are doing a good job. I am here because you\u2019re being a royal pain. I was content watching your little fan club work as long as it didn\u2019t cross any lines but now you are just making me look bad, even if no one knows I am THE VAMPIRE. It has gotten to the point where I am highly annoyed.\u201d You revealed more bluntly as you continued to look out among the city with your arms crossed and listening to him, trying not to smell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Master, I\u2026 I can remove myself if that is what you wish.\u201d He stated, obviously thinking of killing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the type of thinking that I am annoyed with.\u201d You stated that got his heavy breathing to slow slightly. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the taking of innocent life. I was ok when your people were just taking on other gangs and such. While I still don\u2019t like taking of life, it is well within my own definition of taking it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is that Master?\u201d he asked curiously as he wanted something to hold onto in order to legitimize his role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only kill those that have killed. I only search out and kill those that kill those that have yet to take a life, either by killing them or robbing them of their dignity. I definitely don\u2019t make my feeding a spectacle on the news and have never drank someone dry before.\u201d You answered then paused for it to sink in before continuing but turned to him as you did so. \u201cBut you people kill and feed on people and make it public. Sense when does draining an infant of their blood make anyone worth anything? You people disgust me and I am about this close to slaughtering all of you. Sure another would take your place after a while but at least I would have a few months of peace from such idiocy and blatant disregard for life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, I am sorry for the disgrace we have brought on you. If you wish I will disband the entire Clan.\u201d He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how would that help? You would still have random pockets or people unwilling to disband and it will just turn into a plague of a trend that sweeps the country with its filth.\u201d You asked and he didn\u2019t know what to say about it. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t actually mind the Vampire Clan as an idea. If you people want to drink blood and fight other gangs fine, that is up to you. Your little club is actually bringing stability when it isn\u2019t stealing people\u2019s lives from them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what do you want me to do?\u201d he asked as he was done trying to figure out what to do and getting it wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to be able to take my sister or human friend on a walk without them fearing they\u2019ll be mugged for her blood and life. I want to hear how my human family\u2019s day went, not how they were almost grabbed by a member of the Vampire Clan. I want to go to Church without them thinking I\u2019m a demon because of your actions. I want to turn on the news and not see that there was a record amount of murders in the city last month. I want to go into the city on a date without smelling the overflow of blood and death. That is what I want.\u201d You said as you turned back to the city to look at the object as a whole. \u201cI can hear them from here. The crying of a woman that just got her baby stolen, the scream of a teen that was just walking her dog, and the officers slaughter for attempting to regain order between a man and one of your members. I don\u2019t care who any of you are or what you think it means to be a Vampire, this definitely isn\u2019t it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will get better Master, I swear on my life that we will. Just give me a chance to prove it.\u201d He almost begged you but didn\u2019t take the begging posture. Either way it was probably comical for the guards to see if they were allowed to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a month. If I don\u2019t see some major changes then I\u2019ll come back and mow down everyone until I find someone I think would better suited for the task. Oh and one more thing. Please put showering and bathing back on your to do list.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master, I won\u2019t fail\u2026 but doesn\u2019t running water harm you?\u201d He asked as he noticed the last part was a request and not command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in the slightest, I take showers every morning. In the past the only reason the Vampire of that age didn\u2019t shower was because we don\u2019t necessarily have to and it multiplies our natural attractants to attract prey. You people on the other hand\u2026\u201d You said as you sniffed the air. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t drink from any of you if you all were the last humans on earth. I can\u2019t get within a foot of you people without wanting to hurl. If you don\u2019t want to use water than do something. You don\u2019t have to smell like a rose garden either just please work on it, that is a request not a command.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish Master, I do believe most of our ranks will be happy for that development. And I will not rest until the innocent murdering stops\u2026 If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how did you come to know about so many that I wasn\u2019t even aware of?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a friend from church that is a Police Captain and is close enough for me to share my other side with him and only him. He showed me and illuminated what was happening. Of course he could\u2019ve been lying so I took a nice long drive in a cab just to be sure. To be clear on that, he is a close family friend and is not to be touched. He did me a favor by telling me of this and having a friend that high in law enforcement will only help me, understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, and yes Master. I will be sure to send him a sizable thank you gift. I assume if you want your nature secret then you also want your involvement with us secret as well.\u201d he stated but also left it open for you to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct. And I won\u2019t say what about your club is fiction based as it works wonders for people suspecting me. That and I don\u2019t mind the press on you rather than looking for me. I will be in the shadows as my kind has always been. You can take the spotlight if you wish.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how will I contact you if something requires your attention?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t, not until I feel that I can be proud of what you\u2019ve accomplished. Even after that point it will be your Clan, not mine. I will be back more formally in a month to decide if I should have an alias at the top or whatever. Maybe it\u2019ll be like one of those cheesy cartoons with the masked leader that no one sees. But, again, that all depends how well you do by the time I return.\u201d You replied. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will do so in the hopes that we are recognized formally by you and perhaps you may lead us, even if it must be from afar.\u201d Dracula said to which you looked back at him and his eyes met yours with a fierce determination. The whole conversation was a little weird as you didn\u2019t expect him to roll over so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I will go now and make it so only you remember my visit. You will be the only one in the Vampire Clan that knows about me. I\u2019ll leave you to your work, I\u2019m sure you have a lot of it.\u201d You said as you reached out with your hand to the guards to which they all fell over as you purged their minds and those that saw you enter and leave. As you did this you started turning to mist but got one more word in. \u201cDon\u2019t disappoint me Dracula, I am putting some trust in you. See to it that it isn\u2019t wasted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Master.\u201d He said in a low voice before you were all gone and teleported to Doug\u2019s office as he was putting on his coat. His blinds closed and you turned off all the security cameras, now that you knew for sure where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Caleb, is that you?\u201d Doug asked as he couldn\u2019t open the door. You appeared in the shadow of the room then walked to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I caught you before you left. I just had a rather long and interesting talk with Dracula. I thought you would like to hear the results as soon as they were made.\u201d You stated in quiet but still audible voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Caleb, go ahead.\u201d Doug answered and you told him the entire conversation and what you had told Dracula about possibly leading the Vampire Clan. Doug just listened to the information until it\u2019s completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the whole thing. I hope it was ok, for now at least.\u201d You said, a little unsure if you did good and he could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk? Caleb that was much more than I was expecting. I am slightly concerned about this \u2018gift\u2019 he is sending as most of them that he sends tend to explode. But from what you\u2019re saying, it seems like he has a deep longing to please you as an actual Vampire. It will be interesting the next couple weeks to say the least. Thank you very much. If this works it will be a very good thing. Of course the credit will probably be passed to other people above me.\u201d Doug responded as he put a hand on your shoulder to solidify his thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it doesn\u2019t bother me to get a back seat to the spotlight. That kind of stuff never really appealed to me anyway, especially now.\u201d You returned to which Doug just gave you a pat on the back as he went again for his coat and the door, waiting for you to allow him out. \u201cI guess I should get going to, see you later.\u201d You waved as you teleported out and put everything back the way it was suppose to be, except obviously the footage of your visit. Just as a precaution you stayed until he opened the door, which wasn\u2019t that long it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo off you headed home to tell your parents and family what happened.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>School was pushed back a few weeks because of a change of stature. Apparently the Vampire Clan was more influential than you thought. It was about to incorporate a separate faction inside the Education system that allowed the Clan students more freedom. But with your little chat with Dracula he immediately took it out so the schools had to adjust before starting the year. It must\u2019ve been a huge change to get a couple week waiting period. You watched more intently with Doug and your family as things around started changing in that respect. For one, it smelled much better as they all were ok to take showers and baths now. You would hear or sense the random feeding or something every once in a while but nothing like the thick sense that was there before. Instead of hearing of murders you heard of some actual help that surprised many people. While it was still known that no one picked a fight with the Vampire Clan there wasn\u2019t that much if any senseless killing like there use to be. Slowly it spread and was well on its way through the countries factions within the month you gave him to work on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re going to have to kill them?\u201d Eve asked as you were getting ready to go meet with them. You had delivered a letter on Dracula\u2019s desk with your glyph on it that you would be coming tonight and to put the glyph wherever it was secure enough or whatever. You would be wearing something covering if he wanted to do anything special but other than that you left it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope not. Besides, we all agreed that he did a good job in the short time I gave him right?\u201d You asked as she looked down at you from the ceiling of your room to you dressing an tweaking a suitable outfit. She was pretty big at this point so the days of her riding on your head or chest were over. In fact, more often than not Isaac rode her around the house. She gave Doug a heart attack when he formally met the family along with Kelsey and Eve in the fashion of discussing what he would do for you, due in no small part to the positive change that he was getting credit for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I suppose so.\u201d Kelsey chimed in as she was helping you pick out something that didn\u2019t look too cheesy. It was common place by now to go around your house with powers showing and what not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone ever walked in unannounced then they would think they were walking into a fiction book with Kelsey as a Succubus walking around with wings and tail out while Eve helped clean around the house. The rest of the family got use to it and it was more weird when no one was there and \u2018boring\u2019 anywhere else. Sure your family went out to movies and Sarah was trying to go out on dates. But for random fun stuff they just had you teleport them somewhere then pick them up if they wanted to go out. Your cousins loved coming over; Isaac and Dana in particular loved playing with Eve while some of the other cousins sometimes came over just to see you do something cool or feed on them from time to time. It was also more accepted that you could just grab someone and feed off them. If they had a reason for you not to, even if they just didn\u2019t feel like it, then you honored that wish. But otherwise they trusted you to not take too much and leave them enough to be productive in their own day to day lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how does this look?\u201d you asked as you presented yourself to them. It was simple as it was an all black getup. Your normal clothes were covered with a thin form fitting armor that was strong enough to deflect or stop armor piercing bullets, courtesy of Doug and his connections along with Grandpa Konel and his Military ones. The armor consisted of a pair of boot like shoes with a few hidden surprises in them then a pair of tight but not skin tight armored pants utilizing this new fabric. On the top was formfitting and semi tight long sleeve shirt made of the same stuff with gloves on the end. While they were separate pieces they came together in a way that made them so air tight that it could stop vapor from coming in through the seams. Finally the whole formfitting and extremely dark black outfit was covered by a separated cloak that honestly reminded you of the Batman cape and how it could go around your body completely but be taken off easily, but you had a slightly long hood that covered most of your face and what didn\u2019t you covered with a little mist to make is to that even if you shined a light to see underneath you couldn\u2019t make out your face, but the person still could see basic shapes like your fangs or it you decided to make your eyes glow through the shrouded cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell normally I would ask if you are going to a Halloween party but\u2026 I guess that\u2019s the point. You do look intimidating enough and fit the part so I think it is a good look for your Vampire alias.\u201d Kelsey said as she looked you over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is the right one if you are going for scaring the crap out of them.\u201d Eve agreed as she scuttled around the ceiling to look at all sides. \u201cAnd you can hide it right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I don\u2019t have to worry about people finding it because I just do this.\u201d you said as you broke down the outfit like the others you had on file for your body to change into when it needs to, kind of like a partial materialization wardrobe. You stood there for a second in your usual relaxing outfit then went back to the Vampire Master one that you just made. \u201cAll secure and everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, very cool but isn\u2019t it time for your little meeting?\u201d Eve said in a joking tone as you all looked at the clock and saw that it was almost midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I should get going so I don\u2019t miss my own party.\u201d You said as you readied yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, you should drink a little before you go.\u201d Kelsey advised and you looked at her, although under your hood she couldn\u2019t see well enough to fully know your expression, even from her new spot up against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I am a little hungry but not so much as to drink.\u201d You said but more asked in a tone to have her explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t know what will happen there. What if you have to fight them all. You\u2019ll need a full tank of gas\u2026 or blood in your case. Just take a little bit.\u201d She said as she kinked her neck for you and gently pulled your head to a spot you had used a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright smarty pants, you win.\u201d You said as you embraced her and held her as you licked the spot then sank in your fangs into her tender neck. You didn\u2019t know what it was about her type but the smaller more fragile necks were always more enjoyable to you. You drank a little bit as her warm blood flowed down your throat. You took longer than usual to bring the blood out so she could bask in the feeling for a little longer until you were done and retracted yourself. With a final bit of licking to clean the spot off you helped her to one of the silk couches. \u201cAs delicious as always, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no fair.\u201d Eve pouted to which Kelsey just smiled at her mock jealousy. Eve had now gotten just big enough for you to drink her blood in more the quantity that you did the others and liked it just as much as they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll get to you when I get back.\u201d You said lovingly as you pet her hanging form as she address the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise?\u201d she comically pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I promise.\u201d You agreed then with a tender stroke you vanished to your meeting with Dracula, hoping that it would go well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIt\u2019s almost time.\u201d Dracula said as he passed around the room with a bunch of people from the clan there. They all looked like high ranking people from the Clan as they all had that look of superiority to them but was nervous from what might be their last day on earth. What worried them even more was their usually fearless leader was passing and sweating bullets. You of course scanned the area before teleporting then appeared before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDracula, it is time.\u201d You said simply in your ominous voice. You decided that using your normal voice would render your outfit pointless so you chose to use that one in relation to your Vampire alias. He slowly turned to you as you had your arms crossed and head covered he wasn\u2019t sure it was you so you flashed your eyes at him, removing all doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster.\u201d He greeted and as he bowed the others followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDracula, it is time to impress me like you swore you would, time to prove that my trust was not misplaced.\u201d You stated. \u201cOh, and I do appreciate the upgrade in scent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be, he\u2019s just a little kid.\u201d Said a skinny but old man that looked the definition of slyly arrogant. He obviously thought very highly of himself. \u201cIs this why our great leader changed his ways, for this little brat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold your tongue Slier.\u201d Dracula almost growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot this time. We\u2019ve been going along with your new ideas to impress the real thing. But this is going too far. This\u2026 this is the person you are so afraid of? I told you all before that I should be the leader. This  oversized brute or his pet brat has no place in the most powerful and fast growing organization in the world. I think we should\u2026\u201d he ranted to Dracula\u2019s almost horror. He obviously was hoping to make a good impression and this man was bashing that possibility but perks of being who you are and would be, you didn\u2019t have to put up with it. Only one person knew your face in the room so you didn\u2019t have to worry about consequences of acting a little more aggressive. So mid sentence you interrupted the man by putting a little force on his throat and lifted the man up with you mind power. If you ever saw Kaname again you would have to thank him. While your other powers were more potent this one was insanely useful. You searched his mind for what he did and apparently he handled small time finances for the Clan in one of the Minor branches. He, unlike the others, was just power drunk and still secretly fed on young unwilling boys. He disgusted you as he was one of the people who also drank from infants and even if he didn\u2019t for a while he fully intended to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObjection noted.\u201d You said after splitting the man in half many times and throwing his remains into a trash bin sloppily so the others could hear the squishing as the pieces were dropped in the small container. \u201cAny more bits of useless power hungry wisdom before we continue?\u201d you asked to which they all remained silent and not showing their horror stricken emotions. They now joined Dracula in their deathly respect for what and who you were, even if they didn\u2019t know your face. Master was all they needed to know and that you were the real thing. \u201cYou may continue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies Master.\u201d He said with a bow then brought your attention to a sliding glass screen to your left and their right. \u201cThe red lines are what we used to be like as of a month ago and the green what we are now. While there are still some rogue factions as you predicted most of the Clan\u2019s have ceased any senseless murdering outside of territory disputes and your rule on killing innocents has been accepted, if not forcibly enforced by the rest of us. We have established ties with multiple law enforcement groups and corporations and now provide them with intelligence when we have it. We are growing and soon the individual factions will follow suit. We retained our loyalty to each other without condoning violence on innocent. That has led to taking our direct grasp on education out of our agenda. Now if a student gets into a fight for something meaningless it is on their head. In order to justify a killing the offending party or situation must be approved by the overseers and if a previous killing isn\u2019t approved then they are handed over the police or law enforcement agencies, in the worst case we deal with our own if it is too delicate elsewhere. We also help with promoting a bias against murder and like crimes under the threat of our rule and punishment system. Because of this there hasn\u2019t been a single murder in the cities we have the most influence and it is spreading as we do.\u201d He reported as you looked at the corresponding numbers. When he was finished his report as he went into more complicated and minor changes he retracted the screen and bowed to you, awaiting your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs evidence to the idiot I just dealt with it is safe to say that not all your Clan supports this new vision. But I do.\u201d You stated, the first part almost made Dracula shake in fear but the last part stopped this motion and made him slowly straighten. \u201cConsider me impressed, not satiated but impressed none the less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat means?...\u201d Dracula half asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I will allow you to remain the head of this Clan.\u201d You responded to his unasked question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Master.\u201d He returned with another bow, obviously relieved to hear so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM..Master?\u201d asked a very attractive looking woman in her 30s maybe younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak.\u201d You responded to her as she straightened after a like bow, following the example of Dracula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you be leading us?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be your overseer but no I will not be leading you. That honor will remain with Dracula until I find him unworthy or another more worthy. I will among the people with my human family observing you, all of you. Only the Leader will know my face and name. That will hopefully ensure that you treat every person with respect. Remember this, if even one of my family is fed on I will know about it and will make sure you wish you never laid a finger on them.\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how will we know?\u201d asked a man but shrank back as he noticed it was probably to forward of a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t. I could be the woman next to you or the bum on the street. My family is not a small one they aren\u2019t all human either. This is my way of keeping an eye on you. I am not all powerful but, as the idiot in the trash can prove, I am no weakling of fool either. You all have been warned\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood Master.\u201d They all said at once.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMaster, is there any other instruction or wishes that you would like fulfilled?\u201d Another young lady asked. Like Dracula, you had the distinct impression that she wanted to get her blood drunk. The group in front of you must\u2019ve had either a high level fetish or desire for the Vampiric world. If they couldn\u2019t become a Vampire, a true Vampire, then they wished to be a part of one\u2026 well most of them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly this, to portray Vampires as you have been. I will not say what parts of the myth are true or false. I only addressed the water rule because I couldn\u2019t stand the smell. My predecessor created most of the stories and legends about Vampires to protect me and future Vampires so I won\u2019t say what is true or not. But having her legacy being upheld and spread is a sentimental plus for me on your part.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, if we are suppose to be Vampires then why not make us as such?\u201d asked a young man this time. He wasn\u2019t as power hungry as the other man was but he clearly was hoping for the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I can\u2019t. The type of Vampire I am doesn\u2019t allow me to spread out the gift in such a fashion. I can only spread the gift to one person at the end of my time, as my predecessor did before me. This is done so that each Vampire of the age can be carefully selected and chosen over the course of the current\u2019s very long life. That is all I\u2019ll say on that matter and I trust that it will not spread beyond this room. As I have said, I wish the previous Vampire\u2019s legacy to continue.\u201d You answered and as much solemn emotions were running there was an equal amount of resolve to be that person for you. You didn\u2019t want to tell them that it would be close to 2100 more years before you had to choose another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you still want us to act as we have been, as far as acting like what we know as Vampires?\u201d asked an older man near the idiot\u2019s age but more kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is up to you. If you want to drink blood, wear black, get fangs, live in the dark, or whatever you decide then I won\u2019t stop you, as long as it is within what I have previously said and following the instructions I give to your leader. The only rule besides murder that I have revoked was the no bathing and showering rule and for good reason.\u201d You answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining but, what reason is that?\u201d asked the first woman that spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, the only reason Vampires in the past never showered was because we emit an attractant of sorts to\u2026well attract and ensnare our prey or people in general. Taking a shower of bath would wash off the concentration of attractant and its multiplied effect for leaving it sit. So when we don\u2019t wash ourselves it makes us more enticing. However that is the opposite for humans. Your scent doesn\u2019t have to be like mine, as it is impossible to do so, and it doesn\u2019t have to be a garden of roses either. But making every possible person in the area shrink away from you from the smell alone is the opposite of what should happen.\u201d You explained for her and they seemed more pleased by this little insight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you go Master, can we smell it\u2026 your scent?\u201d asked the other woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I will let go my scent to 10% so you understand.\u201d You agreed then did like so. You could immediately see the desire in their eyes and the pull they had to suppress to remain professional and respectful. You let it linger for a moment then retracted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, so that is what it is\u2026 I\u2026 thank you Master.\u201d The woman said as she was censoring herself from saying something she might regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d You asked in a formal manner to Dracula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Master, I will continue to work to make this Clan into one that you can call home eventually. Do not hesitate to ask if you need anything from us. We live to serve you, even as meals if need be.\u201d Dracula stated in bow. You would\u2019ve snapped on him for following that train of thought yet again but you also understood he didn\u2019t mean anything besides a deep longing rather than a dismissal of soul to you. Going to church and being in an all Christian family and school made you a little off when people talked like this but a quick peek into his mind revealed he meant it as a sign of loyalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll leave it to you then. Well done.\u201d You stated then when they looked up you teleported out so they could see the vanishing act and further pull any doubt from them. You popped back into your room to find that Kelsey had went home, it was rather late and the start of school was tomorrow, and Eve in the corner but now awake as she was in contact with the webbing that covered the room. You immediately changed to your normal clothes with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTired, well it has been a while since you got any sleep.\u201d Eve stated as she came over and lifted you so you were laying on her underside as she hung from the ceiling with her mouth and fangs by your head so she could more whisper to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, only had to kill one of them. The rest were strangely respectful, although they all wanted me to turn them. But now they are all\u2026 well mostly straightened out. Still have a few things to work on but pretty good overall.\u201d You said as you snuggled into her and you remembered your little promise to her before you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good.\u201d She said and usually by now she was well on her way to cocooning you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, time for a little snack then sleep till the morning.\u201d You stated and you could hear her get excited with anticipation. Her eyes being on the top side left her completely vulnerable like you were now, despite you not grabbing her or anything. It was the way she liked it so that she could gain the full experience. You moved your head to an open spot the sang your fangs into her. You heard her gasp and almost fall from her perch as you drank  from her similar to how you did for Kelsey but more since she didn\u2019t have school tomorrow. \u201cTasty as always.\u201d You complimented as you both just stayed there for a moment in your own daze like trances. She for you feeding on her and you for your fatigue, it had been 5 months since you got a good rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a good sleep, I\u2019ll wake you if you\u2019re not up by the morning.\u201d She offered as she started her process of gently cocooning you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Eve, you\u2019re the best.\u201d You said before nodding off to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The new school year started and went on just like usual. While you had put the Vampire Clan in line the student faction of it acted the same. However, without the backing and the fear from the teachers and what not, they couldn\u2019t just push their weight around anymore. Kelsey made quite a few of their jaws drop, both metaphorically and literally as they tried to force her to date them. As an eighth grade student you were not that bad and you family life was as usual, except your chores were easier to do. So at times you helped Doug out with whatever he needed. Helping out the Police wasn\u2019t the most rewarding job, as the only person that knew about it was Doug, but it did keep you busy and from getting board. Usually all you needed to do was spit a saliva needle at a tire of a getaway car, or make all the guns jam. While people didn\u2019t know why or how, it was known that if you did something that involved the Police Captain then it was pretty much over. But some people still pushed the limit from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d you asked as you picked up the phone. You had finally got a cell phone. Your Father had finally cracked under the pressure to get the whole family their own phone. You were now officially on a leash as people could call you for any number of different things. You would have to eventually talk to them about that. You just didn\u2019t have the time to go get someone\u2019s purse from home in the middle of school or hunting. More than a few times they called while you were hunting. Some of your cousins were the worst in that respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Caleb, this it Doug. You got a little time?\u201d asked the voice on the other end. \u201cYeah, just chilling at home, be there in a sec.\u201d you answered then hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Eve asked as she was about to spend the night with you and Kelsey, watching a movie with the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll hopefully be right back.\u201d You said as she got off your lap. She liked laying on you at times, even if she was getting to big for it. It reminded her of old times and all that. For now she served as a blanket for you and Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better, movie starts in an hour.\u201d Kelsey stated in a matter of fact tone. You liked how comfortable you all were with each other. She no longer feared or was shy of your touch and you never thought that her Succubus side would dictate her to take the friendship you two had any further. And Eve, well she was\u2026 Eve. A very large and deadly spider that was more like a living stuffed animal with a gentle mind and heart. She even babysat kids and infants for the family. The parents wouldn\u2019t overreact when they came back to their kids cocooned and hanging from the ceiling as they slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Ma\u2019am.\u201d You said then teleported to Doug, who was in his car and you now occupying the seat next to him in your V.C. attire. You both found it easier to hide your involvement like that. That way, only a select amount of people would know who was helping and even fewer would know who was underneath doing it all. \u201cAlright, my movie starts in about an hour with the family so what you got?\u201d you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for coming.\u201d Doug said then pointed to an old building and you didn\u2019t have to wait long to hear a lot of gunshots and an explosion. \u201cThere are some well armed Mercs that hit a local bank in there. They\u2019ve already killed a few of my men and are very well armed with military grade weapons. I would\u2019ve called in some SWAT units but they did their homework and got my Family and a bunch others as hostages. Now they are demanding that I come in within the hour to \u2018negotiate\u2019 with them. I can\u2019t imagine them being too honorable about it, as they\u2019ve already killed two hostages on a whim. Thought maybe you could accompany me inside and if things get hairy then, well do your thing. We got the usual empty cells ready for you if it comes down to it and you can get a little snack while you\u2019re at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll come with you. But let\u2019s try to get this done quick. Like I said, my movie starts in an hour and Eve will be all moody if I miss the start.\u201d You agreed to which he smiled and started to drive to the building. You turned to mist and surrounded him in a light enough coat that you couldn\u2019t be detected, even by Eve if she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think that a situation such as this and neither of us are even the slightest bit worried about it. This would be a nightmare for anyone else\u2019s mind, body, and career.\u201d Doug said as he pulled up to which you just chuckled a response then turned silent as he put his hands up and walked to the front door. You could feel a few eyes and guns trained on him. With your mist so thin and spread out you could feel everyone inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, I\u2019m sensing something wrong in there. I still got your back but just be careful.\u201d You said to his mind as your mist was being repelled by something. An area or person that either your mist wouldn\u2019t touch or something that was actively pushing it away. The only things that did that were fellow Predators/freaks or silver. Since you usually got a sick feeling from silver you were both curious and suspicious of what laid inside this place. Whatever was repelling your mist was dangerous enough for it not to get any closer. But the level wasn\u2019t quite at the level of Eve. So all that remained was to find out what it was and deal with it, one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way.\u201d Said a gruff man in full body armor. For the surrounded situation he was in, he didn\u2019t seam all together very concerned. Doug followed the man as another shut the door they opened, readying but not raising his gun. This was either really good or really bad. Whomever this presence was had enough pull to effect the Mercs like this. It either had a slave system like you or had a way out. \u201cIn there and mind your manners or they\u2019ll eat you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ll what?\u201d asked Doug in surprise, for the first time in a while. But the man walked away and no one was within a few feet of the door. The guards were at least 10 feet away and shaking slightly. \u201cCaleb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d you answered in his mind as he asked in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did they mean?\u201d he asked as he was obviously asking what you were wondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. All I know is that whatever it repelling my mist is coming from the other side of this door. It is being repelled like Eve or Kelsey would. My mist doesn\u2019t get closer to prevent detection. But because of that and that I haven\u2019t smelled this scent before, I can\u2019t tell you what is beyond it. Only that it is probably a predator or freak like me. Doesn\u2019t feel as powerful as Eve but that isn\u2019t saying much as she is no slouch either. I still am well above this level though.\u201d You answered and assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, well let\u2019s get this over with then.\u201d He said as he pushed open the door and stepped into the room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThis is problematic.\u201d You stated in Doug\u2019s mind as you looked at two very large spiders that were easily 30 feet tall. The room was covered in a thick layer of webbing, not unlike your room in fact with the hostages hanging in partially constructed cocoons on the ceiling so they could still interact on a verbal level but not much more than that. You could sense a good number of spiders of all sizes around the two of you but very few that were anything more than a bigger wolf spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, we were getting tired of waiting.\u201d Said one of the large spiders with a female voice at the far end of the room, granted the room was relatively small for them but it was still near a basketball court size so Doug could walk forward and the doors could close from the work of two dog sized spiders before disappearing into the maze of webbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize for my late arrival.\u201d Doug stated with a polite bow. It wasn\u2019t usually his thing but he had talked with Eve and knew how to compliment her, so he hoped they would react in a similar way. You both were on the same wave length to think that these might be Eve\u2019s blood family. If that was the case then you didn\u2019t want to harm them if it could be avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, a human with some manners.\u201d Said another female voice from the other spider. Now that you looked around you noticed there were very few males in the area. You made a note of it before turning you attention back to the pressing matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have come as requested. What do I owe the honor of such a summon?\u201d Doug asked as he glanced at his family and was relieved to know they were alright, relatively speaking. They were cocooned with spiders crawling all over them but weren\u2019t dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur daughter, where is she?\u201d demanded one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour daughter?\u201d Doug asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t play with us human. We have been told and now know for ourselves that you reek with the scent of the royal blood. We are the queens of this area you humans call a \u2018State\u2019 or \u2018Wisconsin\u2019. We know you have her, our question was\u2026 Where?\u201d the other spider asked, the last word in a clear threatening command as she crept slightly forward in a pose you both new, well you more than Doug, as when Eve got slightly angry or emotionally compromised. Eve never let it out but you knew the signs; hair bristled, subconscious movements, chattering of her fangs and/or mandibles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only know of one like you, if she is what you say. I don\u2019t know if she is the one you are talking about though. Please, can we talk about this? Just a moment ago I thought this hostage situation with my family was random idiots. But if you are Eve\u2019s parents then\u2026 I owe it to at least her to try to help both her and you see each other.\u201d Doug answered, raising his hands slightly to try and calm the situation down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve? Is that the human name you have given her?\u201d asked the other one as they did partially move back from the escalation that they were just on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 yes that is her name but I am not the one who named her, nor am I the one she lives with and takes care of her.\u201d Doug responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen who?\u201d the two asked almost at the same time but close enough to sound like one questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 that is complicated. I can have him here in seconds but he is a little\u2026 shy I guess you could say. With so many people he wouldn\u2019t show his face.\u201d Doug answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think us a fool? You are trying to get us to release these other humans. This is where that thinking gets you.\u201d said one of them to which she snatched a cocoon of a man and almost pierced the cocoon before all you teleported them all away along with wiping their memories. You only had one place to put them so you teleported them, without their eight legged captures, to the holding cell. You did this just in time as the fangs of the large spider went straight through the cocoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 was a very poor move.\u201d you said out loud in you designated \u2018Vampire voice\u2019 you used with your little disguise as the spiders chattered and searched quickly for both the disappeared humans and the source of the voice. Doug only smiled as one dog sized spider lunged at him and was pushed back along with a few small ones that thought they could sneak their way onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat trickery is this human?\u201d one of the two demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be the person I was telling you about. I am not doing any of this and it definitely isn\u2019t a trick.\u201d Doug answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you, show yourself!\u201d the other said to which you came together beside Doug. \u201cYou dare do this to us?\u201d she said then lunged like Eve does at you. However, unlike Eve, this one was not use to attacking you. A front attack never worked and you proved this by raising a hand, catching her in midair, allowing her to float there for a moment then threw her back into the wall. She was back up shortly after, strafing a little but not daring to get closer until she could determine what you were doing and how you were doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo impatient, Eve use to be like that to. Now I know where she got it from.\u201d You said as you lowered your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have her? Give her back!\u201d said the other but didn\u2019t risk any more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive her back? I never took her. I only saved her and gave her a home. She is part of my family now, not by blood obviously, but I have never held her against her will. If she wants to come here than she can, I\u2019ll even bring her here. However, that is only if SHE wants it.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why would one of the Spider Queens want to stay with a family of humans?\u201d Asked one of them mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps it was because took her in and we gave her a home. Or maybe it was that we have shown more love toward her than her own kind.\u201d You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you imply that we don\u2019t love our own children. You will pay for that with your life.\u201d Stated one of the spiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, I think things are going to get a little rough. I\u2019ll send you back to your office if you wish.\u201d You said over to him and to his nod you touched him, teleporting him back then sealed the door so the humans outside couldn\u2019t interrupt. \u201cNow I can talk and fight without risk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you human?\u201d Asked a strangely male voice that got the others that were ready to attack to become silent. It was an immediate transition as the once chattering and scampering sounds came to a deathly quiet. You looked on as a 20 foot tall spider came from one of the webbed tunnels in the room. You immediately recognized him as Eve\u2019s father from his almost identical figure, minus the gender differences. Same silky black hair on his body, the same eye configuration, and a bunch of other things that you would only know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point of this outfit is to hide my identity from the world. In doing so I secure my family and others I love from ill effects of the answer to that question. However, for the Father of Eve, I will amend that decision.\u201d You stated then changed back to your normal relaxed wear. \u201cMy name is Caleb Konel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know I am her father?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, you look just like her. Minus the obvious gender differences and size, you are an exact copy of her. I knew the moment I saw you that you were her father\u2026 although I\u2019m not sure about the mother.\u201d You said with a bow at first but ended with looking the two others over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem as frightened of us as most humans are. Why is that?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I answer, may I know what to call you? A name or something, I don\u2019t wish to be rude.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may call me Arium.\u201d He responded after a few moments to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to tell you the truth, I am slightly unnerved. I am not exactly a spider person. However, living with Eve does tend to enlighten the mind. We have been wondering if she had any blood family and where they might be. But I suppose it is also because I am not human.\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what are you?\u201d asked Arium rather directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense Mr. Arium, but why would I tell you that. Being Eve\u2019s father gets you a very decent amount of recognition and respect from me but I have yet to confirm if I can trust you yet.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my daughter hasn\u2019t been living with humans then?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has. It is complicated where I live. I have an entire human family and we take care of each other, Eve included. However I do have another nonhuman friend that hangs out with us. In fact, before I was called here, we were about to have a movie night.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, that is rather complicated. However we must speak with her about her place here.\u201d He replied to which you looked down and thought about it for a few minutes then looked back up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe most I can do is ask if she wants to come here and talk. As long as you agree to abide by her decision. I won\u2019t have my family be bullied or targeted by any of your kind. I know full well that it would be death sentence for them. Is that agreeable?\u201d You asked. You weren\u2019t sure how many were like Eve. But if even a few more were like her or even half of what she is than they could wipe out your family in a single night. After all, it would only take a single bite from Eve to put you down for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that we will agree with her. However I can forbid any involvement of humans in this, wither directly or otherwise.\u201d Arium replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that is good enough. I\u2019ll go see if she wishes to come here.\u201d You said then drew a glyph on the ground. \u201cThis is an anchor point to get back with her. Please stay clear of it as I\u2019ll be back one way or another and don\u2019t wish to harm any of your children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you bringing her here?\u201d he asked with a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeleportation, I can teleport anywhere that has this mark. Now, I\u2019ve got to get back and talk with her about this. I\u2019ll return with her or her answer within the night.\u201d You responded then disappeared from their view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re back, and time to spare.\u201d Kelsey said as she patted the cushion next to her. But both of them noticed your face as one that you needed something and/or had something heavy on your mind. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve, we need to talk.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could no longer solely sit on someone\u2019s lap. While she sometimes acted as a blanket for you and the others that were that comfortable, she needed an actual spot on the floor to talk seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sounds serious, is it a family thing?\u201d Kelsey asked, wondering if it was something she should be apart of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, so you should be a part of it.\u201d You said then sat in your chair next to Eve and Kelsey. \u201cDoug just brought me along for a hostage situation. I freed them but the people that took them only wanted one thing, their daughter back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got to be kidding.\u201d Eve stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, the others I saw there were a little hard to believe. But I met a your father and he looks almost identical to you, bigger and a male but still almost a carbon copy of you. They said you are some kind of royalty or something. Now I\u2019m not accusing you of anything but we do need to get this settled.\u201d You replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Eve\u2019s family. Can I see them?\u201d Isaac asked innocently, in wonder of a bunch of spiders just like Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately they don\u2019t share the same value of human life. When Doug spoke out of turn, one of the large females tried to sink her fangs into one of the cocooned hostages. I of course teleported them all away but they could do some nasty damage. They already tracked Eve\u2019s scent to Doug and if they come here\u2026\u201d You started but didn\u2019t have to finish as they all seemed to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just tell them you\u2019re a Vampire and they\u2019d leave us alone?\u201d asked Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI left that up to Eve, if she wants them to know. I would like it if we keep the people that know to a minimum. I told them to wait for your answer Eve. They would like to speak with you. But if you don\u2019t want to then I\u2019ll make them understand and if worse comes to worse I\u2019ll have to deal with them.\u201d You revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we are dealing with an army of Eve\u2019s, sort of speak?\u201d Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, from what I saw there were only a few that were near dog sized and only 3 that were above that. The three were; Her father who I am guessing is just as potentially deadly as Eve is except about 20 feet tall, then two females that are about 40 feet tall but look really different and have the venom of about a wolf spider. I am guessing what makes Eve so special is what makes her of \u2018royal blood\u2019.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat big?\u201d Sarah asked, freaked out that there were huge spiders out there besides Eve that WOULD eat her if they had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but like I said, only very few were that large. The others were maybe plate size or smaller, lots of them but most smaller than that.\u201d You returned but then looked over at Eve as she twitched and thought about what decisions were in front of her. You put a hand on her leg as it moved on its own. She quickly put it down but you didn\u2019t remove your touch a she turned slightly to you. \u201cYou can meet them then decide if you want. Any way you want I\u2019ll support your decision. You are still part of my family no matter if you decide to live elsewhere for a while or whatever. We owe you the chance to at least see your blood relatives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Papa agreed and they all gave smiles to her as if to solidify the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if you do, you better come and visit.\u201d Kelsey teased to get some of the edge off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you all are so wonderful I don\u2019t want to leave. But maybe I should learn a little, like Caleb does with other Vampires in that thing Mr. Vale brought over. Only difference is I have them here, in this world. I just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Eve said as she thought about it then straightened a little and announced. \u201cOk, please take me to see them.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You appeared in the room with Eve, your hand still on her leg but she sprung out in a highly defensive stance as soon as she was aware of her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you finally arrive\u2026 my daughter.\u201d Said her father as he remained in his position. To his sight and words Eve looked at you. It was hard to tell when a spider like her was looking at you in relation to a response but you had got to know her quite well so you could tell when she was doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I was kidding? He looks just like you\u2026 just bigger.\u201d You replied and she turned slightly too fully address him but she paused for a while but you nudged her that got her out of her deep thought. It also made her cycling body spring a bit. But she was use to you as much as you were use to her so she didn\u2019t attack you. \u201cGo on, I\u2019ll step in if you need help. Go say hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that some of the others were struggling not to act as you addressed her in a fashion that they probably didn\u2019t like. But she sighed and walked forward to address the room without you next to her. This was something she wanted to do on her own as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH\u2026Hello\u2026 father.\u201d She finally spoke as she looked up at the spider in front of her that was many times her size. She was quivering but it was unclear wither it was of fear or being anxious and perhaps both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to be shy my dear. You are royalty and as such the only one that can speak to me in such formality. I would think you have many questions.\u201d Her father said as spiders surrounded you. They didn\u2019t come to close but still was obvious that they weren\u2019t about to let their guard down while you were there. \u201cHuman, you have done what you have said. Will you allow my daughter and I to talk in a more private setting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense but neither of us know you. Being her father gets you far but neither of us know if can be trusted\u2026 yet. So until she feels safe I must remain. It is her choice, not mine and not yours.\u201d You responded, which got a few hisses and scatters around the room but were silenced by a simple low hiss from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you are very protective of her. I suppose I should be grateful for that. After all, it probably helped keep my daughter safe. And now that you have brought her here I can\u2019t complain about the same attitude that allowed her to live this long. But be warned, humans don\u2019t last long when referring to us higher status spiders with such familiarity.\u201d Her father replied. You bowed your response then the focus shifted back to Eve. \u201cSo, my dear, will you allow your human to live and leave us to talk amongst ourselves. She almost responded with an outburst. But with a shake of your head you told her silently that you didn\u2019t want them to know about your other side unless they had to. In such cases she knew you liked to be considered as a human, weird human, but a human none the less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst answer a question\u2026 father. Why did you leave me alone? Why did I have to look to humans to find acceptance over my own kind and family? Why did you abandon me?\u201d She asked in multiple ways as she couldn\u2019t find a single way to ask the question. It was a question you knew she struggled with. You had tried talking with her about it multiple times but it still bothered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy daughter, you have no idea what it takes to give birth to a full blooded member of the royal family. Hundreds of spiders have to give their life for the chance. I am your father but out of 300,000 spiders these two and I are the only ones left alive from the birthing of the batch of eggs. All their essence, including my wife and former leader of our race, was absorbed and shot into these two. We all added our life force and wills along with the normal breeding procedure to create an egg sack full of millions of spiders. So the odds of you being what you are was not very good. Then when the eggs hatch you were all sent out into the wild. This helps keep the competent solders and family alive while disposing of any that would betray us. It also teaches each of you how to grow and survive. So in short, there was no way to know you were among them. But don\u2019t mistake our race\u2019s way of life to be abandonment. We do love you and we gave a lot for even the chance that you may be born. Don\u2019t take that sacrifice lightly.\u201d Her father explained. This was a scenario that Eve wasn\u2019t ready for. She had assumed that they didn\u2019t care about her and just cast her aside without a second thought. Such a revelation made her slightly emotional. You felt like comforting her but you didn\u2019t want to add any more pressure to the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say the leader of our race did as well?\u201d Eve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is customary for the leader to initiate the birthing process because the stronger the source of the birth the stronger the offspring and chance to produce a queen or royal spider. The strongest female is always the one that survives. What we didn\u2019t know was that her age had made her weak. She hid it so well that we didn\u2019t know until she was dead. Since then we have been hoping a queen was born from her sacrifice and here you are. Because she died in your development you will effectively be the strongest queen in history. All her essence would\u2019ve been imparted to you rather than a fraction of it like normal birthing.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut aren\u2019t you the leader now?\u201d Eve asked after she thought about what was said then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am only a steward. Our race has always been led by a queen. But since I was suspected to be the only royal family left, I was chosen to lead until a miracle was given. You are that miracle and are the sole heir to our race\u2019s throne, in human terms of description. We need you, my daughter, my queen.\u201d He ended with what looked like a formal bow that all the others duplicated. It was a very strange feeling as they and you waited for her answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We are not the only sentient spiders. Each territory has their own governing force. We are by far the purest and strongest. But we are by no means immortal. If not managed correctly, an invading force of other tribes or even other species can do much damage. We also help out the humans by feeding on the pests that invade their homes. It also allows our informants to gather information. That was actually how we found you. The humans call our territory \u2018Wisconsin\u2019 and we are pretty secure. So, you have more room to settle in than most times.\u201d Her father said in a formal matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 can I still live where I have been?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can. If you wish.\u201d He replied but she didn\u2019t seem to understand what that would mean, you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I don\u2019t have to leave.\u201d She said to you but saw your look and was concerned. She knew it as a look when she wasn\u2019t thinking correctly. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fail to see what living as a queen would be like. Do you really think they would just leave and leave you unguarded? You are their Queen, they would have the highest concentration of sentries and guards, with the more lethal potency protecting you. Not touching my family\u2019s obvious phobia about spiders accept you. What do you think would happen if Isaac were to jump on you like he does now? Or what would happen if Kelsey were to tease you with her pheromones again. Or one of my cousins squirting you with water. At the very least, our home would be a den for your new\u2026 kingdom and its subjects.\u201d You explained. With each question she understood more, and she began to see what you were talking about as you were only talking and they were almost offended to the point of attacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t want me there?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did I ever say that?\u201d You asked in a tone that she knew you used on her when she was assuming too much\u2026 or little depending on the situation. \u201cI WANT you there, but we both know I rarely get what I want. Besides, having a\u2026 well me as an ally could be helpful. I can come and visit and bring others with me. I know Isaac will miss you a lot as will many others. Not to mention they won\u2019t stand a chance on family Vacations.\u201d You answered and concluded with a joke. She giggled a little at it than was sorrowful again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you all. You may not be blood related but you are more than worth the family title.\u201d She said as she started to whimper out a cry. None of the others were getting close to her so you did. They didn\u2019t like it but you didn\u2019t give them a choice as you held them back with a telekinetic barrier. You finally reached her and put a hand on her. She snapped into a half hug. She was getting to big to clamp onto your whole body with hers so her mandibles and front legs grasped you as she hugged you into her. You pet her along her eyes to sooth her, using your calming mind probe to help her do just that, calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, my Uncle Rusty lives way out in California. You don\u2019t see us thinking any less of him do you? Just because you got a new life ahead of you doesn\u2019t mean we are forgetting or shunning you. But you are growing up and we will be happy for you. Sad to see you leave, but happy that you are getting on with your life. Like I said, I\u2019ll be around\u2026 if you want me to.\u201d You comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I want you around. I never want you to leave. But I wouldn\u2019t be able to force you to stay with me all the time. You have your life to live as well.\u201d She said after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can keep him here if you wish.\u201d Stated one of the female spiders from before, the big ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t be able to. Even if I ordered it, which I won\u2019t, none of you would be able to do more than piss him off. I prefer him as an ally, friend, and family over anything near an enemy, prisoner, or slave.\u201d She said as she let you go and circled around. \u201cIn fact, that will be my first command and wish. His family is off limits no matter what. Even if they are attacking me, you are to do nothing to harm them in any way. If I find that they are distressed by any under me, than I will be more angry than I will know what to do with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Said her Father but you could tell he was not understanding why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you stay, for a little bit?\u201d Eve asked, or more accurately begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, only till the morning. I\u2019ll just contact everyone silently to let them know of your knew status and responsibilities.\u201d You answered, to which she brushed up against you then looked over at her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it ok if I have this night to myself?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may. There are some things you really should take care of. But one more day won\u2019t hurt.\u201d He replies then escorts her\u2026 and you, to an area. You both talked about things and you spent most of the night comforting her and getting her ready for her new and sudden change. In the morning she didn\u2019t want to let you go, but you had convinced her to do so and concentrate on her task. If she was going to be a Queen, than she should be the best damn Queen in history. If nothing else, you had her back. That calmed her more than anything.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Kelsey as you two walked to your next class. Of course you had to watch out for the Vampire Clan and some of the other upperclassman but that was kind of natural by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Nothing, I\u2019m fine.\u201d You said in a default answer. But the fact that you added the \u2018huh?\u2019 in there was not a sign that things were fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I know things aren\u2019t \u2018fine\u2019. Caleb, you\u2019ve been distracted all day and a little since Eve left. It\u2019s been a few months and we all are accepting of it\u2026 except you.\u201d Kelsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. I just miss her I guess.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d Asked Kelsey, as usual the slightly jealous and pouting sense of the question alluded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I like her. I like her just as much as I like you. Let\u2019s face it. Being around humans all the time can get tiring and\u2026 stagnate. With you and Eve it was something more special. I value you two a lot and I\u2019m sorry if I never said it. In the back of my mind I know that your duties with your kind will take you away as well. I will miss you a lot as well.\u201d You admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve said how much we mean to you on more than one occasion. That\u2019s not what I\u2026\u201d Kelsey started but remembered your inability to have children as well as limited immortality. She induced that dangling that situation in front of you again would not be a kind move. So she quickly became more sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have more time later. She has to get the hang of the whole Queen thing and it may take a while. Knowing her, I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t sent a hoard of her little\u2026 subjects to get you. She has always been attached to you, sometimes literally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how has popular life been treating you?\u201d You asked as you both sat down in class. I was a free period instead of the usual study hall. Because of some changes there was no homework. Even when there was some, the teacher that was in charge of it knew that the both of you got done with your work very fast. So, as long as you two were relatively quiet, you could speak. But since it was usually quiet in the room it was difficult to speak about sensitive things. Today however, people were more noisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of annoying. You would think that being in eighth grade would help, but it just makes the guys hornier and the girls more jealous. It helps that I have the hottest guy in the school as a friend.\u201d She answered. \u201cWhat about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it helps that I keep my attractant down. People treat me normal because of that. Sure I get a few looks every once in a while. But they just go right past and go for the guys that will notice their\u2026 lack of decency. What is it with girls and showing as much skin as possible?\u201d You asked in a board tone. Normally it would be a mute question but Kelsey knew it was an actual one. She didn\u2019t know if she should be aghast at his lack of interest in such things or impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t like this?\u201d she asked as she draped her neck line down with her finger perhaps more seductively than was necessary. Once again, the suggestiveness went right over your head. You looked at her, what she was doing, then back to observing the class passively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said before. If all I wanted was a body I could just ensnare a Playboy chick or any of the women around. Heck, your Mother even offered. Without the person it would be little difference than you seducing one of your servants.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be rather boring, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d she agreed. \u201cDid I mention how special you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout as often as I say it to you, many times.\u201d You answered with a smile at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo things like that doesn\u2019t interest you either?\u201d she asked, but more joked, as she directed you vision to Carly. She had a habit of wearing border line dress code skirts then jacking them up when teachers weren\u2019t looking. She currently was sitting on the study hall table so that over half the class could see up her skirt without strain. Not much different could be said for her other clothing. As strict as the school was in dress code, there were obvious holes in it, that she used every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, she\u2019s a Junior High girl that is trying to compete with a Succubus. She isn\u2019t even in your league. I half expect her to be pregnant before senior year. I bet that will shut her up a little. Changing in her hard worked slim figure for a baby and a dozen extra pounds.\u201d You answered, complimenting Kelsey and securing your stance in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome how I doubt that. She has a big mouth. She probably would still try to fit into those clothes, even with a pregnant belly sticking out of them and rolls of fat in other places.\u201d She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d You commented then you both shook the image out of your heads. With your overweight family you weren\u2019t against those kind of people. But Carly already was wearing clothes a few sizes too small. The sight of fat rolls starting to rip the seams of the clothes while the billowed out and her trying to seduce someone with such a look was a little much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you getting hungry?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet. I had some\u2026 of Sarah about a week ago. Not a lot to do since then and Doug hasn\u2019t had me do anything strenuous to need more. Why? Volunteering?\u201d You asked as you playfully licked your lips to which she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot\u2026 well\u2026 maybe\u2026 My Mother also wouldn\u2019t mind. You have to know she\u2019s been craving it ever since you fed on me. She feels kind of left out.\u201d Kelsey stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose. How about this. Tell her that you convinced me to feed on her the next time I get hungry. I don\u2019t mind you taking the credit.\u201d You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? You don\u2019t mind?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, now that I think of it. Mother\u2019s day is coming up. Why don\u2019t I stop by then? It can be your gift.\u201d you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about your Mother?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she doesn\u2019t really get into the whole sensual side of feeding. Sure she likes it like everyone else but she prefers little trinkets and stuff she can keep and look at to remind herself of us or something. The way I see it, feeding on your mother will allow me to materialize something awesome for her. Last year I got her a heart chest made of gold with sliver trimming and diamonds around it to keep all her jewelry. Papa asked me to keep it down this year so that the others had a chance\u2026 including him.\u201d You revealed to which her eyes sparkled at imagining it. The rest of the class was used to talk about other random stuff.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it is hard to have a conversation with a spider when they don\u2019t have a mind to do so. They just scurried off or at most hissed at you. You knew they were forbidden to bite you or your family but it was getting to the point that you were tempted to seek her out to see if she was ok. But either way, the summer was coming around and you were waiting for Mr. Vale to come. Summer Vacations were subtly dismissed. Not that most of them didn\u2019t want to do it. It was just getting harder to convince their jobs and lives that a few month vacation was needed. So you agreed and just went to visit them. Running to California or New Hampshire and back wasn\u2019t so bad in the area of exercise. Not only that but they almost insisted you do so on an empty stomach so you could drink from them during your visits. With Kelsey\u2019s Mother joining the group of people you drank from, it was becoming a literal blood family. Although you made sure they knew they weren\u2019t just there to feed you. You had gone on a blood fast a few times when they indicated such. Finally you caught the scent of Mr. Vale at the door before he knocked at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Oh, Mr. Vale. Caleb has been waiting eagerly for you.\u201d Your Mother stated as she invited him into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded in a polite manner but stayed silent as she escorted him down stairs to the meeting room where your family was enjoying a movie. You had to adjust your eyes to do so as the light from the new HDTVs bothered them slightly but it was possible. You even made a game at trying to replicate the special effects that the movie produced. Sometimes you could, other times it could end up with a weak version. Yet it was entertaining none the less. Kelsey was around most of the time. She preferred it and her Mother, after a long talk with you and securing your inability to have children, allowed her over as much as she wanted. It wasn\u2019t like you would be sleeping with her or anything. For starters you couldn\u2019t sleep. But in either case she like the nonservant oriented atmosphere of your house. Papa and Mom were just glad that you had someone else in Eve\u2019s absence to confide in, more specifically in the area of your Vampire side. As hard as they tried, they couldn\u2019t pretend to understand. Kelsey couldn\u2019t either, but she was closer. Suffice to say, the room perked up when the long expected Mr. Vale came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Vale, it is good to see you again,\u201d you replied as you stood to address him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are too kind Master.\u201d He responded with a bow. Kelsey nudged you comically at the \u2018Master\u2019 word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume you are here to escort me to another world created by Miss. Isibelle?\u201d you asked in a form of verification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I hear we have more time than before. Is that correct?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. As much as it helped, my family have their lives to attend. It was a great help while it lasted but I assume none on the rising level of challenges that you will be affording,\u201d you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you say, my Master. Are you ready to depart?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose as ready as I\u2019m going to be,\u201d you replied after getting an affirmative nod from Papa and Mom then getting a hug and kiss on the cheek from Kesley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, out of respect for your human family I will present you with two options. One is slightly more adult in content and the other is more childish. While they are both challenging in their own rights, I understand that at certain ages things shouldn\u2019t be allowed. However the other that you don\u2019t choose must be visited next year in accordance with the carefully created guidance Mistress Isibelle has created.\u201d Mr. Vale stated then pulled out two series and put them on the table that was currently in the center of the room. The two you had to choose from were\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were wearing your usual black sleeveless with the silver dragon on the back and glyph on the front, black shorts, and your special black shoes with the knife hidden inside. You didn\u2019t need the knife but it was there none the less. Kelsey was having a hard time letting you go so she insisted you fill up on blood before you left. It left her weak but satisfied that she helped in your new venture. Either way, you were at full power, had a pleasant taste in your mouth, and was about to separate from Mr. Vale. You knew little of this realm as well but your parents insisted that you not go into the Blade realm until next year. Being in a series that killed hundreds of people, wither they be Vampires or humans, could wait another year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI helped in the last one because it was your first. Now that you know the volatile and unknown nature of another realm it is best if you figure it out by yourself. It is just another form of experience training.\u201d He replied as he stopped just before the main streets of the city you were about to enter. \u201cI will come and get you when you have learned what the realm was meant to teach you. Try to learn from the Vampires like you did in the previous one. They will be able to teach you much but be careful whom you trust. That is all the advise I am allowed to give.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, thanks and see you later,\u201d you replied, then with a wave he disappeared. You wondered it that was a power you would get eventually or something only he had. Either way, you could see why Miss. Isibelle kept him around. He seemed insanely loyal and useful. One had to wonder what she did for him to follow her instructions so much like this. \u201cSo\u2026 if I was a Vampire, were would I hide?\u201d You asked comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d greeted a boy with blonde haired boy. His fangs were easily visible as was his scent. What intrigued you was that he was out in sunlight. Were the Vampires of this realm immune to sunlight like you were? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was easy,\u201d you said then bent down to meet him on his level. You felt he was old in a deceptive way. Kind of like you in that you were young but the power inside was extremely old. But, unlike the Vampires in the other realm, you felt no hostility in him or evil for that matter. \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kinda look weird. Oh, my name is Kotaro,\u201d the young boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so? My name is Caleb and it nice to meet you. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, why are you out here all on your own?\u201d You asked as you tried to figure out how the world worked. In the last one you visited it would because they were a level E. If that was the case than\u2026 you really didn\u2019t want to think of killing this young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brother and I were on our way to the Special Zone. But we were attacked by soldiers and got separated. He said that he would play decoy while I got away.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m new around here. What is the special zone?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you must be from REALLY far away if you don\u2019t know what the special zone is. Everyone does\u2026 wait, do you know what Vampires are?\u201d He asked as if he was determining how clueless you were. But his own nature seemed to amplify this feeling of ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am, and yes I know what Vampires are. Not sure everything about them but I know some of the basics. But I assume from your fangs that you are one. Do all Vampires around here have the ability to be out in the daylight?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. My brother can\u2019t but there must be others right?\u201d He answered with a smile. However it vanished as he saw some humans dressed in full armor. \u201cOh no! I got to get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was out of impulse or whatever but he grabbed your hand and led you along with him down alleys and through streets as he ran. You didn\u2019t know where to go or what to do but this young boy seemed pure enough to trust\u2026 for the moment. He finally stopped as he tripped over a bottle and into an alley to which you met a pair of people, also Vampires but older and one was carrying a wounded one. The stench that reeked from the wound was undoubtedly silver and you could see sun burns on their flesh. Evidently Kotaro was right about the others not being immune to the sunlight. After a bit of persuasion that you allowed him to take the lead on, he agreed to travel with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are free to come as well. But as a human your freedom in our camp will be limited at best.\u201d The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d You said at the same time as a woman from behind you. She wore a blue uniform and had brown hair as well as catching her breath like she was just running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMimiko!\u201d Kotaro exclaimed as he ran up and gave her a big hug. You were now surrounded by people you didn\u2019t know and over half of them were other vampires that you didn\u2019t have the specs on. But for appearances you kept your cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are also welcome to come along.\u201d The man stated, after taking a minute to think it over. You didn\u2019t like the grin he had but followed him with the other two. In a way you were learning a lot. You learned that at least these Vampires couldn\u2019t sense you. That either meant they were too weak or they couldn\u2019t. Either way, you had no real reason to show them otherwise. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo who are you?\u201d asked Mimiko as you sat with her at a table. For a while you played with Kotaro along with her, making little paper things and what not. But before long they went to play with the other children and you were sitting with her and a woman named Kelly Wong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s tricky,\u201d You answered as you scratched your head, trying to figure out how much to say. The last realm you were in was able to handle it. But something told you that it would be harder for most to accept. Heck, most people in the other one that already knew better still didn\u2019t believe. They accepted but weren\u2019t willing to believe it. A strange mindset to have but still, it did warrant a certain amount of caution. \u201cWell my name is Caleb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we figured that much out by Kotaro\u2019s speaking with you. It appears you aren\u2019t from around here.\u201d Kelly stated as if telling you to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that. I just arrived and bumped into Kotaro. He kind of grabbed me when he was running so I just went along with it,\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just let a child grab you and pull you along. Then you followed the said child into a known Vampire den just for kicks?\u201d Mimiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly\u2026 well I suppose that is what happened but not my reasoning. I suppose there is no getting around it. I am a Vampire as well.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are? You smell like a\u2026 well now that you say it you do have a tint of a Vampire scent on you. But your overall scent is human and\u2026 something else.\u201d Ms. Wong responded after subtly taking in your scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Where I come from, I am the only Vampire. I was turned by the only other one before me. Kind of like a village blood line secret. Anyway, when my type turns another we die so I was given mine about 3+ years ago. Relatively speaking, I am a new Vampire. I worked hard to live among my human family safely and peacefully. But admittedly, I know little about what it is to be a proper Vampire. So my family sent me here to learn from other Vampires. When I saw Kotaro I could sense his pure nature so I just stuck with him. I don\u2019t know anything about what most of you are talking about. Being raised by humans can do that,\u201d you replied as you addressed as many of their questions as possible without saying too much. You wisely left out the whole them being a Anime series thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. If what you are saying is true, than we\u2019ve been really rude. Is there something I can get you?\u201d asked Ms. Wong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thank you. One of my close friends let me drink from her before I left. She said it was her way of making sure I was safe. So I\u2019m full at the moment.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo all this talk about Kowloon children and things must be confusing huh?\u201d asked Mimiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first. But believe it or not I have heard about such things before. Just not in relation to the terms you are using. To be honest I am glad it is only that,\u201d you stated back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Asked Ms. Wong, slightly confused at your referring to an obvious crisis they have with such complacency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere I come from there are major organizations known as the \u2018vampire clan\u2019. Just a bunch of humans that want to be vampires and try to act like what the movies depict them to be. I do say that it is quite annoying. I must say, that I prefer a setting where the bad people are known in such a black and white sense. Back home, I can\u2019t really do anything about my problem. I mean they are humans, idiot humans, but innocent humans none the less. I don\u2019t kill or feed on innocent people. So\u2026 Like I said, I\u2019m glad,\u201d you clarified as you looked out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe it is a human thing, but I am glad you don\u2019t feed or kill innocent people,\u201d Mimiko stated with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs am I,\u201d Ms Wong said but noticed the rare gleam of sunlight hit your face and not do anything. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Not that your story isn\u2019t believable, but you don\u2019t seem like one of us. You mind showing something?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d you replied as you turned back to her. First you protruded your fangs before retracting them. Then you let your eyes flash for her and finally allowed your Vampire scent and attractant out in a minimal setting then retracted that as well. \u201cGood enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you hide so well? Sunlight doesn\u2019t even effect you,\u201d Ms. Wong asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is something only my type can do\u2026 well as far as I know. Kotaro seems to be able to survive in sunlight just fine. Like I said, I was sent here to learn from other Vampires. I met a few I learned from about a year ago but now I came here,\u201d you answered. However, shortly after a chopper appeared above the house and started shining lights that Ms. Wong fled from and you got to your feet as if not sure what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWait!\u201d Mimiko yelled as she followed after her. You never understood why every single character in every show that was slightly important expected other people to wait on them. Did it even occur to her that Ms. Wong would die if she waited in, what appeared to be, a \u2018sun lamp\u2019 light? Either way you followed after them but was just in time to see the doors get blasted open and Mimiko on her knees like she just fell. You reached for her to help her up but got a shot of pain in your arm for your efforts. Before you could do much else your body was littered with bullets. You weren\u2019t expecting them to shoot without warning. Not only that, but the silver bullet in your arm was slowing down your speed. But soon about 40 more rendered your body motionless and sprawled on the ground. You thought about trying to get up. But knowing your luck you would just get pumped full of more holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could vaguely hear Mimiko scream and a somewhat large commotion going on. You waited to you were alone before you used your mist to rid yourself of your silver passengers. You got your bearings back and wondered to the courtyard where the commotion seemed to centered. You didn\u2019t have much time to think as you saw Kotaro being held by the man you had seen with Ms. Wong. But by the look of it, they were no longer on the same sides. Along with some well placed and overheard words, you ascertained they were this \u2018Kowloon\u2019 that you heard so much about. They sprung away before you could do much as you were still suffering the effects of the silver for a few moments as you limped into an entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no intention in apologizing at the moment. But when this all over you\u2019ll have my gratitude.\u201d Said a guard as you entered the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. Can\u2019t I get a little sorry or something? That silver hurt like hell,\u201d you stated as you leaned on a wall then throwing a bullet you missed from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb!\u201d exclaimed Mimiko. \u201cBut you were shot, many times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well\u2026 I told you I was different. Although I would\u2019ve preferred not being shot at all,\u201d you replied as you stretched your body a little and your visible wounds, and shirt, healed back to normal. \u201cIt looks like you are about to go get Kotaro back. Mind if I tag along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can keep up. We can\u2019t afford to waste any more time. Why do you want to help?\u201d Asked a very powerful looking Vampire in a red outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I hate people that assault little kids, especially Vampires. Seriously, they couldn\u2019t pick on someone even half their size?\u201d You answered then twirled your arm as if to work out the kinks then did likewise with the other as you walked and into the open more and off the wall. \u201cPlus Kotaro seems like a good kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The Vampire in red stated. You noticed he had a sword that looked\u2026 very dangerous, even to you. Judging by the guy\u2019s scent, you could tell he probably could use it in more than a skilled fashion. He also seemed personally attached to Kotaro. You thought you heard him call him his brother but now wasn\u2019t the time to worry about it. As he jumped into the night at an insane speed you followed. But you found that you weren\u2019t as good at jumping and flying as he was. So you stuck to the strait stretch of a road that led to the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t have time to have fun with each of the Vampires that got in your way or in the way of the Vampire you were apparently allies with. So you used your saliva needles to take them out. It was obviously not something they were expecting so they didn\u2019t bother dodging. That ended up being a fatal mistake. One shot to the head and they ashed just like a fictional Vampire would. You let the others catch up so you weren\u2019t stuck in a situation you knew next to nothing about. But as you closed the gap you shot to saliva needles into the legs of the running Vampire, well the one Carrying Kotaro anyway. This stopped him and you sped between him and where he was going, shortly followed by the other three that were chasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me you were one of us. I would\u2019ve gave you a place by my side.\u201d The Vampire said that was holding Kotaro, as if trying to entice you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet Kotaro go, or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d you demanded in your ominous voice that you used when your emotions were slightly forward in your decision making. Kotaro wasn\u2019t really having that big of an effect. I was the fact that this \u2018Kowloon child\u2019 had thought it wise to destroy a child\u2019s life and attempt to replicate the pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would let them into the Special zone?\u201d the Vampire beside you asked, as if trying to gauge your intentions. It had only been at best an hour since he met you, so it was understandable. Especially if Kotaro was his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know next to nothing about your apparent feud with these \u2018Kowloon children\u2019. So I don\u2019t know enough to hinder anyone from anything. That conflict is up to the two of you and I don\u2019t have a problem with either outcome or side at the moment. What I do have a problem with is Vampires that think it is ok to feed on, kill, and use children for their own gains as if they were trash or tools. Innocents are bad enough, but kids\u2026 that just pisses me off,\u201d you replied then glared at the Vampire in question. \u201cTime\u2019s up. Release him, or die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can order me around? I don\u2019t care who any of you are. I do what I want and will\u2026\u201d he started but was interrupted by the Vampire beside you increasing his power. This made him drop Kotaro. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! He\u2019s using the Hide Hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited as you saw the Vampire beside you rush forward. You had learned something new and Kotaro wasn\u2019t in danger for the moment. So you let things play out. This \u2018Hide Hand\u2019 seemed useful. It was like a telekinetic power that effected things as its wielder willed. Applications began flooding your mind but your attention was still on the situation at hand. You watched as the Vampire commanded the little girl he had turned to be a blocker for the sword coming at him. But she was shot by Ms. Wong. You searched her mind and saw her intentions and deemed them understandable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha. You shouldn\u2019t let your emotions get the better of you.\u201d The other Vampire said but Kotaro was having none of that. He pushed off with his feet, giving him a good shot considering he was hogtied at the moment. \u201cAh! That\u2019s it!\u201d he said as he went to kick the bound and still squirming Kotaro only to have his foot caught by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I was clear. Let Kotaro go and you get to live,\u201d you stated then squeezed his leg hard enough to sever it halfway up his calf where you had your hold. He tried to crawl towards what you assumed was the special zone but you flipped him over so he was face up and shot a series of saliva needles into his body, pinning him to the street. As he only had 2 out of the usual 4 limbs left he wasn\u2019t hard to restrain in this fashion. The red dressed Vampire finished him off with a single sword plunge to which the impaled Vampire turned to ash as your needles went away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI am afraid that would be a little too much,\u201d the Vampire you had now come to know as Jiro, aka Silver Blade, stated upon your request to travel with them. Mimiko had invited the three of you into the Special zone. You were surprised of the strength of the barrier surrounding it. It would take almost every drop of energy you had remaining to break in if you wished to do so. Much easier to just get invited in. But now it looked like his cautiousness on Kotaro\u2019s behalf was dictating his preference away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe\u2026 does he have to go?\u201d Kotaro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I could hold one more person in my apartment if we had to.\u201d Mimiko stated but you didn\u2019t wish to cause them any trouble. That and you were grateful that Jiro had put you on the no kill list. Honestly you didn\u2019t know if you could win in a straight fight. He had already demonstrated a few skills that you had no knowledge of. It was quite possible that he and his hidden allies would be more than a match for you. Heck, you were only a 15 year old kid and a 3 year old Vampire. There was no way you had the experience they did as being centuries old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok,\u201d you interjected to prevent another round of arguments between them. You knelt down to Kotaro to address him more directly. \u201cThank you very much for your company. I really did learn a lot from you. Even all tied up like that you still got a shot in on that other Kowloon guy. It was an honor and pleasure to meet you. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll bump into each other again in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I have a feeling that it will be sooner rather than later.\u201d You replied with a smile then stood before things could get to drama filled. \u201cThank you for your help and tolerance. I hope to see you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs do we.\u201d Jiro stated to which you nodded to each other in somewhat of a fake smile that you both put on for Kotaro. With that done you waved to them as they left and went to explore this \u2018Special Zone\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around a place that was supposed to be a safe haven for Vampires wasn\u2019t as glamorous as you thought it would be. Even as the day came to a close and the night came you didn\u2019t really find anything worth gawking at. You found yourself wishing you had stayed with Jiro, Kotaro, and Mimiko. At least things were interesting with them around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wondered aimlessly you observed a few things that you weren\u2019t took keen on. You witnessed a few kidnappings and a few Vampire Feedings. But once again, you didn\u2019t know enough about the realm you were in to help one side or the other. But there was one instance that you found yourself interfering, as you knew for a fact that the girl in question didn\u2019t want to die from being fed on and the Vampire cornering her did want to drink her dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please just let me go.\u201d The girl begged. She was a small little thing maybe about 14 years old. Maybe there was something to the fact that she looked strikingly similar to Kelsey, just less\u2026 well succubus like. That and if she was Kelsey she would\u2019ve clobbered this idiot by now\u2026 or enslaved him. But for now this girl was in trouble and obviously trembling in fear. One of many ways that even you preferred your meals. Though you only scared the person before drinking when you were up at Vacations. You just weren\u2019t cruel enough to do it any other time, as if you would drink from a complete stranger like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, my dear. Don\u2019t be afraid. I promise that your last moments will be filled with nothing but bliss.\u201d Said the Vampire as he cornered her in a dead end alley. She tried to strafe from side to side in order to find a gap to run through. But the more she moved the more hopeless she saw the situation. The only thing you learned from this little incident was that it apparently felt orgasmic to be bit in this realm, just like with you\u2026 or close to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say the same about you,\u201d you interjected as you made your presence known as you leaned against one of the walls that lined the alley. You stood straight as you were done observing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want human? You do realize what serious trouble you\u2019re in right now, right?\u201d He asked. You wondered if your technique of hiding your Vampirism was really that effective so they couldn\u2019t tell you were one. But Jiro seemed to be able to tell so you induced that they were just arrogant\u2026 or weak\u2026 or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny. I was under the impression that, here in the special zone, Vampires were forbidden to drink from unwilling hosts,\u201d you stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you know about us huh? Does that mean your with the Company?\u201d asked the Vampire as the girl behind him was moving to the more open area he wasn\u2019t blocking in order to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. I just arrived in the Special Zone this morning. But I more than know about Vampires. Until know I\u2019ve been observing. But this girl obviously doesn\u2019t wish to be drank from. That and I have a permanent bias against Vampires that such blood from unwilling hosts, specifically the innocent ones,\u201d you revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so,\u201d he said then looked at the girl as she had almost made it past him. She froze as she fell under his glare. He looked to be on the verge of either backing off or doing something sadistic. His wicked smile at her almost made you act but you gave him the benefit of the doubt for now. But your muscles flexed with preparation to rush to her defense if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The alley was narrow to begin with so he had more than enough room to grab a hold of her and put her in between you and him. He held her body against his as he looked over her shoulder so that he was teasingly close to her neck as his arms both pinned her arms as well as groped her into his body. The way he was holding her, he could easily use her as a shield of get a few gulps of blood in before disposing of her by the time you could get her away from him. The girl screamed at the sudden position change but then only whimpered as she stood groped in his arms. She was terrified and the emotion showed as he chuckled at his accomplishment and position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must be your girlfriend of something. In that case, I\u2019ll let you join her once she is in hell,\u201d he stated then licked a section on her neck, reveling in her quivering and whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are mistaken. I have never met her before. But if you don\u2019t release her I will not hesitate to kill you,\u201d you responded to which you only got a sadistic laugh and another pleasure lick to his future feeding area. \u201cWhat is your name human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrea.\u201d She answered with a quiver but also almost out of breath. She was in pain from his groping and in horror at the prospect of being drank dry by a real live Vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrea, I promise that everything will be ok. You will live through tonight.\u201d You assured with a content smile that was lost on her at the moment. You could tell that she just hoped it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep.\u201d He said as he laughed to which he grew his fangs in preparation. She grew bug eyed as she saw the deadly fangs with the corner of her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d You said. With that you used your abilities, compliments of Kaname, to crush both of his arms and push him back from Andrea. She screeched at this and ran a few steps before noticing that she was actually free. She looked behind to the howling Vampire as he fell back into a wall, now armless. The sight and experience was too much for her so she fainted. You rushed forward, catching her and laying her against a wall before turning your attention back to the loud and threatening Vampire that now had two less limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done? Do you know who I am? I am part of the Coven, the most influential group in the Special Zone,\u201d he boasted proudly.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Somehow I doubt that. Even if that were true, then I would be doing them a favor by ridding them of an unruly member. Either way, I did warn you what would happen if you didn\u2019t let her go.\u201d You replied back as you stood over him. You weren\u2019t that big compared to him but everyone would seem tall if the person being compared was sprawled out on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she\u2019s alive, isn\u2019t she?\u201d He said as he seemed to realize that it was butt kissing time. \u201cI was just going to scare her. I wasn\u2019t actually going to drink all her blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a suspicion that you are lying through your teeth,\u201d you challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Lying? Never. I am and always will be a man of my word.\u201d He defended to which you knew that it wasn\u2019t true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you deserve a chance. As you\u2019ve said, she is alive. I will allow you to leave under the condition that you go to your master and tell him what happened. If you wish you can leave out the part of you scaring young Andrea almost to death. However I expect some kind of confirmation by tomorrow. Understood?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d He stuttered then took the chance of limited and potential freedom to run. You weren\u2019t too eager to kill in general so you let him go. You were lost and board anyway, so having some big wig address you might be of some use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for the immediate future you had this young girl to look after. You couldn\u2019t just leave her there. So you picked her up and leapt onto a tall platform you had seen before. It was on the back side of a tall billboard and had about a 20x70 foot area behind it and out of view. Because of the loud city underneath it was confined enough to hide a scream if necessary. So now you laid her down against the wall so she didn\u2019t roll off or fall off upon awakening then stood on the edge, looking over the city. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stood over the city, well most of it, from your perch. Listening and watching too many things as they unfolded. You observed that there was not as much \u2018peace\u2019 as you thought there would be in a city so dedicated to establishing such a goal. On top of that you smelled an overflow of blood like you hadn\u2019t smelled before. It was almost intoxicating as its unmistakable scent was carried to your nose. Not that it was a bad smell. Like any Vampire, you greatly enjoyed the smell of fresh blood. But the concept of why it was there was what made you despise the smell at the moment despite its effect of making you crave the tasty liquid. You didn\u2019t know what made you sicker. The smell of so much death or the fact that you felt yourself, or more accurately your body, be so attracted to it in a primal desire to feed. But it was this realization that kept you in check. You doubt that if you hadn\u2019t been thinking about it that you would\u2019ve been able to catch yourself in acting on those instincts and urges. The only good thing you observed was a few more people using the coveted \u2018hide hand\u2019 that you were currently seeking. From this your observations you were able to direct your body\u2019s instincts and thoughts to figure it out. In a way it was like an extremely advanced version of your telekinesis technique that you had picked up from Kaname. However it also used almost double the amount of energy. Perks included making a mostly impenetrable kinetic shield around you or where ever to stop hold or direct projectiles. Most commonly you saw it increase natural abilities and catch bullets. But now you understood why the bridge you were on with Jiro almost ripped apart when he did it. It was a very powerful technique. Another weakness it had was that it lacked the preciseness of Kaname\u2019s technique. So while useful, it didn\u2019t replace your other abilities and you still needed to practice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d came a moan as your thoughts were brought back to Andrea, who was waking behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt that she may react better if you weren\u2019t smothering her with attention right off the bat. So you kept looking over the city. After all, you were near her age and, even with your enhanced physic, still looked your own age. Hopefully giving her a little space would help her remain calm despite her previous condition. You also hoped you wouldn\u2019t have to force the issue. You heard her heart race as she realized and confirmed where she was and who you probably were to get her up where she was. But her heart beat slowly calmed down as she started to process her situation. At the very least she was alive and that had to get you some points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Excuse me,\u201d she stated to get your attention. You turned and looked at her as nicely as you could but still in a stance that signified some amount of power, enough that your defeat of her previous\u2026 host would be more than believable. You thought about showing your eyes but decided against it. \u201cThank you for saving me from the\u2026 that was a Vampire\u2026 right?\u201d she asked as if not believing what she was remembering but enough to ask, hoping that wasn\u2019t the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he is a Vampire. So am I. But while he seemed to force his way on young girls like yourself, I find that behavior disgusting and insanely immoral. Are you ok?\u201d You answered than followed up with a question on her well being. You hoped that it would signify you weren\u2019t like probably the only other Vampire she had been in contact with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 yes, I suppose I am ok\u2026 for now.\u201d She answered as she checked herself for injuries and whatnot. She more than once checked her neck for any sign of teeth marks. But her answer was clear that she was not really trusting you. As you had just confirmed yourself as the same type of being that almost killed her, she wasn\u2019t sure what you wanted. \u201cSo what, saving me for later or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly. You just look like someone I know and care for very much. So when I saw you cornered by that other guy I couldn\u2019t just let him have his way. As you can probably imagine. Saving everyone in a city this big is not possible. Lately I was just observing and seeing if at least some of the Vampires here were honorable. Apparently there are laws that dictated their actions. But as the saying goes, rules are meant to be broken. Hate to say it but they break laws just as often as you human do. Go figure, for all their self righteous arrogance, they are no different than those they belittle.\u201d You answered and ranted a little before pausing then looking at her more calmly. \u201cI am sorry you were attacked like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t you, I suppose. And you did save me from the Vampire that was going to kill me. But won\u2019t he just come back?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe might. But I took off his arms. If you can\u2019t defend yourself against a no armed Vampire than, no offense, but you are just asking for it. Plus a no armed man of any stature should be easy for you to spot.\u201d You replied in a joking manner to which she cracked a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re not going to\u2026 you know?\u201d She asked as she gestured to her neck, asking you if you were going to drink her blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless you asked me to. Even then it would be a rare instance of acceptance. I would never force you to do it. Even if you said it was ok but your heart was going the other way I would refuse. You don\u2019t have to worry about me, I would sooner starve than drink from someone that didn\u2019t wish it,\u201d you replied in a tone that made her accept your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is a load off. So\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind me asking, what are you going to do with me now?\u201d She asked rather directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would take you home, wherever that is, when you were ready. Or at least a street corner you felt comfortable with. I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea leaving you in that alley. Even if that other Vampire wasn\u2019t around, an alley isn\u2019t exactly the most pleasant place to wake,\u201d you responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like that?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. I needed the break anyway. Watching over you for a few hours wasn\u2019t that big of a drain on my schedule. Did you think I was going to charge you for my efforts or something?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really get a lot of free stuff. People generally want something and rarely do something for nothing.\u201d She replied back. \u201cBeing a Vampire I thought you would want some blood or something like that for your payment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, not unless you were offering and were content with it. I can tell you would sooner jump off this platform than let me drink from you. So shall we?\u201d You answered as if it didn\u2019t even matter to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we what?\u201d She asked as she looked at your outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I assume you want to spend at least a little bit of the night sleeping in a bed, preferably your bed. So let\u2019s go. You can direct me wherever you want. If you don\u2019t want me to see where you live that is totally understandable. Although I could just follow your scent if I really wanted to track you down. Even so, I know you might feel better if I didn\u2019t pursue you in any way, much less know where you live,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell this is going to be a long night,\u201d she sighed as she hesitantly walked over and took your hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thanked you before riding the bus elsewhere and you assured her that you wouldn\u2019t search for her. It was a strange thing to promise but if you were only in this realm for a short time than it would be unwise to stay too attached to a random person. Be she did help you in a way. You were able to establish and learn the hide hand while watching over her as well as state your stance to an underling of whomever that other Vampire was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the packaged blood that you found around that you didn\u2019t like the smell of so you just settled for a deer you found as well as a few dogs, but of course left them alive. You didn\u2019t need some kid crying that their dog died. But something told you that it would be a good idea to remain as close to full power for the time being. Soon you got tired of seeing the same old thing on every street corner and alley so you just relaxed near a river as you soaked up the sunlight. You figured that you could get a little nap in but was interrupted a half hour into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d said a female voice that made you open your eyes and look at the source. \u201cI believe you spoke with an associate of my Master. I am the personal assistant to Zelman Clock. Will you follow me please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d you replied as you got up to address her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t speak much as she led you to a street, in a car, and through a mansion. Finally she opened a door for you but didn\u2019t follow you in as the door shut. You looked around in the dark until your gaze rested on a figure reclining on a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I sent for the person that reduced my subordinate\u2019s arms to ash I wasn\u2019t expecting someone so young,\u201d said the figure as the candles around the room ignited on their own. But you were no fool in this respect. You could feel the power increase as he caused the fire to do so. He was another that you felt an unusually high power from and wasn\u2019t sure if you could defeat in a straight fight. \u201cHowever what he didn\u2019t say between his ranting was that you were a Vampire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be fair, I didn\u2019t tell him I was,\u201d you admitted openly as you stood as politely as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so, for a child like yourself to get the better of him and he not even able sense something as simple as this, it is pathetic. However I do find it odd that I was blind to your presence until this point as well. What bloodline do you come from?\u201d Zelman asked as he reclined on his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure. Were I come from I am the only Vampire and I only know the Vampire before me. Her name was Isibelle if that helps. She had her servant escort me here to learn from other Vampires. Truthfully I\u2019ve only been a Vampire for a very short time, 3 years in total so I still have a human family.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say Isibelle was the one that turned you? Are you sure it was her?\u201d Zelman asked, turning a shocked face for the first time since you saw him. Granted you had just met him but it didn\u2019t seem like he was surprised too often if at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was her name. As the only Vampire around where I grew up and the one that turned me, she isn\u2019t exactly someone I\u2019d forget.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I owe you something.\u201d He said as he got up to face you more formally. \u201cPlease come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d you replied as you followed him in another series of walking and car rides you were brought to another room. You heard him call a sort of meeting before he arrived so you were greeted by a room filled with very powerful feeling individuals. The strongest one by far was a small child looking person. But somehow you could tell he held a great power inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZelman, this had better be good.\u201d Said a large Vampire from a seat next to the one he was taking, leaving you alone at the end for them to observe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, this one claims that the one that turned him was Lady Isibelle.\u201d Zelman stated to which the grumbling and whatnot stopped to leave a deathly quiet room. But why was it silent was the question buzzing in your mind. They obviously knew Miss. Isibelle. But you had learned a while ago that it wasn\u2019t always a good thing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you the forebear of Lady Isibelle\u2019s bloodline?\u201d asked a human man on the far end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssuming that we are talking about the same person, than yes. How do you know Miss. Isibelle?\u201d You asked back. Deep in your blood and mind you found them familiar but as if whatever happened a life time ago, which might be very accurate if Miss. Isibelle\u2019s knowledge was really inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were hesitant to believe it when she came to see us,\u201d said the kid to your left. He paused before continuing. \u201cShe came to us and told us she created us. While the general reason was to record our actions and have it be sold for entertainment we were also given a task from her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst you must prove you are who you say you are. There is one way to be certain.\u201d Said the large man. The little kid nodded than an enormous amount of energy was released to which a light enveloped your body. It almost instantly started disintegrating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was unbelievable as you fought the effect of this attack. You used almost all your energy to just stem the tide but when that was gone you had nothing to which you were turned to ash. The ash turned to mist and started regenerating your body. You didn\u2019t know how long it was taking but you felt like someone had just removed all your energy and just got done torturing you, leaving you understandably drained and weak. You didn\u2019t know what to think at the moment. Why did they or he attack you? But in either case, it wouldn\u2019t matter. You were too weak to do anything about it. As strong as you thought you were you still had a long way to go. To think that Miss. Isibelle was so strong that all these people you were under in terms of strength were created by her. She would have to have those abilities to pass them to these people. You realized that there was much you didn\u2019t know and that you were far from the strongest person. Before you thought you were so you had to limit yourself for other\u2019s safety. But now you were literally hit with the truth that you were far from such a high standing. Slowly you woke as your body came back but was unable to move. Your energy and strength was sapped from you so all you could do was open your eyes as you lay on the floor. You were still in the company of those that you had just left for however long you were out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for harming you so. It is really the only way to be sure you are who you said you were,\u201d the child looking person said. Your attractant was fully deployed as you couldn\u2019t restrict it as well as your eyes, teeth, and other Vampirism traits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, take this and recharge,\u201d said someone that must\u2019ve been a servant or something. He dropped a human by your face as he said this. You were getting back some of your strength. Not enough to do much or even move at any lengthy amount, but more than enough to turn your head away from the unconscious human they had provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this? You refuse to eat?\u201d Asked the voice of the large Vampire from before. You couldn\u2019t speak at the moment so you just hissed back in a Vampire like sign of refusal and anger. There was more emotions running through you at the moment. But you had made up your mind on this already. You would rather starve than take from an unwilling host and never to drink dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand you may be angry with us. But we needed to make sure you were truly of Lady Isibelle\u2019s bloodline. Please eat, we need to address you on what she assigned us to do,\u201d pleaded the boy that attacked you in the first place. You had to admit that his logic made sense. You were the only one that literally couldn\u2019t die. So turning you to ash and having you reform would be something only you could do. But they weren\u2019t getting why you weren\u2019t eating. Sure you were cross with them for causing you so much physical pain but that wasn\u2019t the reason why you wouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe must be tired from that. He is only a few years old by our standards. Perhaps he can\u2019t move. Would explain why he isn\u2019t talking,\u201d Zelman stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he took the effort to look away from the meal we provided. He must only eat certain meals.\u201d The large Vampire induced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes sense. He took the arms off my subordinate when he tried forcing himself on a girl. Maybe he only eats willing people.\u201d Zelman agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, it would be an insult to give him anything other than that. Bring someone who is willing at once.\u201d The little kid looking person demanded to which there was a bunch of moving and whatnot to his order. It was obvious that whomever he was that he was in charge and the most powerful. Zelman didn\u2019t seem the type to cater to a demand by any less than a true superior in both power and status. Perhaps that was another lesson to you. Things are not always as they appear. People can to really bad things in an attempt to do something good and the opposite as well. Not only that but this little kid was the weakest looking from the outside. You doubted if he was even out of diapers. But it was clear that he was the strongest and most honored one in the room. You heard the door open and the sound of heels until they stopped next to you so you could see her ankles as she addressed the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou summoned me sirs?\u201d a voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, our friend here is starving and only drinks from willing sources. On top of that it looks like he doesn\u2019t even have the energy to properly feed or even lift his head. Would you be a dear and help him out?\u201d asked Zelman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She said, a little fluster in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt down then laid beside you. Following that she pulled your body on top of hers and your head in prime position to her neck. If there was any consolation or question that she wished to be drunk from, it was demolished when she pushed your head into her neck gently as if she was feeding a baby\u2026 kind of. You strained to open then close your mouth into her neck. Fresh blood filled your mouth and you readily gulped it down. You felt her heartbeat rise and your attractant made her pull you in to finish what you had just started. Sure your attractant had a lot to do with her willingness to help and lay next to you in such an informal fashion. But adding your feeding it was not likely that she would make your or even suggest you to stop. Your body was so drained that it barely touched your stomach before it was instantly digested and fueling your body. For some reason, this woman was filling you up more than you would think she could. You felt full enough to be at full power well before you usually stopped. So you when you were able to take control you held her in her position as you drank very slowly from her. You wanted to reward her for what she did so you allowed the euphoria that came with your bite to pleasure her more so than usual. Her nails dug into your back and your head as she held you tight but eventually you had enough and pinched a nerve to render her unconscious. Following that you retracted your fangs and licked the spot clean before getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have enough? She still has a good amount of blood in her.\u201d Zelman asked as you looked up and glared at them. You had no intention of hiding yourself at this point so you left your Vampire features out and present. The only one you retracted was the attractant, so the humans in the room could think clearly. With a wave you levitated the bodies of the unconscious humans on the floor away and against the wall, safe and secure so you could speak with the room without stepping over bodies.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anger doesn\u2019t begin to touch what I feel right now. You want me to condone your positions and status while preaching how high you value humans than in the same conversation ask why I left the ones that gave their blood freely to me alive? What the hell is wrong with all of you?!\u201d You exclaimed, obviously furious of what they were doing and treating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is only natural for us to feed on those under us.\u201d Zelman stated as if you should\u2019ve known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou arrogant fool. Humans aren\u2019t under us. They are what keep us alive. How long would you last without humans? While I can drink from other sources I know you can\u2019t. What would happen if you had NO access to humans? You need them, a heck of a lot more than they need you. Yet you spit on the actions of those that willingly give themselves to us so freely. They deserve our protection, not the other way around.\u201d You said back to him. He glared at you as you spoke in such a high manner to him. He obviously didn\u2019t agree with your way of thinking. But you weren\u2019t about to change because of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZelman, hold your tongue!\u201d declared the little boy in an ominous voice that actually got him to quiver and relent on his thoughts of continuing his declaration. Shortly after getting his point across he returned to normal to address you. \u201cI am deeply sorry for the pain I caused you. If it makes you feel any better, Lady Isibelle told me to test you in that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe did?\u201d You asked, wondering why she would want to cause you so much pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, something about readying your body to receive what she left with us to give you.\u201d He replied but looked to stray off for a moment as he continued. \u201cI am glad to see that the one she passed her blood to treats others in such high value.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. I do trust her. She gave me this gift so I will receive what she has intended for me, even on the heels of pain.\u201d You replied. You didn\u2019t know where your new vocabulary came from in that instance but that was a minor concern at the moment. \u201cWhat is it that I am receiving?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was like a long very tuff test tube that was filled with blood. He took it from his neck and personally walked over to you. Everyone else stood as he did. He eventually stood in front of you and held out the vial to which you knelt down so that you were eye level with him but didn\u2019t take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you are still cautious and I can\u2019t blame you. This is what she left us. She left this blood for you to drink. Once you do, you will understand and gain all our powers. She gave them too us after all and we have more than mastered them. This blood is the origin. While we and what we have mastered will remain, you will gain all our power and experience in wielding the power. One of many reasons why the Kowloon children are enemies is because their King tried to take and drink this himself. It was made for you and only for you. Please take and drink it. But do know, that it is suppose to bring great pain. However, since your body just regenerated it will be easier\u2026 according to lady Isibelle,\u201d the boy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. I will not waste any more time.\u201d You replied as you took the vial. He bowed, with a surprise and replication from the others as you stood and looked at the vial. You figured this was the time where a bad guy would show up in a series so you hurried and drank the whole thing. You used every ability you had to make sure it was all in your stomach before digesting it then the pain came, just like he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was going to catch you as you fell over but energy and the abilities you were absorbing and learning were randomly coming out and to the surface. They had to actually run as soon the whole room they were in was breaking apart but you were in no position to stop it. Good thing it was on the top floor of whatever building you were in because it blew off the ceiling and shot up to release the pressure. By the time you were done you were, again, in no position to move. You realized that the previous pain of being ripped apart by the boy was indeed a preparation for this but even so you couldn\u2019t remain conscious as your mind had to learn and comprehend the things it had learned as if you always knew it. Therefore you were left limp and relatively defenseless in the middle of a demolished top floor of the building you were in. You sincerely hoped that was the last time you had to feel such pain and whatnot but doubted it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were finally out of pain for a little bit and started waking up. But you had little time to adjust. As you woke and put your bed in an escalated position, you began hearing noises of a battle. You looked around to find that they must\u2019ve moved you to a hospital. First time you had been in one as a patient so you weren\u2019t sure of what to do. But you assumed that the gunfire and battle noises weren\u2019t suppose to be going on. However, some of your new powers awoke and you were able to sense almost every person in the building. Sure you could do that before but not to the degree you were able to at this point and not all of them at once in such a high level. You looked at a little tube that was been fed down your throat, depositing blood into your stomach. You removed it carefully then set it off to the side. You were now fully healed again and\u2026 definitely more powerful. You weren\u2019t sure what was going on but you sensed something was wrong. So you got out of bed and left the room you were in just in time to dodge a bullet that kept going and hit a vampire in the head, turning it to ash. You then got what was happening. Those Kowloon Children were attacking, and a hospital to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, watch out!\u201d said the human you recognized as the officer that you saw before. He was obviously high ranked and was referring to the few Vampires running at you from the other side, you blocking either side from attacking the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Am I in danger?\u201d You asked, but as the Kowloon children were in bite range, having no intention of stopping, you let out a light that plunged the entire inside of the hospital with deadly (for only that type of Vampire) light. It burst through every crevice, effectively eliminating all of them in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not.\u201d Said the human. \u201cWe originally were sent to guard you. But when they started attacking we were couldn\u2019t do as good as we thought we could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuard me? Why\u2019s that?\u201d You asked in a confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Dragon said you wouldn\u2019t need it but it was the thought that counted. He wanted to make sure you woke in relative peace. Looks like we failed in that respect.\u201d He said, lowering his head as if he failed a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell seeing as I didn\u2019t wake with fangs stuck in my neck, I think you did just fine. Besides, they earned no points by attacking a hospital. Before I was hesitant about wiping anyone out solely on their origin. But these Kowloon Children seem to be anything but morally sound and have no concept of mercy or honor. I could condone attacking a police station or a military base, but a hospital with children inside? That is just a new low,\u201d you replied, the first part toward him to which he smiled thankfully with a slight bow. But you could see his fighting strength was limited by his broken arm. So you walked toward him and reached for hit but he backed up to avoid you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t seriously tell me that you prefer to fight with a broken arm, can you?\u201d You asked, then with some hesitation but overlapped with honor and duty he let you touch the damaged limb. You didn\u2019t waste any time as you healed it then ripped off the sling and light cast. \u201cThere, now I can leave things here to you right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d he said then grabbed a two handed weapon now that his arm was free. You had a feeling that was all you were going to get out of him so you turned to mist and headed off to the top of the building to assess the condition of the city. Soon a golden light appeared from beside you to which the boy stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you are awake. I apologize for the rude welcome yet again. But you decided to help anyway, not even a second thought about it. Will you help some more?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I suppose it would be a good way to test these new abilities I have.\u201d You agreed with a smile then looked down at him as he did the same. \u201cI will thank you as well. Despite the pain corresponding with the duty, you upheld your end and was more than accommodating. Most would\u2019ve jailed me but you helped me recover. I suppose that was one of many lessons Ms. Isibelle wished me to learn while I was here. Things aren\u2019t always what they appear and there is always someone stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d He answered before heading back through the apparent golden doorway. That would be a glamorous trick to use later but you had more than that to experiment with at the moment. You flew off, now knowing more so how to control it, then started wiping out the Kowloon Children with different ways. The Eye Ignite ability was a little much but useful. But you had to put out many fires that it caused with the collateral explosions so you moved on to hide hand, powering up, and a few other moves that you were testing. In the end you had cleaned out a good majority of the city that was not heavily occupied by otherwise competent forces able to deal with the problem. But you did see the girl you rescued before being cornered by some Kowloon so you landed silently behind her as she backed into yet another alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease just stay away!\u201d she screamed as they stalked her but back up a little when they say you appear behind her. However you had yet to see one of their kind run from you so they attacked to which you used another light attack to take out any in the area, only being about 20 in the broad and energy expensive attack. She could feel you behind her and the light you used didn\u2019t deter her vision. It only made it seem like there was a golden light originating from whomever was behind her. Perhaps it looked more angelic than you intended but you could worry about that later. Either way, she wasn\u2019t harmed in any way by it, sight included. \u201cAm I screwed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope not. That would be really awkward.\u201d You answered to which she spun around to see you, only a foot away. You had put your vampire features away for the moment but the golden light was still radiating a little as it dissipated from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you killed them. Why would you kill your own kind? For me?\u201d She asked, stuttering slightly but as much as she wanted to move away she couldn\u2019t get her muscles to obey the command. You saw this and decided not to push her any further in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but I didn\u2019t do it for you. I also would appreciate you not comparing me with them. They are as different from me as you are, as evidence to you still being alive. They are\u2026 I guess like sentient zombie versions of vampires. As you have witnessed, they don\u2019t really have a code of honor or anything like that. Heck, they even attacked the baby hospital wing. No, I was asked by some of the leaders around here to help and I just so happened to come across you. But really, this is the second time I\u2019ve had to save your hide from a feral Vampire. Ever think about bringing a silver knife or something along?\u201d You notified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll remember that next time. Um\u2026 can I go?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. But so I don\u2019t have to save you, again, take this.\u201d you said and tossed her a silver knife you thought she could handle. \u201cSlice a vampire with that and he\u2019ll think twice about coming around for a second date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thank you. I-I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d She stuttered to which you just nodded and she ran off, grasping the knife. You could feel you were a little late to deal with any of the bigger threats so you went back to work on ridding the Special Zone of all the small pests. It may take all night to find all of them and the sources but you were actually having a little bit of fun at the moment. Plus the thanks you got from those you saved helped a lot.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jiro came to see you as he too knew Ms. Isibelle and had long since apologized for his rudeness. But now you had to leave the realm to which they were not getting any time to meet with you at all. Perhaps that was another lesson or maybe just an unintentional one. But you looked at Mr. Vale anyway to see how much time you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have little time to waste. You friend Eve came calling when you were away and is\u2026 insistent in your return as quickly as possible.\u201d Mr. Vale responded to your silent question. A smirk went across your face at her reaction but you were sure she knew your schedule by this point as she had lived with you prior for a while. But with her \u2018insistence\u2019 in the wind, you didn\u2019t dare keep her waiting. But as she would never harm anyone of consequence to get what she wanted, at least to you, it was slightly entertaining to think of what she could be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Kotaro. I have a life and people that care about me at home. I was only meant to stay here for a limited time. I can\u2019t, in good conscious, keep them waiting,\u201d you replied in a pleasant way so it hit him a little lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill having trouble picturing you, living with a community and family of humans,\u201d Jiro stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell being the only Vampire in my realm helps but there are other people that help bridge the gap a little. Plus, even for a Vampire, my Mom\u2019s cooking tastes amazing,\u201d You returned. Most of them smiled at the last part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis realm wasn\u2019t like the other one you went to. You didn\u2019t have a couple years to get to know them. But you were stoked about getting Ms. Isibelle\u2019s present. You definitely wouldn\u2019t mind practicing your new abilities and if Mr. Vale was here it meant that you learned what you needed or what was intended. So, with a final wave, you and Mr. Vale went back to your home. You were barely through the portal when you were tackled by Kelsey in a fierce hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang, it\u2019s only been a week,\u201d you said as you caught and floated in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you got hurt, we saw. They hurt you really bad and we all were worried,\u201d Kelsey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you see?\u201d You asked then was shown the series and it was paused with you leaving their realm. You should\u2019ve known better but now you knew and calmed the emotional Succubus down. \u201cAs flattered as I am for being the source of all this attention, you should know by now. I can\u2019t die, so you don\u2019t need to worry\u2026 but thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re your family, it\u2019s our job to worry,\u201d Your Mother replied with a more calmed persona than Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Caleb, Eve wants to see you\u2026 really bad.\u201d Isaac blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe does? I suppose it has been a few months. Did she stop by and visit or something?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Kelsey responded. \u201cShe sent us an invite to a place close to your family\u2019s Cabin area. Thankfully she remembered your family\u2019s\u2026 phobia for spiders and cleared the way for us while we were there. But we did meet her Father. You were right, he looks just like her. Anyway, she was rather upset that you weren\u2019t there but remembered about your training with Mr. Vale so She\u2026 insisted that you come to her when you got back. She still has her Queen duties but she wants to see you really bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose I should\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They say that, no matter where you are, you are always within 5 feet of a spider. As many holes as there are in that saying it did stand applicable in this case. You couldn\u2019t get more than a few feet toward your room before a large wolf spider reminded you of Eve\u2019s wish to see you. It wouldn\u2019t be wise to keep her waiting. Knowing her pushy nature, she wouldn\u2019t be limited to sending a whole army to get you. So you easily caught her scent and went to the entrance of a burrow that was almost moving with all the spiders around it. As you stopped in a rare clear spot you waited for one of the larger ones inside to come out and address you. You didn\u2019t want them to get any funny ideas so you had a barrier like the last time around you, one they couldn\u2019t touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you, human?\u201d asked a male voice from a large car sized spider that came out of the hole in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Caleb, I do believe Eve is expecting me. Well at least that is what the spiders near my house and my family said,\u201d you answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may enter. Follow me and don\u2019t stray. A stray human in a burrow of hungry spiders is not something you should test.\u201d The spider instructed to which you bowed an affirmative then followed him. He led through a maze of tunnels, a small army of spiders of all sizes were following and observing you. Eventually you were brought into a larger chamber that looked almost human in its construction. Kind of like a royal ball room from those old movies you saw\u2026 come to think of it, if Eve was the one to design it than that is where she probably got it from. But either way, it was surprisingly empty. Like the room was off limits to the general hoard that had stayed far from the door. The spider that brought you there only lingered for a moment until he too dispersed from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this? A human, in a spider\u2019s burrow? Do you have some kind of death wish?\u201d asked a voice from a passage off to the opposite side as the main entrance you used. In a short time there was a Scorpion the size of a truck entering the room. You weren\u2019t sure but you were fairly certain that spiders and scorpions didn\u2019t see eye to eye, sort of speak. But if this was some kind of leader among his kind than at least they shared the whole Queen Ruler thing. As you weren\u2019t an authority on scorpion bodies you guessed by her voice that she was female. You also silently commended Eve for taking you secrecy seriously. If no one knew than you had at least a little chance of a relatively normal life. But as spiders were forbidden from attacking of even accident biting your family, you guessed this new entry wasn\u2019t under such restrictions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. What is a scorpion doing in a spider hallow? Seems just as ludicrous as a human being here.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough. I am Drade, Queen of the Wisconsin territory of scorpions. Granted our number is comparatively small compared to other territories further south and most of us die out in the winter but we are still here. I am here at the request of the Queen of the Spiders. She has been most hospitable. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d The scorpion Queen answered then threw the ball in your court while advancing and circling you a bit. It was as if she was trying to work on your nerves\u2026 or see if she could make a game out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the one that found her when she was a newborn. My family and I took care of\u2026 the Queen, until her kind became known, as was her position in it. She invited my family here a few weeks ago but I was not available at that time so I was asked to come by when I had the time, and here I am. So I guess we are both waiting on her. Can\u2019t imagine it will be too much longer though. As soon as she catches my scent she is going to\u2026\u201d You replied but was cut off by a very distinctive but louder voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb is here?!\u201d Came the voice from a passage behind the area of the throne spot. Obviously there wasn\u2019t a seat for the throne but it was big enough to hold a very large ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere she is.\u201d You said as you took your eyes off Drade and saw the black flash of scuttling hair and legs come at you. You could see her just fine and noticed she was a little bigger. She was near car size now and as such easily picked you up with her mandibles as she grabbed you and scurried around until she was on her throne again. \u201cWhoa! Missed you to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was so worried that you didn\u2019t like me anymore when you weren\u2019t with your family.\u201d She almost cried out as she squeezed/ hugged your with her mandibles. To be fair it was the only area of her large body that could correctly hug you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly Eve, how could anyone no like you. I was a little lonely and put out with you no longer at the house. But I\u2019m glad you seem to be doing good. I can\u2019t imagine you had an easy time learning all this stuff,\u201d you said in a way that calmed and cheered her up. \u201cBesides, I learned all kinds of cool tricks from my training with Mr. Vale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you\u2019re the best family and friend I have. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if you ever started hating me.\u201d She said, finally letting you down after a few strokes from you amongst her eyes to further sooth her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to show me some of your new tricks later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, I plan on burdening you with my presence for at least a week.\u201d You joked and she was almost shaking happily and gave you a joking push with one of her legs. She knew her hair was soft so you just leaned into it before a clicking sound came from the slightly ignored scorpion in the room. You suppose that it was her way of loudly coughing to make her awkward presence known. \u201cSo she\u2019s an interesting addition to your circle. Didn\u2019t even know there was scorpions in Wisconsin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid she try to hurt you?\u201d Eve asked, instantly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, perhaps she was thinking about it. But then again a lone human walking into a place like this and being presented in front of her, I can\u2019t fault her from having some predatory thoughts, can you?\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose not. But either way, maybe you wouldn\u2019t mind sitting in on our PRIVATE meeting so you can get to know her and maybe make another ally\u2026 or friend. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou have a spot where we can talk\u2026 without all your subjects listening in?\u201d You asked as if you were still deciding. To be fair, your tone was accurate as you weren\u2019t sure if revealing yourself to someone new was a good idea. Even so, it would only take one small spider overhearing your status to let millions perhaps billions of others know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. We had a little trouble fine tuning it but there is a special room that is more than capable and big enough for many of larger size to fit. That room at your house was such a good idea that it was one of the first additions I made to this place.\u201d Eve stated as she addressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, lead the way than.\u201d You agreed, at least to the talking part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. The human is coming with us?\u201d asked Drade, slightly insulted but curious enough to not act on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that later. But we can\u2019t talk about it with so many of my children listening. For such a big guy, he\u2019s pretty shy.\u201d Eve explained but put the word \u2018big\u2019 in there to indicate there was something about you she would like to know. Of course her slight bit of teasing on you ended with a light push with one of her legs before you stoked it and smirked at her still remaining sense of limited humor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. I suppose any that a you allow this close can at least listen in.\u201d Drade accepted to which Even ushered you and Drade down a few tunnels and through a type of barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the traveling you sensed the escalated tension from the scorpion behind you. Her pinchers would snap or one of her many legs would fall on the ground to hard. Very rarely would you hear her stinger scrape on the ceiling as her body subconsciously reacted to your constant presence. You doubted that she ever let a human get that close and walk away. You smelling so much like one at the moment only made the instinct more relevant. Finally you all entered a room that was just a very large open space covered in webs that acted as instillation, from the weather and sound. It also made the room look white, despite the dark grey of the rock that the room was carved out. When the three of you were facing each other, and Eve had quickly made a silk chair for you, it was time for the speaking part of the meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what is this matter you wish to see me about?\u201d asked Drade as she formally addressed Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know from my father that our kinds don\u2019t really get along. Suffice to say it is a great gesture of trust to come here yourself. I would like to make a treaty of sorts. Nothing big, but big enough to allow an understanding between spiders and Scorpions, one that would allow you and your children to both spread out and survive in greater numbers.\u201d Eve answered. You seemed to realize that while humans referred to those they ruled as \u2018subjects, slaves,\u2019 or a bunch of different titles, at least these two referred to them as children. As if to add an additional level of security, familiarity, and loyalty on those they ruled. How they were willing to sacrifice so many for seemingly tedious tasks was still a mystery to you but you at least picked up the vocabulary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA treaty? I suppose this would be an idea you got when living with humans so long.\u201d Drade spat out but continued before it could be combated. \u201cHowever the selling point intrigues me. Why would you give up territory to me? Even if I would uphold the treaty, the ones after me probably wouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that. Which is why I asked you here, for your thoughts and hopefully a solution to this. Caleb being here may help as well.\u201d Eve replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do we have to involve a human?\u201d asked Drade, partially in disgust. She obviously didn\u2019t like humans or like beings too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause he can tell us what things to avoid. It would be pointless to allow your children into houses that my children occupy if they are only going to sting the occupants and cause them to exterminate both sides in retribution. A simple insight into how to go around would not be such a bad thing. While the odd child will act out or die at the hands of a human or against one, it is better than alerting them all about your presence and making an extermination campaign about it.\u201d Eve answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why we have to. Down south we survive just fine with humans knowing about us. What would make up here so different?\u201d Drade asked in argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one your numbers aren\u2019t self-efficient like they are down there. That and people up here aren\u2019t use to dealing with scorpions. Spiders are accepted, not at Eve\u2019s size but they are not hunted for where they MIGHT be like you and your children would be. You don\u2019t necessarily have to act like spiders to, but crawling in a boot up here will never end well.\u201d You responded to which Drade\u2019s temper seemed to flare up as she probably wasn\u2019t welcoming your input, especially in telling her what to do in any fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou talk too soon human! I wasn\u2019t asking you!\u201d She flared at you, her body and tail rising in anger at your intrusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t talk to him that way. He was only trying to help. I would also strongly advise you to not threaten him.\u201d Eve interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that and why do you like this human so much? They kill millions of our children each year.\u201d Drade almost roared, getting angrier by the second. \u201cWhat can be so good about him that you need to protect him so much?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProtect him? I admit his family needs a little bit but he doesn\u2019t. If you want to attack him than\u2026 well just know that I warned you and I am not about to get in his way if he wants to deal with you at the conclusion. I was only being hospitable in telling you not to threaten him. Unlike his human family, he can more than retaliate in a fashion that gets even me to sweat.\u201d Eve answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you do know how to flatter a guy, Eve.\u201d You joked then looked to Drade. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I am liking you suggestion too much. What would I do with an ally like her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb. Please don\u2019t give up on this just yet. I really would like you to be ok with this to. It is the first really big thing I\u2019m doing and I would like you to be a part of it. Can you just hold on for a little bit? Please?\u201d Eve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but you owe me a drink later.\u201d You answered. She almost jumped with joy at the condition. She was obviously looking forward to it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her emotions were obviously going high as her poised striking position was becoming more prevalent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should\u2026\u201d started Eve but you cut her off as you were ready to reveal yourself rather than have her give an excuse. This was Eve\u2019s first big command so you would make her look as impressive as possible. As you had said before, having you as an ally was a good thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Drade. Forgive me but you keep calling me a human. Funny, I\u2019ve never once actually said I was one, nor has Eve.\u201d You stated cryptically with a glare at her. You increased the glare until her form fell back to a more steady position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am taking part in a treaty negotiation. Obviously Eve knows something about me that she would like to involve with the treaty. As a human I would be considerably useless in such a situation. You really think Eve would waste your time in such a serious decision with the opinion of a human that she can see you don\u2019t like very much?\u201d You asked, trying to steer her thoughts in the right direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you put it that way\u2026 I suppose not. I did think it rather strange that you were down here.\u201d Drade agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. She is on good terms with more than a few humans. But until she was sure they were safe around you she wouldn\u2019t endanger them by parading them in front of you.\u201d You added, making sure she was clear that Eve liked humans but also that she was considering Drade\u2019s emotions and preferences in dealing with her. \u201cNo, I am a predator above most. My previous training has revealed that there is always someone better but I am not anywhere near the bottom. More than enough to combat other predators. I allow Eve, as a friend, to share what territory I have claimed. If she were to ask, I would expel your kind from her territory all together. But she wants to make this work so you are under her graces at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough games, what are you?\u201d she asked, not being able to take the unknown any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Vampire.\u201d You revealed to which you could sense her body go ridged. Unlike Eve, she probably knew a lot more about her history or yours\u2026 well your genetic history at least. Even Kelsey and Mrs. Dremer had said that you were highly feared by all for one reason or another. But unlike humans, they knew there was just one of you and that you were VERY dangerous no matter the circumstances. With this new information she took an involuntary step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-prove it.\u201d She stuttered out after shaking and thinking for a little while. You didn\u2019t have any trouble doing so as you powered up to your escalated vampire body. Your red eyes shined while your teeth protruded and did a few other things including removing your scent so she could smell you better. But the severity of the increase made the room creak. When you were sure she understood you dialed it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that was a lot more than before. How much stronger did you get?\u201d asked Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit more. You know that Lady Isibelle put things in each world for me to learn. Only makes sense she makes me ready with each one. But you\u2019re one to talk. You got a lot bigger as well.\u201d You answered and teased back. Unlike humans, saying how BIG she is turned out to be a compliment, one that you had to be careful not to repeat to others in your life. Kelsey was still ripping on you for the time accidentally gave her the same compliment. How were you supposed to know she was going to take it the wrong way? \u201cSo was that enough \u2018proof\u2019 for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-yes.\u201d Drade answered, continuing her stuttering as to the realization of who and what you were. If nothing else her presume life expectancy had either drastically increased or decreased. \u201cI apologize for my words before. I had no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t, that was the point. I don\u2019t go around broadcasting my biggest secret everywhere. Even among the Spiders only Eve knows. If you were able to guess what I was that I would be a really poor Vampire in terms of disguise at least.\u201d You revealed in a way that made her know that you weren\u2019t angry about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d She said as her body cringed back on itself to be more invisible, hoping that your wrath wasn\u2019t warranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, now you made her all scared.\u201d Eve scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that wasn\u2019t my intension.\u201d You replied and looked at the cowering scorpion. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be afraid. There is only one reason I will kill, that is if I see the person ending the life of an innocent. Sure I may be more likely to think you as one of those people for attacking people like my human family or Eve but I am by no means a hot tempered individual. If nothing else, you have gained Eve\u2019s respect and so you have gained a bit of mine as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you waste your time on me? My kind is very small influence in this territory. I couldn\u2019t possibly be worth such a privilege.\u201d Drade asked and stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you heard nothing? Eve seems to like you so I do as well. I really don\u2019t care what you are or how powerful you are. It is WHO you are that interests me. I am a new Vampire still with my very large human family with an adopted succubus and spider family members. I would love to have a scorpion like yourself join the mix, provided that I can trust you. No point just giving you free rain if my little toddler cousins see you or your children and they end up as food. That would make me understandably put off. I wouldn\u2019t mind in the least if you joined our very large and growing family.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like she was thinking about what you said. Emotions were conflicting and  her instincts were also up in the wind with multiple signals. You wondered what path she would take. Sure it would interesting for her to be around. If nothing else you would have a lot of introducing to do. But on the other hand you now had your family on the platter. Knowing your scent she could easily track it back to any of your family. Whatever she did would probably involve you for a bit of your future. You just couldn\u2019t help but hope she would be direct about it so you didn\u2019t have to guess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou both make it sound like I have a choice. While I suppose I do have one, it isn\u2019t much of one. If I don\u2019t agree than you will probably see me as a threat. I don\u2019t want to be on the wrong end of either of you. If I accept however, my children and I will have relative safety in this harsh land. If I go into another Scorpion Queen\u2019s territory I would be killed so I don\u2019t have the option of running. Are you serious about including me into your\u2026 family?\u201d Drade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnder 2 rules. The first is that you don\u2019t harm innocents. While I know that predatory instinct must be upheld, it will not say much about you and your children if I promote you just for you to kill anyone that calls me on that confidence. On the other hand, if a human or spider attacks you than you should have the ability and permission to protect yourself. The second is, NEVER harm my family. I take my family\u2019s protection very seriously. The way it is, my little brother can jump on Eve with no fear of her attacking him or killing him. I also have arachnophobic family that attack her and kill her children more times than I can count. But they never attack back. If I can\u2019t trust you with them, even under accidental circumstances than I can\u2019t allow you near them. If you follow those two rules than I will be more than happy to welcome you into the family.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 I can\u2019t fight back if attacked by your family?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2019s family is really nice,\u201d Eve started in answering the question. \u201cThey are just very loyal and\u2026 well human. He put that rule in there because of accidents. If one of our kids are running across the floor and one of them step on them. Our instinct is to attack the impending attacker, even it was accidental. While we may survive the encounter, they wouldn\u2019t. For that reason, a no tolerance policy is in effect. It also makes us more aware to avoid such instances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. I suppose, after a while, we could have a few of them be friendly to my children as well,\u201d Drade induced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sure there are a few that will welcome you right away.\u201d You started. \u201cNo offense to Eve, but my family isn\u2019t exactly spider people. They like Eve but squash any other they see, regardless. My sister in particular would be happy to have you around or get to know a sentient one of you children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrade seemed to like this and the rest of the day involved making rules and conditions of the treaty. Things that had them working together and things that didn\u2019t. Such as, if someone like Sarah doesn\u2019t want spiders around, then the scorpion can kill any that approach announced. But with them gone, they would have to take over the bug management and be hospitable to any messengers that may come. Drade was not to take offense it some of her children are killed and the spiders would help them during the winter to survive and grow in number. It was a strange alliance but a good one. Drade was really liking it by the time it was all over. On top of that, now both sides would come together when different territories came to take over theirs. A army of spiders were less likely to invade if they had to deal with not only other spiders but also Scorpions as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the 3 of you spent the week together on unimportant things. You told them about your adventures and showed of some new abilities while they revealed what their lives were like. You never would\u2019ve guessed that some of the most dangerous predators in the world would be in your growing family. Now all you had to do was introduce Drade to your family. Well\u2026 no need to rush.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCaleb, so who is this new member you want us to meet?\u201d asked Grandpa Konel. You had gathered, and obviously transported, all the family and people that knew about you up to the property to meet Drade. Papa and your immediate family already knew the base minimum and Eve\u2019s presence was there, along with millions of her children, to make them feel a little safer. Kelsey and Mrs. Dremer was also there, including Doug. All of them had an enormous amount of respect for you but you were still just a teenager, about to start your freshman year in high school. In either case, they needed to meet any nonhuman members that you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrade, please come and introduce yourself,\u201d you requested as you stepped aside, near Eve and the other predators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome thumping could be heard as her footfalls were more pronounced. You had her do this so they could warm up to her rather than worry about suddenly seeing her. She could be almost as quiet as Eve when she wanted to. But little by little, the family witnessed as the very large Scorpion came into the open area they had made among them, like a crescent moon shape so all could see but she could approach and the spiders taking care of defense after that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn honor to meet Caleb\u2019s family. I am Queen Drade of the Wisconsin territory of Scorpions,\u201d She greeted with a version of a bow. They wouldn\u2019t otherwise know what that looked like if they weren\u2019t already used to Eve doing it. They all knew Eve\u2019s new status and knew that such an act wasn\u2019t a little thing in their society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get this straight.\u201d Started Grandpa Konel. \u201cYou want to join this family, as Eve has done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d was her rather blunt answer. You had prepared her for your family and she was ironically nervous. One would think, with a Scorpion the size of a small bus, that the humans around would be the ones nervous. However they were so conditioned to predators that they didn\u2019t even bat an eye at her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, will we be safe with her around?\u201d Asked Papa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know her as well as Eve. But with a deep check into both her mind and being around her for a few weeks, yes. I wouldn\u2019t bring her to you all otherwise. Truthfully, there aren\u2019t many of her kind in Wisconsin, to cold. But she gained Eve\u2019s support before mine and has yet to disappoint. I would warrant the same caution around her children. But she has earned my confidence.\u201d You boldly stated as you stood by her as formally as you could, closer than you would if you were embellishing it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat of your\u2026 children?\u201d Grandma Lon asked. She asked both as concern for them but also the danger they posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have instructed them in the same way Eve has. I also, accept that they may be some lost just like hers are at a very large amount of times. I suppose the good news is with not so many surviving the cold, that there aren\u2019t as many consentient ones that would otherwise act on instinct. Even those are under a no tolerance policy for your family\u2026 our family. If one stings anyone here, it won\u2019t be my children.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that is good enough. At the very least you have Caleb\u2019s confidence, so you will have ours as well.\u201d Grandpa Konel stated to which the tension in the group was reduced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEve!\u201d called a few of the little kids as soon as that was done. Before anyone could stop them, Isaac and a bunch of the younger cousins ran over and started jumping on her. Some might be better at expressing it but all of them missed her, even if they weren\u2019t too keen on her children. You could see Drade looking at them surprised that they could or would just do that. Then it turned to a little bit of guilt at nothing she did but that there must be something that prevented such a reaction to her. She looked to think that maybe she was incapable of such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got an idea.\u201d You said as they all were mingling around. They were a little hesitant to approach Drade and most swarmed the remaining predators. You weren\u2019t going to have them keeping their distance. They all turned silent as some settled on top of Eve. \u201cSince we can\u2019t have a full on Vacation this year, why not just a single hunting match, with a few extra predators on the human side. Drade would be a huge help and you all get to know her. That and Mrs. Dremer hasn\u2019t participated yet, neither has Doug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this \u2018hunting match\u2019?\u201d asked Drade, she was the only one that hadn\u2019t at least heard about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is an event we do when we had our family vacations. Basically, I use all my power to hunt everyone and achieve a goal decided before the match. Only thing I can\u2019t do is kill the people playing. I have to heal any lasting damage at the end, so there isn\u2019t really any danger but an insane amount as well. On their the opposite side, they have to hunt me and prevent the objective from being completed. Since I can\u2019t die, they can do ANYTHING to get me. Chopping my head off, shooting me, biting me, or in your case stinging me. After the match, all hard feelings are left there and we use any left over aggression for next time. Keeps us wanting to do it every time and it trains both sides while putting my abilities on record with family, as I use all of them. The upside for you this time is to bond with them. They will need all the help they can get and in such a situation they can\u2019t afford to be picky. Put it this way. They would rather have you next to them, helping them out, then another human. Each of the predators in our family are vital, and that will include you this time.\u201d You explained as you stroked a leg that was near her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't long before you all were on seperate sides and ready to start. Sure there was a bit of apprehension about Drade, and the her to them, but she was not someone to be ignored in this type of exercise. Mrs. Dremer and her got off right away, as the two that hadn't actually competed before. Eventually they split up into groups and started. Doug, had access and skill with more advanced weapons, so it was fun to say the least to watch them. Even if it was in the middle of the day, you still were determined to make them have a good time, and have Drade be a invaluable part by the end. So it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you!\" Drade said as she stung a tree that you were hiding behind. You narrowly escaped the point of her stinger as it easily snapped the tree in half and occupied the area you were once in. She didn't relent though, she followed through with a few grabs with her pinchers and another jab of her stinger, before you were forced to enter a portal to get away. True, you were out of your element in the middle of the day but you were suprised that she had caught on so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" complimented Sarah. She was going to give her a pat but thought better of it. However she was pretty close so it made the sudden vocal pattern make Drade spin around and check for hostiles. Sarah froze at the sight of her in prime striking position. She was waving her hands in an obvious submissive stance. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for appologies child.\" Drade said, as she dialed back a little and was more receptive. \"I, however, need to do so. It will take some time for me to accept you humans as... ah... family, and not enemies. I didn't mean to scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you didn't.\" Sarah said to which Drade moved in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain,\" she almost demanded. She didn't know if this human was bluffing or serious. How could she not be afraid of her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget, I've lived with a Vampire, a giant spider, and speratic intervals of Succubus. After a few mornings of waking to Eve's fangs being over my head... it kind of spoils any attempt at intimidation or fear from predator positions. I knew you had enough control to stop so I wasn't scared.\" Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you all aren't like normal humans... do in no small part by your brother. Living with Caleb has really changed your life, hasn't it.\" she more stated than asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.\" Sarah answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, most of your family is a little distant. Why are you so close to me? I could accidentally sting you or sheer your body in half you know?\" Drade asked, still a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to tell you the truth... I really don't like spiders. Eve is the only one that I am halfway ok with. Even her I have smacked out of my room on a few occasions. I was... well... I was hoping that...\" Sarah started as the group started moving again. Sarah was getting a little red with blushing as she was attempting to ask for what she wanted. You watched sliently so that you could see Drade's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were hoping that you could keep a few of my children around instead of Eve's?\" Drade asked in return, hoping she was interrpereting your sister correctly. She had a lot to learn about humans that she didn't know yet. Things that she never actually wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Sarah answered bashfully. You never would've guessed it but she was really into Scorpians. You had thought that she would like them better than spiders, but not actually LIKE them in general. The other family members around her seemed equally interested in this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that would be ok. I have a son that is more receptive to this whole thing. Maybe the two of you can learn from each other. He is pretty big though, near 4 feet long, without counting his tail. You think you can handle that?\" Drade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!... I mean I would love that. If you don't mind me asking, without webs, how does your kind catch bugs and stuff like that?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easily... I am sure that Alex will show you. He actually is quite fond of humans. Was always teased by his siblings for it in fact. You two should get along fine.\" Drade answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you decided to get their attention again and started the game in ernest. Eventually they all regrouped and was harder to take down. It must've been Drade's escolated experience in hunting, but she was really good at fending you off. She even scored a hit a few times. But the lack of silver made her easy to get away from. Lastly, she was introduced to your bite, when you caught her. She suprised that you could penetrate her hard outside and equally so that it felt so good. It was safe to say that you all grew closer. By the end of the time, she was giving rides to the kids and letting them use her body as a jungle gym. Later, she thanked you for the whole thing and you responded by welcoming her, officially to the family. A position she took with great pride as she organized with a few, including Doug, of some of them that would want her children around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Get out of the way, freshy.\" Deek commanded as he pushed you aside arrogantly. He was a senior and head of both the Vampire Clan at your school and the popularity scale... which was basically the same thing. It wasn't worth getting in an altercation with him for many reason. One of which was that you kept your secret a secret for a reason. You didn't need it being known that you could SOMEHOW beat the crap out of the 'Vampires' and get away with it. People could be thick but they weren't that dumb. So you played the socially awkward card, which wasn't that hard, as you and Kelsey had already done so during Junior High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you appologized as you moved further out of the way, out of the path he and his bootlicking followers that were taking up the majority of the hallway. Sure they weren't as bad as before, but they still had an extremely high pull in even something as small as high school popularity. That made them THE people to know and hang with in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" Asked Kelsey as you recovered and started walking to your first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old, same old,\" you answered with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much the same here. Boys with too many hormones and no idea how to use them,\" She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that you made the Cheerleading squad?\" you asked almost rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No contest. I'm telling you, it is actually harder to hold back than it is to practice. That and to not knock out Deek's girl, Breeona. That girl is SOOooo full of herself that it makes me want to snap her in half.\" Kelsey vented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She that bad?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it helps that you made them bathe again. Which you get some neck juice from me later for. She just flashes her fake fangs out whenever she can and is pretty much like Carly was on the 6th grade retreat, but with more... body to show,\" She answered and pushed you a little at the 'neck juice' line, as you both went to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I hear you talking about me Bitch?!\" stated a voice before an almost pale white arm came into view and slapped Kelsey so hard she went falling into you to which you held her as she recovered but also to keep her from retaliating on raw predator instinct. By the time the owner of the arm was talking again she had the persona of a scared Freshman that 'didn't understand' and was, more importantly, hurt by the slap. A ruse that was particularly hard for her to play out. You actually had to restrain her wings from coming out with your arm as you held her in your 'protective hug'. \"So your boyfriend is going to fight your fights?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breeona, you're done right?\" You asked. To all but Kelsey it seemed like you were pleeding with her. Only Kelsey knew that you were using your suggestion to control her to your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see you at practice Freshy Boobs,\" Breeona teased then went down the hall with her 'followers'. You used your ability to calm everyone around you so you two could continue walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freshy Boobs?\" You asked after you two were out of earshot of the 'Vampires'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's their way of teasing me about my boobs and being a freshman at the same time.\" She sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. She's just jealous,\" You returned to which she just smiled and leaned into you as you both continued to walk to class. As usual, her forward behavior and her awkward reaction to the possiblility and insinuation of you being romantically involved with her, skipped your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, pretty odd likelihood that we are in EVERY class together. Had anything to do with that?\" she asked, probably already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might've... talked with a few people about... tweeking our scheduals,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad. What about you're home stuff?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Drade's children that Sarah opted for instead of spiders?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm.\" Kelsey confirmed. It had been interesting to say the least with Scorpions showing up in Wisconsin in more numbers than people even thought exsisted in the state. A few had joined in Sarah's room as a secure place to be in the winter. More and more of them were finding how fruitful their new alliance was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they didn't get along with Eve's children at first. But a good yelling from my Mom about a couple hundred dead bugs all around the house straightened them out a good deal.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple hundred? Isn't Drade mad about that?\" Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. She was actually proud of her Children for giving their lives or something like that. Honestly it was a little weird to have that kind of number of dead and to hear both her and Eve just brush it off. Must be a bug thing.\" You answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK EVERYONE.\" said a voice as you both took seats in the back of the room. You liked being able to see all the people in the room, as did Kelsey. It must be a predator thing. The voice that spoke was your first teacher of the day, Mr. Winter, a math Teacher, THE math teacher. Sure there were others, but Mr. Winter was the one that was like your Grandpa. He didn't give a crap who anybody was or anything like that. And if anyone was caught sleeping in his class... they were woken up in a variety of interesting ways that he was more than infamous amongst the students for. \"I know how much you all LOVE math and freedom. So I'm going to give you both in this class. But they go together. If you mess with my math than I mess with your freedom, RIGHT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last word he said he emphasized by slamming a pack of papers on someone's desk with an audible \"SMACK!\" that made his point infinitely more clear... and loud. This was high school. Despite what remained the same, everything was differnet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been bothering you for some time. You had been raised in a Christian home, went to Church, went to a Christian school, had Bible studies, and had what even amounted to you as faith. However, while doing these things you had been lying through your teeth. Most, if not all, relgions painted Vampires as demons and such. At best they were a fictional representation of a society liberalism. Your teachers preached it, despite some of their taste for movies like Blade and a few that you've actually spent some time in. But biggest yet was your loving Pastor preached it. Your father was a part of the Church and as such had you help out with repairs. You, in a sense, was the biggest hypocrytical person in the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family shared your pain at such things but didn't know it like you did. You weren't evil in any sense, but that was what was being taught. Despite their support, your family couldn't really understand your pain. The only one that could was Kelsey. Most traditional stories and tales of the Succubus was that they were actual demonesses. Here for the sole purpose of sucking out souls and damning them to hell after consumption. But if either of your fictional backgrounds were real than niether of you could go to church or touch a Bible for that matter. The secret was bound to come out sooner or later, with you working at the Church so much with your family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little higher...\" Papa said as you lifted a rather large section of the roof for him to repair. It had blown off during a particularly bad wind storm. The roof needed some work anyway so it was convienent timing. So there you flew, on the underside of the cieling while they secured it when the inevitable happened. Papa had locked the doors to the inside so no one could see you. But there was one person who was higher on the latter in the church as far as humans were concerned, the Pastor. \"... good, just hold it a little bit longer while we secure it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" You replied as you liesurely held up the ton or so amount of wieght while just floating there in midair. You had come accustomed to trusting in certain things. Safety in the Church was one of them. Sure you couldn't do things out in the open, but you helped. From someone's sore throat during worship service to cutting the grass. No one but your family knew how much you did. Even they stopped trying to keep track. You were too powerful at this point to be tracked by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" said someone from underneath you. You froze in your relaxation to this. No one was suppose to be in here. You slowly turned your head to see Pastor Bill there, looking at you with astonishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Papa?\" You called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can let go.\" He answered, thinking you were asking if you could do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got a problem Papa.\" You informed to which you sent him a mental image of the Pastor's current look of shock underneath you. The hammering stopped ubruptly. You heard a few instructions to your brothers then came down and around to the sanctuary in which you were floating. You didn't dare move in fear of jogging the Pastor's fight or flight emotion. You could've just knocked him out and explained at your leisure, but you didn't think that wise if you wished this to come out without the demon title. In a few moments Papa came in and locked the door behind him again, so you both had time while your brothers continued on the roof... probably with one of your uncles at this point as supervision if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, can you come down here please?\" Papa asked to which the Pastor snapped out of it as you slow decended until you stood on the platform he usually spoke on, with Papa arriving as well. The church wasn't that big in comparison to others so the space was relatively small but still comfortably sizable for this fragile notion. Pastor Bill had his back against the back wall as far as placement but not literally as Papa and you formed an unintentional triagle with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter? Caleb? What is going on? Where you just...'gulp'... flying?\" Pastor Bill asked in a confused tone and persona. It was a good thing he didn't feel caged at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well technically I was floating.\" you tried to joke, but was shot a look from them both. From the Pastor of further confusion and Papa of instruction. \"Sorry, bad joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pastor, it seams we have something to discuss.\" Papa stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it appears we do. In my office, both of you.\" He almost commanded to which you both complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should I calm him a little?' you asked in Papa's mind to which he just shook his head to which you left it the way it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were all in a sound proof office with the Pastor turning to secure the door as locked before pausing, then turning slowly and taking a good look at you. He then walked to his desk and slowly lowered into the chair but you and Papa continued to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to start with how or what?\" Pastor Bill said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want the long verson or the short verson?\" Papa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me everything.\" Pastor Bill, again, almost commanded. To that effect, Papa recited the entire series of events without leaving out a single detail. To his credit, Pastor Bill was taking it all in without interupting or running of screaming. He was either in denial or extremely understanding. Finally Papa was done and waited for Pastor Bill to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Vapmire?\" he asked you in confirmation to which you nodded, in almost an ashamed feel. \"But not evil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was, could I do this?\" you asked as you picked up the Bible and began reading for a few moments before putting the Bible down and showing him your hands to proof that you suffered no ill effects from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can this be?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pastor Bill please...\" you started but was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!... Just let me think.\" He said, the first bit stung a little but he hadn't lost his kind nature that you knew from years of being around him. If there was one person you admired close to your Father, it was him. \"Why did you not come to me sooner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a hard enough time having our own family accept Caleb for who he is. We weren't sure how people outside our family would react. He is only one person and Miss. Isibelle's work didn't really leave a good taste in people's mouth when it comes to Vampires.\" Papa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you think about this Caleb?\" Pastor Bill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I wanted to tell you. Every time I worked up the courage to do so you seamed to come out with a sermon about something close to demons and such. One of your main socialogical examples are Vampires and how EVIL they are. That... I just wasn't sure if I should burden you with this. I had questions over these few years that I wanted to ask you, but... I was too afraid.\" You admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know you aren't messing with my mind right now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't, I guess. If you don't believe that I am good than no matter what I say it won't matter. I could always show you what it feels like so you know it isn't happening. But then again you would need to trust me on that as well.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you killed?\" he asked rather bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you answered equally as blunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For food?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can watch the series with him in it if that helps. Caleb had to decide when it was ok to kill and not have it be murder.\" Papa defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPastor Bill seemed to be on the edge of your status. Either he would recognize you as good and allow you to remain. Or he would let years of supposed insight guide him to determine you were an evil being to be cast out... of his presence at least. In that case you would have to wipe his memory. You didn't have any intention of killing him or such things. Either way, this would be difficult for both him and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seemed like you were standing on ice at the moment, just waiting for it to stop cracking and fall through to a deep, dark, and lonely depth of no return. You kept a tight control of your powers, as if a single move or unknown effect could cause him to reject you on uncertainty alone. You wanted to trust him. He was one of the men of consequence in your life. But you couldn't bring yourself to change him to be more receptive or even more calm in his decision. You wanted HIM, not an altered version of him. Finally he breathed deep and let it out in a rather large sigh of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you two, and the others that knew, know what an uncomforable position you put me in. Worse than preaching wrong is preaching in situational ignorance. Preaching something false that the Bible doesn't back up with evidence to the contrary right in front of me. I understand why you kept this a secret, but for me to demean you Caleb, right in front of you without knowing, is not easy for me to accept. I feel like I punched you in the gut without knowing I did.\" Pastor Bill started then seemed to give the two of you a chance to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" You said. As a kid, vampire aside, you still had a limited version of situational prudence. You had been taught to appologize at like times. If others were to arrogant to appologize than that was their buisness, but it wouldn't filter in to your mind as well. Even if what you had to appologize for was minimal, it was still worth saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got throw one in there as well Pastor. I know I was just protecting my child. But I should've trusted that you were capable enough to handle this. As big of a secret this is, you should've been told.\" Papa added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I can't imagine I would've reacted as well as you Peter, in your shoes. You've always been one we can look to to be of solid character and example. But you don't have to do it alone. Don't worry either. Other than my wife, your secret is safe with us. I just have to find a way of telling her and keep her from blowing a gasket.\" Pastor Bill said with some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if it's to soon, but I can help with that if you want.\" you suggested subtly was you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" he asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can alter people's minds to an extent. In this case, make her more calm.\" You revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do that to me just now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Papa and I thought that you should be you when you decided. If necessary I would've had to take steps, but they weren't.\" you responded as non-confrontational as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What steps?\" Pastor Bill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a big secret. If it gets out... well it could get really bad. That is why I haven't dispelled the Vampire Clan or the fictional stories. So people can't or won't suspect me for what I am. So if you would've started condemning me as a demon or something like that then I could've erased your memory so you could continue living without doing damage to us, yourself, or others.\" You answered as carefully as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well I guess I shouldn't get upset about things that didn't or won't happen.\" Pastor Bill said then thought for a minute. \"I suppose you have the capablity of doing a lot of good around here... like lifting part of the roof. Is there anyone else I should know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah. But It really isn't our place to tell you. But they don't pose any danger to anyone.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind Pastor, I think I'll step out and get that roof done. You probably have a lot of questions and Caleb knows more about that world than I do.\" Papa more asked than stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be strange as a parent.\" He joked, which was a very good sign of communicational fresh air that got all of you to smile for one reason or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you know. I just do the best I can. Caleb has already made me very proud. I just try to keep up.\" Papa joked back then stepped out the door. Pastor bill was going to lock it again but you thought to indulge a little and lock it from where you were already. He looked in awe as the dead bolt locked on its own, then looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can do a lot of things. Harder to do them in daylight but not that bad.\" You answered kindly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... why can't you tell me about these others?\" Pastor Bill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really isn't my place to do so. I am kind of like a young leader but not really. Apparently they all obey me but I am far to young to rule them, nor has the vampires before me have done such... apparently. I still have a lot to learn. I can't really forsee the consequences for telling you some of the stuff I've learned that, in short, humans shouldn't know. Some of it is rather messy and most is not something I can put into words.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. What can you tell me? About you and other Vampires.\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well on that I can say more. We weren't lying. I am the only one. Miss. Isibelle was the one before me and I literally CAN'T turn anyone else. My powers and limitations are too long to say in a short conversation, or even a long one. Basic stuff though is I can do cool stuff and I don't die from sunlight.\" You tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about... wait a minute. It was you that helped us out when we were a couple hundred short a few months ago wasn't it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was rather persuasive with the Bank about the Church's status. I have my ways of saying a lot but also saying nothing.\" You answered with a little smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else have you been doing around here that I don't know about?\" He asked, more interested than confrontational. In which case, you felt more than eager to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that cold you had last week?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding... you cleared that up?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. Pain in the butt to make it seam natural. I also made it cooler in the summer and comfortable during the winter. Helped a few cases of early cancer, broken bones, and emotions that needed mending. Referbished the pages of the Bibles in the pews, not to mention helping with repairs and magically cutting the grass to name a few.\" You listed off on your fingers in a comical fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you also had something to do with the Vampire Clan's sudden turn away from typical cult status.\" He more stated than asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Showed myself to the leader and told him I was not please. I did have to kill one person in that meeting. Not really something I wanted to do but it was necessary. His mind was... well, if minds had a sewer system, he would be the scum. Anyway, I am an unofficial leader of it. I let them do as they wish but told them I would be 'keeping an eye one them'. Only one person over there knows my face and no one over there knows WHO or WHERE I am.\" You explained, being noticably down about the killing issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is what your father said true? Is feeding actually a good thing?\" He asked. It was obvious that your Q&amp;A session would last a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think about it, it isn't that hard to believe. My... Venom I guess... works to stimulate the body to give everything quicker and easier. Pain tends to make it harder so pleasure is the next up. Faster the blood is pumping, the faster blood flows out. So it does feel good, but that can be very bad. If neither me or the person I am feeding wants me to stop, and we don't, the person obviously would die. So it is basically on me to hold back. As of now, I have yet to drink anyone dry like that. But Miss. Isibelle said it would happen eventually, at least once. Other than that, there is absolutely NO bad side effects to it. Not even a scare or puncture wounds.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how tough are you?\" He wondered. You got the feeling like he was asking if you had a weakness. You already told him, or Papa did when he was explaining things. But you owed it to him to answer his questions, multiple times if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am immortal, I can't die for a very long time. Biggest thing is Silver though. It really is a pain in the butt. It is the only thing that COULD hold me down if caught, even a minimal amount in some rope or something. For that I have to sense it and avoid. Sure I can still do things with silver around, but it is like running with hundred pound wieghts on a normal human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so came your long nigh with the Pastor. He asked you questions well past midnight and into the morning. You indulged him in biting him a little bit, then took him home via teleportation. He agreed to ease off on the demon calling in church for you, as well as understand that there were some secrets you needed to keep. After a demonstration on the Hide hand and flesh stripping, he agreed that there were certain things humans shouldn't know or couldn't deal with like a Vampire could. You hoped that this decision wouldn't bite you in the butt some day. Pastor Bill was fine, as was his wife. Other people in the church thought... not a good idea. </span></div></div>",

Some terrorists took her and some others and are demanding a ransom.\" She responded. Sarah had won a Vacation on one of those phone in 20th caller things. Your parents let her go with some friends, as it was spring break at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they know anything else?\" you asked, suddenly serious in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, you could talk to Doug and maybe your buddy Dracula for more information.\" Papa suggested as he entered the conversation. \"Caleb, please bring her home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. They have to be either the dumbest or truly ignorant terrorists ever to kidnap one of MY family.\" You responded, keeping the conversation short. With a pat from Papa, you teleported off to see Doug first. You used your usual mode of entrance into his office. He knew you were coming and looked to be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, thought you would show up. We must be dealing with the worlds most idiotic terrorists in the world. Even if they don't know why, most criminal organizations know that your family is highly protected,\" Doug greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the situation?\" You asked in a dialated tone that was calculating everything you observed. He flinched at this new behavior. Sure he had seen you hunt and fight before, but never with this amount of concentration. He secretly felt sorry for the people he was about to send you after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The group retreated immediately out of the country, onto a large boat, just out of the United States border. Officially we can't do anything. The whole negotiation thing, or lack there of, with terrorists. Anyway, they have a couple hundred hostages along with your sister. However they seamed to be promoting her on their video messages and ransom requirements. They either know about you, or they think someone as protected as she is would be worth something.\" Doug explained as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a very healthy attitude. How much time do I have?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had 24 hours since they sent their message...\" he said as he looked at his watch to determine the amount of time that had come and gone since that point. \"... which was recieved 5 hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has been decided?\" You asked, obviously referring to the government's plan on getting a few hundred citizens back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The OFFICIAL plan is to wait them out and try to send in seams of seals to secure things. But I don't think you have that kind of time. They were threatening to kill Sarah at the 24 hour mark. Even if they don't I don't think an ordinary seal team would be able to do anything.\" Doug informed, again, as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to knock on the seals, but... I have a strong feeling we aren't just dealing with humans here. Either that or they are so dumb that they would kill Sarah anyway. If they are at all prepared as to kidnap YOUR sister and openly provoke the Vampire Clan, they must have some... nonhuman calling the shots.\" Doug answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. Either way, if I don't do something, she's dead.\" You stated and was about to head off when Dougs hand caught your arm, to which you turned your attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful. Act smart. Assume they are expecting you or you might be the one being hunted.\" He almost pleaded. You nodded. He was a little off at seeing your eyes now glowing, meaning you were letting go your true Vampire power and nature. However he let go and nodded back to you. It was a good feeling to have him both respect you and fear for you. Not that you needed it but it was still nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you fanished and zoomed across the land toward the glyph you had on Sarah. The closer you got the more you could feel around her, like a sensory verson of radar. As you read you annalysed the ship and the situation to determine what was going on. Doug was usually right about things like this. You didn't want to involve the Vampire Clan with this as you didn't want them to have actual proof WHO you were in relation to the family you had requested to put protection globally around. So they were either running with a nonhuman or they were a bunch of dumbasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You arrived in mist form, as you didn't want to alert anyone in any fashion. You were both relieved and surprised to find that there was no freaks or monster like people in control. The large boat was filled with people though. There was about 40 terrorists and a couple hundred hostages. Obviously the Terrorists had guns and had Sarah in a locked cell of sorts... as if she was in a hostile version of a VIP room. Currently they were just getting done roughing her up a bit. You waited until they left the room and was out of audible range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah...\" You called from your mist state inside the room and around her. She was slouched on the chair they had left her in. But she was far from pleasantly content. You could see multiple cuts, bruises, and evidence of rough play. You repeated your call until her eyes started adjusting. You helped her health until she was healed but still didn't show yourself, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb? Is that you?\" She asked as she stood up and looked around then at her newly healed body. She knew it was you, but just needed some support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, they are coming. I will protect you, say what you want but try and find out why the did this. Ask to speak with their leader and I'll follow around you.\" You replied to which she quickly sat back down and smirked at your presence. She knew, with you there, that she would be ok... and the kidnappers wouldn't. With little time to spare, the door slammed open and in came some burly looking men. They wasted little time in grabbing her, and dragging her out of the room in a rough but directed manner. 'looks like they are taking you to their leader anyway' You said to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you just going to let them drag me like this?' she asked back in her mind, knowing you left your link open to speak secretly with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kind of. I need you to talk to their leader, whomever it is. Be as sarcastic as you want. Besides, I am dulling the pain and effects of their handling you. There isn't any pain is there?' you replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I... I suppose not. What do I refer to you as? I can't let these idiots know you are my brother right?' She asked and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just say that you know me as the leader of the Vampire Clan and that you're LIKE family. Might as well throw some threats in there as well. I am currently knocking out each of the Terrorists and placing them in a cell like the one you were just taken from, near the bow of the ship. I am actually making it look like a horror movie. You know how I do that taken in the darkness thing.' you explained. What you referred to was something she, and the rest of the family, had seen you do more than enough times. Simply it looked like you were pulling the person into the shadows of the room. What you were really doing was pulling them into your mist and teleporting them as you pleased and where you pleased. However, unless they were looking straight at it, there was no way to notice it happening to people around them. And to people that didn't know better it was like being in a horror movie. 'By the time you get there I should only have the area around the room you are in and the leader to deal with. So don't worry about anyone else either.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OK'. she thought back then concentrated on what was happening to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before she was shoved into another chair in a room with a desk at the far corner, a rather attractive woman was sitting in the chair. She looked like one of those russian secret service women as she looked over Sarah and dismissed the others from the room. Once the door was closed you took them away as well, before resting solely in the room the three of you were now occupying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... it seams your government nor this 'Vampire Clan' will be paying. That is unfortunate, because is no one pays, you die. You don't have any way to persuade them do you? It is your life after all.\" The woman said as she stood and walked to the other side of her desk so her lane to Sarah's chair was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this? It can't be just for the money.\" Sarah stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" the Woman asked, obviously hiding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you don't seem that stupid. Your men are idiots but you seem to have another reason for doing this.\" Sarah replied, trying to get your answer. Sure, you could just read her mind, but this way was more illuminating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to explain myself to you, Brat...\" she stated then took a step and slapped Sarah across the face. \"You will do what I tell you, move where I say to move, and talk when I say to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She obviously didn't like the whole slapped in the face thing, but was dealing with you for your sake. It also helped that you took away the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. When I am done, I will be able to by many buildings and be as powerful as the vampires.\" She said, strangely enough, with a great deal of pride. You read her mind just to be sure at this point. She was just a stupid woman with an unhealthy drive to gain wealth and power. Unfortunately, she didn't have the smarts to pull it off, as evidence to her kidnapping Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to be honest, that is the most idiotic thing I've heard. You know that the leader of the Vampire Clan is a really awesome and insanely loyal guy right? Odds are he will come here himself and ruin this little party you have going. He isn't the type that can be successfuly bribed or threatened.\" Sarah warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you do know him. That will make this even more interesting. Maybe I should ask for more...\" She said, as if she just realized your connection to Sarah... or at least the part of you knowing her, not so much that you both were siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I think we've both heard enough lady.\" Sarah interupted. The woman wheeled around to probably smack her again, but fell over as you stood behind Sarah, with your 'Vampire Clan Outfit' on. Sarah saw this reaction and turned her head to see you. \"Well it is about time. Seriously, this broad just ruined the entire trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards!!!\" She screamed but none came. You had long rendered them incapable of responding. You moved in front of Sarah so you could more formally be in the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I bet it will be an interesting story to tell for most of them. You may have gotten use to this whole thing, but this will probably be the most they'll ever experience.\" You offered. She seemed to think about it until she jumped at the sound of a few gun shots. You used a simpe hidehand to stop the incoming projectiles without even turning to legitimize the shooting as a threat. For starters, it wasn't, they weren't even silver. Sarah just smirked at this before looking you in the face. Sure it was hidden and pretty intimidating as you looked now, but you were her brother, and not a threat... to her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Does that mean I have to stay here and get back the old fashion way?\" she asked. She registered an incoming sword attack at you both but trusted you would take care of it. You didn't disapoint, as you used one hand to deflect her attack and transfer her safely, unconcious, and unarmed to the same sell the others were in. Again, all of that without registering or turning away from your conversation with Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sarah, but if I took you home right now I would have to clean up for at least a month. Wiping people's memory is a more tedious task that it looks like.\" You informed. Now that you two were alone, you changed out of your Vampire clothes and into your normal ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... thanks for coming Caleb. Even if it is accepted at this point, it was still nice to know that I would be ok, and that you would be here to take care of things.\" Sarah replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. You're my Sister, that's what families do.\" You responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, enough with the emotional brother sister talk. Not really our style anyway. Are you going to need a recharge?\" she asked in a clear question if you wanted to suck some of her blood. She probably wanted you to, but for now it was just a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably shouldn't. You'll need all your strength to figure out how to tell everyone that you were able to release a gas capsle and confine them all.\" You answered and hinted at a prepared cover story for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I better get started.\" She groaned to which you both smiled and you left. Teleporting next to Doug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm going to have to get use to that.\" Doug stated as he flinched at you sudden arrival. You simply smirked and nodded at his comment before he continued. \" I assume this to mean that you took care of it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, left Sarah there as the hero. Turned out they were just stupid, money obssessed theives. Not even propper silver... silverwear to worry about, on my side at least.\" You reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is a relief,\" Doug said with a sigh to which you looked at him quizically. \"I am just glad that there isn't another non-human group out there that is causing trouble for us. We got enough with the Vampire Clan, Spiders, Scorpions, and Succubus. It is nice that this one was just pain, old fashion, stupidity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I guess it is a refreshing pace. Hope it lasts.\" You said with a bow then teleported to your concerned parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, you're back. Is Sarah ok? What happened?\" they asked. At this point you all knew that questions about your physical well being in such a situation was not necessary. So you didn't take offense when they didn't ask how you were doing in the same series of concerned questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine. Got there, no problems, took care of things, painted Sarah as the hero, and got back. No aftermath to worry about... well unless Sarah chooses to oversell her hero angle. Then she might bring home a fan club.\" You reported with a smile. Your Mother just hugged you tightly as Papa smiled and nodded his evergrowing approval. Both felt good, really good, no matter how many times they did it. You suspected they knew it and was part of the reason they still responded so well to everything helpful you did, regardless if they knew it was no challenge for you. \"Although, if you don't lighten up on the death grip, I might turn blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, you are just... wonderful,\" Mom said as she laughed a little then let go. Maybe it was the fact that it was the family you protected this time, the whole 'precious daughter' thing. But the relief, gratitude, and love they usually had to fake was insanely real and amplified this time. It made you feel even more happy and content then usual. It may have been born out of stupidity, but you would have to thank those thieves and kidnappers for this wonderful feeling... eventually.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey man, how's it going?\" Said a kid named Colin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the first few months you had stressed a desire to have some normal friends. Ones that you would've gotten without your new abilities and status. A simpler way of saying it would be, you wanted some human friends. Kelsey didn't really understand, neither did Eve, Drale, or any of the other nonhuman friends you had. You didn't know if it was left over human emotions or an instinctual balancing act. But you couldn't shake it. So you started connecting more at school, like a normal kid would. Of course, Kelsey was at your hip most of the time. She didn't have the same urge but she did like hanging around you, probably more than she should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much, just chilling.\" You answered back as Kelsey intensionally bumped you, \"I mean, I was hagging out with Kelsey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two aren't making out or anything right, cause that is really unfair.\" Said a kid named 'Tou' prounonced like 'Two'. He was... and interesting guy to be around. Unlike the more direct and loud Colin, he was more... 'sly' about it. He could get away with stuff like walking out of any class and entering another. The only reason people needed was saying 'Tou is Tou', then moved on. In fact, Kelsey had you double check to make sure he didn't have a compelling agent. However, he got a kick out of teasing you and Kelsey. She was probably the hottest person they or you would ever meet. So the fact that she always hung around you provided more than adequete ammunition for some teasing. Thankfully, Kelsey had a realtively good sense of humor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like they would tell us.\" Came the last of your new friend group. His name was Dani. He was a little more secluded, like you, which made the two others balance out the group. One thing about this group was the relative moral standing. You all got tired of the whole drug, sex, fight,drama, idiot thing that people were doing. The only drama in the group was the internal secrecy that you and Kelsey had. You wanted them ignorant for a while... and free from suggestion. They were good old fashion friends that you both would have to work to keep, as humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, now I'm telling you.\" Kelsey said as she leaned up and planted a soft peck on your cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... where's mine?\" Tou joked, Colin would've said something, but this time Tou got it out first... and he was closer. Without really thinking about it, Kelsey just turned her head, took a step, and planted a similar kiss on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PDA! PDA!\" Colin yelled obnoxiously to which you all smiled or chuckled at the thought. Most girls Kelsey's age wouldn't give something like that out so casually. If it was, than they were giving it ALL in accordance with high school drama stages or status. But being that she was a Succubus, it didn't even register to her as a sensual act, and the way she did it, it didn't seam like one to your group either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is it cool if I get your help with math?\" Dani asked Colin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, man. I didn't do it yet. Got that English paper to write.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KELSEY.\" they both said at the same time as they glanced over at her. It was either you or her that was asked with help, mostly her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze... that was predictable.\" She sighed with a smirk, as if she was annoyed but obviously wasn't. However, she was already holding out the Homework they needed. She made a small game out of giving it to them until they were able to snatch it. She may not have understood why you needed the human interaction on this level, niether did you for that matter, but she was far from bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Wrestling practice, and cheerleading?\" Tou asked both you and Kelsey as the other two hurried to get their Homework done. In the grand sceme of things, you supposed, that cheating on Homework didn't rank very high on the bad behavior list, especially when pitted against things that the Vampire Clan did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE\" you both said at the same time, looked at each other, then chuckled/giggled. You gave a motion that she coulg go first as you ate some of your lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Seniors and the Vampires pretty much run the show. I just try to not get in the way.\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding? You're way hotter than they are.\" Tou said, but he didn't even try to hide the suggestive meaning behind it. Again, Tou was Tou, and it was fine for him to say. Besides, Kelsey liked the compliment, as evidence to her sudden but not very long blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the point. They don't like that I outclass them. They are the 'big, bad, and hot girls'. Anything that threatens that they crush. So... they put me off to the side. I'm lucky they haven't tossed me out yet.\" Kelsey finished/ answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a bunch of noobs.\" Colin said before Dani brought him back to what they were supposed to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Caleb?\" Tou asked you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it a little bit better. I think it is because I helped out a bunch in Junior High, but I still get a little bit of that to. Mainly the whole Vampire clan thing. Even if I beat them for a wieght class, they push their apparent superiority and whine till Coach 'asks' me to step aside.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's B.S. man.\" Colin said, as he was half listening to the conversation. This time Dani finished. \"What? You're done already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't the one only paying half attention.\" Dani shot back, but more in a competitive teasing way, almost gloating that he was done and Colin still had work to do. \"Dee, Dee, Dee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all laughed as Colin got all comically flustered then raced to get his Homework done before the lunch bell rang again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an interesting day to say the least, but in a irritating way. You had been keeping more than an eye on the Vampire Clan. So you noticed right away when they got flustered that they couldn't contact you. Most of the time you were glad about this. You also had an assortment of Eve and Drade's children keeping even closer tabs on them. From what you and they gathered, Dracula was running things like you had instructed but still expanding. Lately, in this regard, you had let your personal observations go a little laxed. You liked your new life with your human friends, as partially fake as it was. Even Kelsey had to admit it was a refreshing change than her usual predator/monster/freak filled life. That was what annoyed you most about this coming situation. It almost literally ripped you from your relaxing vacation of sorts to deal with something you couldn't care less about at the moment. Currently, you were in Dracula's office with only him and the cameras turned off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry to bother you, Master, but this is a serious situation.\" Dracula started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As is everything with you people. Everything from the executive decisions to the color of the drapes. What bit of emergency was so important that it DEMANDED my attention?\" You asked, in an obviously annoyed tone. You were standing near the observation window as Dracula paced around the room nervously but not so much as to be rude in that regard. Mainly to a stack of papers on his desk with information, than back to a more neutral position, and back again. At this point he was also sweating bullets. Last time he saw you, you did kind of rip a man apart with your mind in front of him with no effort. You couldn't really fault him for being nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We recieved a... challenge I guess you could say. Usually we deal with such things in our own way, but this one was... out of our league. We call ourselves Vampires here, and I for one am grateful you allow such. But rarely do we encounter another species that wishes proof of such claims, a group that isn't human.\" He explained. You almost instantly understood what he was telling you, minus specific details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. You all have been calling yourselves Vampires, and another group of predator class beings have challenged your claim. I did warn you of this did I not?\" You asked, as if to jog his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did, Master, but this isn't just a request of proof.\" He said as he held up the note in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would guess, whomever sent it, is thinking to wipe you all out. That was what I would do.\" You guessed without taking the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" He asked, in a very concerned and confused tone. He seemed afraid you were going to replace him at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If things had progressed like before, and you all proved that it was a mistake to let you go about your buisness, I would've... dealt with you, ALL of you. This group lacks the information from the inside, or wants the influence you have to disappear. Either way, I don't see what concern this is of mine. I warned you that this might happen and it would be up to you to appease or conquer your foes as you see fit. But such battles can always go with you being on the losing side and that part is also your responsibility.\" You both informed and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you will do nothing?\" He asked before he could stop himself. He started to sweat immediately after his outburst as he saw your eyes flash their red glow. To further emphasise his appology, he bowed his head awaiting your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not say that. I asked a question, and I expect an answer. If this is a human problem, I will not interfere beyond my own ends and ammusement. Convince me this is a predator problem, and I MIGHT help you.\" You clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, please read this.\" He said without lifting his head. He only lifted the note to you once again. Even though you were a few feet away you were able to grab it and bring it over to you. As soon as you saw the mark on the waxed seal, you knew this was not a matter of mere human interest. Such a sign could only belong to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked at the letter and saw the indent in the wax, that once sealed it, had a wolf head howling on it. You were far from aware of ALL the predator/monster groups out there. But if there was sapient spiders and Scorpions, then it only made sense that there was some kind of k-9 presence as well. You took physical hold of the letter then opened it to read the note. It was a serious bit of text. It stated, in not so few words, that they would wipe out the 'Vampire Clan' and any the associated with them. However, they also presented another way. If the Vampire Clan would serve them, then they would all be spared. This was the part you latched onto. Sure you cared for human life. But, like you said before, they had dug their own grave, perhaps quite literally. But the thought of those under your authority being ruled by another in spite of you... it was not a welcome feeling. You couldn't really describe it. The closest thing you could think of it was a threat to your predatory territory, but that wasn't entirely accurate either. Any way you wanted to put it, they had your undevided attention now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume there was a person that delivered this piece of trash?\" You asked in a suddenly serious tone that Dracula was both grateful and fearful of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We have him in a luxury suite. It is actually MY room if I want to be completely honest.\" He answered promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me to him, now.\" You ordered. It was a good thing you were already in your Vampire Clan gear, because you weren't in the mindset to change your outfit. You didn't know what this new feeling was, but you both welcomed and shunned it. If you weren't careful, you might do something you regret. Dracula led you straight there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean you are going to help us, Master?\" He asked but you pinned him to the wall for his question... or more how he said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You listen well Dracula. If you are asking if I am going to clean up YOUR mess, then my answer is no. I simply am responding to a threat to me and mine. I am in no mood to entertain your incompetence or human afairs. Afairs that you should've handled by youself. If I were any more angry I would replace you. Good thing for you, I am only annoyed at the moment. Don't push my very limited, remaining, patience.\" You boomed at him then tossed him in the direction he was originally walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master! My appologies Master!\" he said as clearly as he could with a raspy and recovering throat before he hurried to get you to your destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what was wrong with you. Sure he deserved it, but it wasn't like you to just snap like that. You did an internal check to see if you were just tired or hungry... Nope; you had just fed on Kelsey and Sarah before coming, and you had taken a small nap two days ago. So why were you so tense? Just as you made it to a huge oak door, that looked like something Dracula would design, and that had a definite dog smell behind it, you realized what was bothering you. Wither they meant to or not, these... people had threatened all your domain and people you were in contact with. All your family, all your friends, and everything in between, including innocents. As if to intesify your sudden urges, the smell of human blood and death was now flowing into your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I smell human blood, more so than usual?\" You asked, still in a visually poor mood, which your tone reflected easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has, demanded fresh meals every day since he arrived. With respect Master, I don't think I have to tell you what a Werewolf eats... or how they eat.\" Dracula answered then opened the door. He then led you into the room to which even he was disgusted by its state. The furniture was strewn about and little was left of the softer things, like pillows and the bed. There was half eaten corpses of young women and men in heeps around the room, the blood staining what remained of the room that wasn't trashed. The older corpses were beginning to decay and stink. Lastly, you saw the brown werewolf laying leasurely in a broken chaire that faced the door you just entered through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect timing, I was just going to send for another.\" The offending werewolf stated as he continued his reclining position, waiting to be served. His voice was gruff and lacked any polite concern. This... arrogance did not play well with your already foul mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave.\" you said flatly to Dracula, to which he hurried out the still open door then bolted it closed behind him. You adjusted your gaze to the rest of the room before settling in a glare on the werewolf, your eyes were glowing, but it looked like the werewolf couldn't care less. Ignorancy was bliss for him... for the moment at least. You didn't trust yourself to initiate the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to just stand there glaring, or are you going to feed me?\" He asked then seemed to notice your glowing red eyes. \"What's up with your eyes? Went all out on the Vampire thing? Maybe your family would be worth hunting after I am done here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw for you. You started to walk straight at him. But as he made a clawed grab for you, you grabbed him by the neck and threw him into the wall hard enough to make him bounce off it with an audible \"THUD!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...? Do you know what I am?\" He tried boasting and threating at the same time. But you didn't give him a chance to further annoy you. With another series of steps, you landed a fist in his gut, then grabbed him by the nose and thew him over your head and straight into the floor. With that you kicked him across to the opposite side of the room. This idiot was pathetic. You had to hold back to an insane amount or risk killing him. Although you already broke a few bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You threatening me? Little furball.\" You hissed out. He shook his head as he looked up, then tried to attack but ran into your arm in a devistating clothesline of a punch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that this werewolf would require some extra stupidity medication. You didn't mind, as you pummelled him around and into the room. At one point you made him puke up his last bit of undigested food. Unfortunately for him, it had a skull in it. That only infuriated you more. By the time you were done, he was running away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't.\" you said, then grabbed his tail and yanked hard enough to flip him onto his back then you landed on his chest, making him suddenly cough up a decent amount of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offending werewolf had long given up on speaking, after his third broken bone and nose. A majority of his famed teeth were also shattered. He would never be able to rip into a human again. A side effect that you didn't regret in the least. But that reason also stopped him from doing anything but whimper up at the apparent human that stood on his chest. Yes, he was big enough for you to stand on his chest. He was near 20 feet tall, maybe a little shorter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to take me to your leader. If I so much as see you glance at another human or make a move I don't like. I will ensure that the ONLY way you can feed is from a straw and you'll be pooping out in a bag. Understood?\" You asked in a very serious but bluntly suggestive tone. Because of your hood, he couldn't see your face clearly, but then again, he only needed to see those glowing eyes to nod slowly. \"Good, now get moving. We don't stop till I am in front of your leader.\" you informed as you lifted him and threw him through the door, breaking it off its hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracula stood to the side of the door that now held the mangled werewolf as it got up and cringed away from him. He didn't know what he liked about it the most; that such a large beast was acting that way from him, or that he was mangled from your beating. He bowed respectfully as you passed and the werewolf quickly started to lead you. He would be an absolute idiot to distract or bother you at your current mood. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a considerable amount of time to get to your destination. You allowed him to change to human form, if for no other reason than to take a plain rather than walk all the way to Kansas. However, you more than a few times let him know you were still keeping him on a short lease, no pun intended. People looked at you a little wierd but never really knew what it was all about, as such never addressed it. Finally, you both arrived at a large cave of sorts. You could sense the sheer number of dog like things around, including some that confused you. If you weren't so pissed off, you would've been insanely curious about the new scents being observed. Your... guide... had to transform again to enter and that is where you started your entrance, officially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop. What is your buisness here Ralph?\" asked another werewolf, this one was over 10 feet taller than him, at near 30 feet tall... and had a considerable amount of additional muscle. He actually made 'Ralph' seem like a newbord puppy in comparison. However, you were in no mood to entertain any kind of arrogance on their part. To this you hissed/growled a little bit. Being as they had better hearing, they both heard it. Only Ralph shivered at the noise. \"And why are you so injured?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the envoy for the Vampire Clan. He is here to see the council and Royal Family to offically begin negotiations.\" He almost whimpered out. Now that he was surrounded by more powerful beings, he seemed to lose his former confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your sorry state?\" The other werewolf almost growled, obviously not a fan of repeating himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... They...\" He started then felt you squeeze his spinal cord with your mind like you had done a few times during the trip to ensure he knew you were still a hair away from killing him. He stiffened a yelp before continuing. \"I... fell. Got drunk on blood and did something stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbass puppy.\" He scoffed then looked directly at you. \"As for you, human, I hope I am the one to eat you. If I even smell a hint of a threat from you, I'll feed you to the hellhounds and tell them to rip you apart slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't bother doing anything but glare at him. He growled at this but there must've been an order to leave you alone, for now at least. Ralph on the other hand was sweating so much that his fur was damp. He wasn't sure which of you two he was scared of more. As he looked at you, he saw that it would only take a very small touch for you to start on a rampage. For that reason he chose to deliver you to your destination and leave as quickly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go.\" the werewolf guard growled as he stepped aside more for the opening to the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a maze of sorts. Hard to believe, but there was a full scale city in this mountain and cave, but obviously not made for humans. You saw everything from poodles, dressed all fluffy and neat, to what you assumed were Cerberus hounds; three headded, monsterous size of dogs, easily over 60 feet tall. Some of the dogs/wolves, were in the middle of devouring meals, which included one another in rare cases. But there was so many that the rare case was common enough to be observed by you. You even saw large wolf like creature chew up a small werewolf. Either way, at the scent and sight of you, they turned to observe. Some took close swipes at you. If they only knew how short your temper was, then they wouldn't have been teasing liket that. Most followed as you were led to an enormous stone structure and eventually a huge stadium style room, with the stage and immediately surrounding aread made to resemble a royal court of sorts. The crowd following joined the already observing crowd. There must've been hundreds of thousands of Cainine breeds in the room, all making corresponding noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathered in a half circle facing the crowd, was an assortment of impressive looking creatures. At the center was a HUGE black wolf. It must've been a hundred feet tall, nevermind how long and wide. Your deep instincts told you to be careful and didn't even attempt to hide why. He was a Amarok, or in myth, a 'wolf god'. You figured that, like you, his kind's power and status was overplayed. But that didn't deter the warning that your blood and former Vampires were giving you. Next to him was another one, but looked more gentle, if that was possible. This one was female and a head smaller than the one you assumed was the King of this court, making her the queen. Next to them were an assorment of mythical beings of different sizes and types that you were hard pressed to believe exsited. The impressive display were in hot debate about something and the interuption of your arrival was not welcomed with anything less than full snarls from them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who dares command to see our king?\" Asked, what looked like, a 20 foot tall fox with 9 tails near the end of the half circle of established Cainines. He could obviously read minds to know the situation already, as well as your command to Ralph... who suddenly ran off into the crowd, to get away from you and the eye of his leaders. Snarls and growls surround you until a very low and very powerful sounding growl silenced them all. It came from the large Amarok as it gazed down at you. You were in the middle of the half circle at this point as you glared at him directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is none of your concern.\" You responded back in an ominous voice. \"I asked to see the leader, not his lackies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused a round of barks and ferocious snarls. This was again quieted by a louder snarl from both the King and Queen, showing teeth this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd start explaining if I were you, human.\" Said another of what seemed to be a royal council of sorts. This one came from a large werewolf, white and feminine sounding this time. Her voice had more compasion in it. But you, again, were not in the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you still think I am human, than you all are dumber than I thought. It should be obvious at this point. I am not human, and I am not happy. I wear this ridiculous outfit to protect my identity and that of those I associate with. People you all have threatened.\" You said as you held up the letter they had sent to the Vampire Clan, then threw it so it was in between you and the King. \"I care not what you do to this 'Vampire Clan'. I do however do no take threated to me and mine lightly. You have unknowingly threaten and waged war against me. I have come here to allow you to tell it to my face or withdrawl part of your declaration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIP HIM APART!!!\" said the extemely low and powerful voice of the King Amarok. He wasn't even doing more than a whisper and his voice carried that much power. You were right to be weary of it. However, you knew that, if it came down to it, you could more than hold your own against him... and all in the room. You just couldn't affored to let them have any form of advantage, like sneaking up on you or catching you by suprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his command, two dogs around the 40 foot mark leapt from the ends of the stage, along with a mass of other things. You assumed by the black fur, that had actual flames attached to parts of the fur, that they were hellhounds. But threatening you with fire? The only element other than silver that you couldn't control that well was water. So, when they reach striking range, or in their case biting range, you lifted your foot and brought it down. There was an audible \"THUME\" then all was still. Using a combined bit of your power, you caught all of them and easily repelled magic that was coming at you. They were silent for a moment as the once attacking just floated in midair. Then, with a wave of your hand, you sent them back into the stands, crushing any the fell on. The quicker ones got out of the way, but there was still a few that were massively injured from the weight of the bigger breeds falling on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me dead, do it yourself. I will not hold back on the next attempt.\" You said as you released your full Vampire form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing in the room you currently were worried about harming. If there was captured humans, or friends than you would be forced to protect them. One good thing about being surround by ONLY enemies. You didn't have to dodge any innocents and people you cared about. You could just let loose. Perhaps if they made allies you would need to restrict yourself, but for now... they were nothing but white noise to you, as you floated up to eye level with their King. You could feel everything within a few hundred yards of you. Nothing was going to interfere with you or sneak up on you. The effects of you being in an unrestrained vampire form were in full swing. You had yet to use this much power. You had seen the 'Dragon King' do it but had yet to find a time to do so, till now. Everyone in the room were straining and whining with the incredible wieght you were putting on them. Some of the smaller dogs were passed out and drooling. Any more and they could die, and this was just you idle Vampire release. You had yet to exert yourself yet. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Vampire, he's a Vampire!\" came one of the council members, dealing the intense pressure more easily. You could tell though that she was having a rough time with it, as evidence to all her tails lighting up to probably power a spell to protect herself. But you still had your glaring eyes resting solely on the King. He was now on all fours at this latest bit of information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Master Isibelle?\" He asked in a louder voice than he used before, his talking voice probably. The expression on both his and the Queen's face made you pause in your almost bloodlusted mindset. There was a definite aggression but not out of feral behaviour. You sense, loyalty in connection to the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead. She gave me the gift. How do you know her?\" You answered, a little less confrontational than before but still not trusting they were on the good side of knowing Miss. Isibelle. Your instincts were just telling you to still be careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden change in their behaviour was evident. It was as different as light and dark. At hearing your words, they went from snarling and almost feral in their limited movement, to a submissive whine. This change was not one of the things you were especting as far as suprises. By the time you notced your hesitation it was evident to you that their lack of exposing such a weakness was saying something about them. But you still were going to be cautious, and you still were in a more than foul mood. Not more than a few minutes ago, this Amarok had ordered your death. It would be foolish for you lower your guard yet. However, this change did cause you to ease up slightly on your power, but not much. This aura of silence was maintained for a time before the King realized you were still waiting on his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... She raised me.\" He said simply but also with a noticale whine in his tone. The news that she was dead must've been like a punch in the gut for him. You could understand the feeling. You only knew her for a relatively short amount of time and you were still sad with her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I believe you? You threaten the Vampire Clan, me, my family, and directly order my death. You expect me to believe you are loyal to her?\" You ask but also demand and answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Started the Queen. Unlike the male, her voice was almost angelic in compaison. Sure it still had the gruff of a wolf voice but not the insanely deep and power laden voice of the King. Her voice invoked a single emotion set; loving Mother. If you had to guess, it was a true assumption for a good number in the room. Either way, it was not a confrontational voice. It was more... motherly, pure, but still slightly seductive. As if years of experience dealing with the King and her children had shaped her... beautiful voice. \"... let us speak peacefully. We need not be at each other's throats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not the ones that bit first, or tried to. I find no reason to trust you right now.\" you replied, still with the same tone, an ominous, powerful, and angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must know a child of ours. Perhaps a family dog or something? Please...\" She pleaded, obviously tring to like thier behaviour with the loyalty of Duke, your family's dog. Your anger was interupted by the sight of Duke; Loyal, trusting, happy, content, obediant, and loveable. If these were even a fraction of what he is, then you could at least let them speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct. Be careful of tredding on the trust of our Family dog. I trust him with my life, I can at least let your words be heard.\" You warned then brought down your power and body until you were standing where you were before. You still had your fangs and other effects out. But the insane weight of your power was sealed, for the moment. They could recover properly. None dared growl at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyou.\" She finished as she recovered and layed down so that her proper posture would be closer to your level. The others did the same. However, the King was already grief ridden and sprawled out in a laying posture. It took a few minutes to bring his head up to allow things to progress further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW?\" he asked as soon as he was composed enough to do so. His voice was back to its calm state as it still rumbled the floor. However, the volume didn't impede the noticable emotion in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was her time. She chose me of all people, and I accepted.\" You replied simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A.... and you are ok with this 'Vampire Clan'?\" asked the side head of one of the council Cerberus hounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with anything?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why you are here, is it not? We threatened to destroy them because we thought they were dishonoring the Vampire name. It is the reason we sent that document and in turn angered you.\" Said one of the Kitsunes (Fox looking with multiple tails). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you have a point.\" You relented. To this, you scaled back your powers even more, until it was barely noticable. \"To answer your question... yes, I am OK with them. I am not particularly thrilled but Miss. Isibelle put a lot of work into creating the image of what Vampires are. So them spreading that legacy is the one redeming quality and why I've allowed them to remain. Nobody actually believes they are REAL Vampires and have no idea what one actually is capable of. This group ensures that. However, I am not assoctiated with them. If you want to wipe them out, that is your decision and their problem to deal with. A human mistake in dealing with you is not my concern, even one the more or less worships my kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why are you so angry about it?\" asked the other head of the Cerberus hound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't let my identity known for a few reasons. Besides the obvious, I make is so that people never know where or when they will encounter me or those I care about. If you have to worry about harming me or mine, then you shouldn't be doing whatever it  is that you are doing. That was the first thing. You threatened my entire family with being ripped apart. Indirectly or not, it doesn't matter, I take the protection of me and mine VERY seriously. Second reason why I was angry; Miss. Isibelle has me learn things from situations she set up. One of those things was NOT to harm innocents. While predators will inevitably slip up in this, I do not delight when someone threatens innocents. You did this as well.\" You revealed, letting them think on it for a second before continuing. \"To tell you the truth, I have no idea why I got so angry. I have never snapped like that before. If I had to guess, I would say I responded to the threat of pain and death to those I love and are connected to, something instinctual perhaps. I am still new at this. Also, seeing... Ralph was it?... eat so many humans and expect more out of arrogance might have pushed me over the edge a little as well. Espiecially since I used to be human and my family is still human. I could honestly see one of you eat one of my family out of ignorance and be happy about it. Not a very good emotion to add to my already worsening mood at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE DID WHAT?!\" Boomed the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you all don't make it a habbit out of eating humans?\" You asked, trying to figure them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HABBIT? NO, WE EAT MORE THAN OUR FAIR SHARE. BUT WE HARDLY IN THE HABBIT OF HUNTING THEM. MOSTLY, WE ARE DRIVEN TO SERVE MANKIND. TO DEMAND A MEAL OF ONE OUT OR ARROGANCE IS AGAINST ONE OF OUR HIGHEST LAWS.\" The king explained. He was still grief ridden but far from incapable of thinking clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one reason this coucil exists in the first place.\" Said the male Kitsune from earlier. \"We must descide what is acceptable and what is not. The guise of not messing with a pack of wolves, human or not, is out there for good reason. But how and why we attack or hunt is in constant flux. Especially for those of us who crave human flesh, despite our need to serve them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind me saying that your justice system is dizzying.\" You said commically and with the firest grin or smile that you had since this whole thing started. It seamed to put them at ease, that you were at least willing to trust them enough to do so. As they said, they had a drive to serve you and humans. Although, you had a feeling that their loyalty to the Vampire of the age was much stronger, bordering on absolute. Which you make the fact that you didn't trust them a very serious and burdening thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Will you consider trusting us?\" Asked the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. I've voiced my concerns. If I can't trust my youngest family with you, than I can't say yes. I am currently in contact and trust the Wisconsin territory of Spiders and Scorpions. I also know a few Succubus. Each of them has gained my trust. While I don't expect you to change and play nice with my othre allies, I can't trust you if I can't leave you alone.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we suppose to know who you are if you don't reveal yourself? We may be loyal to humans, but we are also high predators. If even a young boy were to get lost in the woods with a pack of nonsapient wolves, nature would do its thing. Those of us that are sapient restrain from taking of innocent life like a boy. You've probably heard of some wolves leading hunters or kids out of the woods. They say it is just 'man's best friend', but we do know what we are doing. The only way to ensure a confusion or mistake is not done is to have your scents known.\" Explained a Kitsune in a very believable and captivating voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you have a point. Your kinds aren't the same as spiders and Scorpions. I don't have to worry about people of consquence finding out. That and my Vampire instincts are telling me you are all good to your word. Dangerous if not allied to you, but trustworthy. It seams Miss. Isibelle did actually love you very much.\" You said, the last part toward the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW CAN YOU KNOW THAT?\" The King asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because not just her power and abilities were passed along but also a genetic knowledge of all the Vampires, including memories, instincts, wisdom, and emotions. It is difficult to put into words or understand, but I can tell she had a great emotional attatchment to you. If she can love you that much, I suppose I can trust you. Even if the other Vampire's instincts are telling me that it is safer to kill you. I think I'll take her word over theirs.\" You answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying... that she lives on through you?\" the Queen asked for the staggering King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a manner of speaking. I can't talk to her and her spirit is gone, but I can access her memories and what made her who she was. In that way, yes, I suppose she does. She also had to inject her own blood into me to make the transformation complete. Her blood in my viens I suppose you could say.\" You answered. You didn't want to give a false impression but it didn't seam to matter to them. They had heard what they needed. You were a little suprised when the King shot forward and put his nose inches from your body, sniffing your scent deeply. Great tuffs of wind went threw the massive nose as he did so. It took him a while but eventually was apparently statisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HER SCENT IS IN YOU. THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.\" He stated then hesitated for a moment. He seemed conflicted on what to do. You didn't really know what he was waiting for or debating internally. You thought about reading his mind, but held off. He then went slightly to the side so one of his eyes could see you. \"I AM SORRY MASTER. NO EXCUSES. I ORDERED YOUR DEATH, AS YOU'VE SAID, YOU BUT NEED TO ASK AND ANYTHING IS YOURS, EVEN MY LIFE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement seamed like a common and agreed statement among the many in attendance. He moved so his deceptively soft fur brushed against you. It was probably the closest he could get to nuzzling you. The sensation wasn't at all bad. Despite being so close to a set of teeth, the smalles one being larger than you, you felt completely safe. You... liked that feeling. You basked in it for a minute before his fur seperated from your touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calling me 'Master' would already give me power over you all. So there is very few things I desire from you. I suppose, protection and friendship for me and mine. I don't need slaves. I'm sure you understand the unappeal of having ONLY slaves and no friends or family. But if I can trust my family will be safe with any of you and that I can confide in you if needed, as a friend, or possibly family, that would be the greatest gift I could recieve.\" You answered, thinking as you spoke. The King backed up into his spot again as if to get in a proper position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all? You are sure you don't want anything else? We are willing to help you conqure the world if you asked. All you want is... Friendship?\" Asked the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that too much?\" you asked, not sure how they ranked the request. You hoped it would be ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much? It was what we wanted. We didn't think it was what you would ask for. We are not like the territorial spiders and other creatures. Sure we have individual packs and territories, but we are one family. The whole world of Cainines will accept this. We already will serve you, whenever you command. Our King and Queen has given you an extra boon to ask of us.\" A white Kitsune that set next to the King informed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want for nothing else.\" You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VERY WELL. NOT THAT IT NEEDS TO BE DECLARED BUT I WILL ANYWAY. YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IS NOT TO BE HARMED, NOT EVEN A SCRATCH. WE WILL OBEY YOU AND YOU ALONE IN ANYTHING YOU COMMAND. WE WILL KEEP YOUR IDENTITY A SECRET AND ALWAYS BE READY IF YOU NEED ANYTHING. YOU ARE FRIEND AND MASTER TO US ALL. LET NO ONE FORGET IT.\" The King commanded then joined the entire population in a single howl, as if solidifying the command to each other. The whole earth seemed to shake as they all did this at once. You could feel magic and might combine into one as they did this then somehow bind them to this decree. When it was done they all seemed exhausted and started panting to the effect. \"YOU NEED NOT CLARIFY WHOM IS YOUR FAMILY. MAGIC AND OUR HONOR HAS BOUND US. WE ARE NOW INCAPABLE OF HARMING YOU AND YOURS. WE COULDN'T EVEN IF WE WANTED TO, WHICH WE DON'T.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good to hear. Wait, did you say every wolf or cainine like creature in the world is now bound to this?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed he did.\" The Queen confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, if it is ok, I would like to stick around for a day? I need to leave after that, but I would like to get to know you, the King and Amarok that Miss. Isisbelle loved so much. I wouldn't mind getting to know about as many of you as I can as well. I know next to nothing about many of the creatures in the room.\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to ask.\" A Cerberus hound said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently not. But, like I said, I don't want slaves. I would like to know if it is ok, not as your master but as a hopefully growing friend.\" You replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE WILL BE HAPPY TO!\" The King answered with a toothy smile. It would be a frightening sight for anyone else. Even some others in the room were nervous around the large jaws new and brief look. But you were excited to learn about them. Dog was truely man's best friend, and now yours as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright Brad, take it easy.\" You said as you walked with, what looked like, a young man to your front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you were in constant contact with your family. They knew he was coming, and they had gathered in the family room downstairs, even Kelsey. Drade and Eve were elsewhere but got the short and ugly version of it. You on the other hand had spent a day and night learning all you could about your new friends and allies. In the end the sent a Kitsune council member with you. Currently you knew two things about the Kitsune, other than the whole multiple tail magic thing. First was he was old, knowledgeable, and wise. Second was that he liked to play tricks. He was wise enough not to take it too far, but there it was. Currently he was in his human form. He got a kick out of you marveling at this. It wasn't even two days ago when you were angry and... well, much more impressive than he is. But his loyalty to you curved his desire to trick you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault that girls find me irresistable.\" He almost bragged. He was very appealing with his silver hair that matched his almost glowing silverish white in his fox like form. His eyes were light ocean blue and very evident, with a miami beach surfer body. If he had attractants, he would probably be the Kitsune equivilant of a succubus, but male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Eat it up furball.\" You sighed as you escorted him into the house then down to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with all the... bugs?\" Brad asked as he both sensed and saw scorpions and spiders in the open, some larger ones even on the table and couches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, we are basically family with the Wisconsin spider queen and deep friends with the Scorpion one. They keep it interesting and relatively bug free. Even keeps flees off of Duke.\" You answered as you gestured to your family dog that was being cleaned by a scorpion and a few spiders. He noticed the both of you and stood immediately. Brad barked and Duked went back to what he was doing. \"Will having him around be a problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Like King said, we are all connected. Sure we have territorial fights and things. But the Royal court and your Family are set above the rest. He will be like... a person attendant I guess. Not a slave but still... I suppose a pet would be a good continual discription.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Papa would be a little put off if we had to get rid of him. He's raised Duke since before I was born.\" You revealed as you got to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is he still alive?\" Brad asked. Golden retrievers usually didn't last 30 human years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I negated his aging, and the ill effects. As long as I'm around to monitor it, he can live indefinitely.\" You said. You heard a gasp at this but just smiled. \"I am guessing we both have suprises to reveal to the other. I haven't even drank your blood yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb!\" came the voice of Kelsey as you opened the door, followed by an instant hug from her. You carried her while you walked so Brad could get into the room, shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you to Kelsey.\" You greeted then put her down so she could observe your new... friend. He was a little quiet do to your last statement but must've figured you'd explain later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good you are back.\" Papa started as he stood to address you two, to which Kelsey went back to the general spot she usually used when sitting in on these family meetings. She was in full Succubus form at the moment. Not that it mattered, no one even gave her a second glance to that part of her anymore. It was actually less normal for her not to do it around the house, like when Colin, Dani, and Tou came over. The 'bugs' had to hide for things like that as well. But they were all smart enough for you to trust with keeping hidden. \"Duke has been acting a little strange. We were hoping you and our new arrival could explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday he just got up and howled like a wolf or something, then he suddenly got very obediant. I mean, I trained him, but he was always a little independant. After his little howl, he did everything we said without hesitation. Even got Luke a soda from the fridge.\" Papa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was awesome.\" Luke reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that bad?\" Brad asked. Some of the females in the room were still oggling him a bit, mainly Kelsey and Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you mind changing? I would kind of like them to get all this figured out without constantly reminding themselves you aren't human. That, and I doubt they've seen a Kitsune before, especially one as powerful as you.\" You requested. He bowed his head as if to say 'of course' then started glowing a bright blue and sliver until it faded and left a large nine tailed fox the size of a large dog in the room. His change didn't get him any less stares, but it did get their mind off hormone related things. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, prefer this actually. However, not a lot of times I can just relax like this. Usually only in council meetings.\" He answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! the big fox can talk!\" Isaac exclaimed with star struck eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox?\" Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't mean anything by it. He is still in that young ignorant face that humans go through.\" You explained. Your family looked at you as if to ask you to explain. \"Oh, most higher ranking Cainines, apparently, don't like to be called anything other than what or who they are. Pride, honor, loyalty, and all that. Calling him a fox is actually a very rude slang, like calling black people the 'N' word.\" you said, sensoring yourself a little but explaining for your new arrival. You had to guess that other humans had probably died for being so rude to him in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll need to work on that then.\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I appreciate it.\" Brad said, with a bow of his head, his tails moving with his moods. You pet him a few times to which he pushed his head into your hand until you started scratching a spot between his ears and behind them as well. \"Oh, that feels good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't like Isaac's nickname but DO like being pet? How does that work?\" Sarah asked. A question than ended his blissful moment in favor of the current situation and conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still part of the Cainine species. Regardless my brain power or breed, I still like a human's attention.\" Brad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that is interesting. But I think we'll have plenty of time to give you attention and you us. How about the Duke issue. Can he think and talk like you?\" Papa asked. Brad could see that Papa did have an emotional attachment to the domesticated dog, like you had told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, most aren't Sapient. It takes Royal blood of one of the council breed types to have an applicable and reasoning mind. The change in your family companion was an ancient ritual of spreading a single command accross all of the Cainine population, binding ALL of us at the same time. This time it was the command that our King gave on behalf of our new Master and his family. No Cainine of any kind, Werewolf, dog, or even hell hound can harm you, not even a scratch, and they must obey our new Master, Caleb.\" Brad answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he only needs to obey Caleb, then why did he obey my orders? I am obviously not Caleb or even human like his blood family is.\" Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't see things that way. Sure we can tell what and who you are by just the scent, but the order was not to harm his family. You may not be blood related, but anyone he thinks of as family is added or subtracted. As for obedience, we wish to please our new Master, and we know that is something he would want. If a command you give goes against one he gives, we would pick his command.\" Brad revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn bro. Spiders, Scorpions, Succubus, now ALL of the dogs? No offense.\" Sarah started, the last part to Brad. \"It is starting to become overkill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. You should see all the types of Cainines there are. I actually met a Armarok, their King and their Queen. You thought Eve and Drade was impressive? You should meet them sometime. Brad is also insane, little bit of a shameless flirt though.\" You aggreed then teased as you tried to lighten up the room a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, if you would Master and Family, do you mind answering a question for me?\" Brad asked to which you nodded as did they. \"You said you would drink my blood. Is that a punishment for something I've done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. It was an example of something you don't know about me. I would never drink from someone innocent or even partially guilty without them being ok with it. Believe it or not, it isn't a bad experience. But don't worry, it took Kelsey about a year for her to let me do it to her.\" You answered, forgetting that you had left that comment out there for his imagination to work. \"Sorry if I worried you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seams like you are right, I have a lot to learn about you, and you about me.\" He replied almost sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Fox?\" asked Isaac. Brad gave you a look and you just shrugged an appology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll understand eventually.\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is it young one?\" Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ride you?\" he asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if that is safe.\" Brad stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" You said as you could see both of them wanted to do it and your other family members were ok with it. \"I trust you. Besides, he isn't going to let this go until he satiates his curiosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, thank you Master.\" Brad replied and thus began your family relationship with the yet another predator group. By this rate, you all were going to need a bigger house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spirit week in high school. It was a time to dress and act 'hyped up' for sports and school spirit. It started out with each grade getting to design a hallway to fit the theme. Next was dressing up. Each day was something different. One day was oldies day, dressing in a previous decade of clothing, like the 50s. Another day was dressing in the school's colors, ironically enough being red, white, and blue. Last day of the week though was dressing up as a mythical character. This day was more or less to attempt a connection with the ever constant Vampire Clan. It was obvious what they would dress up as, but some were pretty good. You even saw a dragon of sorts, made of foam and colored clothes. You and Kelsey cheated a little. Being actual mythical beings, if was easy for you two. You also helped Sarah into a Kitsune outfit. She may have been hiding it well, to her eye, but you all knew she was attracted to Brad. Not suprising, he had 300 years to perfect his look the way he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice contacts.\" Dani stated as he saw you and Kelsey. You had your eyes glowing just enough to get those comments. Your teeth were also out and you were dressed in a movie typical vampire getup... minus the cape at Kelsey's request. Instead you went the armored route. No weapons in school obviously, but still, very intimidating and recognizable as Vampire armor. You even had an old picture of an old history drawing for anyone that inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you are a...?\" You asked, looking sideways at his costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a ghost rider.\" Colin blared out comically. \"The only way he could wear full biker gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Looks good on you.\" Kelsey answered as she flexed her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you, sex godess?\" Tou asked and joked. She blushed at this a little but not so much as to stop her from whacking him playfully for the comment. She had to pick a more conservative style of clothing. Most things her kind wore to flaunt didn't leave a lot for the imagination. She was in a staggard white and black dress that was just barely school appropriate with her wings and tail having straps attached to look like she made them and strapped them on. The straps were designed into the outfit so she didn't look like a tacked together attempt but quite believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am a Succubus.\" She corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, an evil sex godess, much better.\" Colin teased to which she whacked him as well before they all started laughing. Colin hadn't said it in a tone that put an emphasis on the word 'evil'. He more highlighted it as an upper asset to the guess. Besides, that was exactly what the myth said about a Succubus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what are you then?\" She asked comically, looking sideways at his outfit. Tou was obviously a leprican, with the green getup and all that, like he had pulled them from the Lucky Charms guy. Colin on the other hand had green facepaint on and wierdly placed teeth with rugged clothes. \"A strange version of the Hulk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha. No, I'm an Orc, like from the Lord of the Rings.\" He said. He twirled around so you all could see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you totally missed the mark. Maybe you could pass as a troll's foot victim.\" Tou teasingly contimplated, this time it was the group's turn to laugh at him. It wasn't long before you all got to your classes. You recieved a few angry looks from Vampire Clan members but most were interested in Kelsey. She did look like they had said. Being an actual Succubus didn't deter the allure that he look presented, or her ability to keep the outfit on, unlike most of the rest, as their costumes lost some degree of paint or whatever thoughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all staring at me.\" Kelsey noted again, as you both sat through a more roudy study hall than usual. After all, there wasn't any homework on spirit week. So a Study hall this week was kind of underused for its intended purpose. She was doing well with not moving her wings or tail in a life like manner, but she still had almost every guy, teachers included, staring at her at one point or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you expecting? You know how good you look in that form. Even without attractants, you could ensnare every guy in here.\" You answered and complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except you obviously.\" She sighed. She didn't even noticed that she said it till it was out already. She then blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is hardly fair. We're already friends.\" You answered, she sighed in relief as you, once again, missed what she was trying to say, or let slip. She knew you couldn't have kids and would not deter her from falling in love with another person that could help her with her child obligation to her kind. Not that she dredded it. Even at this age her instincts were driving her to that goal. She just knew what you were going threw as far as limited to no children future. Regardless who you fell in love with, or wanted a family with. They would all die before you, even your immediate family. You eventually would be alone, and she didn't want to remind you of that. \"Don't those heels hurt though?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These?\" she asked as you both looked down at her shoes. She was wearing extremely revealing and high heels that maximized sexual appeal and exposure. Oddly enough, they were the most conservative pair of Succubus heels her family owned. But if your family's females complained about slight heels, you had to guess that these were murder in comparison. You nodded to her question as you looked at her expertly balancing on them. \"Not a bit. You forget, my kind are made to be uncomfortably seductive. My body can bend and curve in ways you've never seen. Part of being an versitile 'sex godess'.\" She explained, using Colin and Tou's description yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really liked that didn't you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They may be humans, but you're right. I enjoy their ignorant compliments more than I thought I would. Didn't like being called evil any more than you do, but I know they didn't mean it.\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about dressing up like this in public? I didn't think I'd like it as much as I have so far. But it seems strangely... soothing.\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. Sure we could get them to let us do this and pretty much worship us if we wanted. But being able to relax like this in the open without too much fear, is quite freeing.\" She responded, both of you breathing in the relatively free air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb.\" Someone called to which you both looked at an approaching 'vampire'. You had to admit, you thought it would take them shorter to demand something of you for wearing a vampire getup without being one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you asked in a curious tone, as if you didn't know why he was addressing you. He was a few grades higher than you or Kelsey so you didn't know his name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take them out.\" He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you asked to his very broad command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fake teeth. Take them out, or we'll knock them out.\" He threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on.\" Kelsey whined in a seductive tone that usually got human men to fold to her requests. \"Just for today. We were having so much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess..s... so. Uh...?\" He stumbled as she batted her eyes at him, literally. Especially being she was in full Succubus form, she could effect men's moods with a meer gesture. She wasn't that powerful originally, but she was getting better at it and your family was also becoming more immune to like effects. But these teens... didn't have a chance. The poor kid couldn't get much more out. Especially when she 'innocently' directed his attention to the slight valley of her breasts that her dress left at certain angles. He turned quickly, covered his newly bleeding nose, and scurried off still stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoyed that too.\" You observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault they are all lightweights. Not going to have them ruin our relaxation day.\" She answered back as she leaned into you as if ready to take a nap but really just getting comfortable while you both continued to observe the class and talk about Brad. She had yet to make him even blink twice at her, no matter how much attractant she flooded his way. You had said that he was ovvr 300 hundred years old as a good excuse. But that just made her want it more. If she could ensnare him, even for a second, it would boost her pride as a future first class succubus. As she said it, seducing humans was relatively boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mr. Vale, it it is good to see you.\" You greeted as Sarah brought him down to the family room for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You as well, Master.\" Greeted Mr. Vale then looked around at the faces in the room, his eyes falling on Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" Brad asked, still hadn't met a majority of the people you were in contact with. Most of the time, he was in his Kitsune form, like he was at the present moment. If someone outside the family came over he merely changed the amount of tails so he looked like a large fox pet. In cases of freaks and/or predators he just relaxed. Not many 'freaks' would pick a fight with a nine tailed Kitsune. Besides, he loved getting pet, and Sarah was his main source of attention in that area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Mr. Vale. He was a servant of Miss. Isibelle. She helped construct realms diquised as movies for me to visit to recieve training, Vampire training to be more precise. He brings me to the realm and picks me up afterwards, when I've learned what she intended,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus the word 'Master'.\" Brad induced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean he has to leave now?\" asked Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so Ma'am. This realm will take a considerable amount of time. You do remember what realm we are going to...?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. I am entering the 'Blade' trilogy. How long will I be gone on this end?\" You asked as Papa and Mom entered the room, as well as the rest of you standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will take 3 months. The time in the other realm covers over a decade of time. You will learn and experience much in that time. For that reason, I suggest we leave as soon as possible, to avoid an absence from your education,\" Mr. Vale answered respectfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the whole summer vacation!\" Kelsey exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Vale, how many more realms is Caleb required to go to?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the last required one Ma'am. The rest can be done any time... or multiple times if the Master wished. The last thing I must teach the Master is how to generate the portals to theses worlds. For visiting or future training. Either way, this is the last one that I was ordered to have him experience.\" He answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is good,\" Papa sighed then turned to you. \"Not kicking you out or anything, but you better get this over with,\" He said to you and pulled you in for a hug that your Mother joined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this one is a little more violent, but don't overdo it, ok?\" Mom asked as she gave you a kiss goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best.\" You answered with a smile, flashining your eyes comically that made her laugh a little at the relatively childish behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I go with you Master?\" Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, these tests are for me to do. No point in them if I have someone else doing my training. Just keep my family safe while I'm gone.\" You answered and gave him a pat on the head to which he nuzzled your hand and gave it a final lick as you passed of to Kelsey to which she hugged you, with her wings as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come back soon, got it?\" She asked. She always got emotional when you went away on these things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I can't die remember?\" You asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I'm talking about. This time it will be years. Longer than we've known each other, for you at least,\" she started then seperated and gave you a picture of the family, the whole extended family including Eve and Drade, and her single picture on the back side. \"You could easily lose your mind in there. Just remember who you're coming back to, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on earth could I forget you?\" You both asked and answered. You finished with a hug from your sister and knuckle pounds from both your brothers. Then you turned to the portal Mr. Vale just opened and nodded to him. \"See you all Later...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you and Mr. Vale were off to the Vampire world of the 'Blade' triliogy. It was night time and Mr. Vale only stayed long enough to close the portal on this side. You were in a currently unknown city with no idea how to find people that you wanted to meet. Mainly, Blade...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided that tracking the Vampire hunter would be both inadvisable and pointless on your part. It was far easier to track Vampires. So you put your time into finding the 'Blood Bath' that the first movie started him out in. It took a while and a few dead Vampires to get there but you finally figured out where it was and, thankfully, that Blade hadn't been there yet. So you decided to enter quietly, so not even the popular Deacon Frost could sense you. Then you simply waited, in the corner, at every event. Any that asked you simply... persuaded to turn their attention elsewhere. It wasn't completely bad. Even if they were all arrogant idiots that were little better than ordinary humans, the blood they gave away kept you fed and fully powered. You even helped a few of their human 'guests' get away. But all the relaxation ended when you recognized the human that the Vampire chick would bring in. You sat up as he walked in, knowing that your waiting had finally paid off. Blade would be arriving soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get your hands off me!\" yelled the human that they had brought in as you grabbed him from the floor and forced him down in the corner bench where you usually sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you an idiot?\" You asked as you shoved him back into the corner as he tried to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" He asked back, figuring out he couldn't force his way past you. Some of the other Vampires were speratically glancing your way but your aura kept them from gazing too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think they call this place 'Blood Bath' because they thought it was a cool name? What do you think they do to people in this place? Think about it, a butcher shot with hanging humans and blood everywhere... You really are just going to dance with them until the drain your blood too?\" You asked, using your powers to open his eyes where you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... Damn, I got to get out of here. Please, don't kill me.\" He started begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I saved you so I could kill you. That makes perfect sense.\" You said sarcastically as you grabbed him and led him to a vent in the wall. He started to be less resistant as he figured out you were at least pretending to help him, and that was better than what he was getting before. \"Take this vent. It leads to the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man, I owe you for this big time,\" he said before going in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Just don't follow easy girls into butcher shops again and we'll call it even.\" You said as you pushed him into the vent and sealed it behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time the sprinklers were about to open up with blood. You could smell the blood in the pipes. It was just beginning to drip and the music was beginning to beat to a very familiar beat that you had heard at least a dozen times at this point, in previous events. With the climax starting the Blood started flowing and you siphoned some of it to keep you at max power. But you didn't need to get all messy to do it. You just brought it over to the dry corner you had returned to, to watch the long awaited Blade show. You had picked your spot well. Out of his way and that of the sprinklers, but not out of sight. You leaned against the wall now as you watched them dance and him enter. Soon it all stopped and the fragile silence took over. The calm before the storm, as Blade waided into the see of hostile Vampires. You were glad he was here. They were beginning to digust you enough for you to almost ruin this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on day walker!\" yelled one to end the calm and start the storm. They began panicking and started to either run or fight. You just stood against the wall, only moving when another wall was clear so you could observe them peacefully. You knew how to fight, but this guy... it was just amazing. The movie didn't give him justice. Without your other powers, he would definitely kick your ass. His movements were so fast and precise that you almost lost what he did a few times. He never even got hit by a stay bullet, and they had not been skimpy on the ammo when fighting him. Then he took out his sword and OH!!! the ownage he dealt. But something was different because you saved that human. Instead of the end being with the other human, it ended with a Vampire threatening him with a gun pointed at your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move or I'll put a bullet in his head.\" Said the Chick that originally was going to terrorize the human you let go. You didn't even move as you watched him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need to move till something touched you. However, you did have the body of a freshman in high school. So the little innocent pull was there, not to mention you had your scent more tuned to smell like a human's than their kind of Vampire. Honestly you didn't want to be like them. They had so many weaknesses. A simple snap of the neck would kill them, turning them to ash. Sure silver was still a pain to you, but they're reaction to it was pathetic. So you just stood where you were with your arms crossed, paying the threatening Vampire no mind as you watched his interaction with her. The other Vampire that he set on fire was still screaming and they could both hear police officers starting to enter in response to the massive amounts of gunfire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drinking from kids now?\" Blade said, ripping on her obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Shut the F### up!\" She shot back then went to grab you. You didn't make a move till her hand touched your arm. With deadly speed and precision you whacked her arm away, grabbed the hand with her gun in it. Then you pulled her to the side and let go so the same arm was free to grab and snap her neck, turning her to ash. This caught Blade's attention more than the previous situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Blade, thought you'd never show up.\" You opened before he could say anything. He was going to say something but both of you heard the doors slam open and police rushing in. \"Ask me later, I'll be around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you vanished from his view. You used a teleportation to get out and started to follow the black coated man. He seamed to feel you watching as he looked your direction more than once. But you never let yourself be known, as you knew he still had work to do. However, you weren't going to just lose him now that you finally found him. So you tracked him, keeping your distance till there was a stopping point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stopping point being...</span></div></div>",

Then you were going to try Whistler but that also would've been a bad idea. So you decided to do the polite way and just knock on their front door. Truthfully you didn't know which one they considered the front, but you just used the human sized one with the 'DO NOT ENTER' sign on it. You knew it might take a few knocks so you did so in loud but polite intervels until you got the desired result. You hear a few locks being undone, a gun cocking, then the door opened to the infamous Whistler standing there, his left arm behind the door frame... with a double barrel shotgun in hand. You also chose this entrance because it was bathed in sunlight at the present moment. That took a visible edge off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, what do you want?\" He asked in not so polite of a manner. He obviously didn't care and, in fact, shunned visitors. Understandable, judging by what and who he had inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes. I am Caleb Konel. I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time Mr. Whistler?\" You asked. His serious face began to harden back up at your mention of his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" He asked back. By this time you could sense Blade moving around and observing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I don't want to lie. I would have to it I answered that question out here, where the occasional easedropper could listen in. I mean you no harm. If I know you have a shotgun behind the door. You can kill me if you find me a liability. No one knows I'm here... except you of course.\" You responded nervously. You stood there fidgetting with your fingers as he thought about it. You heard a noise from inside but didn't react to it. Whistler looked inside then back at you. If you had to guess, you would say that it was Blade, telling him to let you in. He obviously remembered you from last night. You surviving in sunlight probably peeked his curiosity. He might've wrote you off as a rouge Vampire kid. Technically you were exactly that, but not his definition of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" He said as he pulled the door open, revealing the leveled shot gun pointed at you. You got in and he sealed the door back up. Then escorted you to sort of seating area but not really. Truthfully it was probably a weapon training area for blade, wide and bare. But then again, it was a pretty big place. You continued till he told you to stop then turned to see him and Blade, with his sword, facing you down. \"Now answer my question butter cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the one from last night that I told you about.\" Blade informed to which Whistler trained his gun more properly on your head. You didn't take offense to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, that was me. I appologize if I tredded where I wasn't suppose to. I was looking for you, Mr. Blade.\" You answered then looked at Whistler. \"As for how I know your name... You are the infamous Whistler. The old man Vampire whooping machine with turbo boosters. I... I'm a little star struck actually to meet you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infamous? Who else knows we are here?\" Whistler asked, worried about their secrecy and safety. Blade seemed to get a kick out of your description of Whistler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no one. I just... uh, I come from a realm where this one is a movie. I was sent here for training. I... that didn't come out right. I didn't mean to imply you aren't real. But in my realm... this one is just a movie. That is how I knew who you were. I just didn't know where to find you at first. I only arrived about a month ago. That club was the first seen in the movie, so I just waited, helping humans they captured when I got the chance.\" You explained rapidly, changing speeds and rythm as they reacted to different parts of your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect us to believe that?\" Blade asked as if playing on a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not without proof.\" You sighed. You looked down for a moment, as if thinking, than looked up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we start with how a kid can slay a Vampire like you did last night.\" Blade proposed, or more commanded. You were glad he picked another question to direct your thoughts. But the answer also was giving you pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way around it I guess... I'm a Vampire as well. Just... a different one. In my realm, I am the only one. I was given the gift less than 5 years ago.\" You answered, this got Whistler to train his tired arms and gun to your head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gift huh. Curse more like it.\" Blade stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not where I come from anyway. It wasn't what you are thinking. I agreed and she... she died to pass it on. She was kind and gentle, didn't even know she was a Vampire till she told me. She didn't drink for 20 years.\" You tried to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can that be true? You think we are would just believe that? Vampires are... not like that.\" Whistler stated, probably the kindest way he could've explained it under his current state of mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about you, Mr. Blade? Aren't you a Vampire to. Sure daywalker aside, you still crave blood right? What about how I came here. It is in the middle of the day and the door I came in was bathed in sunlight. That has to tell you that I am not normal in that regard. What can I do to convince you?\" You asked. Blade seemed taken back by your knowledge of him. They both looked at each other than at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, we did see that. You're a Vampire?\" Whistler asked. You slowly, very slowly, let your eyes turn to glowing red and protruded your fangs then put them away. \"Do you drink blood?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, kind of. I... my type can't turn people, even if I wanted to. I do drink from humans, but only if they are truthfully willing. Most of the time I just drink from animals. No point in killing them, so I usually have to drink from a few.\" You answered, visibly nervous. \"I know you two don't like that kind of thing. But I don't have a choice in the matter. While my type of Vampirism has it perks it also has its downsides. I can't feed off of synthetic blood or any kind of syrum like you do. I need blood that has been in something living. People, animals, even other Vampires.  Obviously dead sources like Vampires taste like crap but it is better than starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume these 'perks' include immunities to sunlight, garlic, and sliver?\" Blade asked, trying to gauge your strengths and weaknesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. Free on the sunlight and garlic, silver is still a pain in the butt though. As for strengths... that is a VERY long list. I would tease you with a few, but I have a feeling it might just earn me a bullet in the head... at least till you can tolerate me around. I came here fully realizing that you wouldn't just let be leave. So I guess I can stay, chained up, if you wish. Until you can determine if I can be trusted or not.\" You offered. You didn't really care if they wanted to do it. If a few weeks of confinement meant that they would trust you for the next few years, than it was a price you'd be willing to pay.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That is quite an offer. I suppose, if you are telling the truth, you are in no hurry,\" Whistler finally said as he lowered his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If a few weeks restrained helps you trust me, than I'll stay chained up till you decide to let me go, no hard feelings,\" you agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get this overwith.\" Blade stated. You didn't know if having you around was making him anxious or if he was just cautious at the moment. He didn't look like he was threatened. Then again, he had more battle experience than you did. He kept his sword arm relaxed but poised to go into action at the slightest wrong move. You could tell that he was actually itching for a good fight. Didn't know if it was instictual or just him and you weren't going to potentially ruin your new relationship by reading his mind. For such a useful ability, you didn't use it much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cross your arms.\" Whistler commanded. He probably was wondering how willing you were to do this for them. You didn't argue and did as he requested. He then started wrapping heavy chains around you. He would finish and hook an end to a metal beam then start on another. By the time he was done, there was perhaps too much chain on you. You had to guess that he stopped trying to get a reaction out of you when it became idiotic to continue with more. \"Do you need to eat... or rather drink while you are all tied up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Though, if you could have a bag of blood ready when you release me it would be appreciated. From the hospital or from an animal, doesn't really matter to me. You can just leave me here or talke to me to see what I can do and my limitations. I won't lie to either of you. But there is one thing.\" You answered then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Blade asked, expecting you to add a condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These chains won't hold me. You have to use silver, even a small amount of it. Silver restricts my power. A collar or hand cuffs is usually enough to hold me. You could also sprinkle silver dust on the chains, depends what you got on hand.\" You revealed. They thought about it then Whistler went to get something and came back with a clamp of sorts. You could feel the silver from where you were. He came over and clamped it on your neck. He was nice enough to make sure it didn't draw any blood but it was far from comfortable. Well, to be fair, silver was always a pain and you suggested it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That enough?\" Whistler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that should do it.\" as you strained a little. The chains rattled with the attempt until you slumped, letting them hold you. The amount of stress you put on them was noted. \"Obviously not the most comfortable position, but it works just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was either really dumb of you or really trusting.\" Whistler said as Blade took his leave. He grabbed a chair by a desk so he could talk and work as he desired. Right now he probably figured that an interogation was in order. You had agreed to it after all. But it was evident that you had lost a certain strength since the silver was administered. So much so, that he looked to believe at least that part of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the idea. I know it may be a pain now, but it is well worth it if you two trust me later. It also helps that you haven't shot me in the head yet.\" You said and joked the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that even work?\" Whistler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Silver would knock me out for a few days, at least until my body pushed the bullet out. A regular bullet though... minor annoyance,\" you answered. It was now evident to you that the clamp wasn't processed that well. Some of the silver was making you a little more lucid than you'd like. \"Ah, this silver is going straight to my head. You could probably ask me anything right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that makes this easier,\" Whistler returned. \"Your family still around? You said you were turned around 5 years ago, that means you still have human family right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, their back home. But not all of them are human. My blood relatives are obviously human but we got some others around the house.\" You said plainly, as if just shooting the wind with Kelsey. It was a good thing you liked him and you didn't have anything to hide in a manner of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Others? You mean more Vampires?\" Whistler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm the only one in my realm. That is why I visit other realms. With no other Vampires to learn from, I have to learn what I can, where I can. Most of the time the Vampires I meet are too week, but they do teach me certain things that I could only learn from another Vampire. That is why I want to be around Blade so much. I figure he is a good guy to learn from, especially compared to those arrogant idiots... like that Deacon Frost guy. What a self rightgeous panzy.\" You answered. Whistler seemed to like what he heard. He wasn't sure if he believed it yet but it was nice to hear, especially if it was true. You could also tell that Blade was listening. You didn't know for how long but he was, for the moment at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if not Vampires, then what lives with you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well Eve is a really big and really poisonous spider. I think she's near a van size at this point. Drade is a Scorpion about that size, maybe a little bigger. Both of those live with their kind though. Kelsey comes over all the time, she's a Succubus. Then there's Brad. He's the new guy. He's a Kitsune. Also know a Amarok that the last Vampire raised, a few Cerberus hound, a few Werewolves, and a bunch of Hell hounds. That last one is a little harder to strike a conversation with though. That and they tend to burn through the couch. Papa doesn't like them in the house.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You old human family is ok with all them?\" Whistler asked, looking like he swallowed a bug at you calm and sudden revelation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right away. Took them a while to accept me. But the rest of them were easier to accept after that. Kelsey is my age, so that helps. The dog ones though I just met. Papa doesn't really like the Hell hounds and the others are usually too big to come around that often. But they all like Brad, the Kitsune that lives at our house,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so began yet another Q&amp;A session. You didn't know how long you would be restrained but it wasn't the worst thing in the world.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Days blurred together as you waited for them. They offered to let you go and just keep an eye on you, but you were instant that they not do so until they trusted you. You even stopped Dr. Jenson from freeing you when she thought you were being held against your will. But with the questions, silver, lack of food/blood, and demonstrations you clonked out after a while. You didn't mind though. Hopefully the next time you woke would be a different story. So you were delighted when you started to wake, hoping for a favorable outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, rise and shine sleepyhead.\" Said an annoying voice, especially since it belonged to someone you really didn't want to suffer through the trouble of meeting. You were free and you came to with a strong hunger for blood but didn't say anything as your sight came back and you looked around. You were on a bed while Dr. Jenson, the woman you knew as Blade's Mother, Deacon Frost, and Quinn. There was also a knocked out human on the bed next to you that you glanced at but then diverted your attention to them. \"Go ahead, drink up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you being one of us? Your lovely friend here was nice enough to fill us in.\" Deacon stated as he refered to Dr, Jenson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you wanted it kept secret. They...\" She started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. They captured you to lure Blade and killed Whistler. I don't blame you.\" You answered then glared at Deacon Frost. \"As for you, I don't feed unless the source is truthfully willing. I chose to be confined to gain Blade's trust and you killed the other person I was trying to impress. Not a very good start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a load of f***ing crap.\" Frost stated. You had forgot how much he seemed to love that word in the movie. You didn't let him finish as you rushed forward and punched him so hard in the gut that he went flying into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll tell you what is crap. I just spent most of my power and time doing something just to have you ruin it. I am tired, hungry, haven't had a pee in a week, and have to listen to your foul language to add to the already building headache.\" You almost hissed out to which Dr. Jenson backed up from your form as you had just pelted the person next to her into the wall. You looked at her with the same expression you did before when they asked you questions. \"You don't need to fear me. I wont harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try to be nice, and this is what I get.\" Frost stated as he got up, holding his gut with his hand. \"Take him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sprung everyone else into action and you moved back so Dr. Jenson would be relatively safe. You knew she'd be ok, relatively speaking. But you were too week to do much, and the last thing you needed was for them to know you were a daywalker too, agian, relatively speaking. So you put up somewhat of a fight and smacked Quinn once pretty good. But you tired quickly and was falling over before they actually hit you. With that advantage on their side and your secrecy they easily knocked you out again. The next time you woke you were in a container with Blade and Dr, Jenson on your way, you assumed, to the blood god thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need serum...\" Blade mumbled as Dr. Jenson explained her not so cure, for him, cure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join the club.\" You mumbled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake?\" Dr. Jenson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\" You answered bluntly. You really didn't have the energy to be polite right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you bust us out of here?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of energy. Need blood for that.\" You revealed. You had told them about how your powers worked. It looked as if she was going to offer her's, but the space you were in stopped and you all were promptly taken to suffer a speach from Frost then split up. You went with Dr. Jenson, but they had to carry you and throw you down there with her. It wasn't long before she came over to you and helped you sit up against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you can take some of my blood and get us all out of here.\" She offered as she put your mouth near her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Blade needs it more. I can make do with your friend over there.\" You stated as her friend she thought dead, the asshole, was walking around. She got up, not believing her eyes as she addressed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curtis?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen? Karen!\" He called as he noticed her over his incoherant rambling then came towards her. She tripped but, because she helped you, didn't fall next to a useful bone club. \"Tell me Karen, did you ever have second thoughts about us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starred up at him from her position with obvious fear until she saw you stumble behind him. You used the last bit of strength to grab him and sink your now protruding fangs into his neck. You held him toward you so she could crawl out from underneath him. He yelled and hit at your head but subsided as both your bite and his blood loss started effecting him. Unlike living things and good things, you didn't have to hold back. So you kept drinking the foul tasting liquid from him into you. Dead blood, especially from someone like him that was actually worse than normal vampires, was horrid tasting. But you couldn't be picky and so you finished and didn't leave a single drop in his veins, him turning to ash at your conclusion. You fell but caught yourself as your body began do process and digest the meal you just got. You panted for a minute from your former exertion then was done with the whole thing, including cleaning the blood off you, to which you looked over at Dr. Jenson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to help kick their asses?\" You asked as you held out a hand to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... are you going to...?\" she asked as she stepped closer. Figuring there was no use running down here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already explained this. I will not drink from an unwilling source... unless they are evil like this guy was. If makes you feel any better, his blood tasted aweful. I hate dead blood, so disgusting. Like eating rotting meat for humans.\" You said, sticking your tongue out to further illustrate your displeasure. You then sniffed the air as you smelled Blade's blood hit the air. \"Come on, the ritual has started. We need to get up there before Blade dies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I'm trusting you on this.\" She said as she took your hand. You didn't waste any time as you teleported to Blade's general area. Sure you didn't tell him that you had placed a glyph on him when he touched you before. But you didn't need to tell them at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that wasn't so bad.\" You stated as she retracted her hand and looked around. She just nodded in agreement to which you pointed your thumb to the thing Blade was in. \"That's where Blade is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twisted your hand to open it with your power. The door flew from the hinges and the straps ripped apart. Blade began to fall and was caught by Dr. Jenson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you two alone for now. I'll just take care of any guards that would interupt.\" You said than walked off. You didn't know what needed to be done but you didn't want to mess with it that much. You took out perimeter guards then watched as the vampires and Frost did his thing. You actually found it amuzing as they were like barking dogs, trying to inimidate each other. So now you waited for Blade to get done with fighting his Mother and drinking from Dr. Jenson.</span></div></div>",

It was some time before Blade leapt from the top and went down to ground level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FROST!\" Blade blared as he landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill him.\" Frost commanded and as they were about to you appeared at his side. He glanced at you but you could tell he wasn't in a particularly welcoming mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get in my way.\" Blade instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I get all the weaklings and you get Frost?\" You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" He answered bluntly then stepped back but was still ready in case one of them decided to attack him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go too far, this wont take long.\" You advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F*** you!\" exclaimed Quinn as he juggled a knife then charged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost forgot that he had Blade's shades on. So you rose your hand and snapped you fingers, making all those in the area, except Frost, turn to ash. The momentum made a sort of ash cyclone and tossed the shades to you, with you caught, very carefully. You looked over to where Blade had just retrieved his sword and got his attention. No words were necessary as you nodded his way then threw him his shades. You almost laughed when you were reminded how he loved his shades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the F*** are you?\" Frost asked as he came into the circle you were in and Blade was walking up as well. You once again was annoyed by his affinity with that word. Really, what was the point in using it every other word. For a Vampire who's been alive a considerably long time, you'd think his vocabulary would be more... diverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... Complicated.\" You teased then lept up to the wall in which you sat on a broken part to watch them. Blade seemed to get the memo that you were keeping your word and wouldn't help him, not that he needed or wanted it at this point. This was the Vampire that was too big a part of his misery to let someone else have the satisfaction. That and there was the whole Vampire, predator, territorial, revenge thing to take into account. Either way, they both started their sword fight. A few times one of them would look up at you, seeing if you were still there. Sometimes you waved comically at them. But finally it was coming to an end with 'EDTA'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some Motherf***er is always tryin to ice skate up hill.\" Blade said as he threw up his last dart and kicked it so it shot right into Frost's head. Why Frost didn't use his new speed to dodge was beyond your understanding. But either way, in no time you all were topside and you in particular was enjoying the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, what will you do.\" Dr. Jenson asked after asking Blade about the cure and agreeing to make a better serum for him. They both didn't even touch the whole trusting you thing. But you didn't need an appology. You were just happy that they trusted you now, which is what you originally were hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll hang with Blade, if you don't mind?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still want to?\" Blade asked, which might've be what little guilt he had to show, or general curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I am here to learn from Vampires. If it's all the same to you, I would prefer to learn from you rather than somone like Frost. Do you think you can handle having me around? I do have to drink actual blood you know. Granted it doesn't have to come from humans but it can, at times.\" You responded and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out. Meanwhile, I got a feelin' that you could help take out more suckheads than I could by myself.\" He answered to which you all looked at the sunrise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I don't mean to be selfish, but can you... you know?\" Dr. Jenson asked you as she pointed to her neck. Sure she had a cure, but it would be easier if you just healed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You answered as you touched her with your finger. She gasped as you retracted the virus and wounds instantly healed. Even her scars were gone from her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime.\" You answered back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Nice.\" Blade Complimented as you sliced another vampire up the middle with a blood sword or yours. He had loosened up a little ever since you two were hunting together, although the only thing both of you hunted like that were Vampires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave you strict rules to follow, since his serum didn't work on you. You showed him that your feeding COULD be harmless. But he insisted that you not feed on humans unless an emergency came. You didn't mind. He let you have human blood from hospitals and blood vats that they kept in some of the Vampire hideouts you all went to. He knew you could kill all the Vampires in the area with minimal effort, but he was teaching you more things so he had you run like him. Although you could never pull off his look. So you used your Vampire Clan outfit, although now it sported silver stakes and a gun. You had grown conditioned to having silver around. Sure it restricted you, but it wasn't an instant take down like before. Kind of like working out your muscles, except it was a weakness tolerance instead. Either way, it also kept your power within slightly trackable perameters. But you two got even closer when you were able to help find Whistler. It had been hard to say the least, even for you. You weren't use to tracking other Vampires but you learned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only thing you learned. Since you were moving from place to place so much. You had a working knowledge of a few languages. Not enough to hold a believable conversation, but enough to listen in on one. The biggest one you learned was, what your genetic knowledge said, the traditional Vampire Language. Since the others knew, it was easier to pick up than most. Blade also helped you with driving, instinct, and a wide style of matial arts. He referred to it as 'kick butt' style of martial arts, since it spanned from multiple sources for one goal, killing vampires. A bit later you two found Scud. They thought they were so clever in getting him into your group. Blade easily figured it out, even without your help. He did have you read his mind, just to be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy.\" You commented as you both started moving again. He merely smirked as he knew most things were for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then put that thing away.\" He advised to which you let the blood go back into your body. As you both chased the Vampires there were a few doors that you promptly backhanded off their hinges, not even missing a stride. At times Blade would tell you to hold off so he could have some fun. At other times he instructed you so you could improve in different areas. Eventually you both were on the street with the two on bikes. He took out one with an insane jump and you grabbed the other you were both looking for with a clothesline, making his still moving bike crash into the wall. You desposited him on the ground and waited for Blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to talk to him or for me to read his mind?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time to have him jack us off in the wrong direction. Get it out of him.\" Blade almost commanded, and you couldn't blame him. You two were really close to finding Whistler. So you entered his mind not to gently as you searched for where he was. It was buried especially well but you were able to rip it out of him with minimal difficulty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done,\" you noted then took your foot off his chest that you had been holding down with previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can decide what to do with him. You still need to eat right?\" Blade offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but do I really have to have this for my meal? I told you how disgusting Vampire blood is right? Granted some is better than others and definitely better than completely dead blood but still, I prefer animal blood over this crap.\" You asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we won't have time to go hunting later. So you better take it where you can get it,\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" You groaned as you grabbed the Vampire on the ground and ripped off his helmet. You shook in preperation, like holding your nose when eating something undesirable, then dug into the neck of him before he could stop you. You drank him dry and let the ashes fall, wiping away the access blood from your face. \"... YUCK!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" He grunted to which you both went to his car and you directed him toward the place. You didn't need the Vampire like the movie did. You just kicked down the door and so began you and Blade's cleansing of the place. There was only a few of them, so it didn't take more than a few minutes. The real shock came when you both stood in front of Whistler. \"Old man, what have they done to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, what you're thinking will work,\" you revealed to which he looked up from his position holding the freed Whistler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you wouldn't read my mind,\" Blade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't. This is just the start of the second movie in the series. I know it is a little anticlimactic to tell you before you do the whole memory brooding thing but whatever. Let's just get him back and treated before something changes.\" You answered him. He nodded and picked him up. Blade insisted on carrying him. He wouldn't admit it, but you could see that he thought of Whistler like a father. You didn't mess with that, or wouldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting him in the trunk was a little degrading in your opinion, but the rising sun was more than enough reason to do so. Especially given what his current state was. It was a long quiet trip home. It usually was, but this time it seamed like the end of a journey. It was a whole 2 years that you both had been looking and fighting for this moment and you both just needed time to come to grips with that, Blade more than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the dark knight and the demon returns.\" Scud said as his weird form of greeting. At first you didn't really like the nickname. But since it was Vampires that was saying it and it brought out fear to them when they spoke about you by that name, you let it go. Besides, Scud knew better than to call you that seriously to your face. \"You found him... and you didn't kill him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just open the doors,\" You said as you helped Blade get him out of the car. Blade was now the tired one, so you carried him in while Blade got the cure ready. You sat him in the special cell you all had at the place you went to. It was made to hold Vampires and the blinds could be opend to let sunlight in at that expense. Scud was sent from the room when he said a few off color comments about him. \"I'll leave you alone with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay,\" Blade said as you went for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer, but this is your thing. I may like him and deeply respect him, but I'm not the person he's been holding on to see. I can wait,\" you said back then left before he could argue. It had took a while for Blade to fully trust you. He knew as well as you did, that bringing Whistler around wouldn't be any easier, probably harder in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, sorry about the crack about the old man,\" Scud appologized as you shut the door enough to give Blade some privacy. He knew that Whistler would come back because of your revelation into future events, so he stayed with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the one you need to appologize to. You did cross a line you know?\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, still, sorry man.\" He finished to which you nodded. \"Hey, can you... you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you answered. You walked over to Blades car, lifted it up, and put it on a rack for Sud to work on. He always marveled when you did stuff like that and this time was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that never gets old.\" He complimented to which you just smirked and patted him on the shoulder, then went off to take a rest... which meant for you a long session of sitting on the roof, watching the sun rise or fall. There was just something soothing about doing that to take the edge off a night hunt, for you at least.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't mind that you weren't at the top of Whistler's to do list. He and Blade had a lot of catching up to do. It also gave Blade a chance to talk to him about you. You could use the extra help in that regard. So after you watched the sun rise you came inside and observed from a dark corner of the cieling. It was slightly comical to see Scud interact with Whistler. Old badass VS. New know it all. But just when it started to get good the alarms started going off. Now that you thought about it, they were right on schedual. It was good to see that you being there wasn't changing that much. Then you saw them drop down and something hit you that you didn't think you'd feel, not yet at least. When the Vampire got the gun away from Whistler, as soon as he pointed it his way you became territorial again. You forgot that they weren't there to harm anyone, yet. You just didn't want Whistler to die. So, in a flash, you appeared by them and and punched the gun and the Vampire hard enough that the gun shattered and he went flying into the space Blade was now occupying. The other one tried to attack you with her swords but you caught her arms and threw her over by her partner, away from the two humans in the room. Your haze went away at this and you came more back to yourself, then looked to a sprawled out Whistler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help sir?\" you asked as you held out a hand for him to grab. He hesitated, which felt strangely bad for someone you hardly knew, then grabbed it and pulled himself to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blade said you were still around.\" He said as he got another gun from the wrack and pointed it over that way. This time they were already fighting with Blade, so he couldn't shoot them. You were glad for that, so you didn't have to enter his mind as someone that kept him from shooting at a Vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. He's been helping me learn quite a bit. We... had some relative fun while hunting to find you,\" you said back. \"I told you he'd kick your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" Scud said back to you. Whistler got that you were talking about and Scud's little... misunderstanding, then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to help him?\" Whistler asked as you all got to a better position to watch the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Blade, he likes his exercise. He's be pissed for a week if I did that,\" you answered to which Whistler silently agreed with a shrug. \"Besides, they are not here to kill us. Looks like Blade knows that, as he seems to be having fun with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know why they are here?\" Whistler asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because it is part of the second movie,' you spoke to his mind to which he braced for and was about to ask something but  you spoke first... in a manner of speaking. 'I haven't told Scud about the movie thing or most of my abilities. I wouldn't invade your mind any further than to talk to you... without them listening in.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind, it doesn't matter,\" Whistler said after nodding to you that he understood. Luckily Scud was too intent on watching the fight that he missed the whole silent exchange. Eventually the fight was over and you all were coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you?\" Blade almost teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just chatting with Mr. Whistler. Didn't want to spoil your fun.\" You answered to which he just smirked then you turned to the other two, looking them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop with the 'Mr.' talk. It makes me feel old.\" Whistler asked to which you bowed an affirmative to his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blade, and the Demon...\" started Nyssa, one of the assassins/messengers. \"... you two have been our worst enemy. Now there is something worse on the streets, something worse then the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, the reapers?\" You asked rhetorically. You didn't have your gear on at the moment, so they were seeing you as the kid you were for the first time. Obviously it wasn't top on the list to have you talking to them like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" Asad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know many things, like why you are here and what your end goal is. But, for the moment, you are telling the truth... other than the worse than me part. But I am not about to explain that one to you. That would just be stupid.\" You answered back, using the first bit to tie their tongues to any more questions. Nyssa might've been ignorant, but Asad wasn't. Blade reluctantly agreed to go then the four in your new and expanding group gathered to prepare. Blade was gearing up but, with you there, left out the explosives. No need to blow himself up if you could do the same amount of damage without him being blown to millions of pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we trust them?\" Scud asked. You marveled at his acting. If you didn't already know about him, he would have you completely fooled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now. Right now they need us. But later... we better keep our heads on straight.\" You answered, more to Blade and Whistler than to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to go if they do anything stupid?\" Blade asked, knowing more about your abilities than anyone in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fueled up and ready to go. One thought and they'll be ash before they can blink.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\" Whistler asked, which you nodded an answer. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telekenisis.\" You answered simply, moving your gun from the table to your hand effortlessly, then putting it in its holster. \"You'd be suprised of how fast you can kill a Vampire if all you have to do is think, 'pop their head off'. Saves on ammunition too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it would.\" Whistler commented as he got himself ready. It would be an interesting day, or night as it were. You liked that Whistler wasn't really star struck by every move you made, like Scud was. Eventually you all sat in the chopper and was drawn to the conversation that Nyssa and Scud were having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Scud asked Nyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of Blade, the Demon, and the boogyman. Frankly, I'm disappointed.\" She answered as she looked over at you then out of the chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Scud asked, as if to ask her to explain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all agreed to come so easily.\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that B? She's disappointed.\" Scud asked as Blade smirked at it. \"Come on Big D, show her. Come on, pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled then looked out the window so she could see your eyes glow. Then a bright flash erupted outside the chopper that looked like a mini nuke went off. 'You got to love the eye ignite ability', you thought to yourself. Then you ended the attack before it cause any more alarms to go off, in the chopper or in the city below. Her eyes were glued to the rapidly disappearing fireball, then moved to you as she tried to remain in a calm posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still disappointed?\" Scud asked to which she looked away and gave a small smirk of her own, as if her effort and imagination was proven right. It was a wierd thing for you. You'd expect to see a little fear or concern for people she was taking you to meet. But this new behavior made you curious. Curious enough to take an interest in her from now on. You knew her emotions were saved for Blade, and his for her's, but she was intriguing to say the least.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a relatively short helecopter ride you found youself walking into their headquarters, or what you thought was their headquarters. Their leader was here, so you assumed that it was so, or at least a residence of sorts. Either way, you weren't suprised or disappointed as you saw the system they had up close. Sure you had watched the series, but actually being there gave you a new sense of what it was like. You actually got some ideas for the vampire clan back home. But you kept that train of thought hidden. For now you all reached a very large and thick door. Even you would have a hard time breeching it, not that hard of a time, but more than enough to register as high grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The true power of the vampire nation rests here.\" Nyssa said as the door accepted their given invitation and access, allowing your group into the inner part of this seemingly gigantic place. They led you all to a room where you saw the old relic of a Vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blade, this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos.\" Asad introduced. You didn't really know why he discluded you, but you understood why he didn't with the other two. They were human and as such lower then they were, in their minds. So you still being in your 14 year old self probably warranted some lack of recognition. You didn't mind, for the moment. As for the Overlord, he was strong, not very nimble but you could feel his pressence. Wither it was a glimer of what he used to be in his prime or just his age was unclear to you. But you could tell that he was very old, very knowledgeable, and more powerful than any other in the room, minus Blade and you ofcourse. But he was definitely weakening, perhaps from age, or unuse, hard to say for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father...\" Nyssa started but was shushed by him raising his hand/finger. You latched onto this. She was HIS daughter. Great, royalty. You had almost forgotten that part. Truethfully, you didn't sense the connection. She looked nothing like him. For starters, she wasn't blue. But remembering the movie, you knew it was true. He spoke some of the ancient vampire language before addressing the room more initmately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been said; Take pride in your enemy and share in his successes. In this way, we thank you.\" The Overlord stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanking me, for what?\" He asked as another person came into the room. You could tell he was a human by his scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking care of Deacon Frost, you did us a favor,\" the man said as he moved forward to shake Blade's hand. \"Karel Kounen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're human.\" Blade stated in a way he wished for him to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needed to his mark to figure that out?\" You teased, which caused both of them to look over at you. \"Sorry, backing off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly...\" Kounen started as he took back his hand and addressed Blade again. \"I'm a lawyer, Europian Health Consortian.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little bit they explained the situation, to which you remained silent. Not a lot of people in the room were to into taking the advise or speach of a relatively pint sized vampire like you. Those that did, were too on edge to want to hear it. So you just leaned up against a wall as they spoke, for a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight...\"  Blade started in a more confused and pride baised disbelief. \"You want me to hunt them, for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they are done with us, who do you think they'll turn on next?... Your precious humans. Not one of them will be left.\" The Overlord stated almost sarcastically. Sure, he can make jokes, but you can't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" For the last 2 years we've have trained a small tactical team called the Blood Pack. We want you to lead them,\" Nyssa revieled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 years???\" Asked Blade as he caught on that the training start was longer than the Reaper's assumed existance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been training them, to hunt you... and the Demon.\" She answered, looking at you as you observed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think about all this?\" Blade asked, finally bringing you into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am... curious to say the least. I knew they would be training to fight you. But I didn't know they would be working on me as well. If they can't even handle this minor annoyance, then I am curious as to see how they would train others to face us, a greater threat. Easy to see why they asked though. If both sides die, or mostley die, all the better for them. They get two enemies weaking at the same time. But... it should be some fun,\" you answered, bouncing around the different points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you are more deadly than this reaper threat?\" The Overlord almost boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I already know a decent amount about them. I saw one on the street when you flew us here. Ugly little things and a pain in the ass, but handlable. No sense trying to convince you of this. My guess, you don't have much use for a young and pint sized Vampire like myself.\" You answered calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" The Overlord stated then left, agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are they really that easy?' Blade thought to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For me, yes, for you... not so much. They are immune to silver and garlic. They are more like vampire versions of a zombie than anything else. Even slicing them in half won't work all the way.' You thought back to him. He knew better than to react to your inside information in front of everyone. He just nodded for you to follow them as they left. They probably wanted to get you and Blade out of their midst as quickly as possible. The 4 of you laughed at this.</span></div></div>",

Blade went to go rest before meeting the Blood pack, he also needed to take his serum. You on the other hand needed blood and thought it best to keep fully charged when surrounded by enemies like you would be for the next little bit. Blade agreed, but forbid you from drinking human blood. So, you had to make do with animal blood... way better than undead or vampire blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Whistler as he came into the room as you finished drinking from a large dog and a tiger that got loose from the local zoo. You had compelled them to come to you and to leave safely. You would probably need them to return in the near future, so you kept their minds obediant to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just got done with lunch,\" you answered as you wiped your mouth of any residual blood and sent the calm animals out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just going to let them go and turn later?\" he asked as he saw them leave out the window, staring at the tiger a little longer than the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget, I can't turn anything, even if I wanted to, which I don't. Blade said I was not to drink human blood at all, but vampire and animal blood was fine,\" you explained and he nodded. It was clear he didn't completely trust you but he was getting better. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blood suckers are ready to meet us,\" he said not too favorably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and walked with him to meet them. The room went quiet as you two entered and didn't really get up in conversation until Blad came in and did his little bomb in the back of the head thing with one of them. Honestly you didn't care to remember any of their names, except Nyssa and 'Snow man'. Some of the others were ok, but they were still way to arrogant for your taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him?\" asked one of them as they pointed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is fine, he is coming with.\" Blade answered as they were about to leave to 'The House of Pain', to hunt the Reapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just a kid!\" said another, making the group grunt and whisper in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A kid I trust, leave it be,\" Blade more commanded. After his leverage of the bomb in one of their heads, they thought it unwise to challenge him. You smiled at this briefly. He had never said it out loud before. Not surprising, Blade wasn't one for long conversations. Never the less, hearing that he trusted you was not heard on deaf ears for you. It felt really good. So you all set out for this safe house that they were leading you all to. You rode with Whistler, as the others didn't really like you. Heck, if they didn't like Blade, they hated you. Maybe that was why Whistler started to like you more, despite the blood drinking aspect of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Whistler asked as they all got ready and he explained the weapons he brought along for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are close, careful. Keep those UV lights handy... and there is the blood smell.\" You said after sniffing, noticably on edge with the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bothers you?\" Whistler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it does. Innocent human blood is never a good smell. That I can smell it from here makes their lack of respect for life even more evident. Arrogant idiots. Wish I could just go in and slay them all. It would be simple that way, but Blade said no,\" you answered, the last part in an almost pouting persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said human blood was the best. You can tell the difference between innocent and guilt?\" he asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, in a way. I can sense the emotions around this place. Only death and fear from humans around here, and arrogant joy from the vampires for inflicting death on humans. A bit of hightened sensual tension from the feeding act as well. I can hear a few screams from victims and not one human laughter. This is a den of dumbass blood suckers... oh, excuse my language.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excused. Sometimes I forget you are just a kid, Vampire aside.\" Whistler replied then you both joined in with the others. Whistler was told to stay back but Blade wanted you to come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't pass for one of us.\" Said one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is coming, get over it.\" Blade commanded then looked to you beside him. \"You better mist up and stay hidden. I want you to be out of sight till the action starts... and stay with them, tell me anything off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, you're the boss,\" you said after a sigh then burst into mist. This caught the others' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did, you just...?\" Nyssa asked as she approached Blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what???\" asked Blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill him, he just turned to ash. I thought he was on your side.\" She more stated then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is not dead, right Caleb?\" Blade answered and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First they don't want me, then they get mad that you told me to hide. Uh, what a pain in the butt.\" you said from around them. Nyssa looked around to find the source, as did the others. Blade was just smiling at their reaction. It occured to you that he was just having some fun with them. \"Very funny Blade, real original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" he commanded to the group as you all headed for the entrance. He was smirking at their unease to where and what you were. You hadn't told them what exactly you were. Heck, only Blade and Whistler knew and they were having a blast keeping it hidden from the freaking out Vampires. You had to admit it was comical to watch.</span></div></div>",

You will see things... feeding... just remember why you are here.\" Nyssa said before you all were led into the club. \"Both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't forgotten.\" Blade answered for the both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of them were still on edge from what they saw you do before. They knew you were there, just couldn't sense you at all. They were beginning to see why you were called a demon by them. 14 years old or not, you were still dangerous. You could sense some of them shake as they thought about it. Unlike Blade and Whistler, you weren't restricted from reading their minds. You could clearly see that they were more nervous of you than they were of the reapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place stinks,\" you observed. Your ominous voice only made them more nervous, except Blade, who was getting a kick out of their discomfort. To be fair, he used to be just as uncomfortable when you used this ability. He got used to it, but knew what they must be feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just don't do anything rash, demon.\" Nyssa more asked then commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever.\" You answered with a little shake of the surroundings as you hiss/growled a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked to the large security door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to be kidding me...\" Blade said as he saw the sea of Vampires inside. For the first time since Blade had met them, Nyssa was the one to smirk in response to Blade, instead of the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all spread out, except you. You were already dispersed around the room in your mist. None could sense you, but you could sense almost everything in the area. You observed as Blade and the others made their way around the club. The music was a little better than the typical vampire clubs you had been to. Then again, all of those were cut short from you and Blade's hunting activities. You heard Blade talk with Scud over the radio as he placed remote cameras around the place, and played with a few of the blood pack. little bits of teasing. The others seemed to be concentrated too much on their search and relatively relaxed atmosphere to remember you were near and watching, like they were worried about before. But all this calmness had to come to an end eventually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, you stay in here. I am going to look in back and s... stuff.\" He commanded, censoring himself in front of you. You smirked at this. You were a kid after all, so using foul language was still an issue... or at least one that he held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You want me to babysit the one's in here?... great...' You sighed to him in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb...\" he almost scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine, go have fun. I'll wait in here.' You relented. You knew he liked his fun and challenges. Not that you had to worry about his safety. He is Blade after all. 'By the way, they are here. Watch yourself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to tell them?\" he asked as he was heading off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Heck no. Just because I have to watch them and play with them, doesn't mean I have to hold their hand.' You answered to which he smiled and went about his buisness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that certain things would happen this time. But you wondered if saving one of them would be a good idea. The one known as 'Light Hammer' would be bitten but not die. 'Priest' would actually die this time. You liked Light Hammer better, strong silent type and all that. But Priest was a little more understanding and honor bound. Sure he was a blood sucking and arrogant Vampire, but he had his code that you liked more than the others in the Blood pack. Another factor was that Light Hammer would be outside the place Blade told you to stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to save?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to go with Priest. In fairness, Light Hammer would be around until the battle where most of them die anyway. So you could do what you could with this idiot. Maybe he would play a bigger role later on, or not. But that was for later. For now you watched as they went about what they were doing. When the reapers finally showed themselves you made an ominous shudder that freaked the vampires so much that they started running for the doors, well almost all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for, Demon?\" asked one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are here.\" You announced, and not a moment too soon. They began to see them attacking almost as soon as you said it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like in the movie, they were having trouble but not overly so... except Priest. He was getting his butt kicked. You observed a few things and helped a few escape then turned your attention on your change in plot experiment. You watched to see if slightly warning them did enough to turn the tide for him, it didn't. The only thing that was different was that he got a few shots in. You waited until the reaper was about to bite him. You then turned solid and back handed the reaper off him and through the closest wall. You looked down at the broken Priest. Even if you saved him from being turned and bitten, the reaper did a number on him. You kneeled down next to him, to which he started scooting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself.\" you commanded. He was, at this point, to frightened of you to disobey. You put a hand on him and began healing his injuries. It didn't take much, but you got him healthy enough to fight and heal the rest on his own. He jumped up after you were done and examined his wounds. \"Now I have more to do than babysit you all day. I trust you can look after yourself from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will manage.\" He answered, still shaking but noticably in a different attitude toward you. You had made a blood sucking fan, just great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't be happening again,\" you warned then grabbed the incoming reaper and threw him through another wall and into one that Snow Man was cutting up. The fleeing and half skewered reaper continued up the wall while the one you threw recovered and he readied his sword to deal with him. \"Hold up, this one is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow Man nodded and sheathed his sword, though still warry of his surroundings. You jumped into fighting position with the reaper. Sure you could destroy him with Kaname's ability or hundreds of other ways, but you wanted to get a work out and have some fun. Maybe Blade was rubbing off on you. Either way you taunted the reaper a little until he attacked. You dodged and jabbed at him. It was like a dance with a really ugly partner. You were also showing the others what he was made of. Blade entered halfway through and watched as well. Since he didn't have to kill Priest he could just watch. At one point you cut half his head off, as you knew they needed to see how it worked even without being attached to anything. But finally you used a massive uppercut to make a hole in the ceiling and cause sunlight to rain in and engulf him, bursting him into flaming ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that took longer than usual.\" Blade mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was just having some fun,\" you said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed some,\" Blade pointed to the piece of the head you sliced off. Its eye was still roaming around. Your eyes turned red as  you made it burst into flames. They already knew about the eye ignite ability, so it was no point to hide that one. \"Nevermind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've done that the entire time?\" one of the Vampires asked and you just nodded comically. \"Then you put us in danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it!\" boomed Priest. \"He saved my life. I won't let you badmouth him like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When did the fan club start?' Blade asked to your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know. I guess it is better than him treating me like a human meat sack. Little annoying though.' you answered to which he smirked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We could always tell them about you being a Vampire...' Blade teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on, you said that they didn't deserve to know. Only you and Whistler knows, and you know why... oh, and Miss. Karen,' you responded. You knew it was teasing, but you also knew this was one of Blade's ways of telling a joke. So you played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others started verbally fighting a bit until Whistler and Scud came by and he showed everyone the captured reaper he found. You didn't need to know about it. You already knew everything about them. You just went to relax for a little bit, hopefully in peace for a while. In the back of your mind, you wondered if saving Priest would change anything. He already seemed as loyal as a dog to you. You would find out soon enough.</span></div></div>",

It was clear you would get no rest for a while. Strangely enough, you were beginning to get use to being called 'demon'. It used to bother you to no end. But now it was understandable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blade and the others are gathering for the mission,\" he informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I will be down momentarily,\" you answered. He left to join the others in getting ready. You made your way to where they were and sat near Whistler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demon.\" called Priest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...?\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not going to get ready for the mission? You aren't even packing a gun,\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I pack a gun when they are immune to silver and garlic? Unless you invented a UV bullet in the last few hours,\" you answered to which he stopped, thought about it, then went off to revaluate his armament choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your new friend is very attached,\" Whistler observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, annoying little pest. Even tried to give me a bag of human blood from a hospital. The thought was nice but I don't know where he learned about that. I thought only you and Blade knew around here.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a spy somewhere around here. Either that or he could've sensed something when you healed him. Either way, if he knows, odds are the rest of them knows. Probably didn't tell you they did so they can find a way to kill you,\" Whistler replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. Damn, now they are going to want my power to... and tempt me with human blood when they get the chance,\" you said back, half thinking as you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, keep the human blood option to yourself while we humans are around you,\" he commanded. He was actually very strict about this. You thought he was joking until you saw his face. He obviously didn't like even the idea of a Vampire drinking human blood. The fact that you were a Vampire and he was a human meant that it made it even more personal for him. But even so, usually people got aggitated or mystified about it, not scared or angry. That meant he didn't really trust you yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, won't talk about it again,\" you appologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better not,\" he said bluntly then walked over to the table of weapons. You sat where you were a feeling a bit guilty for talking that way around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Blade asked as he walked up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he likes me that much,\" you said as you glanced at Whistler from where the two of you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" he asked back. Luckily no one was close enough to hear your conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he hates Vampires and I am one. That and I have to drink actual blood. I don't think he likes that part in particular,\" you answered then looked down. \"Not like I try to be a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is just a hard nut to crack. He'll come around, just like I have,\" Blade responded as he put a hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to hold my breath,\" you said back. It looked like he was going to say something back, but the group was all ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Demon, let's go.\" Priest said as they went to the mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ride you stayed away from Whistler. He didn't seam to care and only Blade saw this. He began to talk to the old man, but you had no desire to listen in. You had enough to worry about to add an old man's hatred of you to thee mix. Finally you got there and looked down the opening to the Reaper's next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first.\" You volunteered then jumped in without any care. You didn't have to worry about dropping that far. You just wanted to get this part overwith. You took a look at the area. \"All clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got down there and all were being quiet for once. Blade could see the tension between you, Whistler, Priest, and the others. He silently seperated the teams up. The teams were what they were in the movie, except you and Priest were one as well. To be fair, other than Blade, Priest was the only one that was willing to go with you. So you both searched the tunnels. It was going slow because of him. You could do it in minutes if you didn't have to wait for him. You knew they were down here, but taking them on was another story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they?\" Priest asked outloud. As if to answer his question, one jumped out of a doorway at him. You kicked it midair so it went down a dead end and splattered on the wall it hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had to ask,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Demon, I just...\" he started but the fun was starting and a hoard started coming down a tunnel at the both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" you hollard as the fighting started. You could hear the fighting of the others start as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight began and you used a good amount of effort to both fight and keep Priest safe. You wanted to keep as much secret as you could. So you just used enhanced speed, strength, fighting skill, and eye ignite ability to do what needed to be done. You alse allowed him to gawk at the blood blade you made. You fought and all that until Blade called for the regroup. You both got down to where they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the bombpack?\" Blade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down that tunnel.\" one of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it. Caleb, you stay here and help them,\" Blade ordered to which you nodded. You knew he just meant Nyssa, and you would do just that, as much as you could. \"Now give me a hole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you used your eye ignite to enflame all the reapers in close proximity and down the tunnel he was going. They were ash soon and off Blade went, and so did your group. You all would need to get a fair amount away from the bomb. The only one's that could survive that thing was you, Blade, and Whistler. You knew, from the movie, that Whistler would be ok. You just didn't know how other things would be. Things had already changed because of Priest. So your group went down the tunnel. You used your sword most of the time. You almost cursed yourself for not feeding before the mission. This was getting exhausting. You only had a few more eye ignites left before you were on zero. You would have to make do with your blood sword. That wasn't that bad. Most of the time, whomever was before you lost their head, literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the bomb was activated and you all saw it coming. WIth what was left of your power, making your fangs grow and eyes glow, you used a shield to deflect the energy from the group you were in charge of protecting. But the nitro vacume must've enhanced the blast more than you thought. Even with your shield and your power, you came up short of what you needed to cover them completely. They dove into water to help just enough to survive. But unlike the movie, youre shield helped more than enough in that regard, but made you gasping for air, and blood. You had never been so thirsty in that regard. They looked at you as you panted on your hands and knees, looking at them. You were restraining yourself from drinking them dry, all of them. That and you doubted you could've forced them anyway, not all 3 of them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Priest, now!\" said the one you didn't like. Didn't even know his name, or refused to know it. But as he said this, hot silver pumped through your body. The Vampire you saved in this realm was betraying you, after saying some rather embassingly loyal things and sticking up for you against them. He was unloading sliver bullets into you. The last few went in your head, knocking you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you thought on it through your unconsciousness, hanging around all that silver all day and not feeding after being in mist form was taxing in itself. It wasn't overly suprising, even through your training that you would be this weak at the moment. You kicked yourself as you should've known better. To make it worse, Whistler also hated you for wanting human blood. If he saw you with your eyes glowing and fangs out, you had no doubt he would be repulsed by you. You didn't know what to do if/when you woke up. The only one you knew wanted you around at the moment was Blade. You hoped that would be enough.</span></div></div>",

They could tell you were still alive from your breathing and heartbeat. They just dropped you onto the floor. If you were awake you would've been eyeing the tank of blood not more than a few feet from you. But for now, they were examining you while the others came around and asked their questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this one?\" Asked the Overlord as he touched around your skin. The others around picked you up and put you on a table so he could take a look without bending over. Others came near as well. \"You are sure he is a Vampire, Priest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am sure. When he healed me I could sense it. But also he has many bullets in him and isn't dead. He also has these...\" Priest answered as he lifted your lips to reveal your fangs that were more than visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the thanks he gets for saving your life?\" Whistler asked as he saw them playing and observing your body as if it was a toy of interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have little room to talk,\" Priest said as he turned to Whistler. \"At least I made him feel valued when I was sticking my nose up his ass. You, on the other hand, didn't give him much more than a second look. Blade wasn't the only one that made our work a hell, and desimated our kind to find you, a human. This one was right along side Blade, and spoke nothing but praise for you when I was around to listen. You, on the other hand, made him feel like a worthless pile of crap. At least I made him feel good for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhistler was going to say something but was caught by his own thoughts. He was going through what the little Vampire on the table was to him and Blade. How much he remembered you wanted to impress him and Blade. A boy like you, Vampire aside, killing thousands of times, vampires and humans, just to rescue him. That had to leave a mark. And just like kids your age, you just wanted a little appreciation for your efforts. A sign that you did good by him. Even a simple head nod would suffice. But treating him like a vile enemy was not the story book response you had imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you also see his eyes my lord?\" Priest asked as he went back and lifted an eyelid so the glowing red eye was visible. But your body's reflexes were still operational. When he opened the the eye and looked into it, your body automatically sensed a hostile Vampire and reacted. Your gaze pushed him into the air and toward the ceiling at such a speed that when he hit it, it showered what was left of his body all over the room. Your eye closed on its own, as if sensing that its work was done for the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that... WHAT WAS THAT!\" The Overlord asked to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like we know that. He is obviously unconscience. What he does in that state is news to us.\" Blade answered. \"He rarely sleeps to begin with. Maybe this is why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes his study all the more important,\" the overloard stated as he stroked your body like before, but more gently. \"Take him away and learn his many secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back inside your body)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a see of blackness. You had been here before many times when your family had killed you during family vacations. The only difference was a single instance where a white light protruded in, as if someone was looking into you, then a rush of power, followed by darkness again. You were glad for this. When you were \"dead\" like this was the only time you got to completely relax like when you use to sleep as a human, except you didn't have dreams. Either way, it was a good time to relax. You thought on things like Whistler, Blade, and your family. You missed them a lot. You had been so busy that you had not thought on them for a while. Kelsey, Eve, Drade, Papa, Mom, Sarah, Luke, Isaac and all those dogs you just met. The king Amarok, you wished he was here to tell you about Miss. Isibelle while you waited, or to eat some of these people that imprisoned you. You remembered Kelsey's warning and promise that you not forget them. You spent the rest of the time remembering all of them. You started to actually cry as you realized how long it had been. Crying wasn't something you did. But this was something in your mind that you had little control of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to wake as a familiar feeling of blood rushed down your throat. They must've drained you pretty good for you not to feel it going down in the first place, until some was already digested. As soon as you could move you were gulping down huge quanities of the blood. It was good, really good. All of it was pure, warm, and delicious human blood. You were swimming in it there was so much, literally. You could start feeling people and things around you. There was someone else in there with you but he just got out. So it was clear to drink it all if you wanted, which you did. Your power unsealed and skyrocketed. Whatever pool of blood you were in exploded up and you created a siphone to suck up all the blood you could, like a funnel tsunami. Your body was all too eager to put its newly found fuel to use to repair and refuel its drained body, as well as put some on reserve for later. For the first time, you were stuffed, utterly stuffed and felt so powerful you thought you could split the world in half, but that one you couldn't do even if you wanted to. You finally came to rest in the now empty pool and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirsty?\" Blade asked. It looked like he was super ready to fight, but as shocked as everyone else in the now full room about what they just saw you do. To that fact you were still licking your lips and fangs of residual blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All filled up. Uh, haven't felt this good in a long time.\" You answered in a blissful smile as you walked up and joined him looking over the room. It took you a second to process what was happening. \"Hold up, I thought you said you didn't want me drinking human blood, and how did I get from being shot in the head with silver to being bathed in that much blood? Sure as hell wasn't them that threw me in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my idea. Was Whistler's doing,\" Blade answered as he pointed up at an old man on the balcony. He looked like he had just went through a torture session and broke his back lifting something. \"He dropped both of us in there. Crazy old man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at him. Your eyes were glowing red as your Vampire features were all out and making most in the room sudder under its weight and pressure. You shielded your allies out of habbit so Whistler and Blade were free to move unhindered. As you looked to him he looked back from his laying position. He was trying to recover but had limited movement at the moment. Even through this he took the effort to throw Blade his shades and nodd an approving nod to you. You couldn't help but smile ate this. The fact that he was the one to give you to Human blood was overshadowed by this little movement or recognition and approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got these guys. You can go get the top dog,\" you said as you brought your attention back to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Blade asked, clearly wanting some of the action. He even had his 'don't f*** with me' shades on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I need some fun too. I got all this power and need some place to vent it on. You can have the big boss man and I get all the whimps... just one thing, where's Priest? I believe I owe him one.\" You answered as he began to relent to your request and focus on his task. the question however made him smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He tried to open your eye when you were out and well...\" Blade answered, pointing to the cieling where Priest's body still decorated the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that explains that,\" you said as you looked up then back at the room of soldiers and vampires. You snapped your fingers and a golden portal opened up. \"Here, just step through and you'll be in the room with the one you are thinking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now come on,\" you answered. Using the dragon king's ability was easy enough but also unspecific. If someone else got through then you couldn't stop them on route. Blade seemed to figure this out on his own and walked through with his sword. The one good thing about changing the storyline. He didn't have to fight for his sword. How he got it was unclear, but you could ask him later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you had some fun to enjoy. You sealed the exits so they couldn't escape and went to work. Wasn't hard to defeat them. They weren't even using silver, they stood no chance against you. You made sure not to feed on them though. Whistler might've let you have human blood once, but feeding on humans directly probably was too much. Luckily they were stupid enough to think they could win. Saved on time chasing them down. You were surprised they could move under the pressure you were releasing, but them moving and fighting meant more fun for you. Within a few minutes they were all dead and you were satisfied, both physically and your hunger. This feeling was rare and you basked in it for a while before you came out of it and helped Whistler. You were tempted to ask what changed to have him drop you in human blood. But you didn't ask and he didn't tell. Although you did retract your vampire traits to make him more comfortable as you healed and helped him. You both arrived just as Blade was taking the dying Nyssa out to see the sun. You both stood silent as Blade dealt with this strange loss. This was a day of many firsts, one of which was Blade grieving a blood sucking, full blooded Vampire that he had kill so many of over the years. You also knew this would be the end of the 2nd movie and the 3rd was some distance away. But you kept your Family in your mind, taking out their picture for the first time since you packed it away. Yes, you will remember them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(A few months ago...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to leave?\" You asked as Blade and Whistler asked. You were unsure why they were telling you to go. You all had gotten super close and this wasn't on your radar at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. There is too much happening for both of you to be in the same place. Blade can look after himself and so can you. There is no reason why both of you should be dealing with the same small fry. Better to spread out and take care of twice as many. Since Blade can't materialize weapons like you can, I will be sticking with him.\" Whistler explained. You were silent and pacing back and forth for a while as you thought through it. He was right, as usual, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I've learned everything I can from you two and... I like being here with you guys.\" You replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have our fun Caleb. You know you roll like a pro and outshine me on occasion.\" Blade started. You knew that he would never openly admit you were better than he is. THAT was as close as he got to saying it. \"It won't be the same around here without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we will feel the same as you do. You are like family at this point. But there is nothing more to teach you. Plus, there is a favor I would like you to do for me while you are out there, if you would?\" Whistler agreed and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything, you know I would,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good, I appreciate it.' he said in your head, which meant he didn't want Blade in on it. He did this every time he wanted to talk exclusively to you about things that would otherwise upset Blade. You didn't mind as it showed how much he trusted you, not more than Blade but differently. 'Ok, Caleb I have a daughter, and her name is Abigail...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Present time...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been on your own for a while now. Whistler had asked you to keep an eye on his daughter and to come to Blade's aid if anything were to happen to him. You didn't bother argueing about this, especially sense it was for the best. He would be dead shortly and if you remained with them you would be compelled to save him regardless of what happened to the realm. So you searched and found his daughter. He had mentioned she was already trained as a Vampire hunter, not as skilled as Blade but still pretty good. For this reason you observed unless something bad happened. In those cases you helped just enough so she learned and got better. Things like blowing a bullet off course slightly or ashing a Vampire sniper that she never knew was there. Although, to your relief, such instances didn't happen much. So you were able to watch her grow, which was its own reward in a sense. Of course you gave her privacy when needed, but kept a constant watch on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of these instances that you decided to help more directly. Maybe it was because you were in the realm but there was more enemies in this scene than there was in the movie. You had went over this scene in your mind over and over again so you could remember it when you saw it, the start of the 3rd movie. Unlike the movie though, there was at least a dozen kids trying to get her. How they thought her and her fake baby's blood would be enough to satisfy all of them was news to you, but she was needing help at this point. You also knew that she would have to see you in the very near future, and you would be leaving this realm soon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!! Garlic!\" screamed one of the kids that was looking at the doll. They all looked over to see the effect. Abby was able to take out 3 of them before the rest held her firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to pay for that bitch!\" Said the one you thought to be the leader. He reared his arm back to punch her but you caught it before it went forward. From their point of view, you had just appeared. You also smelled like a human. \"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't very nice,\" you said then kicked him into the path of the oncoming train, making him a very dead vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him!\" yelled a few of the others as Abby watched, trying a few times to get free but only earning a fist in the gut or a slap to the face for her reward. You moved slow enough for them to see but fast enough to be obviously not human. It didn't take long for you to snap the necks and otherwise kill all of them in a variety of ways. Ways that you had learned from years of hanging with Blade, and other realms. Finally only Abby and her captors remained, very fearful and panicking captures that were obviously intent on holding her hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move, or we'll kill her.\" One said as he held her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You plan on killing her regardless. But if you let her go now and leave while you can, I won't kill you... today. Make a move to kill her, and You'll see just how fast I can be. Your move,\" you answered with an intense glare. They looked around at the disappearing ash of thier group then at you. They were sweating bullets and Abby could only watch you as you glared at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to hell!\" one yelled then began swinging a knife at Abigail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad move.\" you said and turned them to ash with Kaname's ability. Once again you were praising and thanking him from afar. That ability was insanely useful and effective. With that you rushed forward and caught Abby as she was dropped to the ground. She lay in your arms and you started to heal her. You did it slow so she could see it. First you put your hand on her chest and protruded a light to heal her broken ribs and punctured lung along with other cuts and bruises, then her throat to heal her partially collapsed throat and obvious bruising side effects, and then her head to help her concussion and any other injuries. \"Are you ok Miss. Abby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah... Thanks to you I assume\" she said as you helped her up to her feet. You were still a little kid, in size and shape. So you were shorter than her and obviously younger in looks. You also made it a point to remain in that mindset, polite little kid that is. You had a life to get back to eventually, so you needed to hold onto what your projected age would say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am. It is really nice to meet you Miss. Abigail,\" you answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you know my name and you would be...?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Caleb,\" you introduced with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have been what, following me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your father asked me to,\" you responded with an innocent look. You didn't have your Vampire Clan outfit on, just your casual wear, so you looked more kid like and nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did? Wait, how do you know my Father?\" She asked, obviously confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... well that is a long story,\" you said nevously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and went over to sit on the bench and patted the seat next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got all night, so let's here it,\" She answered. You nervously sat down. You didn't know why you were nervous. Other guys would say that it was because you were talking to a very hot woman. But you had access to a succubus at home, two of them in fact. It wasn't her status or power level. You didn't know, you just were nervous.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Right, where to start...?\" You said outloud. You thought about how to tell her you met her father and Blade. There was really no way of getting around you being a vampire yourself. \"... I met him when I was looking for Blade. I was sent to... find him and learn. It took a while for them to trust me, but eventually I was accepted and trained with them. I learned a lot but your father thought that having me and Blade in the same area would be too much. So he had us seperate and asked if I would look after you when I could. I suppose that is the short verson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't nearly old enough to have met him that far back.\" Abigail said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that is because I am... older than I look. Kind of like blade in that I am a... well not human.\" you said, visably nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes you a vampire then?\" she asked as she scooted slightly away. You followed her movement and sighed at her sudden distance before nodding. \"What do you mean like Blade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daywalker for one, in a manner of speaking. Immune to galic, can eat human food, but we have our differences. I have to drink blood, but it doesn't have to be human. Blade used to have me drink from Vampires... YUCK!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to be kidding me. My father would never ally with a Vampire that drinks blood!\" She stated as she got up and faced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet here I am. Please Miss. Abigail, I don't want to harm you. If I did, why would I heal you, and tell that story? You already saw I have enough power to do so if I wanted. Though you do smell really good.\" You added, trying to go for a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I would trust a Vampire, even a little pint sized one.\" She almost growled at you. You got up at this, but slowly and started walking away. \"Wait, where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Probably just around some place where I can keep an eye on you. I get that you are too much your father's daughter to take me for my word as a vampire. I can still keep my promise from the shadows. Sorry if I intruded,\" you responded then turned to mist slowly, so she could see that you were turning into something rather than the ashing like appearence it usually had. \"Call my name if you need me, I will hear you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched her again. You also helped deal with Vampires as you traveled. But that was just simple stuff. Out of respect, you didn't drink human blood as you did this. You knew that Blade didn't approve, and if you judged the time right, Whistler was dead at this point. You watched as Abigail told her friends and others about you and what you said. They settled on the thought that you were some kind of spy, using her father's name to get close to her. You didn't like being labelled like this, but you understood it was the only logical thing they could do. Either way, you had to stand aside as they rescued Blade. You knew they wouldn't need your help. So you just followed them until they made it back to the hideout and were talking about things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is he?\" Blade asked, after they got done with explaining about Dracula and arming for thier hunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He?\" asked Hannible King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the kid. The old man told him to watch you. So where is he?\" Blade asked, looking around for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, you mean that little vampire kid was telling the truth?\" Abby said, not believing it. Blade just answered by looking at her. \"We thought he just was a vampire plan to get past our guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you tell him?\" Blade asked, catching on quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent him away. I... my father really did send him?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you sent him away. You got no idea what you have done.\" Blade replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so special about this kid?\" King asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this whole Drake thing is true, only he and I can do anything about it. He's got crazy mad skills and has got kick ass abilities.\" Blade explained. Someone else might've explained a little better. Blade was never one to talk much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said I could just call him if I need him.\" Abby told them. Blade just looked at her again. It was amazing what the dude could say without doing more than looking at someone. \"Alright... Caleb, are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have always been here.\" You answered from around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing that mist thing again aren't you?\" Blade more stated then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else am I suppose to keep an eye on them without them knowing,\" you answered. You paused for a moment then proceeded. \"Blade, I know about Whistler... sorry I wasn't there. Maybe I could've...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it. You know the old man wasn't one to die easily,\" Blade responded, which was as close as he got to a comfort response to you in such a situation. It was hard to read him, but you had gotten a hold on it, barely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, where is he?\" King asked after pointing his gun every which way as you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would show myself, but I really don't like being shot. Mind putting down the gun, or holster it?\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is him asking nicely.\" Blade informed. He glared at King until he holstered his gun and Abby did the same, though still highly on edge. To this you started to thicken and combine your mist so they could see you reform. You figured it would give them a chance to see something without you having to explain in detail. \"About time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you to,\" you said commically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... are you?\" asked King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Caleb. Vampires also call me 'Demon'. Don't really like that title, but it scares the crap out of them, so I don't mind,\" you introduced and bowed while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you...?\" asked the pasty white guy named Hedges that was usually in charge of the weapons and more nerdy stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do a lot of things.\" you said with a smile. Again, you weren't in your Vampire Clan outfit. You didn't see the point at this stage. This was the last movie and so you didn't have to worry about staying around afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to roll?\" Blade asked, bringing everyone back to the topic of hunting and taking out Dracula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you haven't gotten to soft have you, or do you need a cane?\" you asked comically to which he just smirked at the ego jab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, he's coming with us?\" Abby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, got a problem with that?\" Blade asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just... he's a vampire right?\" She asked, trying to voice her concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over it.\" Blade answered. She looked at you and you shyly glanced at her as if to say sorry on his behalf. He may have been blunt, but you weren't. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't swet it kid, she's hated vampires for a while. I think it is hereditary.\" King joked as you let them go ahead of you. You forgot how he liked to say bad jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be right about that. Took a lot for Whistler to trust me too.\" You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't mean it like that... I'll shut up now.\" King responded, noticing that it was bothering you a good bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Finally,' Blade thought to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You really think that chatterbox has run out of things to say?' You thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That sucks. What's up with you and her?' he asked as you all got into the truck and she gave you a death look while you were visibly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't know. I'm just really nervous around her for some reason.' You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe you got the hots for her.' he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not really. Don't get me wrong, she's hot, for a human. However, I got women and girls much hotter than her at home. Succubus are naturally that way. Whatever it is, I am not sure why I am like this around her, so it hurts that she doesn't like me very much,' you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not easy being you is it?' Blade asked in a rare form of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I suppose not.' you replied in an internal tone that indicated that you were not wanting to expand. He didn't mind, he was normally quiet to begin with. So you stole one last glance at Abby then gazed out the window as King drove you all to your next destination. They eventually stopped and started hunting and tracking familiars, but you were barely breaking a sweat. Blade was content on killing them, but you weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this one thinking?\" Blade asked as he held a young man to you. You glared at the man and looked deep into his mind. It was easy to penetrate his mind, as he had no mental defenses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Vance is the head dude.\" you said as you pulled out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do that?\" Abby asked but with a tone that indicated that she thought her mind was also a target for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just can read people's minds, if I want. Was hard to control at first, but it is useful and easy against people like him. He doesn't know how to guard his mind. Just like searching on google or opening a book.\" you answered then Blade tossed the man off the building. You used your ability to have him land safely but still out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to save all of them?\" Blade mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help it. The moment I say humans can die that easy is the moment I condone drinking one dry, which I don't.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Blade ended with. You hated people that killed innocent people and he hated familiars. In some ways, you two balanced each other out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What is that?\" Abby asked as you all drove to Dr. Vance's office. She was referring to something you had been looking at since you got into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... it is my family,\" you answered in a tone that made it obvious that you missed them, a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they?\" she asked, probably expecting you to say that you killed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are waiting for me. When I am done here, I will be going back there. I haven't seen them in over 10 years, though for them it will only be a few months. I miss them,\" you responded, actually petting the side of the picture as you looked deep into each face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\" Blade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on how long it takes to kick Dracula's butt. If I let things play out, it will be about a week. But if I don't, I'll be done today. Both has their downsides,\" you answered in a contimplative tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What downsides?\" Abby asked in a lighter tone. WIther it was to get you out earlier or because the news of your family was working on her was unclear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wait and stay longer than Blade will deal with him and vengence is dealt with like is should. But if I kill him today and give the blood to you all then you don't. Either way, all the vampires are destroyed at the end. The downsides are if I wait then more innocent people die. If I do it right away then the legacy passed on to Blade is passed on to me instead, making me stronger and leaving you all with not that much. Selfishly, I like it here, but I want to go home. I guess we will see,\" you responded. They listened but didn't reply to you. Blade seemed to be thinking on it as were the others, in different fashions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you all were there and heading up to Dr. Vance's office. The security was pathetic and you all made it without breaking a sweat. You sniffed as you all entered the room, smelling blood. You were face to face with your choice now. Drake was standing right there. The Dracula in your realm was a joke, this one wasn't and Kaname's trick wouldn't work on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember me, time for some payback.\" Blade said as the formed a triangle with you next to Blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't Vance,\" you stated as you glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Looks like him.\" Abby said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Drake could do anything you lifted a hand and swiped it. This made all the obsticles in the room, even the drapes and paint, turn to dust. The only things that remained was you 4, Drake, and the recently dead Dr. Vance. As you did this, Drake went back to his normal sealed form. The other two formed up by Blade and your side. Abby wasn't keen on having you so near her but she was more worried about Drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the hunter they all fear, and the Demon. I had a feeling about you two,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blade, this is that moment I was talking about. We either let him go, or I kill him. You know where I come from, and know that I won't be coming back. So what do you want to do?\" You asked, although not taking your eyes from Drake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him now.\" Blade said. Mr. No nonsense, you should've guessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A child is going to kill me? I think not.\" Drake said as saw you walking toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You of all people should know that things aren't always what they appear.\" you said then rose your arm and sprouted a blood sword. You let your eyes glow and made a barrier around the place so he couldn't get out. \"I am sorry Drake, but this is where your story ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" he asked, a bit bewildered. You could tell the others, except Blade, were wondering as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine if ALL the vampires and all their abilities you have ever heard of and were ever born were all combined into one... that is what I am. I am THE Vampire. Now, I know you will not believe me so I will skip the argument. Goodbye Dracula,\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do much more you rushed forward and cut off his head like nothing. The move was so quick that it looked like you just appeared on the other side, even from his eyes. He stumbled forward as his head tumbled, hitting the ground by his feet before his body dropped as well. It was considerably harder than you made it look. Most you could just tear with your mind, even the ones in Kaname's world. He was immune to like attacks and it took a good amount of effort to get the blood swory through his neck. Either way, you summoned the blood from his body and began filling viles with it and drinking some as well. Most of it though was in a few viles for them to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, this should be enough for your bio weapon and...\" you started then made a movement to seal the head back on Drake's body, just for appearences. \"... that should be enough to keep the Vampire's busy until you use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was it? That's all it took?\" Blade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were expecting something longer? Sorry Blade, but I am really home sick. I couldn't play with him at this point,\" you replied then they reacted to a new presence in the room. \"Hello Mr. Vale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you completed this realm and test earlier than expected. Lady Isibelle would've been proud.\" Mr. Vale said as he got up from bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" Abby asked as you let your eyes go back to human eyes and the barrier was released. She was dumbstruck till this point and now was full of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is the man that is here to take me home. Don't worry, you won't see me again... at least I don't think you will.\" you said. She backed down, but had a bit of a guilty face on. She wasn't ready to be attached to you, but you had just beat their enemy and was attached to her father. Her open hostility toward you might've been too much and she was just beginning to see it. You still didn't know why you were so nervous around her. Maybe you would see her again. You never know. One thing you learned since becoming a Vampire, anything was possible. You looked from her to Blade. \"It was an honor Sir. Thank you for putting up with me all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was fun kid. Go and do right by your folks.\" he said and held out his hand. This suprised you. Sure you two had been cool with each other and trusted one another, but he never had done anything more than a nodd to you. Shaking hands was a huge thing. You hesitated, but he waited, until you finally brought your hand up to meet his. His words were standard, but this was a good send off. You looked over at King, who had fainted from shock and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mr. Vale, time to go.\" You said as you seperated from Blade and walked over to where he stood, towering over you. He was, after all, a very large man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish Master.\" He said and darkness took you again, but not before you were able to share one head nod with Blade before he was gone. But then you were held in the darkness with Mr. Vale. \"It is time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, it is time for you to gain the portal ability. The same one Lady Isibelle gave me to help you. With it, all your power will be unlocked and you will be the master of your own path.\" Mr. Vale said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, going into different movies and realms could be really cool, and creating them too. How do we do this?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By drinking me dry.\" He said. The solution and words hit you like a ton of bricks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You asked, still shocked after a good 10 minutes of just standing there trying to process it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been an honor serving you, Master, but this is what must happen. I have lived a very long and very full life, first with Lady Isibelle and then with you. But... SHE was my love of my heart. I long to join her after centuries of living and loving her, to be without her is too much... and this is the last task she gave me, to ensure her chosen successor was trained right. I have been waiting for this day, to finally be at peace.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be... wait, you said you lived centuries with her, and you both loved each other. I thought only a Vampire could live that long. How did she take you with her for so long?\" You asked. You had not only the shock of what you had to do, but also the shock of not being alone like you thought you would have to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a gift you can only give once. Normally it is given at the end of a Vampire's life. But if given any time before that, the person given this gift is immortal and has the portal ability at their disposal, along with whatever power the Vampire shares, until it is taken. You must be careful if you are planning on giving this gift to someone. A thousand or more years can be as much of a curse as it can be a gift, as you will find out soon enough. But this brings us to this moment. Please, Master, set me free and allow me to join my Love in Heaven.\" He said, kneeling down so he could look you in the eye. Yeah, he is that tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you, Mr. Vale. As a favor to you and Miss. Isibelle I will do as you ask. Tell her thank you from me when you see her.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, Master.\" He said then closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't want to do this. You had worked so hard to NEVER lose control and drink a person dry, unless they were those already dead and insanely evil vampires in Blade's realm. But this was someone you cared about. But you had to do it and he was begging you to do it, without you compelling him to do so. So with that decided you leaned in and took hold of his neck. Then with a quick motion you bit into him. You worked fast so you didn't lose your nerve. You had never drank a human dry before and you hoped it wasn't going to be something you would be compelled to do again, because it felt really good. You kept drinking until he turned to ash. But this wasn't because of you. It was the gift leaving him. In the end, he died just like Miss. Isibelle, or should you say, Mrs. Isibelle. With that done, you readied yourself, opened the portal to your realm and walked through, ready for the rest of your life. Remarkably enough, you didn't feel bad, you wondered why... but for now, you were going to see your family again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>September 4, 2004, it will be a day that would be cemented into your mind for as long as your immortal life would live. You had gotten home early and spent some much needed time with each of your family. Most noticeable was Kelsey and Eve. They were always your closest friends and they were quick to remind you of that. Although, they quickly backed off when they were reminded that YOU were the one gone for over 10 years. For them it was only 2 \u00bd months. So they helped ease you back into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you and your immediate family were Up North at the cabin. Your Grandparents were deciding to move up there for retirement in the near future. So Papa was recruited to help make it ready for them. Sure the cabin was nice, but it was not for long retirement staying, especially for old people, and since your father was working on it, you and your brothers were to. You had offered to help them get things done faster. But Papa had insisted on working alone side his sons the normal way, well close to it anyway. Struggling with a farm tractor and grater to plow a field was one of these activities. But this day wouldn\u2019t be remembered for a well completed job. Something else, that would mark you forever after\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much further?\u201d Papa asked, as he backed up the farm tractor to the grater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore\u2026\u201d Grandpa started, as he guided Papa back. \u201c\u2026more, more, there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright boys, get the bolts in place,\u201d Papa instructed as he observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPapa, I can\u2019t get mine.\u201d Luke said, as he struggled with the bolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Caleb already has his side in,\u201d Papa joked with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like that\u2019s fair,\u201d Luke joked back, making you all laugh a little bit. Papa helped Luke and had you straighten the piece, as it was at an angle. Then attempted to heave himself back up to the driver\u2019s seat of the tractor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStink\u2026\u201d He said as he came back down. It looked like he was playing on his running old and overweight joke, like he always did. Groaning while walking up a flight of stairs was part of this. So him backing off and saying something like that got another smile on your faces. But when you expected him to end it and get back to work, he didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right in front of you and you had your hand on him as if steadying him if he needed the extra push to get up there. You became concerned when this \u2018joke\u2019 went on to heavy breathing and labored pulse. But the turning point for all of you was when his usually upright and working shoulders began to slouch. He was facing you now and you were holding him up with one hand on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething isn\u2019t right.\u201d You said as you looked at his extremely labored breathing. The others seemed content to run with the joke as long as Papa could keep it up, that is until they heard you say this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, let\u2019s get him in the open,\u201d Grandpa said, first to start moving as he told Luke to go get help. You effortlessly lifted him and laid him down on an open part of the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb? What is going on?\u201d Mom said as she looked at you observing him, and Grandpa doing the same. She went by his head to hold it as more people came out. She, along with everyone else, now saw that things were bad. \u201cHelp him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I am trying,\u201d you said, as you healed everything you could find. \u201cI can\u2019t find what is wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Grandpa asked, first to be able to talk after you said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have healed everything and more already. He should be able to live till 150 on the things I healed. I don\u2019t understand. Everything is healthy, why won\u2019t he wake up? He\u2026\u201d You said as you frantically healed places and they could see your desperation and truth behind your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa, call 911.\u201d Grandpa instructed. After that, you all tried everything you could. They even tried CPR, as if your attempts weren\u2019t enough. Mom looked past his vomiting and such to give him mouth to mouth, when he wasn\u2019t breathing. 45 minutes went by and there was no change. At this point, you were crying and healing him so his heart would beat a few times then stop, or his lungs would work then stop as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Caleb, you need to stop.\u201d Mom said, knowing that the EMT\u2019s were mere yards away, getting out of their ambulance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere has to be something I can do!\u201d You cried as you sent another healing energy through his body, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grabbed you with silver in their hands to restrain you and pull you inside. You didn\u2019t fight them, but without silver, even your default motor skills were too much for them. They put you on a couch inside while Mom stayed with Grandpa and Grandma to explain to the EMTs. They left Luke inside with you. You had many friends, family, and such that you loved very much. Each had their little thing they did best. Kelsey and Eve were high on that list. But Luke was your brother. He was always the more populat and, if not for your vampire abilities, more athletic. He was the \u2018cool\u2019 one. But he was also the only one to reach you like this. There was just a bond that only a sibling that close to your age could have. He understood you. While your Vampire side was more than he knew, your mind and heart were known to him better than anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, is\u2026 he?\u201d Luke asked, both scared of the answer and wanting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t heal him. What\u2026\u201d you started, whimpering as you spoke. This caught Luke off guard as well. You had been through a lot since the change and he had never seen you cry or was this emotionally compromised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all know you did everything you could,\u201d Luke said, putting a hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What is the point of all this power if I can\u2019t save the people closest to me? At least my family.\u201d you asked and ranted. \u201cIt is my fault. If I was stronger maybe I could\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb!\u201d Luke almost roared and whacked you over the head with some silver brass knuckles he kept around. You looked at him as he looked at you. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever say that! You are the best son and brother in the world and more powerful then\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but you are not bad and you are powerful. You tried your hardest to heal him. As far as I know, only God has a higher healing ability than you. It is NOT your fault. I am having a hard enough time dealing with this without seeing my Vampire brother freaking out in front of me. We need you, we all do. Sure blame will be passed around for a while. But if you couldn\u2019t heal him, with all your power, then the Lord must\u2019ve been calling him home. We need to trust in that. He is more perfect and strong that you. So you wake up and help us deal with this already! We need you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were locked for a while. Luke was something else. He always knew what to say to you, to kick any mindset in the butt. He could look into your red Vampire eyes and talk you down easily. The only person that could do it better was\u2026 well he wasn\u2019t there anymore. But you needed to help. Papa might be beyond your abilities, but not the minds of the people around you. You needed to help them deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Luke\u2026\u201d You said as you wobbly got up. You braced yourself on the wall for a minute. You weren\u2019t ready to go out there. But this was one time where you could never be ready. Not for this. Not to see your Father dead\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... please help. Help us now, especially Mom.\" Luke begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" You answered then entered his mind. Entering the minds of your family and friends was a lot harder than anyone else. They were use to mentally defending mind attacks. But for their sakes, you did it anyway. You helped him calm then went with him to help those outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not easy for you. The moment you came around the corner, you saw the white sheet over your Father's body. The ground shook slightly as you looked. Those that knew what they were feeling looked at you, as you entered the area. But you went straight over to Mom and sat on the log with her. She grabbed you and hugged into you. She was in shock and pain. You then realized, that no matter how much you were hurting, there was someone that was hurting more. Your mother had lost her Husband, her life partner, her Love. You embraced her and entered her mind, calming her in a way that didn't tread on her memory of the day. She didn't need to forget, she needed to accept it in the right light. The others watched as you helped her respecting it, in shock themselves, and secretly hoping you would hurry up and help them too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a very dark day for you. Your Father, first to accept your condition, moral center, most reasonable and loving person you ever were to meet, and friend was out of your life forever. But for the calm that you were trying to pass out, you dared not shed another tear. Not when they took his body away, or offered their condolences. You had to help, you could deal with your own grief later.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Word traveled fast about Papa's passing. One of the things your family was good at, was being nosy. Within hours of his death, everyone in the family knew. Before the week was out, everyone else that was ever connected with him was also notified. The funeral was so large, that the population capacity of the church was doubled, and those were only the people that could make it on time. As for the non-human family other than you, they paid their respects as well. King even came in person, but only when all your family was Up North, spreading his ashes over the river. Everyone was dealing with grief in their own way. You Mom was the most worst for wear. Made sense when you thought about it. He may have been your father, but he was her loving husband for more years than you'd been alive. You offered to help calm her, but she insisted on doing this part without supernatural help. She just wanted to give Papa the time and respect he deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand were reclusive at the moment. Unlike your brothers or Sister, you couldn't react by moving away with a guy or breaking a wooden chair. You had to be careful. Extra emotion would not excuse you from doing something foolish, something that you couldn't come back from, or the person you did it to. You decided to handle it in a way that he would want, as far as losing you temper was concerned. It also helped that you had wonderful family and friends. Although they could all see that you were not showing your true feelings. Eve wasn't there all the time, as she had her kingdom to run, but she did refrain from asking for your help in dealing with wars with invading insects like she had been doing after you got back and before Papa's death. Kelsey was the most supportive though, her Mother tried but wasn't good at feeling bad for a dead human yet. So many years not caring had conditioned her. Although, even she had to admit that the world was a darker place without Papa in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, wait up!\" Kelsey said as she joined you in walking to your next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kelsey.\" you said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be doing well today. How you holding up? If I were in your shoes, I would've taken the month off they were offering you.\" Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well if he were still here he would expect me to be on top of my grades. Can't let him down with that. Plus, School is one of the few normal things I got left. I can't jip on that.\" You answered, trying to do so and joke at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you do that?\" Kelsey asked as you both walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\" You asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brush off your feelings to protect others. It is ok to feel sad you know.\" She said with care. She didn't want' to seem too forceful, but she did want to be there for you and get you to open up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are more important things on people's plates than worry about me and my problems. I don't want to add to people's worry,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how will you feel if you bottle it up for all that time, then it comes out when you don't want it to?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'll lose control?\" You asked, both confused and almost hurt that she thought you had that little self control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that isn't what I meant. Everyone has their way of dealing with things like this. You have to let those feelings out somewhere. I just want to make sure you do it where it is safe and where I can help. I want to be there for you, Caleb, but you have to let me. If you a human, I'd just force you to do it. But I can't, you have to help me help you.\" Kelsey explained, genuinely worried. You looked at her for a moment as you both sat down on a free spot. No one was around, you made sure, so you could talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth is... I am scared. Like really, crazy, can't sleep, shaking scared.\" you said, after a long pause to think on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... scared?\" she asked. Of all the things she thought you were going to say, this was not one of them. You were a Vampire, one of the most powerful of all night creatures and assumed monsters. You tended to scare other people, not get scared yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it is strange. I thought I was losing my mind at first. But I am,\" you started then paused. She was just listening to you. When the pause went on long enough, she just put her soft and silky smooth hand on yours as if to tell you to keep going in her own little way. \"Papa was the first person to accept me when I turned. He was and is my moral center. When I was unsure what or who to feed on, I went to him. When I was pondering when to cross the killing line, I asked him to help guide me. When I was being treated like a monster by my family, he was the one that helped everyone see that I had not changed underneath it all. He... he was my core. I don't know what to do without him. What if I... what if I go bad without even realizing it? Without him here to guide me, like only he could, I fear I will slip and fall and not be able to get back up. I am so scared Kelsey, unbelievably so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what to say at this point. Sure Papa was special. Even the non-humans had to admit that he was more than the ordinary person. Many had thanked him for raising you in a Godly and right manner. Teaching you and helping all of you. But those that knew about you, wondered how he did it. Raising a blood sucking vampire couldn't be easy. Especially one that could kill everyone in the room with a simple blink of an eye, and craved their blood. Even knowing all of this, she didn't know how much of a value you put on him as well. How would she help you get passed losing such a crucial part of your life. She even owed her life and that of her Mother to Papa. He was the one that came up with how they could live, even though they tried to kill you and threatened your entire family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb... I am not sure what I can say to help. Jeepers, it would be so much easier if I could just kiss you and be done with it.\" She started, trying to lighten your mood with a joke... it wasn't working. \"But listen, you have a huge loving family, including me. You all welcomed me in to your huge and obnoxiously nosy family with open arms. I know none of us can replace your Father. I am not going to even try, cause he was very special. But from one mythical being to another, you will make it through it and I will help. Even if you need to vent on me, instead of someone weaker. I will be there, cause Lord knows I will need you when I face a similar position. My arms will always be open to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I do something bad? Like really bad?\" You asked, not knowing if she could handle something like that. Kelsey was this beautiful being that was, in some cultures, thought to be sex goddesses. You didn't see her embracing you in wake of a mistake that ends in lives lost, many lives lost. Before she answered she pulled your arm and didn't stop till she held you in a very tight hug. If she was hugging a human, the person would have a crushed spinal column. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you are covered in blood from people you kill, I will still be here to hold you until you are ok again. And I will help you stay centered, remembering where you come from so you are less likely to do that. I will be here long after your human family joins your father. I plan to hold you and help you for all of that time, if you let me,\" she answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Kelsey,\" you said as you hugged her back. This simple pact of friendship and responsibility wasn't enough to heal your fear all together, but it was a significant start. And perhaps, in time, your inward grief would also be healed. But for now you hugged Kelsey, your Succubus friend, family, and helper. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat with Duke, just relaxing with your Father's dog. Life was still hard without Papa, and you were still scared, but you all supported each other. Kelsey was right, you would make it through it. But for now, you and Duke were enjoying each others company. Sure he wasn't sapient, but he was still a k-9 and as such was completely loyal to you. You wondered 2 things as you pet him. Those were; if dogs and such in other realms would be required to obey you, and at what point you should let Duke go. For the first point, you would have to wait and see. But the second one, that was a little deeper. You had extended Duke's life and he now flirted with his 20s, and not in dog years. That was pretty old for a Golden retriever. You didn't know if you were doing good or not allowing him to finally rest. But you weren't too distressed by it. You would figure it out eventually, and you both didn't want to think on the bad side of this situation. All at once, Duke barked at an approaching scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah buddy, I smell it too,\" you answered and sent him inside the house. The scent had been around for a while. Just wafts of it and not imposing. But it was a scent you had not experienced before. You stood and walked out into the front yard to allow the wind to pass around you and bring in the scents from around. You didn't know what it was about this scent, but it was a very strange one. Seeing as you had experienced some pretty strange things over your life, so far, this did not go unnoticed. You stood still, eye's closed for the better part of a few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, what in the world are you doing?\" Luke asked as he got home from... well wherever he was previously. It was a more teasing question, as he didn't even try to guess why you did some of the things you did. You came around to his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A strange scent in the air, again.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure it wasn't just Ryan?\" Luke asked. Sarah had been seeing a guy named Ryan Snowball. Yes, his last name was Snowball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat started after you left for the Blade realm. Your parents were worried at the time. But when you got home, you could confirm she was safe and sound. However, she was pregnant. As far as morality was concerned, your family didn't like that she did this out of wedlock. But your Mom needed something else to dwell on. Strangely enough, Papa's passing brought a little responsibility to them. They were planning on marrying, soon. It was the first addition into the family that no one except Sarah thought he should know about you. But Sarah being your sister made it a touchy issue. You didn't like him, his silver tongue was useless on you, as you could more than read his intentions. However, you... tolerated him, only because Sarah asked and your soon to be born Niece would need a Father, no matter how screwed up he was. That and Sarah loved him. Mom couldn't wait for the baby. It was a source of many jokes around the family, and Sarah knew not to tell him about you until they all approved. She didn't test that part, as she knew you were stronger than any argument she had to tell him. literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can smell him to.\" you joked back. \"But no, this is different. I've been picking it up for a little bit now. Strange thing is, I don't know what it is. Usually, I can at least determine if the scent is alive, dead, human, or something else. But this... it is off my radar completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something you can't detect?\" Luke asked, suddenly on guard. He knew, that if you couldn't do something, then it warranted supreme caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Duke can smell it to. Don't worry though, I don't think it is hostile. But best to be careful,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you are out here, just standing around? You are... what? Picking up the scent?\" Luke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Letting the wind bring it in. But I have yet to locate the source.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you just ask Eve and Drade to help?\" Luke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was an emergency, sure. But this isn't a clear threat. It is just my curiosity. I don't need to spy on everyone in the state just to cover that,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. Just be careful Bro.\" Luke said as he turned and went in the house. You nodded to him in an affirmative then stood again, trying to find and track the sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it might be faster if we just take a walk?\" Kelsey suggested, as she saw you and came close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose  you've sensed it too?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think? Worst part is, I think my Mom knows what it is. But she said that I should find and deal with it the first time without her help. But she never said I can't bring you...\" She answered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Let's go for a walk then,\" you relented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you beat the crap out of those 'vampires'?\" she asked. The Vampire Clan had teased you at a weak moment about Papa. You soundly defeated them, but had to erase their memories or suffer a publicity storm. You left in that they were not to tease you about such things again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but patched them up again. So brittle, and tiny, those people are,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could enthrall them if you want.\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you did that to every human that was an idiot, your house would burst with idiots. Besides, don't you want useful people?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you are right.\" She returned calmly. \"Besides, not like I want to kiss them anyway. Such closed minded idiots don't deserve to touch these lips,\" she finished as she brought her hand up and lightly caressed her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And way to young. What possible use could you have for a High School pimple popper like those guys?\" You asked, keeping the joke running as you both followed stronger wafts of scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could entertain myself for a few minutes. But they aren't nearly as good as someone with more power and experience.\" She said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both continued talking about different things that ranged from predatory preferences to your school work. Your human friends were also a topic, wondering if and when to let them in on your little secret... and hers. She didn't really see the point in letting random humans know. Although, she was getting increasingly fond of them. Unlike most in the school and your graduating class, they were a little more together. She even thought about letting them kiss her, when they asked. But she stopped herself, she liked them as friends, not as love slaved humans to her will. Although, as she matured, you could tell that the level of difficulty in restraining her body's urges were getting harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy stink! That is definitely it. That was like getting blasted by the scent.\" Kelsey stated as you were both hit hard by the scent you 2 were tracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, we are getting close...\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two of you searched the area. It was a type of park. Large in size and with many forms of recreation. There was a jungle gym, swings, and that sort of thing for little kids. Paths and benches for romantic walks and what not. Not to mention plenty of trees and cover in between. More than a few times there were people who partook in questionable activities in the cover of the park. But you didn't know what you'd find. Because of that, you two stuck together. You both had your senses fine tuned, so every heavy wave of this scent hit you both like a semi truck. It took a few hours to find the center, and it was well into the night. Good thing to, or the source would've seen you two coming. But with the dark aiding the two of you, it was simple to move and not be sensed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This boy is the scent?\" Kelsey asked, as if confirming what she was thinking. She was speaking in voice barely ranking as a whisper. Only you and other high ranking predators could hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the boy specifically. I can pick up his scent. HE, is most definitely human. But he is radiating the scent. If it goes on like all day, he should show us what he has been doing to produce such a scent very soon,\" you answered. Kelsey nodded as you both settled on a branch that overlook the small area the boy was in, but well hidden even from a predator's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy must've been no older than Isaac. Maybe 9 or 10 years old. He was panting heavily, as if he had just got done working out. You could smell the sweat, but not the grime that usually accompanied such an activity. You two observed as he got in a proper sitting position again with his hands out in front of him. He closed his eyes and began to speak in apparent gibberish. Even with all the languages you had heard, you had never heard this one before. Traveling to the realms and inside them, along with around the world and in classes at school, you didn't think you'd be completely baffled from communication, by a child no less. Then again, you were pretty young. You searched inside yourself to see if your Vampire instincts were telling you something. They didn't have anything either. Not like King, the Amarok, that your Vampire instincts told you to be extremely cautious about. Whatever and whomever this was, you didn't have a clue. Then something popped into your mind from movies... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, that isn't possible. If something like that existed, one of the former vampires would've seen something about it... unless they are doing the same thing Kelsey's mother is doing. In which case, they know, but is letting us find out by ourselves. I must be careful, we must be careful,' you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened to the words he was saying. Never being so lost in all your life. Both your eyes widened as a blue light emanated from his hands and began to shine over his body. His body rose from the ground like a levitation trick. Although, he was obviously not doing all that just to rise up a foot or so. As you both watched, you saw other things around the boy lifting as well. Then they began combining and separating until the wood, logs, leaves, and other things formed a new and fully intact tree in front of him. All the debris that one normally found on the forest floor, was gone. It had all gone to create this new tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" The boy said then crashed down to the ground, as he lost is concentration. \"Ow, that hurt. But who cares. They all said I was too young. Secret training complete and I proved them wrong. Magic isn't that hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he quickly got up and ran off excitedly from the spot. Leave the two of you, dumbstruck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just hear...?\" Kelsey started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you responded before she could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he just...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I dreaming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if compelled, you both made sure no one was around then went down to look at the tree the boy had made. You both circled it. It was by far the most healthy looking tree in the place. It was almost done with fall season, and this one was still in the midst of its green cycle. Not only that, but it smelled right to. Just a small hint of the scent that, apparently, was the scent of the kid's power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what we were smelling was...?\" Kelsey asked, still stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic energy? Is that even possible?\" You answered and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. If Kitsune can do a form of magic then there should be a breed of humans that the mage myth come from. But why is this such a secret? My Mom didn't say anything, she seemed afraid to do so. Your former Vampire knowledge also kept you in the dark.\" Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But I think we should at least see where this kid lives. We can confront him or his family later, when we know more. First step, see who and what he is... carefully.\" You stated and both of you nodded and left the magically made tree where it was, following the boy's scent. This was a lot easier than trying to follow his magic scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments you both were on his trail. You both kept back, inhumanly so. You didn't want whomever he was tied to finding you. If a small boy could do that, you shuddered to think what the others could do. Your Vampire side never said you were the biggest kid on the playground. Maybe, these magic humans were a threat so powerful that your Vampiric powers would be useless against. After all, if they could create a living tree, something you couldn't hope to do, they were likely to be able to do much, MUCH more. So you both followed him. The boy turned every once in a while. He seemed to sense you both were there, which was also bothering you. Did he know you were there. You, a Vampire, Ruler of the night by some, were detected by a little kid? But he was either too young to know that he was being followed, or he was just paranoid at being found out by whomever said he wasn't suppose to do that outside. Well he didn't say that. But it was obvious by the fact that this kid was the first scent of magic you had sensed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he came to a huge mansion, went in the gate. Kelsey was about to follow over the wall but you grabbed her and pulled her back far enough so you could  both talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you do that for?!\" She asked, confused and irritated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can sense something open and close when he went in the gate. I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take a chance on it being some kind of barrier that could, at the very least, alert them that we are here.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barriers? That is just...\" she started to which you just looked at her. \"... right. If magic exists, then why not magic barriers to. We at least know where the little dude lives. We should be careful. Let's go figure out what to do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. But don't say anything to others.\" You agreed and suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For whatever reason, they aren't allowed to say anything. On the off chance that they are in danger to that command, I don't want to put any pressure on them. We are meant to discover this by ourselves. That is what we should do.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learned that in the realms I suppose.\" Kelsey stated while crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had to learn something while in there...\" You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's go figure out what we are going to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You both thought about what you should do. After following the boy around, you both saw that their family went to your school, and even had a sister in your grade. Beth, she was actually in the locker right next to you. You had never sensed anything abnormal about her, and she never hinted she suspected you at all. But even if she didn't know something was up with you, she was hiding this magic thing so well that even you couldn't pick up on it. But either way, you thought it unwise to corner one of them at school. That would not put forward a very good image of you or Kelsey. So you decided, after a few weeks, to go to the mansion. If they were potential allies, then you needed to meet with the parents and leaders, not their children. That could happen afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Kelsey asked as you both stood outside the main door. You both had entered past the barrier. You both took extra care to suppress any abnormal things, so both of you were very human at the moment. You could feel the strange aura scanning you, at least that was what you thought it was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's just get this over with,\" you answered, still nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that knocked on the door firmly. There was no answer, but you could hear movement inside, so you knew they had to be doing something. But you couldn't use a bit of mist to investigate. Well you could, but you didn't know how they would react to that. You already knew that a small child of this house could do things you couldn't. What if they had more dangerous surprises in store for supernatural visitors. So you both waited patiently. Finally, the large door opened and you could sense another barrier lifting just from the entrance. You had to guess that there were charms, or something like that, over the house. Mainly to prevent things like you from getting in unannounced. The man that stood in front of you now looked like a butler of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, how can I help you?\" He greeted with a formal bow. Yep, definitely a butler of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry for intruding, but we were wondering if we could speak with Mr. Kohler... or Mrs. Kohler. We have concerns about their son, Tim.\" You stated, bowing back to him. Kelsey did likewise, but more so smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They asked not to be disturbed at the moment. However, as it involves Master Tim, I will inquire again. Please come in.\" He answered, opening the door for the two of you. He led you just inside into what looked like an area used to hold people waiting for the people inside to permit them access. \"Wait here while I inquire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both did as you were told. You might've been curious, but you had no intension on making these people angry, just because you couldn't follow simple directions. Kelsey seemed to be on the same wave length. You both just glanced around the room, but didn't move from the spot the butler left you two. You both could hear his footsteps as he went about his duty. Eventually, you heard footsteps returning, more of them. It was then that you sensed more people observing you, but not directly. It was a weird sensation. It was like the feeling you get when you just know you are being watched, but slightly amplified. Perhaps another form of magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening young man and young lady.\" Greeted an older man. He looked very distinguished but perhaps a bit arrogant. You hoped that wasn't a peek into his true nature. \"What is your names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelsey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Caleb and Kelsey, you have my attention, but I am understandably a very busy man. But I always make room for matters of my family. I am told you have concerns about my youngest boy, Tim?\" He asked as he stopped in front of the two of you in a proper but concentrated posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do. Um... how to put this... We were in the park a few weeks ago and we saw him do something rather... strange. Good, but strange.... actually it was quite beautiful to be honest. But we understand that if it caught our attention, you might want to know about it.\" Kelsey stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see?\" he asked, very attentive at this point. You were getting a bad feeling about this, and you could feel the strange aura get stronger around the two of you... well 3 of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't that sure what it was. But we can say what we saw.\" you suggested, he merely nodded for you to continue. \"We... well we were attracted by a bright blue light. We, followed it until we saw a young boy, later to be know as Tim, he was... well floating in midair. We thought that was strange to say the least, but then everything else started to float to. It all came together and made a most beautiful and healthy tree. At first we thought we were seeing things. But the tree was real and blooming, not like the falling nature that the rest of the trees were doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must've been drinking. Really, at your age?\" He stated in a quite arrogant tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir. Neither of us drink or do drugs or anything.\" Kelsey defended before you could stop her. The man had given you two a way out, and she just bashed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you think it is that he was doing?\" he asked, glaring at her, then you, and back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... We, hesitate to say, but we thought we were seeing Magic. We waited a few weeks just be sure we couldn't think of any other reasons that could work. We didn't want to just show up and accuse your son of doing something without exhausting all other options. But the more we thought on it, the more sure we were that it was magic. The tree still stands in the park. You can see for yourself if you wish. It is the only one still green in there.\" Kelsey continued. She didn't seem to sense the increase you were feeling or notice the narrowing of the man's eyes as she explained herself. It was a respectful was of bringing it forward, but if they were as bad as the feeling you were getting, then she was just digging a deeper hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it seems we have a problem, don't we?\" he asked as he looked at the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we came here to tell you that and to...\" You started, trying to manage the situation before it became to bad, But you, all of a sudden, were plunged into pain. Searing pain that gripped your whole body. You hadn't felt anything like this since that kid in the other realm almost killed you, to test you. But this wasn't destroying you, or stopping. \"Ah!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard enough of this, out of you two. We do not suffer those underneath us. We rule over them, and you.\" He stated as he chanted something then you and Kelsey's pain filled bodies began floating and moving. You both were still in unbearable pain, but he closed your ability to speak for the moment. You felt like releasing your powers to stop this intrusion, but your decision to be so human for this visit was backfiring. Whatever he was doing was keeping you from resisting him. It was clear though, that even with your full power, it would be hard to fight this guy. Magic, who knew that it could be this powerful, and harmful to you. But your concern was more so for Kelsey. Tears were streaming to deal with her pain. She must have been unable to change as well. \"You two will learn why it is very important that you NEVER speak of magic or its relation to us, EVER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point he brought you both down into a dungeon type place. You two were hooked up to machines and magic devices that stimulated painful points you never knew you had, especially as a Vampire. You now knew why your knowledge was sealed, and Kelsey's Mom was so scared. These people were overpowering you both without that much effort, and they weren't even using silver. If you ever dealt with them again in a fight. You would have to be completely released and sense the magic aura to anticipate attacks. But for now, many arrogant magic users came and tortured you two. Over the course of a month, you two were put through unimaginable pain, but not so much as to leave any evidence. They even cut off one of Kelsey's arms, then magically healed it, and did it again. That right there was enough for you to not want anything to do with them. They were spouting the entire time how superior they are in the world and the supremacy of magic over anything else. What was worse, they were nearly right. You were powerless and fading fast. You didn't know how long they could keep this up. But one thing was for certain as your perception dimmed and blurred. You were beginning to HATE magic, and magic users... but also fear them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Caleb, you should never have come here.\" said Beth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange. Everyone in their family was required to help with this. You didn't know if you should be even more repulsed or impressed. But for now, they had all tortured both you and Kelsey. Even little Tim did a little bit. He was restricted away from cutting or blood activities, but he still helped. All of them were very different than what you remembered in school... well Beth at least. She was on the Cheerleading squad with Kelsey. Sure she was always jealous of Kelsey for her looks, but she was otherwise smart and nice. Loads better then most of the other people in your grade. But here, she was just as arrogant as her father and family was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only 2 relatively good things about this situation. The first was that they hadn't discovered what either of you two were. You had a feeling that letting them know would only secure more torture and death. Kelsey seemed to be on the same thought pattern. You both also faked being brainwashed into what they were doing. Saved on torture time. The second was that you saw and filed each of her family. It wasn't as large as yours, but still decent. Thankfully, if you ever got out of there, you'd only run into Beth and possible Tim at school. The rest were in jobs and businesses around the state and country. This little incident also cemented your view on magic users. You wondered when you first thought about them if they could teach you magic. That was before all of this happened. Now, you didn't want anything to do with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do we have to do this?\" Beth asked another woman that were taking you down from a rack of sorts, then doing the same with Kelsey. They started dragging you two out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we got the worst practice scores.\" said the other. You were paralyzed at the moment and Kelsey was either in the same position or worse. You thought worse, because you could hear how labored her breaths were and other things in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that should matter. We get stuck taking out the trash. Why can't we just kill them again?\" Beth asked. They were letting you two go? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the would cause a murder investigation. This way, they are afraid enough never to bother us again, and never to tell anyone. Don't worry, this isn't the first time we've done this.\" The other said as they packed you two roughly into a van and drove off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold metal floor cut into your skin. You had a feeling that if you could, you would be passed out by now. Never thought the not sleeping perk would be a downside at any point. They continued to talk about how much of a pain it was and the fun they had with you two over the past weeks. But as the van stopped and you two were taken out, you began hearing a most welcomed sound. Howling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it strange how all the dogs have been acting?\" the other said as they dragged you and Kelsey to a hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding. Every dog and wolf in the state has been acting weird. Father says that their leader must be missing or hurt, something like that. I didn't know they all had one leader.\" Beth answered back as she dropped you on the ground by the hill, the other doing the same with Kelsey. It was a steep hill that they must've used before. It was perfect for dumping bodies. steep enough to force a roll, but no enough to outright kill the people being dumped. The bottom was right next to a small road, ensuring that someone would find the people... eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that is load of crap. Something is just around that is spooking them. Maybe it was Tim's little training.\" the other stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Beth agreed, then looked at the two of  you as they were ready to push down the hill. \"Not that either of you two can hear me but... serves you two right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that they both kicked you and Kelsey down the hill then drove off. You couldn't do anything, yet. Their magic still lingered, but you could hear Kelsey tumble as well. The sound of her rolling bad and snapping one of her limb bones was heard at least twice and then a thud as you both came to a stop. You so wanted to go to her and heal her. The ordeal was over, and you both were alive, barely. Kelsey was in bad shape. Your head was facing her and you could see her once smooth face riddled with new cuts and torture makes. Dirty and bloodied from this whole thing. You were too weak to turn away, and too week to look. This image of her like this did all the situation needed to make your view of mages as bad as it could get. But you were about to sleep, finally. But right before you could you heard the howling and barking get closer until you could see a few wolves around, and hear more than a dozen in the area. A few came by and started sniffing around then whining at your position, but not sure what to do with Kelsey. You had to make sure she was saved. They were wolves after all. While they were sworn off of you and your blood family, and as close as Kelsey was, her scent didn't show a blood connection to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...\" you started but was heaving blood as you spoke. This caught their attention. The largest one laid down and put his head close enough to you that his fur was touching your face, listening with rapt attention to what you had to say while the others seemed joyful that you were alive. \"T-take... us... home...p-please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all you could push out as, what seemed like, buckets of blood was pouring out of your mouth at each word. You would need to drink when you awoke, assuming that the spell wore off. Your last thought was the relief of hearing an affirmative howl from the wolves present. This meant that the ordeal was over, and Kelsey would make it home safe. It was a good day when you decided to spare and make friends with the k-9 nation. Speaking of which, you knew exactly what you would be doing when you woke up. Brad, he was going to be teaching you magic to combat these mages. You couldn't justify slaughtering them. But you would be damned if you were caught by them again. That, and they had made it clear that they wanted nothing good with you. That was ok, cause you wanted nothing to do with them either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but you eventually woke up, slowly, with a group around you. You were still weak, but you could feel your power again. You never thought you would be so eager for feeling your power again. You painfully moved your head to each side to check what was going on. You were in the basement of your house, in the meeting room, with you and Kelsey on beds, with your immediate family, her mother, Eve, and Brad there. They were all both relieved and worried when they saw you move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank the Lord you are ok.\" Mom said as she grasped your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Bro.\" Luke said as he put a long plastic straw in your mouth. You knew what it was, a straw to one of those hospital blood bags. You took it gratefully and started drinking . Most of it was gone as soon as it hit your stomach. You had loads of wounds to heal after all. But it kept coming and you kept drinking. It was human blood, and it was good. You kept going until you were both satisfied and healed, allowing you to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, before we go any further.\" Kelsey's Mother said and looked to her daughter. You could feel she was on the edge of death. This got you even more angry at the Mages, but for now you nodded and got up. You knelt down by her and started healing her as well. You had a bit of leftover blood in  your stomach, so it was all used up in this endeavor. Soon she gasped and shot up. She looked around frantically then at you. Before anything else she just pulled you in and clung to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it over?\" she asked through a new fountain of sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. We hare home, and we are safe.\" You answered her, hugging her back. She seemed to be just as stiff as you, as she protruded her full Succubus form as she embraced you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok you two.\" Said the voice of Eve.  She was huge and took up over half the room. Brad must've had to use magic to get her in there in the first place. But she was the closest predator to you and Kelsey. So you assumed she insisted on being here when you woke up. But you both could tell she was far from peaceful right now. \"Tell us what happened.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You two were suffering some ill effect of the past month or so. Mainly in what you should tell the room of concerned people. You had teleported everyone to King's area, so you could talk with him as well as bringing Drade into the mix. You didn't need to tell everyone, just those that were present. Besides, you had some questions for them. You and Kelsey laid out what happened, including little Tim's activities and the scent that had drawn you both to him. You told them about your vampire side not saying anything and your new hatred for magic users. You of course left those of them present that could use magic, like Brad and King, but you were visually upset about what and how these... people tortured the two of you. More so Kelsey. You could handle if they just tortured you, but Kelsey was another thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that is where you were?\" asked King. His huge deep voice rumbling those in attendance. This was Mom's first meeting with him, so to was most of the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, perhaps you could explain a few things King. Like why I was so helpless against their magic and not against yours or Brad's. Or why they seem to be more powerful then I am. And why no one warned us about it. Finally, how I can fight them if the push me again.\" You asked, still heated about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is simple to answer. They are not more powerful than you are.\" Brad started, everyone looked at him except King. \"Perhaps I should start with the order of things. You see, whomever is the Vampire is the most powerful in terms of raw power and accumulative abilities. However, the Vampire can't learn magic. It is nature's way of balancing it out. We couldn't teach you magic no matter how well we tried. And as such, you are extremely vulnerable to magic, more so than silver. But it does have its limits. Any of your abilities are stronger than a magic version. So if they were to throw a lightning bolt at you, and you shot one at them, yours would be leagues stronger. Same for the rest of your abilities. But they have many spells that you don't have abilities to counter. As to why theirs worked on you... it was because you weren't at full power. When you are at full power, you have a magic defense that is made by the effects your power is having on the area. NO magic can be used inside that area. But it tires you out when at full power, as you know. As to how you can beat them without going full power... you must strike before they can utter a word of their spells. If they do, you are screwed. Unlike me, they must use verbal enchantments and spells. But this also means they are stronger when cast. I could do that to, but the language is only known by those that have their particular magic aura. I wouldn't even understand it. As to why we didn't warn you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was because we didn't see the need.\" King stated, to which you looked at him very seriously. \"The Vampire of the age is never targeted if they are known. Not even mages are stupid enough to do it. Not because they can't defeat you, as you found out, they can. But because of the Reapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reapers?\" Kelsey asked. The others in the room were listening with either rapt attention or angered guilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look like a robed monster that's skin is almost stretched so thin around its skeleton that it does little to hide the bones. They smell like rotting flesh, because that is what they are. They are not sapient, only an instinctual creature drawn to their need to feed. And they only feed on one thing.\" King stated. Brad seemed to afraid to even speak about them. \"They feed on the life force of any that have magical energy. If they start feeding, only a withered barely alive husk is left. At that point, it is a mercy to kill the victims. Worse of all, they are impervious to abilities and magic, and almost all physical attacks. People that don't have magic energy can't see them. They are magic's enemy and mage's worst nightmare. That is why they are so well hidden. If a Reaper catches even a hint of magic energy, they swarm to feed on any and all that have magic in the area. They hunt and feed until none are left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I am actually starting to like these guys. But what do they have to do with me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" started King. \"A Reaper has no weaknesses except one, Vampire energy. If you were to even touch one, they would wither and die, turning into dust. So to any of your abilities and aura. That is why so many mythical beings live so close to whomever the Vampire is. A Reaper won't come anywhere near a Vampire and the moment they even catch a whiff of your scent, they tell the others and will go to the other side of the world as fast as they can. Not even stopping to eat or sleep. They are deathly afraid of you, literally. Meaning, that they are also deathly afraid of fallback. Any they feed on that are connected to you is more of a chance for you to hunt them. So any that they even think you are in contact with, they will steer clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if I would've told them what I was...?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would've begged you to forgive them. They still might if you reveal yourself,\" Brad answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you didn't.\" Eve stated to which you looked at her. \"The Mages have always been like that. If you had told them who you were, then you wouldn't have seen what they are like. Sure they could easily defeat you, Caleb, but they wouldn't dare. If they had succeeded in doing lasting damage or sealed you, Reapers would've sensed you were not protecting them and had a feast. They may be afraid of you for that reason, but the force their will on everyone else. Only thing stopping them from taking over main areas are the attracting Reapers and the Vampire's command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master.\" King said to which you looked to him. \"Your spider friend is right, but also to revenge based. Being linked to you, any k-9 in the pact with you is safe. It is obvious to me that you don't truly hate these people. If you were, Reapers would sense it. You think they would miss a chance to feast on people you wouldn't mind them eating. People with such an abundance of magic energy. They would swarm in the thousands if you did so. No, and I request that you not commit genocide because of this experience. They may not be your most valued group right now, but they do balance things out. If they weren't there to hinder rouge predators and monsters, we would have a much different and bloodier world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are saying I should protect them?\" You asked, obviously not liking the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO.\" King answered with a little more volume than was necessary. \"You need not protect them. If they use their power, they should expect Reapers to be drawn. That and they should know what a mistake they have made. Blindly attacking you, it is nearly unforgivable from all of us that rely on you. I can assure you that they will feel many factions move against them for this. The may be powerful, but not all powerful. While you are weak against them, some of us out there are not. Hell hounds for example. They repel magic. If you EVER are in need of them, you know how to summon them to you. We will also have them watch your family. But they can be outnumbered and beaten by the mages. Either way, you don't have to protect them like you do for us. But you shouldn't hate them so that they are free game either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" you stated, walking around as you thought on it. You had heard of Reapers in games and TV. Now it made sense why you had seen so many mythical beings so soon after changing. They were sticking around Mrs. Isibelle for protection. The Vampire clan also made sense. The Reapers wouldn't attack if they even expected a Vampire nearby. So having an organization like that protected a larger area of people. Also made sense why more creatures hadn't destroyed them yet... and why every one wanted to be on your side when they knew who you were... or what you were. It wasn't because you were all powerful or vastly more powerful than anyone else. The last month had made that painfully obvious. But at least you knew now that you didn't have to fear them either. In fact, even though they could kick your butt, they still feared you. \"What do you think Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...\" She started. She was a little nervous with so many high powered creatures looking to her. She was advising you on such a topic. They nor her took it lightly. But that was the way you liked it. You had done that a few times. Putting a vastly powerful creature's life in the hands of your human family. Made them more respected and honored. Even werewolves that hated humans had to brown nose your human family. \"... wiping them out, even indirectly, wouldn't be right. Papa would say for you to forgive and forget, just like the Bible says. But I know they went too far. While you should still try to do that, you should also allow them to deal with the consequences of their actions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You good with that Kelsey?\" You asked as she was the target of their recent torture and she was clearly still shaken by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you are there to protect me, I will be ok.\" She said, hoping that the Mages saw the connection from her to you, as a Vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, none of you will tell them who or what I am. Let them figure it out by themselves. I will not kill them, but I will not protect them either. The will need to find and apologize before I will come to their aid.\" You stated, they all seemed to agree that this was the best choice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt a little better about things. You thought that going back to school would only be a bad thing if Beth and her brother were still there. But if you truly were that value, and that you had Hellhounds at your command, you didn't have anything to worry about. Mrs. Dremer however, had decided to pull Kelsey out of school. She was still in the area, and she was getting homeschooled, but they both were to afraid of Mages to openly be exposed to them like Kelsey would be at school. Regardless of your feelings about them, this did not to the Mages any favors as far as your attitude toward them. You had been convinced not to hate them, or wipe them out, but you were even less likely to come to their aid now. You still didn't want anything to do with them. So you were torn as you walked to your locker. It was right next to Beth's. So you would have to put up with her. You half wanted to see her face when she saw you without the obvious scars that her family left you. If you hadn't healed, you'd be out of school for a while and covered with burns and cuts... not to mention they torched your hair off. But you were no different then before, and only a day after. But the other half of you didn't want to be anywhere near her. She couldn't do anything to you, and you were tempted to just tell her how big of a mistake she made. But you decided against that. She was insanely smart, she would notice something was up. If not right away, then when you summoned Hellhounds to protect you. To top it off, you had sped over to where you heard a Reaper was. It was as ugly, smelly, and frightening as they said it was. But it also was as fearful of you as they said. As soon as it smelled you, it didn't wait to finish its meal, it just took off as fast as it could with a horrendous scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" came a voice as you walked. There wasn't a lot of people in the school that would talk openly with you. Most of them weren't there yet. So you turned to see who it was. But when you saw Beth gazing in shock at you, it didn't need any  more attention than that. You just turned and walked away, leaving her to stand there shocked in the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you man?\" Colin asked as you got to your locker and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. I was visiting someone for charity work and it lasted longer than I thought.\" you answered. You knew that telling any more people about magic would only put them in danger, wither you were there or not. You didn't want yet another of your friends to leave school because of THEM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was Kelsey with you?\" Colin asked as you got your stuff and walked away before Beth could get there. You packed everything you needed, leaving the locker empty. You didn't want to deal with her in any fashion. But you knew she would be listening in on your conversations to make sure you didn't tell anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of. But her Mom pulled her out of school. It was a little drastic but that is what they decided.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean our group is without a hot girl, again?\" Colin asked, obviously bummed. You smiled at the compliment and made a note to let Kelsey know when you saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it. She might still come over by my place though, but not as often as before.\" you answered, this time with a little bit of a sad note. While it was safer, you didn't like that the one person that made a normal human day at school tolerable, was gone. You knew you could handle it, but it would be more draining without someone there to help. Maybe you could carry around a spider, no, that would be too weird and potentially problematic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to class and started your day. Thankfully, you only had one class with Beth, Gym. But she was on the opposite side and had no real way to interact with you while in that class. But seeing as the gym outfits showed your flawless body. You could see the confusion building. As you thought, she was a very smart girl. She definitely noticed that there would have to be a supernatural explanation for you not having any evidence of what her and her family did to you. But your avoiding her wasn't making it any easier for her to get answers. She tried to get close to you for some reason, but you would walk down busy halls just out of her sight line then teleport so she couldn't find you but got you to class. She must've had some rules, like not doing magic in the open. As you didn't sense her aura at all. You saw her waiting for you by your locker. Unfortunately for her, you had already emptied it earlier. You just dematerialized your supplies in your bag. So it would seem like you always had what you needed, despite the small size of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw you bypass her without giving her so much as a glance, she followed you. There was nothing you could do about that. On the way home, there wasn't any sudden corners you could lose her in. So you just walked normal and left her to ponder things. You weren't going to let her know you were watching her. That would only be seen as you being nervous around them, and her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis type of day continued for a while. At times, some of her family would join in watching you, at wrestling matches and such. You could feel them watching you and hear them talk about how something was wrong that they needed to discover. But you gave them no opportunity to see anything worth gawking at. It was wearing on Beth in particular. Sure Tim had come up to you and kicked you in the shin, but you didn't react to it. You just turned and walked away. You found that the worst thing to do to people like them, was to ignore them. Worst for them at least. You were nice to everyone else, and submissive at times. Like when the Vampire Clan did their thing and you did just enough to cause them to move along. But with them, you ignored them in a very cold fashion. Not so much as a glance in their direction. Some of your human friends noticed this, but they didn't really like her to begin with either. She was too popular, and even how hot she was, they thought of her as fake. Nice on the outside, and bad on the inside. If they only knew how right they were. But eventually she ran to corner you before the exit stairs after a wrestling match, where you were alone and she could talk more openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, we need to talk,\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You asked back, not letting emotion into your tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter? I said we need to talk, and you have to do what I say. Or do you want us to torture you again.\" She threatened. This was obviously her way of getting what she wanted from people their family had done this to. That got you to wonder how many people that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone,\" you sighed and walked the other way, toward the crowd of people from after the match. Usually you liked walking alone afterwards, but anything was better than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, I could always go after that loving family you have...\" She tacked on. This made you stop in your tracks. You didn't turn to face her, just stood there. If she had seen your face, she would've seen how mad you were getting. You needed to cool off before she made you do something you'd regret. \"Good. Now tell me, how did you heal so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find out yourself.\" you answered then started walking then stopped, catching a thought as you felt a magic aura start to form and her start to say a few phrases. You knew you had only a few moments to stop her before her spell was complete. You weren't about to expose yourself and you couldn't summon Hellhounds this close to normal humans. But you thought of another way that should scare her pretty bad. \"But the person that did told me something about you people. Something that, he says, will protect me from the likes of you and your family. He said, their are Reapers in the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a gasp and a sudden retraction of her magic aura. You were once again glad that you weren't turned around. Otherwise she would've seen your smirk. There was a Reaper in Wisconsin, but it was far enough away. So you told the truth, just not all of it. But that was enough to scare her so bad that you smelled sweat forming on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know about Reapers?\" She asked, whimpering as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much. He just said that with one so close, that your family wouldn't dare use your... gifts outside a shielded area. So as long as I don't go anywhere near that house of yours... I shouldn't be worried. But your family should, whatever that meant. Apparently whatever this \"Reaper\" thing is... it means something pretty bad for you and your people.\" You responded. You could feel her shaking. Wither she was out of self preservation, or for concern of her family, that was uncertain. But you didn't mind in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this person?\" she asked, on the verge of crying scared to warn the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I would tell you that. Go on and deal with whatever this is by yourselves. I guess I am glad I can't do whatever you all can do. If this \"Reaper\" comes by. It will only be doing me a favor. Then Kelsey can come back to school. Good luck with that.\" You finished then started walking again. She burst out the door and went off crying. For what reason, it was still up in the air to you. But you were glad she would leave you alone, for now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You almost laughed when you saw the Kohler's new attitude. Your little bluff actually worked. You didn't think that arrogant family would believe such a thing. They must REALLY be scared of Reapers. You couldn't really blame them. If those things were hunting you and you couldn't do anything about it, you would be pretty freaked out as well. But for now, you liked the space they were giving you. Beth tried to question you a few times. But you just told her to get lost or leave you alone. You might've talked with her, if she wasn't demanding you to answer her questions. She was nice to other people. You didn't know why she couldn't just suck it up and ask nicely. But no, she had to keep her pride. Probably got that from her Father. Oh, you were waiting for the day that they figured out what you were. But for now, you were dealing with something else. Something you put way higher than the Kohler's survival. To be fair, lots of things made that list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Caleb.\" Sarah begged. You had helped with her wedding. She was now Sarah Snowball and almost ready to pup out her kid. You had already offered to help with that, if she wished. She said no, and you agreed. That would just be too weird. But right now she was wanting to tell Ryan, her husband, about you and the family secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do understand how much danger you will be putting him in right? If he knows, he will be opened to my world. Worst of all, he will be a target for abnormal attacks. Since he doesn't share the Konel or Lon blood, those allies that we know may still harm him on accident, or in an attempt to keep their own tower of secrets.\" You warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the family didn't like him very much. He had a silver tongue, but he did nock up Sarah before marriage. But most of the family tended to leave it up to you if you wanted to tell more people about yourself. But they were NEVER to make that decision for you. If they wanted to tell someone, they had to approve it with you . While you were their family, and they trusted you, they knew that you were a Vampire with connections to multiple mythical beasts with different temperaments that protected you in strange ways at times. This was made obvious when one of your cousins told someone at school and a werewolf tore the throat out of the person. You took care of it for them, but it was just common place to have you decide such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. He needs to know. If little Cassandra needs your help, he needs to know that we should call you rather than the hospital. Plus, he is already wondering why I have so many scorpions around. I can't have them stink him, or him seeing a large one without him understanding why.\" Sarah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, bring him down.\" you relented. She kissed you on the cheek then went upstairs. She had to be careful with her 8 month pregnant belly, but she was doing well. You were downstairs in the meeting room at the moment. You had previously planned on finding a realm to visit over the summer. The TV was on and you had a stack of series to watch, but now you had to deal with Ryan. Soon she brought him down and they took their seats, after Sarah shut the door. Luckily no one wanted to sit through another one of these with you, especially with Ryan. Sometimes they got a kick out of people finding out about you and their reactions. \"Hey Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Caleb. Sarah said you could explain the scorpion thing?\" he asked jokingly, but with an aura of seriousness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scorpion thing?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I almost got stung this morning by a 2 foot long scorpion when I woke up. I almost called 911, but she just yelled at it and it went away. That was a bit weird to say the least. I said that she had to explain and she brought me to you.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Drade would be cross of I said anything without your or her say so.\" Sarah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. Last thing you need is getting on her bad side.\" you answered with a smirk then looked back at Ryan. \"What I am about to tell you is not to leave this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" he said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't. I mean it. This is very dangerous stuff. It will trump your little incident this morning by a long shot. If you so much as breathe it to anyone, dying will be the least of your worries. That is not a threat, it is reality, and one I can't protect you from.\" You pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a threat.\" Ryan argued. This was one of the silver tongue moments your family didn't like about him. He could guilt people into doing things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can think what you want. But this is not up for debate.\" You stated very seriously. He hadn't seen you use that tone before. Sarah was getting nervous but Ryan backed down. To be fair, he had no chance against you, in body or mind. \"Ok, what if I told you that we converse with mythical beings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Ryan asked. You simply looked at him without flinching. He looked at Sarah who nodded that you weren't kidding. He looked back to you to answer. \"I guess I would ask to see one, as proof if nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already are seeing one.\" you stated. He was obviously not getting it. You nodded for Sarah to move away from him. She did so and sat apart so he could deal with it. She would've helped him, but neither of you wanted to endanger the baby with his reaction. With the extra room, you turned full Vampire for him. He fell over and sprinted for the door. But you held it with your power. \"Calm yourself Ryan. If I wanted you dead, you would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" He asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You can't figure that out?\" You asked back as you reclined and waited for him to respond and calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a Vampire Ryan.\" Sarah stated in a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's is impossible.\" Ryan stated, not believing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said you could handle it. I could wipe your memory, but Sarah was begging me to let you in on our little family secret. In case you were wondering, I am the only one and no I can't turn you or any of them.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't wipe his memory.\" Sarah protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that I COULD, not that I WOULD.\" You clarified to which she backed off. You then retracted your Vampire look so he wasn't staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that scorpion was what, your pet?\" Ryan more accused than asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it was closer to Sarah's than mine,\" you answered. He looked at her the back to you as if for one of you to explain. \"I am friends with many mythical creatures. Including the queen of the Wisconsin territory or spiders and scorpions. Since they are friends of mine, some of them are friends with my family and protect them. They obey my family because the respect me. Sarah doesn't like spiders, so she opted for having scorpions protecting her. You must've done something for them to think you were a threat. But in order for you to be completely safe from them, you need to actually meet Drade, their queen. Sarah is on good terms, but if you react like this with her, she might sting you herself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we just get a dog or something?\" Ryan asked, trying to deal with the strangeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who would be on bug patrol?\" Sarah asked him to which he looked at her with a questioning look. \"ALL the spiders are gone from around our place. so if the scorpions weren't there, we would have quite the bug problem. Plus they are the ultimate security system. If a robber ever came in... not good for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, but why not a dog?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one...\" you started, so he looked over at you. \"... I am also in control of all k-9 species. Because of that, they would require my sister to be well protected. Scorpions are one of a few predator species that can defend against many things at once, superhuman or not. If you got a dog, they would require a werewolf or something to watch over her as well. Trust me, you may be nervous around Drade's children, but at least they don't hunger for your flesh... unless you prefer the werewolf option...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, stop teasing him.\" Sarah scolded as she saw his almost horrified expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just having a bit of fun.\" you said with a smirk then back to the task at hand. \"Usually, the requirement for this secret is for me to suck some of your blood. But I don't really want to do that right now. Unless I need to prove something to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't. I don't want to die or be turned!\" he exclaimed, or more begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeepers, this is going to take a while...\" you sighed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took almost all night to explain things to him. It didn't help that he freaked out at every little thing you did. Eventually Sarah had you suck her blood, just to show how safe it was. You brought some other people in; a few of Eve and Drade's children and a Hellhound. He needed to understand in case the Kohler's attacked them, what would happen. Eventually, with Sarah's help, he started to calm down and understand. At the moment, he heard and understood most of it... alone with why he needed to know and keep the secret. Sarah was back at his side, holding his hand and helping him deal with what he just found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel any better. The family took a while to except me when I was made the next Vampire.\" you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, your bite does feel good.\" He relented. He just couldn't believe that your bite was a good thing. So you bit him just on the wrist so he could see for himself. But it wasn't long. He wasn't exactly your favorite person. You didn't want him craving you to do it again. He was stupid enough to let you drain him, or beg you to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you get it,\" Sarah agreed and leaned into him. \"Now you also know why we all hold Caleb so highly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it makes more sense now,\" Ryan agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. You should probably meet Drade. Just so she could tell her children to leave you alone. The probably wont follow your commands, as that is a respect only for my blood family.\" you added as you stood and stretched. You had been sitting to explain this to him for a decent amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you just ask her?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she has to have your scent to pass on to her children.\" you answered, as if it was the most obvious thing for them all. \"Now let's see if I can get her to come here. Or we will have to go to her den. That might be a bit awkward for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded dumbly. He didn't really understand like Sarah did, but he sure as heck didn't want to be surrounded by lethal insects like he would in a scorpion's den. You mentally linked to Drade and had a quick conversation with her. She agreed to come and you held out your hand, drawing a portal for her to use. Ryan's eyes seemed to dazzle as you did this, but widen with fear as Drade started to come through. She barely fit in the room in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this room is too small Caleb.\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is this him?\" She asked as she snipped her pinchers as she inched forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is Ryan, Sarah's husband.\" You said as you moved to a neutral position next to her and them. Sarah was helping to keep Ryan from backing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you humans need only one husband is beyond me.\" She started. \"Sarah, are you sure about this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is nice and caring. Not to mention a good father for my little one on the way.\" She answered. Ryan seemed to calm when he saw her talk with her so openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that humans have a harder time giving birth, but have only sapient children. Congratulations.\" She said then put her conversation back to Ryan. \"I will say this quickly, human, so I can get out of this tight room as quickly as possible. I will have my children spare you and protect you. But you will not be in control of them unless they themselves like you. Cause I don't. But while you are connected to Caleb, through his sister, you will not be harmed. Break her heart and we will have a feast. UNDERSTOOD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes!\" he stuttered as Drade put a large pincer by his throat. She backed off when Sarah gave the appendage a whack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, Caleb, not that I am distressed in seeing you, but please send me back. This room is too small.\" She requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Thank you for taking the time out of your day.\" You answered as you opened a portal behind her so she could back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time. Always a pleasure.\" She said as she moved back into the portal. \"Remember what I said human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are all the mythical beings you are allied with like that?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much. To be honest, they don't really like you that much. Bluntly, nocking up Sarah was testing their tolerance. You see, they are very loyal and like to protect their friends. So you threatening one under their protection... not a good move. But while you are connected to Sarah, they shouldn't give you trouble.\" you answered as you sat back down, he did so as well... more like fell down. It was a lot to process at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about our children?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will have my blood in them, through my sibling, Sarah. Any with that distinction will be similar to Sarah in their safety and status with them. They can even play with scorpions, spiders, and all them and not be harmed. They will even be very good babysitters for you if you wish. Hard to beat protection from them. They will NEVER harm them. However there are rogue factions. But they end up dead quick enough\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to take a while to get used to.\" He sighed, finally relaxing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it will.\" you and Sarah said at the same time then started laughing. Even if you were a Vampire, it was obvious that you two were still sister and brother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassy, your new niece, was an awesome little ball of fun. Ryan was somewhat reserved about you to say the least. But a few demonstrations of why you were useful and helpful was all he needed to at least think of you as friendly. Particularly when Cassy was having a hard time, you were able to teleport over and calm her in seconds. That helped Sarah and him out immensely. She seemed to like you. And, as you predicted, she was playing with the scorpions in the house. A scary sight to anyone that didn't know she was safer with them than she was with almost anyone else. She was too young after all to know they were dangerous. She could spend hours trying to chase them around the floor. When she was crying they would tickle her or scuttle around in circles to make her laugh. Despite the largest one, around 4 feet long, scaring Ryan at times, he found them comforting with her. Sarah was also grateful for the help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn either case, it was summer time now. To be honest, you were wanting to get away. There was one good thing about the whole magic and Kohler threat. It kept all your minds off of Papa's death. This helped the grieving process along quite a bit. So now you were deciding where you were going. Unlike before, you had to pick rather than Mr. Vale picking before. You had watched hundreds of movies, shows, and such that some of your family had accompanied you with. Without Mr. Vale's help they wouldn't be able to watch you this time as you went in the realm. But they couldn't help but talk about how you would impact each one, or what you COULD do in each. Some were cartoons, some were full of drama, and some were too short to last all summer. You wanted to be gone for a majority of the summer. If not, it would give you too much time to think on the last year... and too much time for the Kohlers to find a way to get back at you. If you weren't even in this realm, then they couldn't do anything to you. You had to assume that they had some rule against attacking innocent people, even if they were your family. But, just in case, you ordered the Hellhounds to carefully watch ALL your family. But you couldn't decide where to go. So you left it up to your family. They had the room covered with the different titles you had watched. You could always go to the others they didn't pick later. But they were deciding now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the Twilight series?\" Dana asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would be interesting, but a lot of drama. Plus I would be tempted to kick all the vampire's teeth in. I did just spent the last summer helping out Blade you know?\" you answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they have werewolves in there to.\" Luke suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Always wondered if the realms were controlled by the same obedience factor that King put into play in this one. He said it would, but then again he never went into a fictional realm before.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, you think we could meet him again? He was really cool.\" Luke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but he doesn't like being disturbed. That one has a temper.\" You stated. You were being truthful. King was the one in that part of your life that was big, powerful, and influential enough to take a snap at even you while in one of his moods. He knew it wouldn't kill you, which is why he might do it. As for your family, he could keep them alive no matter what he did to them... well almost anything. So bothering him with small matters was not something you wanted to test. It was pushing it to have all of them meet him after the magic thing. But he let that one go. \"Though, I'll pass on your compliment next time I see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what about the Vampire Dairies?\" asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Twilight has too much drama, that one is going off the cliff. But it is up to you all.\" You answered, showing your dislike for it but also your acceptance if they picked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what about one that isn't Vampire. Like... the Avatar movie?\" Luke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be cool. I wonder what their blood tastes like...?\" You stated as you thought about it then thought about something else. \"Then again, maybe not. If the point is to learn from other Vampires than it would be a bust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could always do Hellsing.\" Luke put in, as he held up the other one he was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one would be cool. Hard part would be that they all kill Vampires on sight and Alucard could probably kick my butt.\" You answered. Strangely they liked that part of that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teen wolf?\" Sarah put up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Vampires, but lots of werewolves to order around. Might work.\" You said. Granted some of the series they were putting out you only watched a few episodes of, so they could have more to them than what you were thinking. Which is why you were leaving it up to them. Between all of them, they should be able to pick a good one. Knowing your luck though, they would pick one that exposes clueless nature with romantic things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord of the Rings?\" Isaac asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be cool.\" You said to make him feel like he came up with a good one. But the others knew that one didn't have Vampires or Werewolves in it... and it had magic. In retrospect from the rest of the year, that might not be a good choice... then again, maybe going full Vampire mode and slaughtering thousands of enemies might be the outlet you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went on for a while, talking about each choice and the perks. Sometimes they would think about how fun it would be to see you beat up some annoying person in a series or help out some of their favorite heroes. They seemed to forget that their \"heroes\" might find you as a threat that you would have to fight. You were still far to the good meter. But you couldn't predict what they did on the others side. Like the Blade series, more so at the end, you could end up changing the realm all together. So they continued until they found one. They showed you and you opened a portal. They all said their goodbyes. Kelsey gave you a little kiss on the cheek. She felt guilty for not being at school with you and now not being able to hang with you during the summer. So you promised her to spend time with her when you got back. She didn't like you leaving any more. But understood you needed an outlet and a break from the things you were going through. Unlike her, you didn't have another Vampire to help you get through things. For that you needed the other realms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... what realm did you end up going to???</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Really?\" you asked, hoping that they would change their mind. They just had to pick a drama and romantic realm for you to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. You'll have a blast, and to top it off... there is no magic or silver.\" Luke stated, not to into the first argument he put on. But knew that the no magic and silver option would make it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if you get in the way of Edward and Belle than I'll kick your butt when you get home.\" Kelsey stated, spoken like a true fan. Although you had a feeling that if she were going instead of you, she would be the first to hit on Edward or one of the other \"hot\" boys that the girls screamed over. She was a teen after all, succubus aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, like I need more reason to leave drama alone.\" you answered with a fake pout face on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun!\" Isaac said with a smile. He was getting older and saying things that were actually intelligent now. But still missed the hard parts of going. But the smile was appreciated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, have fun and come back.\" Mom agreed as she gave you a hug and kiss on the cheek. \"I know this one won't really be a challenge for you, but that is the point. I just wanted you to be able to have a break from all the stuff going on around here. So make it a nice long vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, love you Mom.\" You returned. Sure you loved the rest of your family. But she needed to hear it more than them. Unlike them, she was your Mother that just lost her husband. She needed all the \"I love you\" phrases as you and your siblings could push out. She returned the sentiment then you turned to Brad. \"You sure the werewolves on the other side will be bound like over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. The pact our kinds made with you isn't stopped by dimension. It translates to all of them and any that will be made in the future. You need not worry.\" Brad stated. You had stated that you didn't want to kill any werewolves on the other side. If you did, it would make you more likely to see the werewolves on this side as hostile. You didn't want to kill one on reflex and start a rift with them. \"Although, their individual attitudes and personality quirks will still be open. While they have to obey you and not harm you, they may be able to verbally assault you if they want. In a sense this isn't that bad. Otherwise they would know you right away when they start talking with you. Unless I miss my guess, you want to be disguised as a human for a little bit right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" you agreed with a smile. He smiled back. Regardless how old and smart he was, he was a Kitsune and wanted to please you. Like any animal, smart or not, he liked to please his master. Pride and all that. King would never admit it with others, but he liked it when you thanked him as well. \"Alright, I'm off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, have fun.\" They all said almost at the same time as you disappeared from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your first time traveling and doing this by yourself all the way through. So you were glad when the other end opened up and you stepped out into the well known town of Forks. Well for you anyway. You had just got done watching the whole series. Sure there was blind spots, but you got a hold of them quick enough. You didn't want to attract attention, so you severely restricted your scent and put a block up over aspects of yourself. You knew there were certain aspects that other people could detect. Specifically Vampires and Werewolves. So you made yourself a very convincing human. Not that you had anything to be afraid of in this realm. No magic and Silver wasn't a known weakness. Not to mention you could just walk into the sun to disprove any suspicions. But you didn't want to rock the boat too early either, relatively speaking. You walked around the town for a little bit before going to an real-estate agent. After a little hit and miss you were able to find a house in the forest that was far enough out of the werewolves and Vampire feeding areas. Well not really, because they unofficially owned it all. But a spot that was as good as you could get without drawing attention, or any more than you needed. As soon as  you moved in you felt a few wolves come around and check you out from a distance. You almost told them to get lost. They didn't even let you hunt. So you had to go back in town and get an unrestricted hunting license. That was good enough for now. You just had to hunt them the human way, for now. Finally you enrolled in the school and made sure to be in the main story plot class. You just needed to keep an eye on Belle. The Vampires could take care of themselves. But SHE was always getting in trouble. So you thought it wise to watch her. Of course they wouldn't know about it. You could watch her from across town with a mark you snuck on her. With everything set, you just lived and observed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there buddy.\" Said a police officer that had come by to make sure you were settled. aka Charlie Swan. Figures that it would be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sir.\" You answered back as you invited him and a man into your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you work quick. Last time I was out her you only had the framework up. It is almost all furnished at this point.\" He complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I worked hard on it.\" you stated. You were glad they allowed you to live alone. Like they had a choice in the matter. \"So what's with the visit this time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he started as you offered him a freshly brewed cup of coffee. It would look to suspicious if all you had was raw meat and blood around the house. So you gave what you could to other people and of course drained the blood for your own use. You had to be careful so the other nose sensitive people around wouldn't be able to smell it, along with the safe of hospital human blood that you kept in a safe and buried deep in the earth. You could just bring it up without any effort and it was way more secure than letting people see a huge safe and wonder what was inside it. For extra measure you ate regular food in front of them. It wasn't like you had to force yourself to eat normal food. You did it plenty at home. But you had loads of food at your home for you and others that came by. He accepted the cup and offered cookie. \"This is Billy Black by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello son.\" he greeted with a hand out. He was in a wheel chair at the moment. You smiled and shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you sir,\" you responded then offered some other things before sitting down at the table with them, drinking some coffee and eating a bagel for good measure. Billy seemed to relax when he saw this. Yep, worked like a charm. \"So what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've heard about those animal attacks haven't you?\" Charlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. I have been careful when hunting. Always keep an extra round or arrow to be sure.\" You answered and nodded to a wall where a hunting rifle and bow were held with any and all ammunition, including a few side arms that you had picked from your Blade days. They were low key enough to keep out in the open. Unless someone looked close, they seemed like ordinary, but impressive, handguns. \"Can't be too safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But this thing has already attacked a few grown adults already. I meant no disrespect son. Just checking on everyone, making sure you all are safe.\" He responded as Billy took a longer look at the weapons than back at you. He took a longer look at the bow. It was a good thing he didn't ask to see it. It was ordinary, except that the pounds were set at an inhuman difficult of pull. You wanted to make sure it could got through a Vampire. But this realm's Vampires had basically diamond skin. So it wouldn't really work. But perhaps the recoil would send them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is comforting that Forks has Officers like you that care so much. I am glad I moved here.\" You complimented to which he smiled. A well place compliment never hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, I like that. I really should introduce you to my daughter.\" He joked and Billy smiled at his friend's joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I already know her... that is... we are in the same class at school.\" You said in a way that made it seem you were agreeing and running with his joke, making him feel accomplished. In the back of your head you felt a few of the Vampires come by, see the police car, and leave. But you didn't let it show on your face. You had been keeping tabs on them so you knew what the story line was at that point. Also, you didn't want to confront them, so you had just enough interest to keep werewolves coming around. Kept them from attacking. Didn't want to kill them right away. Belle and Edward still had to bond with this whole thing, and that was a while off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Billy also had a quick question for you.\" He stated than turned things over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, usually we don't want people hunting in the area and all that. We are ok with a few deer and what not, but the amount you are doing, is bit much. We are hoping you would tone it down. We know with that unlimited license you can hunt everything on your land. We were just hoping you would be willing to tone it down a bit. Maybe 2 or 3 a month?\" Billy asked. Now you understood. Between you, the other vampires, and the werewolves it was getting a little too much to divvy up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I am sorry for taking too much.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks son. We appreciate it. You are a very nice young man.\" Billy responded with a happier attitude.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were getting in the swing of things. Belle didn't notice you much, although she did notice when they mentioned that you also \"transferred\" to that school. The only other person in the small rainy town that was new was not overlooked. But, compared to her, you didn't get a lot of attention. You might've had something to do with that, but not much. you couldn't use a lot of your abilities under threat of people finding out about you. Belle was just... well a hot girl. Sure you were hot to. Came with being a Vampire, and ripped. But you tried not to stand out. You knew that Edward would react if he couldn't read your mind. But you didn't really care. After all, you didn't smell nearly as good as Belle. Sure you put your scent at a human level, but not in the same league as Belle's. Even you had to admit, she was... mouth watering. So yeah, compared to her, you were almost invisible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently you were doing some work on your roof. It was constantly raining, and when it wasn't it looked like it would rain. It really stunk that water was one of the only elements you couldn't control. Made it hard to do outside work on your house. It wasn't like other places you'd been to where you kept training equipment outside and worked out in the sun to get a better work out. You had to build a shed for that. But it wasn't all bad. Anyway, you were making a perch point, kind of like a small patio on the top point of your house. On the surface it was a complicated spot only big enough for 5 people with a small roof to keep rain out. But there was no walls, it was completely open to the elements with benches that could swivel and retract so you could stand or sit in any direction with minimal things in the way. People got to it by a ladder from inside the house. What you were doing was waterproofing the door so it didn't leek into the house. It was then that you caught a scent of the other Vampires. They were buzzing around for a while, but for some reason the werewolves were elsewhere and since you were at the peak of your house, your scent could carry for a while. You had made the spot with that in mind. Well it was supposed to be so you could catch scents while not looking like you were doing it. But it worked both ways. They knew you were there, and you knew they were there. You wondered what their play would be. You weren't scheduled in the movie. So would they try to feed on you, or move on? Your question was answered as they started getting closer, faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello up there.\" Said the dark skinned one. You didn't care to remember his name when you were watching the movie. What, they only said his name like twice, so you didn't really pay attention. But he was the one that was the more sensible of the three. Maybe this was a game for them. But you tended to believe that they weren't stupid enough to attack you were your blood scent could travel to the wolves that they were avoiding. Which is why he was probably being so civil. Otherwise they probably would've bulldozed through your house to get at you. Another perk of your perch that you hadn't intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn't see you there. I'll be right down.\" you answered with a smile as you waved. You went like a normal human as the three of them waited where they were. You could read that they couldn't believe how \"easy\" this was. You almost laughed as they were about to find out how true that was, for you that is. You moved like a normal human, so they could hear you in the house. Then came to the door with 3 hospital bags of blood. You closed the door and locked it. The walls and doors looked normal to the eye. But everything had a think layer of titanium reinforcing the structure. Even you would have a hard time getting in. They looked at you strange as the saw and smelled what you were holding as you crossed the yard to them. When you were in the front yard, sort of speak, you tossed them each one. \"Took you long enough. Those are for your trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, it seems like you already know why we are here.\" The dark skinned one said while the other two observed you, James most of all. He had more of a play hunt face on. They looked at the blood sacks then dropped them, James stepping on his. You looked at it and gave an annoyed face. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't the easiest thing in the world to get those without looking suspicious. Plus, now the whole area smells like human blood. Thanks a lot.\" You responded, again in an annoyed posture. \"Really, would it have been that hard to just toss them back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we have a fresh source in front of us?\" Victoria stated in a antagonistic seductive voice as they got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet you seem to miss the point,\" you sighed as you figured one of them would've figured it out by now. But they were driven by blood and you did smell like a human. Maybe you could play the Vampire hunter card. You had watched and fought with Blade enough to pull it off. Even with faster versions like them. Their diamond skin would make it harder, but you had a few tricks you could use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\" James asked as they got within striking position of both you, as a human, and them. But they were more curious than thirsty at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. I know what you are, offer you human blood that I just happen to have laying around, and am not running away. You can hear my heart beat. Does it seem like I am bluffing?\" You asked as you spurred the conversation. You could see their minds start working on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have something on your side to help you.\" the dark skinned one said. You pushed for his name in your memory and found it; Laurent. \"But is it the false assumption that the werewolves will be back by the time we are done, or something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent question. How about I prove that I at least am competent and know who I am dealing with... Laurent, James, and Victoria. And you expect me to tell you if I have an edge before I use it? I am not that stupid. You make a move on me, and see what happens.\" you said, the first part was calm, the next was a clear challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" James said then shot a hand forward. You saw it coming from a mile away. But you had to be careful. You didn't want them to know, of all people. You had to do this as a believable human. So you moved at a human speed as you fed his arm passed you and used his momentum and a kick to the leg to flip him. While in midair the other two attacked. You deflected their blows in directions that had them hit James in places that hit pressure points. Allowing you to pin him on his stomach with them a few feet away. As you settled you drew your gun and aimed it at a point at the back of the neck. Sure they had tough skin. But the concussion of the shot would hit nerves that would render him paralyzed if you shot. You made your move obvious so they knew you had just beat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was overly predictable. If I shoot right now, sure your skin will deflect the bullet, but from this distance it will paralyze you long enough for me to ignite your body on fire and kill you.\" you stated as he stopped trying to get up under that threat. \"You idiots really think I would be stupid enough to come out to meet you without a way of leveling the odds in my favor. I am a well trained Vampire hunter and your three aren't even in my league. With all  your speed and strength, you have way too many faults, arrogance for one. Now, should I shoot and kill all three of you, or would you like to clean up the mess you made with the blood and leave, while you still can?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be bluffing.\" Victoria stated to which you flicked your thumb and cocked the hammer on the gun, finger twitching on the trigger, ready to fire. \"WAIT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stand off lasted for a little bit as they looked to each other. You didn't use any amount of strength, just a steadfast gaze and steady hand to drive your point home. Perhaps they thought you would start straining and move a little bit to give them an edge if they waited long enough. But when you didn't they had to think of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" James sputtered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You break your word and I'll kill you.\" you stated and backed off, still having the gun trained on the spot as you backed up. When he got us and joined the others you still had the gun trained on him. \"I do believe that the wolves will be back pretty soon. FYI\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wont forget this.\" James stated then raced off, the other two following closely behind as they heard howls coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, didn't even clean up. When they were out of range you had seconds to clean up the blood and the smell before the wolves were in range. By the time they came sniffing around you were back on your roof, working. They weren't confident enough to come into the open. \"They better no forget.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey,\" came a voice you didn't think you would be addressed by. It was Belle who said it and sat down in front of you. You had taken extra car not to stand out. More so to be sure that she developed the correct feelings for Edward. But you supposed that time had came already. She was now in love with him. Unlike him, you could still read her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi?\" you stated, not sure why she was talking with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to just plop down by you, but I needed a break and they say you just moved here to. I haven't seen you make any friends. Why is that?\" She asked. You didn't know why she was talking with you. Not that she was a bad person or anything. But you never thought of her as one to just strike up a conversation with someone like she was doing. Maybe she was drawn to greet you as the Vampire from another realm, wither she knew it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like being alone.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't.\" she stated then continued before you could say anything back. \"Look, I usually like that kind of thing to. But even I got depressed if NO ONE came to talk to me. No one to share your life with. That has to be hallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be a little draining at times.\" you agreed. \"So you just came over because... you know what I am going through or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, yeah.\" she answered. She was rather clumsy with her hidden emotions. Even if you couldn't read her mind, you could read her body language. \"Not that we are the same or anything. But you shouldn't be sitting here by yourself all the time, day after day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you suggesting?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about you stop eating alone. Come sit with us.\" She suggested and gestured over to where she and Edward were sitting. At this point she had to have learned his little secret. Maybe that was part of why she was being so casual with you. Or maybe she just had an instinct with Vampires. You weren't sure about exposing yourself to the Cullens yet. What if you made them biased against you? Well she was offering, and by the way Edward was looking at you, he already noticed your unreadable mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it will be ok? I don't want to bud into your time with Edward.\" you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, he didn't really like the idea. He doesn't even eat lunch or anything.\" She started. The way she said the last bit made it obvious that she knew about him at this point. Then again, the movie didn't share every hour of every day with you. It was even possible that she suggested this whole thing because he said something about not being able to read your mind either. \"But I can't just leave you over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. It appears you don't give up on things like this very easily. If you two need some time though. Just let me know. I don't want to get in the way.\" You agreed. You grabbed you lunch and headed over with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward, this is Caleb.\" she introduced. Funny, you didn't tell her your name. You peeked into her mind and just saw that she remembered it from the teacher's role call in class. \"Caleb, this is Edward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to meet you.\" you said as you stuck your hand out to shake. When he just looked at it you put it back down. You knew he wouldn't shake your hand, cold skin and all that. The point, for you, beyond being normally polite, was to show your flush hand. This would work in your favor as far as appearing normal. You sat down and took out your lunch. Nothing big, just a sandwich and chips with a milk bought at the cafeteria. You started eating politely. Edward seemed to be heavily observing you. You didn't give him anything to gawk at except a perfectly normal human... one that could repel his mind reading. \"Thanks for the invite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem.\" Edward stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Caleb, where did you move from?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wisconsin, you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arizona.\" She responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, hot and cold. No offense, but it looks like I came from down there an you came from up north.\" you stated in a clear joke. You didn't want them to think you were making fun of her. That would be a bad rep to start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been getting that a lot.\" she said a little bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure they mean well.\" Edward stated, wanting to get in on the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do.\" you and Belle said at the same time. You just looked at each other comically then laughed a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you live on your own?\" Edward asked, Belle's attention was peaked at this new form of question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My family couldn't follow me here. But they really wanted me to come. So they call every once in a while to make sure the school and stuff is ok. But they leave me be most of the time. I got a place right next to the reservation. Actually had a few of them from the Reservation come by. They were tracking that animal or whatever that was attacking people. You dad comes by to make sure I am ok to, Belle. He is a good guy, your Dad.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he is.\" She agreed. \"So... what do you like to do?\" She asked. It was like they were trying to find out things about you. You didn't mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was really into outside stuff. Working, athletics, hunting, and martial arts. The last one is more of a hobby than something I like doing. But it does come in handy.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like Karate and all that?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but more like mixed marital arts, but more formal.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if the guy is like insanely strong or fast. Does learning that stuff matter?\" Edward asked. Perhaps a more pride based question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it does. It doesn't matter how big, strong, or fast they are. They still weigh the same. Even if the guy could lift a truck, they still have weaknesses that martial arts can help find and exploit in a fight. I am not a master by any means. But I can hold my own well enough.\" you answered with a smile so that Belle didn't scold Edward for asking a more pointed question. They you all were interrupted by the school bell. \"I guess that is our cue. Is it cool if I do this again, eat lunch with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. I said it would be right?\" Belle answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did. I just wanted to make sure. See you both in class.\" You replied back then went off with a wave. You could hear them talk about you as you got out of range. I was good they didn't think you could hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure he is different?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not. I mean you can block me to, and you are a normal human.\" Edward returned. \"But we should still try to get some answers out of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we did just invite him to sit with us indefinitely.\" Belle stated.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You knew that the first movie wouldn't last much longer. You could either let things play out, or help when you could. Of course you wouldn't get in the way of Edward and Belle. That was basically the constant drama in this whole thing. But as far as communicating with the other vampires, you weren't sure if you should wait or bring it up. There wasn't really any way of saying it without them telling you to leave. After all, once they knew, you would be stuck with whatever they decided. Maybe it would be better if you save them from something. So you waited for when James was hunting Belle. It was pain staking, but they didn't mess with you anymore. Laurent actually came by and apologized, which you weren't ready for. But either way, you were watching them in full vampire hunter gear. You knew that traditional silver bullets wouldn't work. So you loaded them with explosive rounds and made sure to bring the sword. Just in case of situations like this, you made a very strong sword, that could definitely cut through these Vampires and then some. So with everything set you headed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had kept pretty good relations with both Edward and Belle through the \"friends\" title at school. Even if all they were doing was gathering information. It was impossible to talk all the time without having some genuine feelings of friendship. You made sure not to tread on any Belle issues that would anger Edward. You also kept a good relation with some of the tribes people in the reservation. Even Jacob came around. Mainly because you both had a level of friendship with Belle. It wasn't much, but you were able to get him comfortable around you... well as comfortable as a few meetings could get you, and most of them were with his dad. Either way, you were on good terms and ready to intervene as a Vampire hunter, later as a Vampire, when they were ready to talk to you about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Belle as she left the hotel and went to go meet James to save her mother that James had for the lure to his trap. Though, you knew, he never had her to begin with. You hid in the darkest corner with the best view and watched as things unfolded. You watched as Edward got there and started fighting. But when it got to the point where James was about to bite her in the arm, you weren't going to let that happen. So from one side of the room you shot a round and hit him smack in the forehead. The explosive round went off and pushed him back with a grunt. They all looked to see you as you came into the light, gun trained on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I tell you to not do that?\" You stated then let loose your fully automatic pistol. He smiled as he thought they wouldn't be much effect and just let them come as he bent down to get at Belle again. But that was his mistake as the explosive rounds impacted and made him go flying across the room and into the wall. Normally a vampire of their type would be strong enough to resist it after a few hits. But you aimed at him so he was off the ground and so each one sent him flying, without the ground to stabilize himself. Belle looked at the action then back at you in shock as you got closer. Not firing anymore, but still having both of your guns trained at where James had landed. Edward rushed over to her, not sure if he should thank or attack you. \"Hey guys. Funny the people you run into out here isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb? W-what are you doing here?\" Belle asked as you stopped by them, Edward still highly defensive but trying to hold Belle. That was something you didn't get. He had to sense James was still able to attack and he lowers his guard. Stupid boy, and he was older than you, much older. You responded first with a sigh as you holstered your guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, tail you and blast a vampire in the face to keep him from biting you and that is the thanks I get.\" you said comically with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were following me?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh. That guy isn't as nearly good as he thinks he is, and you always seem to be hip deep in trouble.\" You said, again comically then snapped your head to an approaching James. Edward hissed at him, protectively holding Belle. \"I got this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even know what you are dealing with?\" Edward countered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a dumb question. No, I got no idea. I just happen to have fully automatic pistols loaded with explosive rounds and walked into a room full of vampires by mistake.\" you answered sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explosive rounds, is that what you used?\" James asked as he faced you. You had moved a little forward so not to get Belle and Edward involved with your fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I know perfectly well that normal bullets don't do more than tickle you guys. So, I packed a something with a little more kick. It worked quite well to separate you from Belle. But to finish you, it requires something a little more lethal,\" you answered. To that you pulled your sword from your back sheath. Katana in shape and design with a little Vampire help in its construction. You stood in a ready stance facing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" He asked as he started to move closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come and find out. Or are you afraid of the weak human? Here, I'll make it easier for you.\" You stated then cut yourself and threw some blood at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just missed and went onto the floor. But it was enough to get him excited. By this time, the other Vampires just got there. But it was too late to stop him from bolting toward you with his hand ready to enclose around your neck. You still moved at a human speed, and he didn't dodge when you swung at him. Granted, a normal sword would've snapped like a twig. But it wasn't, so when you made contact you sliced him completely in half. He split and laid on the ground, in shock of what just happened. One moment he was attacking a human, and next he was in two pieces. You went over to him and flipped him over. You threw a lighter that Blade helped you make at his lower half. Like the one he used in the first movie of the Blade series. His legs erupted his lower half. you then looked at him with your sword pointed at his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made the same mistake as before. You want to know what your big fault is? You Vampires are too arrogant. How could a little human defeat you. That sword will snap in two. Well, evidence to you in two pieces, you aren't that good. Your arrogance killed you, I was just the tool.\" you stated and made a slash as he tried to get at you, cutting his arms off and head in one slice. Then you started walking over to a very stunned group of vampires. Casually tossing another lighter over your shoulder that made James' upper half pieces burst into flames as well. You flicked your sword to get any gunk off of it then sheathed it. You didn't stop until you were directly in front of Belle, the rest were standing over Edward as he held her. \"I assume you are the good guys right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah, I guess.\" Said Alice as the others were to stunned to do more than stare at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good to hear. Sorry to hog the fight. Didn't think you all would mind. But I didn't leave any of the fun for you guys.\" you said with a smile but the last bit with a slightly worried look. You didn't know if they wanted some retribution for what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was... amazing, for a human.\" Carlisle answered as he gained his composure and smiled like he usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you liked that, you are going to love this,\" you stated then knelt down and looked at Belle. \"With your permission?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Edward demanded for her, he was still a bit protective, understandably so. Adding the whole drama angle and he was like a powder keg ready to blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing bad, I promise.\" you assured. \"If I wanted to do her harm, I could've just let him bite her, or shot her instead of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" She said to which you smiled a little then reached down to her broken and bleeding leg. She winced as you put a hand on the skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may sting a little, but only for a second.\" you warned. She nodded then you got to work. They watched in stunned silence as she winced while her bone mended and her wounds started to heal like nothing had happened. You did it slowly so they had time to observe. Otherwise you would be plagued with even more questions. When you were done you stood and backed up a little to give her room. \"Sorry, nothing I can do about the blood loss, stains, and ruined clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you...?\" Edward started before helping Belle to her feet. She still had to deal with the blood loss. But at least she wasn't in any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later. That took a bit out of me. I would like to get home and get a good rest before divulging in a game of 20 questions.\" You suggested then looked at Belle. \"Plus you look like you are about to fall asleep. Blood loss can be a pain can't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" she answered, not sure what to say after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you need a ride home?\" Carlisle asked as the others tried to coupe with the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice.\" you answered. You had shown them enough to get their feet wet, but weren't sure about showing them more. So you followed him as he led the way. You read that they at least accepted that their questions would come and be answered later. That was good enough for now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They took you back to their house instead. You were too tired to argue. While you didn't use a lot of power, you were running kind of low to begin with. You had kept it down so that it was easier to seal your powers and scent. But now it was getting a little tiring. So you allowed them to drive you to their place and slept on their couch for a time. It felt weird, but you felt safe there. Usually you didn't feel like that with strangers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast!\" exclaimed Alice as she brought in an omelet and set it on a table that was next to the couch you were waking from. In your sleepy state you accepted out of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said and ate the egg dish. You were surprised at the taste. It was... rather good. \"Mmm.... those were great, thank you very much. Didn't know you all could cook like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We learned a few things over our years. Between all of us, we were able to make one.\" Carlisle said. You glanced around for a moment and he guessed what or who you were looking for. \"Belle went home. She needed to deal with some things with her Father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess she does.\" you sighed as you placed the plate on the table and sat back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was rather amazing what you did.\" Edward stated as they sat to talk with you. Jasper was a bit on edge, like he usually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" You asked, not sure if he meant your fight or healing Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've never met a human with such abilities. How did you attain them?\" Rosalie asked, more forcibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither have I.\" you said after a little pause. They looked at you in a strange manner. \"While everything I did was well within a human's abilities, if they train, I myself am not human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... you smell human.\" Emmette said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about now?\" You asked as you let go your Vampire scent. You saw them react but knew that your scent was different to any of the Realm's vampire scents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" Jasper asked, now gazing at you with rapt attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" You asked rhetorically. They were still not getting it, so you reached into your attached canteen and unscrewed the cap. They could definitely smell the blood and you chugged the whole thing in 4 seconds flat, licking some that escaped. \"Ah... much better. Haven't drank anything for... 4 months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be.\" Rosalie said in shocked awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?\" Edward asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? The drinking blood part. Real simple, in the mouth and down to the stomach. Why, it works different for you?\" You joked. It took a moment to catch before Alice burst out laughing. They seemed to join in a little bit as the tension started to lift. You guessed that if Alice didn't see anything in the future for them to worry about, then they tended to relax. So getting on her good side was evidently a must have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really one of us, a vampire that it?\" asked Esme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Got me there. But also a little different, as you probably guessed by this point. To start, I have a tan.\" You answered casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah, how do you manage that?\" Emmette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, sit out in the sun for a few hours then there you go.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are hilarious, a total riot.\" He said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try. Look, no offense, but you aren't going to understand most of what I can and can't do. You'll just have to trust me on that. Also trust that I am here to help and not to cause that much trouble.\" You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try us, we might surprise you.\" Carlisle responded as they all sat back down from the shocked stances they were just in. You guessed that being vampires lessened the shock a bit. A couple hundred years under their belt probably also helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you asked. Here's a few; I can walk in daylight with no visible effects, I can fly, I can bite people and not turn them... uh more accurately I CAN'T turn them even if I wanted to, I have healing saliva to help heal feeding holes, retractable fangs,... uh, should I continue?\" You asked as you saw them try to take in what you were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Retractable fangs?\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can fly?\" Emmette asked almost right on top of Alice's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are incapable of turning people?\" Carlisle asked a second after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showed your fangs then retracted them to answer the first question, then floated a little before settling on the couch again. \"Now to answer the other question. That is correct. My bite is different. It actually feels good. Good enough for the prey to want me to drink them dry if prolonged, but I wouldn't be able to leave teeth marks or turn them, even if I wanted to, which I don't. Downside is that I have to drink actual blood. No synthetic stuff. But I can also drink from animals and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels good?\" Rosalie asked with obvious doubt. You just held out your hand. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can drink from vampires to. You want to see what it feels like, I can show you. Your diamond like skin may be a bit tougher than I am used to, but not the hardest thing I've bit through.\" you offered. She retracted then looked around then thought about it for a second before giving you her wrist. You slowly brought it up, grew your fangs, and dug in. Her head threw back with ecstasy and immediately pushed your head into her arm. But you let go and force past her grip. She looked like she was going to overdose on blushing as he body dealt with your bite. Her white skin turned a shade of red in parts. The rest of them didn't know how to react. \"Told you so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... it was...\" she stuttered out before wiping some blood away from her arm. They didn't have much, if at all. But you could suck up other things all the same. You didn't have to. The sensory projection was the same, so she still felt it all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeepers, you react worse than humans do.\" you almost sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feed on humans?\" Carlisle asked then looked to Rosalie again. \"She is going to be ok right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will be fine. My bite stimulates all the pleasure receptors in the body. The longer I bite, the more they want me to continue. You saw how she held me to continue. As far as hunting is concerned, it is to help the blood flow go faster and cooperation of the prey, animal or person. As for feeding on humans, only if they are truly willing. I NEVER force it. Since I can't turn them and there are no scars, the only downside is a lack of blood.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am not sure what to do about you.\" Carlisle said to which it was your turn to give a confused look. \"You seem safe enough to have around, if not very useful. Having you on our side would be a good thing, both as allies and friends. Problem is that we have a treaty with the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Werewolves right?\" you finished for him. They looked at you as if to ask how you knew. \"Not that hard do figure out, and even easier to smell them. They don't know about me yet. For the near future I can just pass as a human. Already had a few of them over and they haven't suspected anything. As for later, when I introduce myself, that wont be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Carlisle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I have an understanding with a VERY powerful k-9 that keeps me safe from any and all dog like creatures, mythical or not, including werewolves. I can't really say more, yet. But end result, they won't be a problem for me.\" You answered casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right.\" Alice said then paused before finishing. \"You don't make any sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled and laughed. Conversations started and finished about them and you. You refrained from letting them know their realm and its relation to you. But you were free to talk about other things. They were particularly entertained when you told them about Kelsey, Eve, and Drade. You sidestepped the magic topic though. No reason to bring it up if there wasn't any here. That and this was suppose to be vacation for you. Away from all that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No kidding, you can really do that?\" Belle asked as you, her, and Edward walked through the woods. It was her birthday and was really not liking all the attention. Since you had a little more insight into what was going on, you understood what was bothering her. But you just materialized a protection disc for her. You made it with a considerable amount of fire energy in it. It turned the otherwise clear diamond into a flame designed ruby in the shape of a silver dollar in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all you do when a hostile vampire grabs you is stick that on their skin and want them dead. They will burst into ashes.\" You answered to which she fingered it. \"So if Edward ever gets on your nerves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't even joke about that!\" She exclaimed but knew you were joking, along with Edward. She slugged you in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, careful, I'm fragile.\" You joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, I might think you are hitting on my girl.\" Edward chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that is fair. Even if daffy duck came over here and started whacking you with his mallet, you'd still be first on her list. Eternal love and all that.\" you said back. They both seemed to like that. You all went on until you all saw a wolf, not one of the werewolf packs. Both of them stopped. \"Don't worry, he's not here to harm us and not anything we should worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, speak for yourself tan boy\" Edward stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it isn't like I can tell him to heel or anything\" Belle added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to?\" You asked as the wolf rose its head and looked at you 3. It growled at Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the things I control is ALL k-9 like animals. There are some really cool mythical ones out there. See watch.\" you answered then whistled a short burst, kneeling down to call the wolf over. It heard  you and happily came over without question. Both Belle and Edward shrunk back a little as it came back. Edward wasn't scared, he just didn't want to start something with the werewolves. Smart, but this was obviously not one of them. The wolf was a completely white one and really quite beautiful. It came right next to you and leaned into you to give it some attention. \"Good girl. See, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you can't do?\" Belle asked as she kept her distance. You saw that they weren't going to get anywhere near the wolf, so you gave it a few pats then sent it on its way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, loads of stuff. For starters, I can't do squat with water. You already know I can't turn anyone. I may have perks, but there is downsides to.\" You answered as you rid yourself of the dog scent. \"The impressive one here is you Belle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" She almost coughed out, obviously not believing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You are surrounded by all of us and rather than judge us, you just accept us. You got to be the most hospitable person I know... well other than my mother. Anyway, not a lot of humans say, \"Yeah, that guy can suck all my blood out. I should hang around with him.\" You are one in a million Belle.\" you stated as  you walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but even I will wither away.\" She said, obviously still pushing the whole turning her thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really worried about that right now?\" You got a few years before you need to worry about such things. But I'll make you a deal. I may not be able to turn you. But if you get to the age of... say 25, I will use my power to stop you from ageing. How does that sound?\" You asked. This offer caught them both off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! You can really do that?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I could turn you 80 years old right now if you wanted. Personally I think you got a little more filling out before you should hit he stop button. A few more inches taller and other features would do you some good. That and if they end up turning you when you look that much older than Edward, you get to pull little boy jokes on him.\" You answered in a casual manner, ending in a joke to smooth things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you could just keep her from aging? There is no reason to turn her if that is the case.\" Edward stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can keep her from LOOKING older. She will still get older. Regardless of how she looks, sapient species can only live so long. Her mind will start to go and there is nothing I can do about it. She would be an old woman in a young woman's shell. That and I won't be around forever. No, the only way to have Belle stick around for more than... say 100 years is to turn her to something that lives longer than that, Vampires being one.\" you answered. \"I just offered so that her aesthetic appearance doesn't go further than she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks. I probably will take  you up on that offer one day.\" Belle said as she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hey, the point of that little offer was to keep you from worrying. Today is your special day. So have fun.\" You interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. We have to be at the house in a little bit. Caleb, do you mind taking us to the car?\" Edward agreed, latching onto the Belle subject, and making her happy the way she is. With that you just held out your hand. They had been through your teleporting a few times and knew just to hold your hand. They did so, in a second they were back to their cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is never going to get old.\" Belle gasped. You smiled at the compliment as they took their hands back. You all made your ways to the house where Belle's part was happening. It was a good time, until Belle cut herself, making a few things happen in quick succession, ending in belle being thrown out of the way and caught by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks for catching me.\" She replied as Jasper was taken out of the room... or house to be more accurate. \"Well, maybe you could stop this cut from bleeding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you responded then licked it. She retracted her finger as if fearful. \"Sorry, was quicker that way. No reason to waste energy on the healing aura if a simple lick could do the trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry.\" She said as you two separated. \"Guess it is just habit with everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try to keep her blood outside of your body.\" Edward almost commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know I would never harm her.\" you battled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sure.\" Edward responded then led Belle away. You looked after them then looked at the only other person remaining in the room. \"What I do this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is just a bit touchy. We all know how good she smells. Tasting her blood is like kissing her, to him at least.\" Carlisle explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does things have to be so drama filled?\" You asked out loud as you rubbed your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the way things are. But it was good that you were there to catch her. You are really great to have around.\" He responded back then went on to console the others. You just plopped into a chair, utterly confused. You knew this realm was full of drama, but come on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Did you really have to destroy her like that?\" You asked as the Cullens came to your home to talk with you about leaving Forks. He had just told you about what he just did to Belle. Of course you knew what he actually said from the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am protecting her, from us, and those after us.\" Edward stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that will work.\" you said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Carlisle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, destroying her mentally is just the same as doing it physically. There were loads of better ways to say it and you know it. Second, if they really wanted to hurt you, they wouldn't attack your group in blind rage. If I were doing it, and I was as weak as they are, I would attack Belle so you notice, then kill you when you go off to morn in your own way. That would destroy you and get revenge at the same time. They might even get lucky and you'd take your own life. As in love as you two are.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saying leaving is a bad idea?\" Emmette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is up to you. Not a horrible idea, just the way he handled it could've been better. As for the age excuse, that is a cop out and you know it. But I won't float around this with you guys. If you think the best way is to leave, then do it. I'll stick around here and protect her like I have been. I probably should go retrieve her from the forest. Knowing her, she probably ran after you and fell over in a drama filled hysteria.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are going to stay here?\" Carlisle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I moved here for a reason. I'm not about to just leave. Plus, I still have to introduce myself to the werewolves. I'll probably do that while you all are gone.\" You answered in a tone that indicated that they shouldn't press it any further, cause you weren't going to budge. They had already said their peace on you conversing with the werewolves. But you stood firm and told them to back off when they got heated... except Carlisle. Although reserved, he was more ok with it than the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll not go after her?\" Edward asked. You knew he meant romantically speaking, not for her blood, which you knew not to touch all to well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't have to.\" you answered and he looked at you intensely. \"Pardon the aesthetic observation, but she is pretty good looking and you know it. She is in high school and is friends with Jacob, a pretty good looking guy as well. You think so to, or you wouldn't have reacted when they are just talking. So, you really think that she will have a hard time finding someone else to keep her company. You have my word that I will not \"pursue her\" and I will protect her from harm... well the lethal kind anyway. But as for her love life, that I stay clear of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but what are you talking about \"lethal kind\"?\" He asked, catching that part and knowing you were right about the other parts... but not wanting to dwell on or admit to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well everyone has to learn things for themselves. That and if someone else is protecting her and will save her from something, I'll let them. As long as she isn't going to die or lose a limb, I'll back off a little. She needs to live her life, not a sheltered version of it.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thank you for that.\" Carlisle budded in, knowing that Edward was getting worked up. He wanted things HIS way. The fact that he could push his way on you wasn't a good feeling for him. Drama, what are you going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. She's a friend to all of us. I wouldn't want anything happening to her any more than any of you. Still wouldn't hurt for you, Alice, to keep an eye on things. With all my abilities, yours isn't one of them.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, but I was going to do that anyway.\" She replied, nervously playing with her fingers. \"I worry about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all do.\" Edward added in, needing to get his little say in the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Now, I should probably go find Belle. Her father probably already called a search party for her. Hope you all have a wonderful trip, and be safe.\" you ended, then waved as you walked off. They were needing to go as well. They waved back and off you were to find Belle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take you long as you had your glyph on her and so you just teleported to her. She was unconscious and just lying there, crying in her sleep. You carefully picked her up and headed to her house. The way you figured, it didn't really matter if they found her or you did. So you sped back, avoiding the werewolves easily and slowing down near her house so the wolves observing didn't get suspicious. You pretended like you didn't see them as you carried her. Finally you broke out right where they would've. You didn't even have to say anything, as they saw you coming and carrying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle!\" Mr. Swan exclaimed as he reached for her and you passed her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's alright, just unconscious.\" You reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you find her?\" Jacob asked as Mr. Swan nodded his thanks and immediately started carrying her inside. You didn't mind, he was rather worried, and her father. You wouldn't fault him for seeing to his own daughter rather than thanking you properly. Besides, a thought and a head nod was all you really needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know I go running in the woods. I found her at the end of my run path. Don't know why she was out there, but she was already out cold. The spot was just as far from here as it was from my place, so I just brought her here. Didn't know she was gone long enough to warrant this kind of search party though.\" You answered as you glanced around him to look at the people that had gathered. \"You know she does go out in the woods often? Not like she didn't know where she was going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how did she end up alone and knocked out?\" Jake asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok big guy. I didn't mean anything by it. I was just saying that her being in the woods for a day isn't abnormal. But you are right, something must've happened to her. Not many scratches on her, so not attacked. Maybe mental. We wont know till she talks about it.\" You relented, making him feel like he had thought of it. He did, kind of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" he ended with, looking into the woods at the wolves. Most couldn't see them, so you didn't react. But you knew he was looking at them. You thought about waiting for him to emerge before saying anything to them about you. But that was for later. For now, it was Belle management time. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The normal plot line must've had a stronger pull than you thought it did. You were a pretty big change to the whole thing. Having a Vampire she could talk to should've helped. But she never accepted even your glance. She just wanted to be alone. That and, you were right, Edward had messed with her pretty good. It didn't help that she was the other side to the drama. But you had come up with all these. excuses why you were still there, why he left. You couldn't just tell her that he was coming back, eventually. Because if you did, then she wouldn't do all those dangerous things, and Edward wouldn't figure out he had to come back in the end. Not to mention she wouldn't have figured out Jake's little secret. You still didn't know when you were going to talk with Jake and his people. Just showing up would be possible, but not very polite. Then again, being so deep in their territory was not polite either. Either way, she progressed like she did in the movie. She stayed away from you as she hung out with Jake and did the Bike thing. She went on her little date with him. You were still watching her. But with Jake and the wolves around, there was no way to do it from location. You had to use the glyph as a radar of sorts. All things considered, you weren't expecting to have her coming to your house one night. You went to the knocking door, opened it to find Belle standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she said, looking a little guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, didn't think you wanted to hang with me.\" You replied, but not in an angered tone, more a questioning one. She looked away then back, as if she thought of something and decided to just stick it out. \"I'm not going to read your mind Belle. So, you want to come in and talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said to which you ushered her in and shut the door. You led her to your sitting room. She knew her way around your house, from being there with Edward a few times. She sat on your couch and you sat next to her. \"You know Jake right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He and his dad come over every once in a blue moon. Usually to check on me or address something I did wrong on near their preserve and \"on their land\", stuff like that. Jacob is a cool guy, if a little infatuated with you.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me and him were hanging out for a while. Just keeping my mind off of... Edward and all that. The reason I didn't come by you was... well because you being a... like him. It was just too much of a reminder.\" She stuttered around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I wasn't going to push you,\" you replied back. \"So, you saying the \"were\" word in there means that Jake ditched you to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\" She asked. You almost forgot how sensitive she was about people prying, despite being the one who pries the most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that glyph I have on you? Well, I can use it as a radar. I still feel like keeping an eye on you. But watching  you directly was definitely to intrusive. I can't see everything like I would if I was there. But I still can sense other people around you and all that.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I guess that makes sense. Well as much sense as any of the other things you do.\" she joked which brought a smirk to your lips. \"What is with me and hanging out with guys that leave me with the connection that they SHOULDN'T ever see me again? He said we shouldn't be friends. Same thing, more or less, that Edward said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't touch that drama stuff. But you are right. You do have a knack for that kind of thing. You also have a knack for meeting non-human friends. Do you have a troll at home that I don't know about or something?\" You joked back, looking under her coat comically, as if looking for a pixy or something. She whacked your hand away with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little bit you just let her vent on you. You offered to help calm her down. But she said she needed to deal with this. You were glad she said that. Even though you could use your powers on her. It was kind of like doing it on Dracula, from Blade's realm. It was insanely hard compared to others. You had to assume it was her shield ability. Yet another ability that you couldn't do to save your life. But, like the other abilities around here, it wasn't able to hamper you to an amount that qualified as effecting you. Edward's mind read couldn't get you either. You wondered about the other Vampire's abilities. But  you would find that out soon enough. For now it was about her. She vented about Edward, her letters to Alice, Jacob, her Father, her being alone, her treatment of you, other people's treatment of her, Her age... again, and a few more drama filled topics. Eventually she told you about being able to see Edward when she was in danger. That is when she pulled something on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, could you do me a favor?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends what the favor is.\" you answered back. Since it came right on the heels of being in danger,  you didn't like where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you drink from me?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you said rather bluntly, that of which caught her off guard a bit. Even if you said something serious you had allways spoke with a gentle or otherwise positive tone and feel. That answer didn't have that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" She asked, obviously wanting you to get to a scenario that she could see Edward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one, I promised both you and Edward I wouldn't. Even if he isn't here, I keep my promises. Second, he knows I wouldn't harm you. So your little plan wouldn't work, because you wouldn't be in danger. Third, I don't like being used as a peep window to see someone else. If you want to be around me, please at least act like it.\" you answered and requested. She thought on your answer before responding. Her little idea not working out for her. \"If it makes you feel any better. I gave Edward a lecture when they came to get me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They came fore you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They thought that having ANY vampires around would put you in danger. But I can cover my scent rather well. So their arguments were hallow. Carlisle seemed to understand. In the end that was enough.\" You responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, that does make me feel better. At least someone gave him a tongue lashing.\" She said after thinking on it for a little bit. \"Thanks for talking with me... and not sucking my blood too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Now, I know you have a few ideas about how to get a rush. Just promise me you will TRY to be careful?\" You more requested then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will try. But the point of it isn't to be completely safe.\" she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. Not like I would let you die anyway.\" You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... you like me that much?\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Keep it up vampire girl.\" You teased back. She whacked you for the shot while smiling a little bit. You knew that she wanted to become a Vampire. So calling her one was just a comical jest on your part. You both hoped she was better, and hoped you hadn't screwed up the story line that much. But looking at how the story seemed to self fix itself all the time, you doubted you could put that much of a dent in it, unless  you really put some effort into it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't really know when you were going to talk with the werewolves, still. But fate rarely falls upon us at the moment of our choosing. You were observing Belle as she went to go talk to Jake after his little visit in her room. You were tailing her after that. Which was harder to do and not have the wolves notice you. She knocked on their door and Mr. Black came to answer her. Typical Belle, she barged in wither she was allowed or not. She must have a homing device for super powered secrets. She got pissed about the whole Sam pack thing. But she was blind to what was right in front of her as she confronted Sam and the others. She was handling it just like you knew and saw she would. But when she punched one in the face and he transformed, despite Sam's order to calm down, it caught your attention. She began running and Jake appeared, facing him off. Belle was there just watching in horror. You were hesitant, but decided to bud in. A quick teleport and you were right next to Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH! Be silent.\" you commanded. There was definitely a difference between when you spoke to k-9 type things and when you were ordering them. This was the latter. They all cringed as they had no choice than to obey you. You stared them down, and gave a glance to Jake then helped Belle to her feet. \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" she started then looked over at the wolves, some transformed, some not. \"How did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you already, remember?\" You asked as you stimulated her memory in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them to?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL means ALL. Don't worry, I've been trying to figure out a time to meet with them anyway. I did say I'd protect you right?\" You assured and answered and brushed some hair out of her face. \"I got to go talk to them now. They give you any trouble, let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her nod you separated from her and went over to them and went in front of Sam, then looked at Jake more directly, then back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Sam more demanded then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This conversation is better had without such an audience. You and Jake should do.\" you suggested. He huffed for a few breaths then ordered the others to take Belle somewhere else. You nodded to her to go. You needed to speak with them. When the three of you were alone, and Jake was back to human form... with some shorts on, you continued. \"My name is Caleb. I do believe you guys have been watching my place for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, now how are you able to command us, and appear out of thin air. I am the Alpha here, not you.\" Sam asked forcibly. He obviously didn't like his authority being challenged by anything or anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was given the authority and protection by King, an Amarok and ruler of all k-9 races. He said ALL would be effected, wither they knew him and me or not. Guess he was right. As for how I appeared, I teleported to Belle's side when she was in danger.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleporting?\" Jacob asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou teleported behind them to prove it. \"Yeah, teleporting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do that?\" Sam asked, spinning around to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do a lot of things. Then next part will get you pretty defensive, so just be cool alright?\" You warned. He took a breath, as did Jacob, then nodded in that way he usually addressed other people \"lower\" than he was. \"I am a Vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are what?!\" He recoiled as you said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Vampire. You know, blood sucker, long teeth, red eyes, and all that. Jeepers, I though you guys were suppose to have good hearing.\" You joked back. It helped a little, but not so much with Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stand there rather confident, seeing as what you just admitted to, and knowing what we do to the vampires that aren't Cullens around here.\" Jacob stated, a noticeable hostile tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, like you guys could do anything against me anyway. Even if you could, King had decreed that NO k-9 like creature will harm me and will obey me regardless on their feelings on the matter. I could kill you and order you to just take it if I wished. But that is not why I am here. I am here to introduce myself. Granted I planned to do it in a more peaceful manner, but I can't allow Belle to be harmed.\" You answered back. They weren't too keen on the whole supremacy thing. But they seemed to gauge and understand it, for now at least.</span></div></div>",

They particularly liked the Vampire hunter part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, even if I wanted to I physically can't.\" you answered with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you still hang with the Cullens?\" Asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. They are one of very few vampires in this realm that are halfway decent, particularly Carisle. He seams very sensible. He would have to be, to keep his head working at a hospital. Plus, no need to burn bridges.\" you answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that you all reached the door where everyone else was. They looked you over when you entered, last. Belle was still standing as she was talking with them. But they all stood when you entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I don't smell that bad, do I?\" You asked, as you knew this realm's vampires did smell a little bit worse than normal ones. Kind of like a rank version of sterile, it that was even possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to, THEM, you smell amazing. But your Vampire scent still sets off some alarms.\" Sam informed as he hugged Emily. You looked at her, then at her scar. \"She doesn't like when people do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. I was just... I don't suppose you would want me to... heal that, or is it to early to suggest?\" You asked. All of their jaws seamed to drop. \"I mean I would understand if you don't want a Vampire doing anything to your all. I was just offering. Being me may be complicated, but it has its advantages.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you could?\" Asked one of the others in the room. They had only heard part of your story, but even Sam who had heard it all was in shock at this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Shouldn't be too hard. Of all the things to heal, skin is by far the easiest.\" you answered with a smile, trying to smooth things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, are you sure you should've suggested that?\" Belle asked, sensing the difference of moods in the room. This whole werewolf thing was new to her, so she wasn't sure if this change was good or bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, to be honest. I was just trying to be nice, but they might've not appreciated a Vampire wanting to alter someone they know and care for, even if it is just healing.\" You answered softly to her, knowing full well that they could hear you, but said it softly enough so they thought you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it really work?\" Sam asked, after talking with Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, watch.\" you answered as you pointed to your own face and distorted it worse than her scars then back to your normal look. \"It feels a little weird, but it is really easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can help, would appreciate it.\" Emily said, after Sam gave her a nod. She walked over to you with Sam and was shaking a little as you rose your finger up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, It wont hurt at all. Just feel a little weird. Like an ant crawling on your skin.\" you assured then touched her. She closed her eyes and quivered a little as her skin began to move and heal. Sam seemed to go bug eyed as he saw her face going back, and even reducing in age slightly. When you were done you removed your hand and finger from her face. She took a minute but then opened her eyes. \"See, didn't hurt a bit did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, felt kind of... good.\" She revealed, but she got a new face when she turned to see the other's reaction to her newly healed face. Saying that their jaws were dropped would be an understatement. She was then worried and went to fetch a mirror from the counter. She held it up and almost dropped it as she glanced at herself. Her hand went up and tears rolled down as she felt her unblemished face. She was a beauty to be sure, and even though she didn't blame Sam for the scars before, something could be said for its return to its glorious and kept state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that means I did a good job?\" You asked as they stared at her, and for the first time in a while, she didn't mind the staring. She went back over to you and just hugged you. You joked and coughed as if she was squeezing the life out of you. But the joke was obvious, turning everyone's shock and stunned faces to a smiling and partially laughing one. She then let go and hugged into Sam, burying her face in his chest. \"I guess that is a yes then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, that was a yes.\" Sam clarified but took Emily into the other room to be alone with her. Jacob caught Belle's attention and they went to go talk with each other while leaving you with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you mind if I join you guys?\" You asked as they dumbly kicked out a chair you could use. You sat and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing.\" Paul stated and the others agreed. \"So... we heard you were a Vampire slayer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eavesdropping were we?\" You teased then continued to their mischievous smirks. \"You wolves and your sensitive ears. Anyway, yes I use to be a Vampire Slayer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many did you kill? Bet we have gotten close,\" asked Embry prideful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"13,456... I think. There might've been a few more, but I can't count the assists.\" You answered after comically counting them on your fingers as  you thought about it. Again, their jaws dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, we will never touch that.\" Embry admitted, to which they all cracked up laughing and the conversations started in earnest. Some demonstrations and some stories on both aspects of you them and you. Maybe it had something to do with King's decree, but it had turned out incredibly easy to gain their confidence. Healing Emily might've also helped a little.</span></div></div>",

After all, they can't just ignore a Vampire like me. One more powerful than they are.\" You answered as Alice and Belle came to your house. They had asked you if you would help them save Edward. You were tempted to just have her call Edward. That would save a whole lot of headaches. But then future events wouldn't be preserved. Showing yourself to the Volturi would be the only way at that point. Since they don't allow humans to know about them and just get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just...\" Belle started but stopped as you waved her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say I wouldn't. I was just giving you one last chance to back out if this course of action. The way it is, I will have to power up to just get you there. I've never teleported across continents before... well not at this distance at least.\" you said, looking at her then at Alice. \"This is your world to, what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I would like to keep your identify a secret, saving a life must come before secrecy, don't you agree?\" She asked, knowing your answer. After all, you had told them about your rule on taking life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, just a sec.\" you answered and went to a sealed fridge you kept some of your human blood. You grabbed a few packs and started drinking from one right away. You burned it as you finished, holding the another while the rest went in your pocket. You then held out your hand to them. \"Let's go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Caleb. This means a lot to me.\" Belle responded as she put her hand on yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. I guess it wont be the most terrible thing in the world to rip on some arrogant vampire leaders. They are always fun to screw with.\" You answered as you waited for Alice to join her hand. They seamed to smile at your comment. Normally Alice would probably advise you on how dangerous it would be to do so. But then again, she had been told how powerful you are, shown, and she could see the future. \"Hold your breath.\" you said and as soon as they did you all were off. It was quite a trip and you were right to assume you needed the extra power. If it was just you then you wouldn't. But doing it for so long and safely for both Vampire and Human was not a picnic. So you drank the blood you had in your hand, as well as an extra on the way. For them it was a few seconds and you were all in a city full of red robed people. They were about to thank you when you ducked behind a building, gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb? What's wrong?\" Belle asked, a little bit nervous. Alice was also concerned but not as vocal about it. They found you digging into the remaining blood bags you brought with you. For a second your eyes were their glowing red and your fangs had protruded. The intense nature of your full Vampire form wasn't something they'd seen. Like that, it was near impossible to look nonthreatening. They drew back at the sight, but it was only a second as your features went back to human, wiping the residual blood off your lips and licking that up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. I didn't think that would happen. Maybe that was the birth of the traveling over water weakness legend puts on Vampires. That took a whole lot out of me.\" You said then stood straight and stretched a bit. \"All better now, all the same though, we should take a plane on the way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no argument here.\" Alice agreed as they relaxed. \"Now, we have someone to talk down, don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's go.\" Belle agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that you three moved through the crowd, Alice leading the way. Since you all weren't cutting time, there was a little more time to play with. More than enough to make it to the door Edward was just walking out to expose himself. When he opened it, Belle lost all self-control and dove into his arms. They did their little drama thing while you and Alice came in and locked the door behind you. You made it a point to appear human. No need to make waves, if they didn't. Ironically, things happened just like the movie. Strange how that pull was still active. You were a pretty big anomaly in this plot point. But you were all led through the halls and into the main chamber by Jana all the same. Conversations continued on topics like they should. You didn't really care until they started threatening Belle. Their threats to you weren't even noticed, and you didn't react to them. But unlike the movie, Edward didn't attack as soon as they started threatening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what is the point of threatening us?\" You asked in a comically manner. One Edward didn't necessarily approve of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Aro asked as they already seamed to have already decided to kill you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, you really think Belle will remain a human when in love with Edward? Come now, you all aren't that blind to such things are you? First love, then protection, then doing stupid stuff for each other.... like Edward's insistence to kill himself if she died. After that they get joined in one manner or another. How long do you think the age topic will come up and the fear of being separated will last before they fix that problem?\" You asked as you drew out the logic of such a relationship clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, she will be one of us. I have seen it,\" Alice said as she came forward in the conversation. \"Even if I have to change her myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out her hand so Aro could see the future with Belle being a Vampire. Afterwards he drew back and looked intently at Belle, then at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an immortal your abilities will create...\" Aro stated to Belle then looked to you. \"But what of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of me?\" you asked plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Belle seems to have a future with us, but you have yet to describe why you will. Have you also fallen in love with one of our kind?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I am just here to make sure no one harms Belle. If you will allow, that is all I need say.\" you answered, stimulating a sense of honor in their minds but not sure how well it would hold. They could decide to attack, in which case you would have to show your nature. Or they could take hold of your influence and accept you as a support for Belle, a future Vampire.</span></div></div>",

You say you have no intension of becoming one of us?\" He asked in a confrontational tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a manner of speaking...\" you answered then looked to Belle and the others. \"You guys might want to leave now. Your business is done here and I would rather you not get caught up in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... right. We'll see you outside then?\" Belle agreed and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I just need to explain things to them. The short and sweat version should suffice for them don't you think?\" You asked back with a smile. They smiled back and left, with the Volturi's blessing. You followed them until the door slammed close then set up a very strong barrier around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what were you going to explain to us?\" Aro asked as if taunting you, a pretty accurate assumption. \"Sending away your only protection, that wasn't the smartest move you could make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I need their protection. Not that it would be much use anyway. Two vampires verses all of you, while protecting Belle and me. Not a very fair fight on their part. I would rather they not be touched by this little situation we have here.\" you answered with a default smile on then got into a serious glare at Aro. \"But if you think I willingly surrounded myself by you all and not accounted for this.... and a way out, then you are dumber than you look. I would choose your next moves and words carefully, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, interesting.\" Aro replied as he recoiled slightly from what you said. It was clear that he liked being in control, but even more so informed about everything. While you appeared to be a normal human to his eyes, you were right. Even if it was a bluff, to his eyes, the uncertainty was not something he enjoyed. He turned and walked a distance away then turned to address you and the room. Turning to the two young looking ones... \"Jane, would you be so kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pain.\" She said simply as she gazed at you. You felt something happening to you, but your blood blocked it away. It seamed there were many abilities in this realm that you would never be able to do. But your pure vampire blood also acted as a shield that they couldn't touch. Kind of like it was an intense flame and their abilities were dried leaves. They could still use them against you, unlike the werewolves, but their attempts didn't even register before they were burned up before getting anywhere near you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be the pain illusion girl. I am afraid you will find me harder to entrance than anyone you have ever faced before,\" you stated at a leisurely pace and tone then looked at the three that were on the steps ahead of you. \"That was your free shot, next one might cost you. But you can try, as long as I have your word that you will keep the Cullens, Belle, and the fine people of Forks out of your sights because of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that we need your permission, but we will agree to that, as a last request.\" Aro stated then looked to someone behind you. He came rushing toward you with a pretty insane speed, aiming a hand toward your head and/or neck. At the last second you stepped to the side and put an arm out, effectively clotheslining him. While he remained airborne you gave him a spin kick that Blade had shown you, sending him crashing into a wall on the other end of the room, settling in a calm posture like before glaring at the 3 surprised vampires that made up the leadership. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, he was very fast, even for one of you. But not fast enough I am afraid.\" You said, turning from your serious demeanor and going to a sarcastically smiling tone instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" Marcus asked timidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I tell you that? It is so much more fun letting you guess,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then...\" Aro replied then gave a signal to which 10 Vampires came at you. But you were visibly not worried. If you and Blade were able to take out a couple hundred in one night, 10 was barely felt as a threat. They reached you all at nearly the same time. You thought about how to defeat them. But the simple way would be just to use Kaname's power. So you rose your hand and brought them off their feet as well, letting them float there for a few seconds, then sending them into the walls. You didn't need them dead, just educated in how futile their attempts were. At that point, a black fog like power enveloped you. You sighed at this, which seamed to amuse them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This power of yours is troublesome. But what making me unaware of my surroundings is dangerous, for you that is. What if I miss and hit someone I shouldn't?\" You asked as you shot a little static bolt in a random direction. You didn't need a full on lightning bolt. For a show, a thick static one was good enough. The fog dispersed immediately and you saw your bolt had got mere inches away from Aro's head, melting the stone behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible? No human can do these things.\" Aro stated, freaking out a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, I never said I was human. You just assumed that. So far, I have restrained from seriously wounding any of you. Can't say my patience will last forever though.\" You replied then let loose your scent and a little bit of your power, making a vortex of power to surround you. You also used some flames to mix and cycle in the mix, making you look like a DBZ character powering up. But you weren't that powerful, it was just aesthetic that you hoped they wouldn't push. \"If you are through playing at a low level, I can get serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey braced back and took out a few things to protect themselves. One of them took out a sword, which you used your energy to slice in half from that distance. Some pulled out a pipe or knives, same thing happened. You just stood in the center with your arms folded in boredom. To be fair, this was a little less than your idle power level. They seamed finally scared. Maybe your protruded fangs and glowing red eyes had something to do with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We yield!\" Exclaimed Aro as none could do more than brace back, and definitely didn't think about attacking, after seeing what you did to the weapons they took out. With that you reduced and retracted your power, appearing like you did prior to the display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good. I would hate to have to start fighting you all. I'm not to into taking people's life if I can help it, human or otherwise.\" You answered with the same sarcastic smile you were using with them from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you not tell me you were one of us?\" Aro asked, confused... and frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am not one of you. I am a different type of Vampire all together.\" you answered then sliced your finger so blood could come out. \"See, for starters, I can bleed. Yeah, not like you at all, but I am a Vampire so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will you join in our feast?\" he offered. You knew, even without reading his mind, that he was referring to the humans outside the door right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you are offering your neck with them, then no. I said it before, but maybe you need me to say it again. I don't enjoy taking of sapient life. Vampire, human, werewolf, or whatever else. But if you would like me to change, then perhaps you were volunteering?\" You asked to which he took a step back with an obvious \"no\" answer. \"Didn't think so. While I will.... tolerate your habit, don't expect me to follow your example or rule, or condone it. Now, if there is nothing else, I would like to get going before I am tempted to do something foolish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, go with out blessing young one.\" Aro agreed as he gestured for the door and you took down the barrier. You bowed to them then turned and walked to the door, but stopped when they were about to open it, to which the flinched and stopped. \"Is there something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that... I will be keeping you to your word about harming the Cullens, Belle, or those at Forks. Break your word in any manner and will break you.\" you warned then pulled the door open with your power and walked out, allowing the light to hit you and show how different you were before proceeding past the waiting humans and toward the door where Alice, Belle, and Edward were waiting. You kept going until you met up with them. \"Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are done? They let you go?\" Edward asked, surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... talked about it.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fast.\" Alice commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left out the complicated parts. They will leave me and us alone. Now, how about we get home already?\" You answered and suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Belle answered and followed Alice as you all made for the airport. She was definitely a strange one. She was in a building full of vampires. Her best friends were Vampires, humans, and werewolves. Then again, you had little room to talk. But at least you could hold your own if you needed to. She was just... vulnerable, very much so. You were admiring her strength for this reason. She was even better with weird stuff that you were, which was saying a lot. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacob wasn't too happy to say the least about Edward's return. But you stayed out of it. Even when he asked. Their romantic triangle thing, yeah, that was not something you wanted to be a part of, even indirectly. As long as they didn't kill each other, you didn't care that much. And you knew that Belle was more than capable of keeping the two sides. In her own way, she was more valuable than any of them were. Not only for her relationship with Jacob and Edward, but for her ability to be a neutral ground between the two sides. No one wanted to hurt her, so no one fought each other seriously in that respect. But now was a meeting about changing Belle. She had called the meeting and they went around the room voting on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...?\" Belle asked you, as you were the last one to say your piece. Edward seamed to be begging you to say something against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find this pointless.\" You answered to which they all seamed shocked for different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Carlisle asked for them, as he was the first to get his voice back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward wants to be with her forever and she feels the same, only way that will happen is if she gets turned. Each of you have a desire to keep her around one way or another. Even if there is something to be said about turning people in general as far as morality, it is overruled by the fact that SHE came to you about it, and not as a spur of the moment thing. She isn't going to change her mind, and that is painfully obvious. She didn't turn against you all when she found out what you were, what Jacob was, what you all do, and the danger she is and will always be in. Even if she must remain a human, she doesn't look like she will leave in anything other than a body bag. Even if that were to happen, I am sure she would find some way to haunt the people that harmed you all and to still be with Edward. She is one stubborn woman.\" You started to which she smiled at that last part as your tone was more comical than anything. The others were thinking about it and nodding at your points. \"Personally, other than the first little bit of rejections, becoming a Vampire was the best thing I've ever done. Sure there are downsides but nothing that would make me regret it. As much evil a Vampire is capable of, we also have an almost endless amount of time to do good as well. I can tell, that Belle, you will be a vampire even if you have to force one of them to bite you. In that light, no point arguing about it. If she is going to become one, the only way to influence it, is to agree and take it one step at a time. There is no rush. You will have all of your very long life to dwell and you are not even close to being over your prime yet. SO.... pointless. She will become a Vampire. What you need to decide is how she will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make a good point.\" Alice stated with a smile. Belle seamed to be smiling ear to ear. She already knew, from her visions, that Belle would be one. Perks of being her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot.\" Belle said as she gave you a huge and a kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No swet.\" you responded as she went over to an emotionally conflicted Edward. He didn't know if he should be glaring at you or nodding his thanks. \"But Belle, Edward is right about a few things. Being a Vampire, while exhilarating and far lasting. Your love will last and all that, especially since you have the feelings as a human. They will amplify as a Vampire, when you turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good isn't it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Imagine how you felt when he was going to die. It is obvious that either of you will give your life for the other. But the level you will be at when you turn... if he were to nobly give his life for you. Wither it be tomorrow or a thousand years from now, you will be utterly devastated. More so than anything you can imagine as a human. And IF you survive your depression, which is unlikely as evidence to what Edward was willing to do when he thought you were dead, you would have to live out your whole immortal life without him... which is a VERY long time. On top of that, your predatory instincts will almost force you to desire your human family's blood. If you were to take a human life in that light, you would be burdened with that guilt for the same amount of time. One thing that will increase along with everything else is your memory retention. While that means your loving moments will be forever with you, it also means you anger, sadness, guilt, sorrowful, and miserable moments will be to. THAT is one of many things why Edward is not too keen about it. He wishes to shield you from harm and pain, especially the everlasting kind. I know you will be turned anyway, but you should think of things in reverse as well. Would you doom someone you love to a life of potential pain and regret for as long as their long life would allow because you wish to extend your love?\" You lectured. This mode of conversation was more up Edward's alley, but he wasn't short sighted enough to not take what you said earlier into account. But now Belle know what it meant to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess not. But I really want this, to be with you forever.\" She answered, the last bit to Edward directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that Belle. Caleb is right though. A Vampire's life is not all roses and butterflies. There are bloody battles, wars, death, and sorrow. Many things that I don't wish you to be hurt by. However, living without you... I know that is also a form of death for me.\" Edward said to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou endured more drama talk between then until the meeting was over and they went to talk more. Seriously, how much could they talk about the same drama filled things over, and over, and over again. You didn't get it, but what else was new. You never had a firm grip on the relationship scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, that is what they needed to hear. I sometimes grow weary of playing peace maker.\" Carlisle sighed and shook your hand in thankfulness, a large smile gracing his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know both sides rather well. Sure Vampire life can have its bad sides, but I've never scorned the one who turned me. Then again, I had a choice and she was rather nice about the whole thing. Not all that are turned can be as lucky, and I hear the way you all bite people is not like my bite, or the one I received. So... I can see both sides in more recent detail. She just needed to have her eyes open to both her decision and his feelings. Edward is not very good at describing things that he knows in his heart from a century of experience. It makes sense to him, but doesn't really know how to express it into words,\" you replied back as if you were looking into your past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it that turned you, if you don't mind me asking?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't wish that to be part of the knowledge base around here. Although I will say that she died in doing so. She knew she would die if and when she passed her.... gift. And she did it for me, in a way that I will never forget but went out of her way to make it a very good experience for me.\" You answered, giving him a little but not enough to tell him everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize, I apologize for bringing it up. She must've been a magnificent person.\" Carlisle replied, noticing that he had stepped on a touchy subject. He had enough tact to know not to push such topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was, thanks.\" </span></div></div>",

It was a little touchy, but you were able to keep good relations with both the Cullens and the werewolves. Each asserted their own view on the other and tried to sway you over who was the most just. But you usually cut them off before they could do too much preaching. As you put it, 'you didn't want any part of Vampire/wolf drama'. However, in this particular instance Jacob was talking about Victoria, who had just come into the territory of both the Cullens and the Wolves. Amidst their territorial fighting had let her escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I could do that. But she hasn't actively harmed anyone in forks, which is pretty much were the majority of the people I care about. Until she does, or openly threatens in a way that I must act, she hasn't done anything wrong to me and mine. Until she does, I am not about to start any fights. At my level, that would just be bullying and not my way at all.\" You responded as you rounded a path with him. He was in wolf form, but that didn't stop you from understanding him. Even without reading his mind, he could still talk to you in wolf language. Must be part of the internal language base, or perhaps King's decree... either way, you could flawlessly understand all of them, which came in handy to say the least. \"If it makes you feel any better, I am looking out for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are???\" He asked, almost tripping in both shock and curiosity. But being a wolf and running on four legs has its perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she is a main source of my interest in this place. Not in a weird sensual, love triangle, or food way. I just want to protect her as a really good friend.\" You answered, answering some questions before they caused a problem. You knew, by this point, that any unexplained lines of dialog that hit anyone wrong could blow up in a huge drama filled situation. You had no desire to enter the Love and protection triangle that Belle, Edward, and Jacob were in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but how. Sure you see her at school and when she stops by your place, but other than that, you are the furthest away from her most of the time.\" Jacob asked in labored bursts. You had reached the home stretch of your little morning jog. It was the point that you would sprint back to your house. He had to really huff it and borderline unhealthy assertion to keep up. Well you had to slow down too, but it was an excellent workout for him... that could only help later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that Glyph I told you about?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" he said then you both waited until you were back, as he was too distracted to have a intelligent conversation at the moment. When you both got back and got some water and blood (for you), you two continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can use that glyph as a sort of radar if I wish. When I sense something hostile about to do her harm, I simply teleport to her side and... solve the problem. Otherwise, when I am not looking her way, sort a speak, I have a nose out for her blood. If her blood hits the air, I immediately check on her to make sure she is safe.\" you explained. As you spoke you could tell he was having different emotions for each part. But the end one was relief at the news that nothing would get past you, if they failed at some point. He had been with you long enough by now to know that NO ONE was stronger than you are, well at least no one they knew. You thanked God for the fact that there was no magic in this realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Belle is ok with that, having the glyph on her all the time? I would thing she would want some privacy at some point.\" Sam asked for Jacob as he and some of the other pack came into the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't have to worry about changing to human for you to understand them, so they just stayed like that. They knew that all manner of things could come and see you. As long as they didn't start anything bad, you didn't mind them like that. You all sat in a small area and you got them a good portion of meat from a deer you had hunted recently. The first time you had offered them something like that, they had refused. But now they knew that you hunted only for the blood and for company. Otherwise you let the animal live as part of your hunt. So they ate the provided meat without thought to it, other than to thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was a little hesitant at first. But it isn't like I can see her with my eyes when she is bathing or going to the bathroom, stuff like that. So she just accepts that I won't abuse it. She is very good with weird.\" You answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That she is.\" Sam agreed between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but I do have a bone to pick with you guys.\" you stated after they had finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking about the red head thing?\" Paul asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way, yes. I don't care if you keep them out. Heck, I don't care if you hate their guts. But what gets me is that you both tend to blame each other for something you caused. You blame them for Vampire things that happen, and when they are willing to help catch one, you refuse, even at the cost of letting a hostile one get away. I am sick of being in the middle of such things. Both sides handled it wrong. Bottom line, I you mess up then take responsibility for it, not a pride based blame game, and sure as heck don't expect me to support either side.\" you lectured. You felt a little weird lecturing people that were older and so different from you. But they seamed to take it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you just order us to do that?\" One of the others asked. He was new and didn't know what if felt like to be ordered by you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, but I prefer to ask as a friend rather than demand such things.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that.\" Jacob responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" You replied back with a pleasant smile. After that you all proceeded to hang out and have a bit of fun. After all, there was things you could do to help them, even with training the younger pack members...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, the Big guns have arrived.\u201d Emmett Said as you showed up for the \u2018training\u2019 that they were doing to fight newborns. Jasper was right, they all needed some education\u2026 and so did you. For instance, you hadn\u2019t watched the series long enough to know that, even with ripping off their head or slicing them in half, they are still not fully dead until they are burned. You would have to think of things to combat that. Therefore, you would need just as much training as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d You comically answered as you did a muscle flex to pun off of his statements. Some smiled and some laughed at this. Belle was there and she didn\u2019t see the point, but you all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was comical to watch them practice, to you, basic combat skills. You were insanely glad that you had already been in realms to help with such things. Jasper had told you to try, and he was on his back before he could do anything else. Suffice to say, they didn\u2019t doubt your physical stature and accomplishments after that point. But then, after their session, instead of returning home like in the movie, they all stayed as it was your turn to ask questions and get figure out better ways to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you need help with?\u201d Asked Jasper. Like everyone else, he was slightly confused at what he could do to help you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wanted to know what works on your type of vampire, that I can do. I have a few tricks that would be useful, but pointless if they don\u2019t finish them. You have said, that fire is the only way to kill them for good, right?\u201d You revealed and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026?\u201d He answered, wondering what you could do that wouldn\u2019t work or would. Both sides seemed to intrigue those that were watching all the more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then unless I want to make a huge mess, possibly alerting humans in the process, then I should find ways to end it quickly. Is that fair to say?\u201d You asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight again. Although you might want to avoid anything too overly flashy. I\u2019ve seen your flame tornado. That would not be anywhere near subtle.\u201d Jasper returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, see that is what I need to know.\u201d You replied back then walked to an open spot in the middle of all them. \u201cI am going to perform a skill and you tell me if it is useable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded and you started by using Kaname\u2019s ability, moving a log, shaping it as a Comical Vampire figure, then bursting it into a milliong pieces. You then looked over at them for their analysis. It took a few minutes for them to recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, didn\u2019t know you could do that.\u201d Jasper replied then thought about it. The others were talking amongst themselves. Sure they could\u2019ve interacted as well, but this was Jasper\u2019s thing and they let him handle it. As he was the most educated in this anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would happen if you did that to a Vampire like us. But, since there wasn\u2019t any flame involved\u2026 the Vampire in question might be able to come back one day, with a heck of a grudge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, good to know.\u201d You replied back then did the same thing with the a log and turning it into a Vampire practice dummy. Then you shot first a saliva needle at it, then a fire needle. It didn\u2019t burst into flames, but it was burning. \u201cTwo separate attacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, again, didn\u2019t know you could do that. But the first one, although able to penetrate us, will be useless because we can still move and function afterward. The\u2026 fire one, it would be a good distraction, but not much more than that unless you riddled the entire body with those things they would just remove them and continue, harmed but not killed.\u201d Jasper said, again after the recovered. They did so quicker this time but still had a ways to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, you used a good number of your abilities. The best one was your blood sword that you, under his suggestion, modified to have the fire element infused. This made it easy to slice a Vampire in half and burst them into such intense flames that it looked like slicing through a Vampire from Blades realm. Best of all, it was the option that cost the least amount of energy from you. It wouldn\u2019t be the only tool you had, but it would be the favorite for slicing and dicing up Vampires in this realm. The Werewolves and the Vampires seamed both delighted and scared of this new weapon you had. However, they liked when you told them about the little thing you gave Belle. That way, even if they did reach her, she could still more than defend herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you all went your separate ways to rest and hunt. After all that show and tell, you needed some blood\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was more drama to follow, as this was a drama filled realm. You were just getting to a place where you could not get caught in the pointless stuff. They started to understand your place and that certain things they had to figure lots of that stuff by themselves. So you continued to train with them. However, with your abilities tweaked and you ready for the fight, they used you for a practice dummy of sorts. Of course you agreed. You were the only person that could be ripped apart and brought back together again. That tended to train them better, and the Wolves could partake in the event as well, in a more feral war like aspect that they couldn't do with Vampires that they shouldn't rip apart. Even so, they each apologized after each training session to make it clear that they valued you and wouldn't ever think of actually killing you. The point was always answered with a joke from you, basically saying that they wouldn't be able to even if they tried. The pride based joke got them in better moods and strengthened the bond you all had. The two sides still were very wary of each other and there was obvious tension, but it was far better at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Asked Emmett, as you all stared down the field, waiting the Newborn army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember who you are talking to right?' You joked. Most of them, despite the impending battle, smiled and/or laughed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will leave some of them for us right?\" He asked back, a 'concern' also held by the wolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a few. Here they come.\" You said with a wink. The last part as your attention then suddenly shifted to the opening, as they were now entering the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been better if there was a little time to talk them down. Alas, there wasn't. They came into the clearing at a straight run. You all move into for the clash of sides. Halfway to them, you cut your finger and made the blood sword come out. This peaked the new Vampires, as they were still blood drunk. The Cullens and Wolves had gotten used to it. These ones... not so much. You could tell that they were now solely focused on you, unaware to how dangerous that Blood sword really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a clash, the sides met. The newborns were stronger than most of your side, but your side had the experience... and you. As you met the opposing line, you began dispatching them with ease. However, as fast as you and they were, you ended up killing at least one with every swing of your sword, sometimes multiple Vampires in one swing. Your blood was confusing them enough to give everyone else an edge as well. But that was not the only thing you did. You took it upon yourself to protect them. When they ganged up on a Cullen of a wolf, you used your abilities to remove the threat and end them in unique ways. In very little time, the battle was over and all the Vampires were dead. Unlike in the movie, your blood had spurred the little girl vampire to fight as well. You found it slightly sad, but you knew that she would've been killed anyway. So, with all of them dealt with, you all just stood around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go get them? It would be faster...\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" You responded, then teleported away to where Belle, Edward, and Jacob was. You knew it would happen, but they were in the middle of a battle. You let them bond for a little bit. However, when it can time for Edward to almost die and Belle to cut herself, you used your powers and separated each one of them. One side knew exactly what it was, the opposing side however, were all fighting against the invisible force that held them against their will. \"Why is it that, even with the best laid plans, you two always get into trouble?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like we go looking for it.\" Belle responded back comically. You put all of them down to which they gathered into two groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know though, Victoria...\" you started, getting her attention. \"The one that killed James wasn't Edward. It was me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! You are lying! James wouldn't have been brought down by a HUMAN.\" she retorted back, saying human like it was an insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\" you replied as you walked into the open area between the two groups, well within striking range. You brought out your blood sword again and that broke any self control of the two that were there. This, along with your comment, made your group smile. They had teased your human like scent at times. But knew all to well, with your blood sword drawn, two unfocused vampires didn't stand a chance. Just as they came close enough to strike, you swung your sword and cut them both in half with little effort. With that done, you put away your blood and turned to them, holding out a hand. \"Shall we go? The others will have been waiting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't break a swet by any means.\" Edward said almost at the same time as Jacob did. They all laughed then came over to be teleported back down with the others.   </span></div></div>",

However, unlike the movie, they weren't able to get as much under their skin with you there. They still remembered what you could do, or at least what you showed them. If they had been just a few minutes earlier, they'd be more educated. Suffice to say, they were far more respectful, once you backed them down a little. However, they still noticed Belle's... lack of immortality. She had told them that 'the date was set' and that seemed to be a good enough answer for them. They parted soon after, mostly to get away from you. The Cullens liked you even more for that, although Carlisle asked that you be careful. They didn't need to be on the bad side of the Vulturi. If he only knew that they would end up there in a little bit anyway. Currently however, they were in the middle of informing people of their impending Marriage. They valued your advice, which was a welcomed change to things. They even made an effort to bring in as little drama as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you two are destined to be together. There are too many reasons why you two should be together. Some of which you don't know yet. But I can see them clearly. Not to mention, I can't imagine you two tying the not with anyone else. That would just be... weird,\" you answered comically, to which they smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you approve.\" Edward stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish Jacob would come around.\" Belle sighed. Edward was about to comment on it but you both stopped him with looks that held his words where they were, still in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a good thing to be concerned about one's friends. Vampires and Werewolves may not get along, but both sides get along with Belle. You are connected with her, now in a more serious manner, so you will have to deal with them in the nice sense, wither you like it or not,\" you said to Edward, then turned to Belle. \"Don't you worry about it. He will come around. You are too good of a friend to him, for him to just turn his back to you after that point. Besides, if there is one thing that Wolves and Dogs are good at, it is being Loyal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you are right, again...\" She said with a better but not completely healed spirit about the whole thing. \"Thanks Caleb, for everything. You have been a really good friend and peacemaker at times. That means a lot to me. Even if you weren't a Vampire, you would be well worth the effort of getting to know.\" She complimented with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both smiled at this. It meant a good deal to hear her say that. You had been concerned that they just saw you as a 'big brother' like figure. A person or thing that could protect and correct them. It made your feel good that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about the wedding...\" Edward started, to which you sat up at attention. \"If you wouldn't mind, we would like you to do background stuff. Like protecting the wedding, us, making us feel warm to any that would touch a Vampire. This is a wedding after all, and people might get close. Sense there will be... well non-educated people there, it would help if we could enjoy the evening without that hassle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure that it would a hit regardless, but I will do my best to make it as smooth as possible. I may have to read your mind on the day to make sure that I am doing everything the way it should, is that ok?\" you asked to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" they said at the same time and without hesitation. That also meant a lot to you. They trusted you that much... it felt really good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis indeed was a very good Vacation.</span></div></div>",

Here it is \"I'll tell you a tale of Vampirates, a tale as old as true. (Verses 1 - 3) Yea I'll sing you a song of an ancient ship that sails the ocean blue......

Even if you didn't really care to keep the timeline at this point, it was useful to do so anyway, in this case. That is because people acted like you'd expect, rather than leaving you in the dark. Then again, with you playing peacemaker most of the time, you had a lot of stuff you didn't know about as well. Most of the time, they respected you enough to not bring over too much drama stuff. But they couldn't help it, this was the Twighlight series after all. This particular case, both the Vampires and the Werewolves had come for your advice and hoped that you would back one side in their quarrel with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is our Baby. When Belle wakes up, she should be able to see her own child!\" Edward declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be allowed to live.\" Jake agreed, in a rare moment of support to his least favorite Cullen. Of course, that was a matter of opinion, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT... is unnatural! A demon! The Cullens are one thing. This... Creature!... is too much!\" Said Sam. It was unclear if all his hostility was against them as a whole, or part of Jake as well. Since Jake wasn't following his orders as the Alfa and all that. To be fair, that probably wasn't easy on a K-9 species like them. Not to mention, he had a slight superiority complex. Not as much as normal Vampires did, but big enough to play a factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is natural,\" replied Jasper, which got a round of hissing and growling. All of which was prying on your patience. Even more so when they started another round of arguing and confrontation. They would ever threaten to harm each other, but they knew better around you. Particularly on your land. You had planned on waiting until the calmed down. but that would not be a short wait... which irritated you even more. To your credit, you waited about an hour before budding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!!!\" You blared. This silenced all of them, some out of fear, others because the outburst was a borderline order to the k-9s in the group. They turned deathly silent as they saw the irritation appear in the form of your eyes glowing red and you flexing a little bit. You closed your eyes and composed yourself before speaking further. Taking a few breaths before continuing with, \"The Baby stays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Caleb???\" Sam asked, distressed that his last attempt at rectifying this to his liking was going up in flames. He couldn't do anything himself, since Jake had imprinted on the child. However, if you ordered it, Jake himself would have no choice but to follow the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike normal Vampires of this place, the cold ones that you wolves have such a biased against, this one was born. She has a beating heart, a more desirable smell, she grows, and she LIVES. I do not take part in the slaying of ANY innocent life. Out of all the Vampires in the world, SHE should be the one you all can tolerate the most.\" You started, backing the almost feral looking group of werewolves. Then you looked towards the Cullens. \"As for you all. You should know that this child will take loads of explaining. Tread carefully, for most people, as evidence to the situation we have here, will not take kindly to her being born like she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Edward asked, in a drama filled emotion. Thankfully, Carlisle headed it off and silently explained it to him in a way you didn't have the patience to achieve. You were glad that at least one of them had a head on his shoulders, sort of speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect us to accept this... child?\" Asked Sam, as if asking if it was an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I expect that you will not needlessly kill her, like you were planning on doing. You can treat her like you treat them if you wish. Just know, that I will probably protect her more than harm her. Fair warning...\" you warned, glaring at them a little, causing them to quiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" He answered. To that effect, they didn't want to be around the Cullens any longer than they had to, so they bolted as soon as Sam told them they could. Jake stayed though, as the Cullens plus him seemed to have something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle, she is...\" Edward started but you nodded in understanding, before he could finished. \"... You knew? You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Having a Vampire baby is no small feet, especially for a human. The little girl could tare the womb open on its own if she wanted, but she didn't. Either way, it is bound to have a toll on the Mother, even more than usual. In normal cases, the Mother is the stronger of the two, the Baby so fragile and all that. In this case however, the Baby is stronger than she was. I assume that you have already changed her?\" You responded and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she lies in a bed.\" Carlisle responded for the emotional Edward. \"She isn't doing well and we don't know if she will pull through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will.\" You said bluntly, after closing your eyes and concentrating on the signal you were getting from the glyph you had put on her. You knew the Movie, so you knew she would be. But, course of habit, you checked anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are sure? How do you know?\" Alice asked, this time. Being the person most like a sister to Belle, she was also quite concerned. She was, after all, the one holding the little one at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That glyph I put on her. Is like a beacon in times like this. It feeds me intel on her status and health so I know if I need to intervene. If she was dead, as in never coming back, then the glyph would disappear and I would know.\" You replied as if stating the weather. They all stood silent for a minute, then shrugged comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get used to this kind of thing at this point.\" Jasper stated stoically, but it was still slightly comical. \"If you aren't worried, neither should we.\"</span></div></div>",

The Cullens and wolves were preparing. The only difference was that they waited to tell Charley for a little bit. You had convinced Belle that it was a good idea and Jacob was ready to reveal himself. They all had some concerns about you doing so, as you were planning, however, since you weren't part of their family officially, Charley wouldn't be targeted after learning of a hybrid like you. So you and Jacob had just arrived at Charley's and were meeting him in the woods, for secrecy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is this all about?\" Charley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is about your daughter, kind of...\" you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle? You've heard from her? How is she?\" Charley asked in rapid succession. It was clear that he was very worried about her. He kept looking between you and Jacob for the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is fine, more than fine actually!\" Jacob stated. He really didn't believe that, as he thought Belle being turned wasn't the best thing in the world. However, he understood that it was far from bad either, and it resulted in Renesmee being born, the one he imprinted onto. Charley seemed to get better and more excited all in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where is she? Can I see her?\" he asked, to which you raised your hand so he knew there was more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean to be rude, Mr. Swan, but it is a bit complicated. We can't tell you everything, but we can prep you so you can see her today, if you are willing to listen and keep an open mind.\" You responded as Jacob started to get nervous and Charley started to get more insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can it be complicated? She is my daughter!\" He almost blared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, however, she is involved with something, while wonderful, it is also very need to know. It is one of those, tell you but have to kill you things. Literally. So, we as a group have decided to give you a taste of what is happening, so you understand that there are certain things that she can't and won't tell you... and that you should not ask about. If you can do that, and trust Belle, then we can take you to see her right now.\" You responded. He seemed to follow you rather well. Even though he was not very happy about it. His law enforcement background seemed to help with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, do what you need to do and say what you need to say, so I can see Belle.\" he almost commanded. You nodded then did the same to Jacob, to which he started to strip out of his clothes. \"Uh... what are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've been shown this a long time ago.\" Jacob said as he removed his last article of clothing. Before Charley could come back with any type of comment, Jacob transformed into his wolf state. Without his gun, Charley's only move was to fall backwards and backpedal until his back was against a tree. He started to calm when Jacob laid down in a very nonthreatening pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what just happened?\" Charley asked you, not risking a move that might invoke a reaction from the very large wolf in front of him. However, he noticed that you were just standing there, as if in no danger. Not strange for you, but definitely strange for him, at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He turned into a wolf. What does it look like?\" you answered comically, then decided to add a little to ease him a little. \"Don't worry, he is still Jacob. Same mind and all, thus why you are still alive right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob?\" Charley asked the wolf slowly, then started to get up. He eventually went over to the large wolf and pet him. He then backed up and got closer to you. \"So, are you a large wolf too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" you said, nervously. His thought process was distracted as Jacob went back and put his clothes back on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\" Charley asked, still keeping an wary eye on Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am... I am a Vampire.\" you said, the word seamed to have a similar effect than Jacob's transformation had, just less animated. Strange, you hadn't felt this nervous in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to be kidding?\" He asked, partially in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can't tell you much more than that. I can't even show you, which is weird. I can lift a car to prove it. But that is about it. We are not saying that Belle is or is not a Vampire... or a werewolf.. We are showing you this to make you understand.\" you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understand what?\" Charley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it. If there really are people like us out there and Belle is somehow accepted in any way by a group similar to us, they would want the secret to stay a secret. The governing body would keep a lid on it, at any cost. So, if you asked too many questions and found out something you weren't supposed to, even with our help, what do you think would be their reaction to it?\" You asked, helping the wheels spin in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would... not be happy...\" he started then thought hard on it. \"I see what you mean. If Belle is involved with a group like this, even an honorable one, she would want to see me, but not want me to know anything that could get me killed or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! She cares about you a great deal!\" Jacob responded to which Charley eventually nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, take me to my daughter.\" he both agreed and commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happily!\" you responded with a smile. You both led him out of the woods. There was a quiet for a while. You let him think, as he had a bunch to think on. You eventually made it to his car, and before getting in, turned to him, then bent down and lifted it off the ground. You put it down and winked at him as if to say, \"Told you so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be an interesting day of explanations and reunions.</span></div></div>",

I don't really get into the whole slaughtering people underneath me thing...\" you answered with a sigh. Most of the new Vampires laughed it off as a sign of weakness to you. The Cullens however nodded to you in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will a fight be necessary?\" Belle asked, hoping that wherever Alice was, she would be bringing something to help, or someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but it is necessary for us to think that it is. So just keep fighting in your mind and 'the plan',\" You responded to which she nodded and gazed at the area that they could all sense the incoming Vampires coming. It wasn't long before they showed themselves and walked, prideful, into the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen began the talking. Full with drama and baiting from both sides. Carlisle, again, was the only clearheaded and relatively drama free person in the conversation. You steered clear of it, until they addressed you that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of you? You support this?\" Aro asked you in a baiting fashion. However, you didn't really find a reason to figure out his deception. Instead, you just decided to answer openly. There was no reason to lie... about this anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you answered bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you whole heartedly admit to opposing us.\" Aro stated in more of a statement then a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you once before, I am not connected, but I will protect them and you have been warned.\" You answered, letting go your eyes so they could step back slightly from it. It was a clear threat to them. The other new ones, even in the Volturi, seemed to laugh at this. However, those that had seen your power, were NOT laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you protect them forever?\" Aro asked. You thought hard about this answer. You were intending on leaving after the series ended. However, their world would continue. So, if the only reason why they weren't attacking was you, then when you left, they would not hold back. On the other hand, maybe there was a way to leave and keep them in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I will be leaving very soon. However, I will visit. It may be in a few days, or in a few centuries. However, if they aren't alive and well... You, Aro, will be the first I slaughter in retribution.\" You stated with a fake but equally sarcastic smile. This seamed to get him to sweat bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the movie progressed as it should. Alice's arrival included. You knew what Aro was seeing was probably more... drastic because you were there. They argued a little more than the movie though, again, because of you. His thought that there was NO danger rang hollow when you had clearly threatened them. Aro had probably seen your ugly side in Alice's vision and was trying to settle his followers down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is only a child, a weak child!!!\" One said as he took a few steps closer to fighting, the wolves reacted by snarling. \"AND they are in league with werewolves, our natural enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think I am weak, do you?\" You asked, in an ominous voice. Your patience was being strained from the extra 2 hours that this was taking. The constant insulting was not helping either. With that decided you let go your full Vampire power. Your power almost exploded out and swirled around the whole field violently. You made it so that no one was injured, and your side was barely effected. However, the previously laughing and doubting lips were now quivering with the rest. \"I don't have the time or patience to teach mere infants like you how to breathe! Attack or retreat, you have 30 seconds to decide or I will decide for you and wipe you all out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last little bit, plus a little fire erupting in places because of your power was enough to cause them to scurry away like the rodents they are. Some actually tripped over each other to get away. You opened a section for them to retreat through and they did so. When you felt that they head sufficiently left and were staying away, you calmed and toned down your power to your normal human like presence. They rest of your side were looking at you as if you were a time bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, too much?\" You asked in a childlike tone. This seemed to snap them out of the temporary shock they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think you just bought us a few hundred years before they try something like this again.\" Carlisle responded with a smile. \"I honestly wish we knew you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us too!!!\" Renesmee exclaimed and threw herself into your arms. She hadn't known you a long time. But, being closer to her age and not her parents, you were able to connect with her easier. You all laughed and started back to peace and quiet... well as much as it got in the Twighlight series....</span></div></div>",

For the moment, they agreed to the truce. The joined alliance against the Volturi could also be part of their appreciation for each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, yes. Then again, I have been away from home for a few years. It will be good to get back.\" you answered back. The large group that had gathered to see you off was there in bulk. It made you feel good. It was a rather... interesting and relatively relaxing vacation. They seemed to all understand the position you were in. It was one instance that the drama filled side actually helped. If anything, they knew the value of a family bond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ever going to tell us where you live?\" Edward asked for the rest of them. They had been hounding you on that one as well. \"What if we need you, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some secrets are better left uncovered.\" you answered. You knew that revealing the typical movie reality would only harm the situation. Perhaps if you did it earlier, when you had time to deflate the situation, but now... not a good idea. You then went over to Renesmee and knelt down to meet her eye to eye. \"I am sure you will be told this many times. But you are one special girl. Take it from an equally if not more different Vampire... Different is never a bad thing. You are going to do great things, I just know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you stood and nodded to her. Belle, Edward, and Jacob seemed to like the little peace of advice you gave. It wasn't often that you got to give advice like that to a hybrid vampire. It felt strangely... good. Plus, you felt that, in this drama filled realm, she would feel the feeling of being different one time or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for allowing me to stay in each of your territories.\" you said finally, to mainly Carlisle and Sam. You would've included Jacob in there, but as Sam was the Alpha, or original one in a sense, you figured that the comment would filter down and up to the necessary people of consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a pleasure.\" Carlisle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An absolute honor.\" Sam agreed with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I got to go. You all play nice now.\" You said comically, then after exchanging smirks with each of them over the comment, you turned and opened a portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that it would be displayed as just another unexplained ability that you had. With them in wonder of the ability you used, you stepped through and started your travel back, making sure no one was following you. You weren't sure if anyone could follow you, but it was best to be careful. You were getting a little better at this portal thing. Although you guessed that it would take a few decades before you would be as good as Mr. Vale was at it. A ping of sadness hit you as you remembered that large man that was your first and hopefully last person that you would drink dry. Sure you had drank animals dry, and evil vampires. However, those were both evil, non-sapient, and fake relatively speaking. Mr. Vale was the first that you did of secure definition. He was a good person, and you had drank him dry. You knew that it was his choice, you had set him free by doing so, and it was ok morally. But you still felt a bit off from it. However, something inside you said it was ok, so you clung to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was enough time to think and debrief from things before stepping into the real world again. You stepped through to the familiar setting of your family room in the basement. There was no one there and, so you checked the date and time on a nearby computer. It was about a week before you usually got back, and it was about 1 in the morning. So you didn't fault people for not being there. You saw a spider notice you, then scurry off, probably to inform Eve and others. Either way, you were back and safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome sweet home!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't want to be too obnoxious about getting back early. Waking everyone in the middle of the night would probably NOT be a good idea. So you sat in your chair and waited. You found it strange that you couldn't feel anyone in the house. There wasn't even that many spiders in there. But you were content in waiting for them. You thought that one of them walking in and seeing you there would be a great surprise. So, you waited, and if they didn't arrive by tomorrow then maybe they were Up North or something and you would take a quick run up there. As you waited, you began to think on the things you would need to brush up on upon coming back . School was going to start, events in the world, wars, police stuff, Vampire Clan stuff, and... THEM. The first few you thought about, but that last one... not so much. You didn't want to ruin your homecoming with thinking of THEM. So you put it from your mind. However, things don't always go the way you want, and a little messenger was about to pop your calm bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, Mr. Vampire... sir?\" Came a small voice from a 2 foot spider that crawled into the room. Actually it was a rather quick entry, which slightly surprised you. Mom was getting use to spiders but was far from having one do something like running down the hall like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I get to the point of being out in the open, where my Mom can see you, what is it?\" You asked pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, Master, Mother needs to speak to you as quickly as possible. She said to tell you it is about your family, and it is urgent!\" He said as quickly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout too much wasted time, you bent down and picked him up and teleported, almost at the same time. This slightly put the spider on edge, but knew better than to act out. If you wanted to kill him, he would let you, as a loyalty thing. But you didn't. So you just teleported you both to Eve's throne chambers. At your sudden presence, the spiders in the room hissed at a possible intruder, then as they saw it was you, gave some room and chattered happily. Eve was on her spot, or throne for lack of a better description. She was either resting or sleeping. But the moment you cam into view, her legs shot out and she bolted for you. The spider you teleported with scurried off in wake of his giant Mother coming so quickly. Eve grabbed you with her mandibles and hugged you tightly liked she always did. Although, as she got bigger, it looked more like she was trying to eat you, from an outside perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Caleb, I am so sorry, and happy, but so sorry I failed you!\" She almost cried out. This concerned you. She was 'hugging' you pretty hard and she was shivering, not to mention her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, calm down. Tell me what happened.\" you said calmly. She slowly let you down and backed up, after you petting between her eyes a few times. She purred at this, but was still distraught with whatever she needed to tell you. She calmed a little more before she responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your family, they  have been taken.\" She blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taken...? What do you mean?\" You asked, suddenly very serious and concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, those Kohlers, the magic users?\" She asked, as if jogging your memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they didn't take too kindly to your little bluff when they searched and found that the Reaper in question was not there anymore. So, they watched your family for a little bit. When they say Brad and Kelsey in their true forms, and heard magic talk, they took them.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them, you mean Kelsey and Brad?!\" you asked, not liking where this was going. You were secretly hoping that it was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... well yes... but not just them. They used their influence and grabbed your whole family, EVERYONE!\" she cried out. You took a few steps back to catch yourself. You didn't know what to think or do at the moment. \"I am so sorry Caleb! I promised to keep your family safe, and I couldn't do it. They even killed the hell hounds that you placed to protect them. I couldn't protect them, your family, my family!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to get yourself under control and composed. THEY, had took YOUR family? You were so going to have to deal with this. But you couldn't do this in vengeance... ok, maybe part of it. But you couldn't afford to just go in there and start slaughtering people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, it is ok. You did what you could. I don't blame you. However, I need your help to free them. Can you do that?\" You asked, trying to get the emotional spider back on track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I can help. I WILL help!\" She stated, with a great deal of conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I need to know where they are, how and when they were taken, why no attempt was made to free them, and why people didn't drop what I am at this point. I can't imagine that some of my younger cousins and siblings would not say something like that, especially since the Kohlers usually torture the people they abduct like this.\" You asked/stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried to go get them, but a mage's house is not a small thing to do that too. As it stands, even if all the k-9 allies and insect allies were to come together, we wouldn't be able to get into a well occupied Mage's house. The Kohler's have all their family there. They were taken about a month ago, they used very high level magic and threats of people they already captured to take them.\" Eve answered dutifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why hasn't someone dropped my name yet?\" You asked. They had previously stated that if the Kohlers knew who you were, they would 'beg for your forgiveness'. So you were wondering why they were still being held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of us tried, at one point or another. But, they want proof. Since you were gone, they said that we are just trying to deceive them and they couldn't be wrong. As they put it, 'an example must be made'. That damned arrogance of theirs, wont allow them to see anything past their own conclusions.\" Eve almost hissed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I suppose I should go give them a visit then, shouldn't I.\" You stated, rather than ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to come?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, if they push me, I will pull my protection from them, with the Reapers. I don't want you getting caught in the feeding frenzy.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Caleb. I am glad you are back. We all missed you. Despite needing you for this whole thing, I still missed you regardless. We all did!\" she stammered out, ending with brushing her face against your body. She then backed up and looked seriously at you. \"Ok, please go teach those Kohlers a lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count on it!\" you declared, with a smirk, then teleported away to save your family. You didn't know how you would handle it, but one thing is for sure. The Kohlers.... they were not going to forget this day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On your way there you had to decided what and how you were going to do all of this. At first you wanted to just go all out and bust down the door. It would certainly be easier so just slaughter everyone. You remembered what King had said. If you were at full power, it didn't allow any magic to be done in a certain area around you. However, you didn't know too much about that, so you didn't want to risk it. Also, you weren't too interested in slaughtering everyone. After all, they weren't evil, just arrogant. Despite your bias against that kind of thing, it wasn't grounds for genocide. So you decided to teach them a lesson. You didn't like it, that it would require you to tell them, or more accurately show them, you are a vampire. However, odds were that your family already tried telling them that. So, with that decided, you appeared at the end of their yard, knowing that going in as any type of supernatural force would set off every magical alarm in the place. You had also stopped at home and filled belly and reserves with as much blood as you could stand. You had a feeling that you'd be needing it. Being at full power for a long period of time was draining enough, but fighting as well and holding back would probably be more than just a little blood to power. With everything ready, you walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel now the magical barriers, both in front of you protecting the house and around the yard. Maybe you could sense them because your body knew what to look for now. Either way, you had a feeling that it would be best to play the week card. Just until you found your family. You needed to make sure that all your family was ok, and all that. Starting off might put them in danger. So you went up to the door, despite some new eyes watching you, and knocked. It wasn't long before the Butler came to the door and opened. You wondered for a moment, why they would just open the door. Then again, they probably had a few too many charms and barriers up to prevent people and otherwise hostile forces from forcing their way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the last arrival.\" The Burler said out of turn. He seamed to catch himself and posed to restart. However, you knew what he meant. You were the last of your family to be brought there. They must've thought you were in hiding. Seeing you knocking at their door must've been.... interesting to say the least. \"Mr. Konel, welcome back. The Masters have been expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it would seam.\" you answered with a little bow of respect. You didn't really respect him, but you wanted to maintain a calm, composed, and respectful manner about you. If they were going to act out against you, it wouldn't be for any rudeness you did. He ushered you in after that and had you stand in the same room as you and Kelsey did before. However, unlike before, they didn't wait to talk. You were surprised by this actually. You thought they would at least give you a chance to explain yourself. Their curiosity must've been tripped. But you were hit with something. From your torture experience from them before, you knew it as a gravity spell. It basically forced you to face plant on the floor, with an audible 'thud!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit.\" Started Mr. Kohler as he walked down the stair and stood above you. The spell was so strong that you couldn't move even enough to touch him, despite him being only a few inches away, not unless you went full power at least, and you weren't ready for that yet. \"... I didn't expect that you'd come here of all places. I thought you would go to the police and we'd have to use our connections to get you here, or something equally as futile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this you tried to talk. You tried to tell him why you were there, and what a mistake he was making. You wanted to give them a chance, but your vocal cords were clinched somehow. At your attempt, there was pain from yet another spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say you could talk? No, I think not. Your family has not learned their place. They even won over some mythical beings. Which is no doubt because you spilled information about my family. Information that we expressly imprinted on you NEVER to tell. Yet you still defied us, your superiors. We will... teach you how much of a mistake that was. Although, I am not without mercy, I will put you with the rest of your family, reunite you with them as it were. They are a bit worn out at the moment.\" He mused and instructed, the last part with a smirk, as if proud of their work. The whole time he was speaking he used a self gratifying and arrogant tone. As if only they mattered and they were on top of the world. \"Beth, be a dear and ESCORT him to their cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Daddy!\" Beth said as she came into view. She gave him a little kiss on the cheek then kicked you in the gut hard enough to send you across the room. It must've been a magical kick to be able to do that. She then continued to do that, kicking you down stair, through hallways, and finally into a cell. \"THAT was for telling me that there was a Reaper around when it wasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she closed the door and a magical field activated over the bars. You were almost instantly swarmed by hands and arms. You soon found that they were the loving, if not highly battered arms of your family. With the magical field around the bars, the spells on you were cancelled. You stayed in a helpless condition until Beth left the room. After that, you got up to address those in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb!\" Kelsey called as she hugged you so hard she nearly crushed your back. At this point her full Succubus form was out. You had a feeling she did that to help their case, well it didn't, apparently. But it was still nice to see her and embrace her. \"We all missed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I left with all of this happening.\" you apologized to her and around her, as she wasn't letting go yet. She backed off a little to give you room to address everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, we knew you would come for us when you got back. It wasn't like you knew they would do this.\" Grandpa Konel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next little bit, it was basically a heal and catch up session. You would heal their wounds and then take a little blood for your escape option, while talking and exchanging stories. Theirs was just like Kelsey and your time with the Kohlers the first time, except they didn't let them go yet. You wowed them with things from the other realms and they liked that you had gotten stronger. However, eventually, you got to a point that got you a bit mad. Cassy. As Sarah held her newly born daughter for you to heal, you saw that not even Cassy was saved from the torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have gone way to far with this one.\" you said as you healed her, making Cassy laugh at the weird sensation, making most smile as a result, then back to your serious face. \"They are lucky that I have an aversion from killing people on a whim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I don't think anyone would mind of you added a little something extra to whatever butt kicking you are planning.\" Mom said, slightly spiteful but with the approval from the room. She loved kids, and that her only grandchild was tortured so young, didn't do any favors for the Kohlers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the door opened to the cell block and a few Kohlers came in. Apparently they did this to get people to torture. One would get the person, while the others handled crowd control. It had been a few hours since you arrived. But you were in no mood to entertain them. All your family was now healed and you were ready to get out of their, they shared that feeling as well, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, it is your turn!\" Said a man, probably Beth's uncle, as Beth was in the group as well. He was pointing to your Mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" you said as you waved everyone back, away from the door. They knew things could get very chaotic when you were at full power. Yet they hadn't seen it for a while, and you had gotten a lot stronger since then. Brad was next to you though. You nodded for him to get back and protect your family if needed. He nodded and went to them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Get out of the way, Caleb.\" Beth said with a flick of her hand. You felt a spell form and an impact hit you. But, unlike before, you had no intension of reacting like a human. So you let it hit you, and it didn't make you budge an inch. she tried a few more times, and nothing. They took notice of this. You were glaring at them intently, making some flinch from it, and you didn't even have your Vampire features out yet. \"What the heck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, have gone way too far this time. I brushed off when you tortured me and Kelsey because we could handle it. But now you target my family and think that I won't retaliate... Well, you thought wrong.\" You said, trying to control your breathing so you didn't lose control of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should we care if you fight back?\" The Uncle said in an arrogant tone. He didn't even give you time to answer as he used a spell and it cut you soundly in two. \"There, anymore heroes that...\" he started, but then was caught dumbstruck as your two haves started to come together again, as the mist brought them and mended them together again. \"That in the... What are you?...\":<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As they have said, I am the Vampire!\" You said as you connected. With this said you didn't wait for them to understand. You let loose your full Vampire power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this your appearance changed like it usually did. The energy you were emitting shattered the bars around you. Now that Magic was no use inside the area you were in, you could destroy or make anything you wished, unlike before. You could guess that the whole house was experience the same effects as magical alarms were going off everywhere. People with you were almost as scared as the people that you were against. It wasn't every day that they say their loving family member and friend turn into... this. The entire area was riddling with all the effects that you could do. Throwing things, increasing gravity, causing static discharges, fires in other areas, and much more. But you kept your group safe from such things. Then you started walking towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, we...\" The Uncle started. Bt you had no patience for it at this point. With a wave of your hand, you through the group, along with a crippling and dumbfounded Beth, to the farthest point of the room and the landed on each other in a messy drooling heap of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" you said to your family as you nodded for them to follow. They had broken out of their shock and started to realized that no matter how scary you got, you were still Caleb. So they followed as you blew the cell door off its hinges and started walking down the hall that Beth had kicked you down just a few hours ago. Sucks for them that they didn't make you wear a hood or something like that. Every Kohler that tried to do or say something ended up in a drooling heap in a corner somewhere. You also added a nightmare session you had developed so they wouldn't forget what happened and your vampire form would haunt them for a few days. Eventually you got to the front door to find a group of older individuals bowing to your group as you all approached. Apparently they had finally realized their folly and had come to respect you, and perhaps beg for your forgiveness. Mr. Kohler raised his head in a very pitiful expression to start talking. But you weren't going to let him. With a wave, you pinned all them to a wall. You were running out of power, so you had to make this quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you have to say. I don't care what your reasons were. I really don't care about you mages at all. In fact, I don't care to the level that I am calling a situational open season on your family with the reapers. If they sense any magic from any one of your family, no matter the age or reason, even in self-defense, they have my blessing to come after the offending mage, but no one else. I want nothing to do with you, your family, or your kind. I swear, the next time I hear of one of you, even touching one of my family or someone I find value in, I will corral every Reaper in the world to your family and make sure they know that it is meal time. LEAVE US ALONE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you sent them across the room like you had so many others that evening. When you all got outside you scaled back your power and heaved a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's over now.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You almost fainted when you got home from rescuing everyone. They and you underestimated how much power it took for you to go to full power. Although, it was well worth it. You also knew that there was a few things to work on. Getting your full powered form to last longer than an hour would take some heavy duty condition training. But that was for later. For now, you were relaxing and enjoying the time with your family. They each thanked you and you all had a decent amount of Q&amp;A time with each other. A few wanted to know how your time in the Twighlight realm was, while others just were wondering how powerful you had gotten, in the aftermath of you showing your full power. Eventually, it was just you and Kelsey. Eve would've been there, and you did visit again... a few times. But she was WAY to big for the family room at this point. So, it was just you and Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was it really?\" Kelsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was what?\" You asked back, not sure what she was referring to. To be honest, should could've been talking about anything. Your realm visit, your power, your diet,...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being that powerful. I mean, I know you are always really strong. But being so strong that nothing can touch you... it has to be... exhilarating.\" She clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was... kind of. However, it was also a bit draining. Not just in the usual blood usage sense. When I am that way, my human life, the one I hold onto so hard, seems to be move away even more.\" You responded, a little somber about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that bad? I don't mean to be insensitive, but you aren't human anymore. Why do you want to hold onto something that doesn't apply anymore?\" She asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is hard to explain. It is one end that you, perhaps, will never understand. I suppose that it would be like you turning to human. Regardless how well you adjusted to your new life, you would still miss the old one. You wouldn't want to say goodbye to your Mother, just because you changed species. Same here, I want what I had before. Maybe not in physical stature, but the concept of it. I want the love of my family, the wonder at seeing new things, the enjoyment of seeing my Niece being born. I don't want to loose that. As a Vampire, it is possible to look at everyone and everything as just food or objects. I don't want to do that... does that make any sense???\" You asked, bouncing around different topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I guess I understand as much as I can. You're right though, I couldn't imagine the change that you have undergone to get the way you are. What you miss, what you don't, and everything in between. I almost wish that I knew you before you were turned, just so I could see the difference. Then again, if I had known you sooner, I probably wouldn't be the same person I am now.\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" You answered. You didn't mean to do it, but you accidentally put a little contemplative memory recalling in your voice. You knew she heard it, in hindsight. Too late to hide that fact now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, oh, I just hit a bad memory, didn't I?\" She asked. You hadn't done it often, but every once in a while she hit a raw memory from your past. Sometimes you shared it, sometimes you didn't. But per her offer to help you through things, you tried opening up to her. She and Eve were your closest friends, but she was by far the closest out of those two. Eve understood that Kelsey would be. There was no jealousy between the two. At times they got together themselves to hang out, without you. You were glad to have Kelsey there all the time to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps a little one, not that important thought. I had forgot about it, until now.\" You answered, indicating that you didn't really want her to hear about it, but she could tread if she wanted, just to be careful. She knew your little emotions and their tells quite well. It helped being a mystical being. Her perception was higher and she could pick up on small things to tell your mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, judging on what I was talking about, you probably have a memory of me before I remember meeting you. And judging on the tone you used, I probably didn't make a very good impression.\" She said, a little guilt creeping in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry about it. I have put it in the past, where it belongs.\" You stated, putting on a smile and trying to change the subject. \"So,  you coming back to school, now that the Kohlers aren't going to be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my Mom said that as long as you are there with me, she will allow me to attend. Thanks for that by the way. Home school is not nearly as exciting as it sounds.\" she answered with a smirk. You knew she meant the amount of people around. Despite the drama, she liked being social, even with humans. She also liked being admired. Most girls would be offended by being ogled all the time. But that was kind of a Succubus thing. They were just naturally sexually attractive and took great pride in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Colin, Dani, and Tou will be happy you're back!\" you winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, almost forgot about that...\" she mock cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, they aren't that bad!\" You joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, they weren't that bad. Kelsey was just used to a more hands off and less formal approach when dealing with humans, that weren't related to you. Sure some of your family members admired her as a woman/girl. But they were like family to her, and her to them. She took the odd crush inside the family as a good natured teasing moment. She even helped a few with girl problems and advice. One of the more nerdy cousins didn't have a girl to ask for homecoming. So she went with him and made his night. Like really, what High School girl can compare with a succubus of any age? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not.\" She said with a smile. You were both looking forward to another year at school. From all the weirdness of the summer, you both were craving the slow paced norm of a school year.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why in the world would I do that?\" You asked Luke as he tried to convince you to join the football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Havel was your school's wrestling coach. He was VERY successful in that respect. Sent people to the State Tournament every year, and every year at least one placed, with the occasional 1st place. The team was defending conference champions for 6 years in a row, and he went out of his way for the team, students, and the school in that area. He was also the gym teacher, which made the wrestlers his unofficial favorites in the classes he taught them in. However, he was not the best MORAL character to follow at a Christian school. So you were grateful but just not as connected as some of the others. He got particularly peeved when you had to cancel the state tournament on your end. You would get as far as the Regional tournament, win the whole thing, then say you couldn't make it to the State. What he didn't know was that you were busy with Summer training and Vampire stuff during that time. So, without a \"good\" reason, he was a little put off. However, you did win them a bunch of matches and whatnot, so, after a very long talk, and no persuasion from you, the two of you came up with an understanding. You would make every Wrestling match you could, including normal, invites, and tournaments and he wouldn't press you when you said you couldn't make it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had also been trying to get you into football. As he was the most successful, results wise, at the school. The School asked him to coach their high school football team. It might also have something to do with the fact that the school didn't like spending extra money, so they double lots of the teachers in other areas. So, this is where you were now. Mr. Havel new that of all the people he knew of, there were only two people that you listened to in situations like this; Kelsey, and Luke. So he put you two in a quiet room, at Luke's request, and was having him talk to you about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Luke asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Really? Even putting aside how royally unfair it would be, even when I am holding back. And that I could accidentally snap someone in half from a simple twitch in the wrong direction. I would be in the middle of the spotlight for everyone to see. Meaning I would have to say no to not only wrestling scholarships, but football ones as well.\" You replied, with a look that indicated that Luke knew that already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that was a stupid question to ask I guess. But, Wrestling you do for fun and as a form of training. Why can't you do the same with Football?\" Luke asked. Unlike you, he was already signed up and ready to go. He had been practicing with the team and all that too. Technically, the time to sign up was over. But they REALLY wanted you this year. Luke was the only person out there that knew why in more detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would I be training while knocking humans on their can over and over again?\" You asked, not really getting it. You could've just read his mind. But you induced that would be rude to say the least and told your family that you would refrain from doing that, unless the situation called for it. They differed to your judgment for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you had to practice with your full power right?\" Luke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes???\" you asked and answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if you go full power underneath a helmet where no one can see you. If they remark on your eyes you can say you got contacts to freak people out on the other side of the line. You can fog your face mask like you do to hide anything else. As far as your other... stuff you can do. You can use power to control things, like the wind and noise in the area. That with the restraining and constant drain should help with your training, right?\" Luke answered and asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been thinking about this for a while, haven't you?\" you asked rhetorically. He just nodded and smiled, as he saw that you were coming around. \"Ok, I will do it. But same rules as my wrestling. I can't do summer practices. Those started in August, and I am still in other realms at that time. As long as you all can handle that, I suppose I can do a lineman job in football, while training I guess...\" You replied back, Luke's eyes getting wider and happier with every word you said. Mr. Havel was pacing outside and looked in the window every once in a while. But at this, you saw a wide grin on his face too, as you both came out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Luke talked some good sense into you?\" Mr. Havel asked and complimented at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way. I am still insanely busy in the summer. I won't be able to make the practices then. But if you can deal with that, I suppose I can deal with a lineman role or something.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good to hear! I still think you would make a killer running back, with all the speed and power you have. But I will take a little more defense and offense from you as a lineman.\" He answered with a slap on the back. \"Now, if you will excuse me, I need to get ready for class and practice. Thanks again, both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Problem...\" You and Luke said at the same time with a wave, indicating that you were still brothers, and close ones at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I hear that right?\" Came a very familiar voice from behind. The only one that could pull off a innocent yet highly seductive and beautiful voice all in one was... Yep, Kelsey. \"You are going to be on the football team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it...\" you responded, scratching the back of your head, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is wonderful!\" she said, surprising both you and Luke. You had both thought that another mythical being would think it a bad move. But she was delighted. She even came close and gave Luke a simple kiss on the cheek. She knew that she couldn't kiss on the lips, any human, unless she wanted a slave. But a kiss on the cheek from a maturing succubus... definitely not a bad thing. Luke blushed as she backed off a little. \"THAT, was for getting him to join. Can't tell you how draining it is to cheer at those games without someone I know playing, and winning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Luke answered, still recovering from the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright miss heartbreaker, let's let Luke recover from that and get to class. See you at practice Luke.\" you said, steering Kelsey down the hall. Luke dumbly waved then shook his head and went off to class, still blushing though. \"You really like that trick, don't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kissing on the lips is out. I got to get it where I can. Plus, It isn't like they don't enjoy it.\" she replied back, defending herself a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a new thing that she had picked up. Sure, her kiss could make a human be her slave and her attractant could make them kiss her, while having sex with them made them completely obedient drone of sorts and feed her a bit of their energy... all except her chosen mate of course. But a simple kiss on the skin other than the lips was like injecting arousal and sexual excitement into the person directly. Very similar but not as potent as your bite did. She could make a man that was happily married all his life fall for her with one of those little kisses. Heck, she could do it to the wife too, if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. Jeepers, by the time my family gets used to all of us mythical beings and our abilities, they will be like mutants or something.\" You joked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see, I am helping!\" She said, giving you a kiss on the cheek too. She pulled back and blushed herself at the sudden action that her body probably did on impulse. You didn't know at the time, but she seamed disappointed for a brief second, before turning to her normal happy self. \"Of course it doesn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! Let's just get to class!\" she said as you both went on with your day.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a normal day, or rather a rather pleasant normal day. Nothing really was going wrong. You were walking around the city as you did from time to time to make sure that Dracula was doing right with his job to have is people not run wild and doing crimes. To your joy, you hardly caught anyone doing anything like that. In fact, the city was enjoying less crime than it did for a VERY long time. In the middle of your rather pleasant walk, you were interrupted by an unforeseen impact to your chest that sent you flying back. You had no doubt what it was, a sniper round and a rather large one with probably an explosive round, because the hole it left in your chest was about a foot in diameter. It took out all your organs at once. You were fine, as it wasn\u2019t any bit of silver, but you stayed down in an apparent dead state. You wanted to find out who or what did this, and why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConfirming target down.\u201d Said a man that had just stepped into the alley, now dirtied with your blood. He was obviously some kind of agent, of what agency you didn\u2019t know. \u201cSend cleaner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this point a few men came around and began to \u2018clean\u2019 the area, and you. You were slightly impressed by how they were able to do their work. They put you in a tub and started a process or \u2018cleaning\u2019 you. They were about to inject things into you, but saw that your heart would be unable to circulate it, since there was a huge hole in your chest in place of a majority of your organs, including your heart. So they set about melting down your body in acid. You of course weren\u2019t really melting, you were just making it look like it was working while turning your body into mist so fine that you entered the body of the \u2018agent\u2019 that was residing over the event and probably the one that shot you, judging by the sniper rifle he was putting away. Anyway, as you entered his body you hoped he would bring you to the one in charge and not to some place random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit lucky that he did exactly that. You observed everything around him/you as he went to a secret bunker of a base, through security, and to a debriefing of some sort. He entered a room with a single man in a chair behind his desk and stood, waiting to be addressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael, I take it that you were successful?\u201d Asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u2026\u201d he responded. You were slowly seeping out of his body at this point. While being in someone else\u2019s body was a good way to follow unnoticed and get some extra blood for your trouble, it was also a pain if done too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the man behind the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I didn\u2019t see the point of this mission.\u201d He stated then continued. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why this\u2026 boy was a threat to anyone. The most aggressive thing I saw him do was hit someone on the football field perhaps a little too hard, but was quick to help them up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently gave the man props. He was following you and you didn\u2019t realized it. This human was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs it turns out, he was deeply involved with the Vampire clan. Birkhoff was able to crack their system and found him in their files. Not much, but enough to indicate that he was well protected and involved.\u201d Said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, is there anything else sir?\u201d asked Michael. You read into his mind and noticed that he obviously didn\u2019t like killing children. That won him some more points with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you may go.\u201d Said the man. You stayed in the room to see what happens next. You took note where the devices in the room were. You would need to secure the room if you were to speak to this man. It wasn\u2019t long before he picked up the phone and made a call. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPercy, did you do it?\u201d asked the other man. You recognized his voice as one of the Beth Kohler\u2019s uncles, Frank if you remembered correctly. His voice was highly anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, we took care of it, like I said we would.\u201d He replied with a smile that you wanted to smack off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are sure no one will know of this\u2026 arrangement. My family would kill me if they knew, not to mention some of the other forces out there.\u201d He asked, very nervous. You really didn\u2019t like the Kohler\u2019s at all, but at least it wasn\u2019t the family that had ordered this, just one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank, you don\u2019t need to worry. We specialize in keeping secrets.\u201d He replied while you saw in his mind that he was preparing a file on you and this whole thing to put on something called a \u2018black box\u2019. \u201cNow I believe you owe me something, your knowledge of magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one thing, how did you kill him?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you must know, an explosive sniper round. His chest was no longer there, along with his major organs, then disposed of the body by melting him down with acid.\u201d Percy revealed, which got a gasp from Frank. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to know, you shouldn\u2019t ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me you used silver, like I requested.\u201d Frank gasped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was no need. We got him.\u201d Percy said with an air or arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fool! He is probably there now! You have killed us both! He will not be happy! He is\u2026\u201d Frank exclaimed but you interrupted him by starting to form your body in the room. First a hand that took the phone from Percy\u2019s now shaking hand. You sealed the room and made all electronics useless, except the phone you now held. Percy\u2019s eyes started bugging out as your body formed from your mist. You held the phone to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear from me soon.\u201d You said to Frank Kohler then hung up as you fully formed in the room. You took a spot floating in the air, in a reclining position. \u201cYou know, I was having a rather pleasant day before you people decided to interrupt it with a bullet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026 W-what are\u2026 who are you?\u201d Percy stuttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the boy you just ordered killed.\u201d You stated, making him sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d he started to which you just cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already know that. I take great pains to keep myself hidden. However, that leave us with a problem doesn\u2019t it? You are now revealed yourself as an enemy, or at least one that would kill innocents and children. That is a problem; while I can handle a bullet in the chest, my family can\u2019t. So now they are in danger. What do you suppose I should do about that?\u201d You stated asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I swear that Division will not pursue you or your family.\u201d Percy stated, suddenly realizing what a problem he had. \u201cAnd the Vampire Clan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are missing the point. I care not for human concerns besides that of my family and friends. While I make sure that the Vampire Clan isn\u2019t stepping on my toes, I don\u2019t rule them and don\u2019t care if you slaughter all of them, or not.\u201d You started, then lifted him with your power to which he started sweating a great deal. \u201cI can read your mind. Your little black boxes don\u2019t bother me. That is a human concern, so I have no problem killing you to secure my family\u2019s safety and I don\u2019t trust you to keep your word. It seems like killing you would be the easiest way to prevent you from being a pain later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I can be of use to you! I can!\u201d He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. However, unlike you, I don\u2019t overly enjoy killing people. So shut up while I find a way to deal with you and keep you alive.\u201d You said then went into deep thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard enough for you to kill in other realms when you knew the people were evil and wouldn\u2019t have any ill effects. But in your own realm, you had no knowledge of what would happen if you killed someone so high up in the government, or whatever branch this \u2018Division\u2019 was. Besides the potential world war that those Black Boxes could create, he seemed to be holding many strings that would go unchecked if he was killed. Then Kamper had an idea and whistled twice. A few spiders came up from areas of the room and stood on the desk as well as a hell hound. Percy\u2019s eyes bugged out as he saw them, not so much the spiders but the Hell hound was not something humans liked to see, and didn\u2019t even know they existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an\u2026 alliance with spiders and Hell hounds to name a few. THEY will keep an eye on you. If they find you mentioning me or my family in any capacity that spreads my information or danger to them, they will communicate it to me and deal with you on the spot.\u201d You explained then nodded to the Hell Hound to which it roared then dove into Percy\u2019s chest, causing a bit of pain then looked as if he was absorbing it until it was gone. \u201cHe will be in you for a very long time. And not to worry, he is invisible to human scans and will keep that switch in your heart going if he has to kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you dropped him onto the ground, he crumpled to the ground then wearily got up. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was named \"SN-01 Code: Demon\" you thought that was an interesting name so you opened the file and nearly fell off your chair in astonishment as your saw document upon document of case files all relating to the super natural. You wondered if you had a file so you scrolled down to \"v\" and found your file, It was three quarters of a gigabyte by far the largest there. You opened your file and found it had all your school records, all your family's birth certificates (And death if they had one), countless photos and links to other files in the SN-01 folder including werewolves, scorpions and spiders but no mention of succubi (Either didn't know about them or hadn't made the link.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou trawled a bit deeper into the file work until you found a program. this program was used to access a supernatural energy hunting satellite. You booted up the program and it opened a window showing a real time map of the earth in the bottom right hand corner of the window there was an indicator showing the amount of satellites in position, it currently read 37. \"37\" you thought to yourself whilst doing some calculations \" that almost 7.9 billion dollars\".<br>\r\nyou quickly scanned over to your house and found it alight with super natural energy, with the concentration coming from the area of the house that would be the living room. you looked up whilst using your vampire vision to see through the walls, you looked up into the sky for about ten minutes then closed the program and just kept trawling through the file system looking for any more hidden Gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately you found not that much else apart from some access codes to some encrypted files so you closed down the computer and misted into some clothes that wouldn't stand out in public then headed off to the mall (it is about 10:30 by this time on a Sunday)</span></div></div>",

You called up the school then enrolled and got placed in Koujo's  all by using a little bit of over the phone mind control. After this you popped out again to get the books you were gonna need to learn how to read Japanese as only the spoken language was translated. After a few hours of study you had a fluent grasp on hiragana and katakana with a 5th grade knowledge of kanji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you had a fully fluent knowledge of all of the character sets and the spoken language. (you finished with about 5 hours to spare so you decided to learn the spoken for when you got home.) You misted into the school uniform then headed off to school. At school Koujo asked \"What are you doing here?\".<br>\r\n\"It's my first day of school here and the last time I was in a Japanese school was a private school on main land Honshu and that was nearly 5years ago. You see I'm not actually Japanese I'm American.\" you explain hoping to befriend  him before the action started.<br>\r\n\"really, I would never have thought that because your Japanese is perfect and you have a strong accent.\" Koujo said quite confused.<br>\r\n\"well if you rearlly must have proof , konnichiwa, Hajime mash'te Atsuki san.\" you said in your best Japanese accent. (he would of heard this in English with an American accent.) (by the way for any body that can't speak Japanese that said 'hello, nice to meet you Atsuki' people are referred to by there last names in Japan with a suffix)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok then your either very good at accents or your telling the truth. So what class are you in?\"  he asked.<br>\r\n\"yours\" you said with a hand gesture.(NOT a swear.)<br>\r\n\"erm... Then I guess just follow me and I'll show you around.\" He said obviously still quite blundered about the languages thing. He showed you the way to the class room then gave you general directions to the canteen, the gym, the library, the toilets and the courtyard. As you walked into the homeroom you got a few weird looks. \"forgive me for asking but why are they all staring at me ?\" you asked Koujo.<br>\r\n\"your eyes are red.\"he responded. <br>\r\n\"oh I forgot about that it must be all the energy it must be reacting with my own.\"you said as you started to retract the power from your eyes but then you noticed something strange, you couldn't manage any less than a red tint. \"what the hell\" you said quitely to your self as you couldn't completely retract your vampiric energy from your eyes. But that was the least of your problems as nagisa sensei entered the room and got everybody to sit down apart from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"this is Caleb, he is our new transfer student. I would like for you all to make him feel welcome in our school.\" Nagisa introduced you. \"now Caleb, can you go sit down next to Koujo over there please.\" she said this time adressing you directly.<br>\r\n\"thank you sensei\" you said with a slight bow of respect.</span></div></div>",

All things considered, he had  a right to be a little on edge, he did just have a Hell Hound jump into his chest. \u201cMichael, get in here now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t risk anything other than those words, especially with you standing right there deciding his fate. You felt the man return and unsealed the door while slowly turning to mist so Percy could tell that you were still there. With a click and a few beeps from the keypad, the door opened and in came Michael. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas there something else?\u201d Michael asked as he took a position to address Percy, he then seemed to notice the high anxiety state he was in. \u201cWhat is the matter sir?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that you were once again returning to a solid form, but this time behind Michael. Michael seemed to get it as Percy\u2019s horror stricken eyes locked on you and your reemergence to the room. You had to float a little bit to be at eye level with him but waited so he could turn around. He had to catch his breath as he looked into your glowing red eyes. Then he realized who you were and reached for his gun. You didn\u2019t let him as you backhanded him hard enough to make him fly over Percy\u2019s desk and slam into the wall then held him there. Percy tried to run on instinct alone but you grabbed him with your power and held him against the wall next to Michael, who was just recovering from his own impact with the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I say you could leave?\u201d You asked Percy in a highly threatening tone. You saw him still shaking with fear but shook his head as if to say that he would obey. So you turned your gaze to Michael. \u201cAs for you\u2026 you are the only other person here that knows me to any extent. So now that I have silenced Percy\u2019s tongue, we need to have a chat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilenced Percy?\u201d Michael asked, not as scared as Percy but still highly on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou impress me. Even with me holding you blink away from death, you still ask about someone else. Anyway, I\u2019ve implanted a Hell Hound in him. If he so much as types a key stroke about, to, or against me or mine in any fashion the Hell Hound will tear him apart very painfully and very slowly. Now about you\u2026\u201d You answered and moved on. \u201cI implanted the Hell Hound into him because I don\u2019t trust him. However, from your mind, I can see that you are a different person as far as trust is concerned. I don\u2019t think I have to keep an eye on you, do I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 No, you don\u2019t.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I would hate to send something dark and dangerous to deal with you. So, this is what I want. You and this\u2026 \u201cDivision\u201d will leave me and my family/ friends alone and I will leave Division alone and not order your or any other\u2019s death. But if I find that letting you two live was a mistake\u2026 well then I will have to clean house\u2026 understood?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we\u2026\u201d Percy started but you clenched his throat and he squawked at the sudden pressure, gasping for air as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, Human.\u201d You bellowed at him with a glare then looked back to Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yes\u2026 WE will not pursue you or your people.\u201d Michael said out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d You stated then let them go. Michael landed on his feet while Percy, once again, slumped to the ground, this time gasping his throat and coughing. Shortly, they both were on their feet and looking to you, wondering if you had anything else to tell them. To that you started disappearing again, Michael\u2019s eyes bugged out as this was the first time he had seen you do that. \u201cWord of warning, this was me asking nicely. Betray the small amount of trust I have in you at your own peril.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you disappeared from the room and zoomed through the air toward where you felt a Reaper. It sensed you and tried to flee but you used your power to surround it, then formed in front of it. It was obviously scared out of its pants\u2026. If it had pants. But either way, it was intently listening. Even an almost soulless creature like this had enough sense to know that you wanted something from it, because even a glancing wind with your energy in it could kill this thing. Its life was in your hands. As if to further beg, it bowed to you so you didn\u2019t need to see its rotten looking face that almost made you hurl as soon as you saw it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a meal for you.\u201d You stated, your voice making the creature shudder, both in excitement. Without using any Vampire energy you sent it a mental identification of Frank Kohler. \u201cThat man has a great amount of magic energy and has proven to be unworthy and my enemy. You are to go and have your fill of him and him alone. However, leave his health untouched and a very small amount of magic left in him. I want him to remember what he lost and how. Understood?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature nodded without looking up. It must\u2019ve known that it was unsightly for most of everything else. You had even heard rumors that they didn\u2019t like looking at each other. It also screeched a type of affirmative screech. You slightly cringed at the sound. It was like nails on a chalkboard. With that you let him go and he rushed off to do your bidding. You followed to make sure it knew that he was not to cross you. You slightly marveled at how it just bypassed the magical barriers around the Kohler house and went straight for Frank as he was trying to leave the house, probably to run from you. He dropped his things but was too late to do anything as the thing grabbed him and started sucking the magic out of him. As you suspected, when Frank was forced to look into the face of the Reaper he hurled. But since the Reaper was holding him, he hurled all over his front. When the Reaper was done it dropped him and sped off, to get as far away from you as possible. As grateful as it was for the meal, it didn\u2019t have any plans to stay anywhere near you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had a suspicion that Percy was the one behind it, but as this was far from attacking your family, you let it slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course I am. You know, I\u2019ve been working, fighting, training, and all that. Even as a child I\u2019ve never been here before, but always wanted to.\u201d You replied as you looked around at your uncles and Aunts trying to settle down their kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Disney promotes the use of Magic. While most of that is in movies, I would put money on the fact that they have some form of magic user here. And for them to not attract Reapers or not have problems with them\u2026 they must have a very impressive form of it and defenses.\u201d Kelsey replied, knowing all too well that your dislike for magic, due in no small part to the Kohlers, was very high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I also know that a great deal of the show that isn\u2019t magic will be lost on me because of my mind and body\u2019s habit for looking to the flaws, it might deter some entertainment out of it. But I am here to have fun and to nerd out a little bit. Let\u2019s just have fun as humans. If they by chance have magic here, I am hoping that they have a system that lets people like us have fun as well. An organization like them can\u2019t be this big without having ran into mythical beings before. So, being so known for hospitality, they probably have that covered as well.\u201d You replied, almost begging for her to have fun as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d Brad said to which you Kelsey\u2019s mother just nodded in agreement as she moved along. \u201cDisney has had a long standing relationship with most, if not all, types of beings. Even King has gone there once or twice. A great deal of people with actual abilities go there then stay and help make Disney\u2026 even more magical, real magic. Trust me, having someone that is adept at magic perfecting a magic show is much more efficient. You will not be disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!!! This is going to be the best ever!!!\u201d Isaac replied. He was excited beyond belief about going to Disney. But now hearing that there was actual magic there made it all the more exciting. He then went over and started spreading the word, which made the recently calmed kids go into a frenzy again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo. How relaxed are we allowed to get?\u201d Kelsey\u2019s Mother asked with a wink to you that meant she probably wanted to have some Succubus fun. Kelsey just shook her head. Sure she had those urges too, but aside from wanting to impress you with her restraint, she was still a teen and was embarrassed about her Mother talking openly about sensual or sexual activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it easy. I am guessing that Disney has measures in place to keep both their guests and their employees relatively safe. It would really stink if our fun and relaxing time was cut short for that reason.\u201d You answered in a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know that full well. I tried many years ago to have \u2018fun\u2019 here, Succubus style. Let\u2019s just say that there are very compelling reasons why I will not be indulging.\u201d She said. It was lucky that she dodged the graphic terminology because one of your younger cousins heard and came to ask her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mean Mickey will keep magic people in line?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet he does.\u201d She said as she stroked his cheek, making him blush and rush off excited as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an easy trick for her, but one Kelsey was just learning. Not only could a Succubus compel people in a non-slave manner by kissing them on the cheek instead of lips, but they could invoke certain emotions but just their touch. It was something to do with their body heat and pheromones being injected into people. While their lips were the most potent form of this, only following their private area, they could with training make their touch do a very small version of this. You had allowed them to do so on your family only to help with their training to resist attractants and such\u2026 and as long as they didn\u2019t go too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Mom...!\u201d Kelsey moaned in an irritated tone that all teens had, then she continued to walk with you to begin a much deserved family Vacation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are known partially for hospitality for a reason\u2026\u201d Brad answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all were brought into a room with a table of people sitting at it and a large pentagram looking mark on the floor.

Honestly he looked like a real time version of Dumbledore from Harry Potter, complete with the robes and everything. You could sense great amounts of magic from him, which put you on edge and wondered if he was in fact Dumbledore. After all, you could travel to other movie realms, why not someone else\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am\u2026?\u201d The old man gestured to Kelsey\u2019s Mother.

When she reached the center and stood still it started to glow and more symbols appeared and seamed to float in the air, before coming to rest on the tablets the group of people were holding at the table. Some mumbled in an approving manner and one younger young man followed her form as she exited the circle. \u201cAh, Ms. Dremer, welcome back! I trust you will have another enjoyable time in this land of Magic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I plan to!\u201d She stated as she settled by the exit door, waiting for the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis happened in a like fashion many times, then Brad entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Kitsune, it is rare we have someone of your stature here. But seeing as you helped build this place, we will afford you every comfort available. However, we must ask, why have you returned? We thought you left to be on the K-9 council. Have they let you go???\u201d Asked the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. I was given a task.\u201d He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat task would that be?\u201d The old man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn short, to do whatever this one says.\u201d Brad replied as he pointed to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would\u2026?\u201d The old man started amongst the murmuring of the others, but then he seemed to suspect something and nodded to which Brad exited the Circle, leaving only you at the entrance, looking nervously at the circle. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, young man, it won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 just don\u2019t like magic very much. I don\u2019t trust it.\u201d You replied, still not really relishing whatever magic was at work here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey you travel in strange company. A Kitsune like Brad has much magic at his disposal\u2026.\u201d The old man stated and the others chuckled at, to which you glared at them and they seemed to cut their laughter short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 My friend here has been on the receiving end of some\u2026 misbehaving mages in the recent past\u2026\u201d Brad explained, to which they seemed to change from a nervous comical response, to a pitiful one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see. Well, rest assured, we are not here to harm you in any way. This circle will only allow us to better serve you, one of our honored guests. It couldn\u2019t harm you even if we wanted it to. Please, trust me, if you don\u2019t trust the circle\u2026\u201d The old man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what is your name?\u201d You asked. \u201cSo I can rip your head off if you decide to imprison me for torture or something like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Dumbledore\u2026 Ah, I see my name has you thinking of the movie, doesn\u2019t it. Well, I was placed here by a lovely and deceptively young lady with a thing for blood\u2026 if that helps\u2026\u201d Dumbledore said. This confirmed that Miss. Isibelle had brought him here from another realm to reside in this world and probably protect or help protect Disney. Even if Disney wasn\u2019t associated with Harry Potter at the moment, Miss. Isibelle still had put him here for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further objections, you stepped into the circle and went directly to the center. They seemed to be used to that response. It did seem that every mythical being in the world had a deep respect, appreciation, and fear of even the term Vampire. But the Circle didn\u2019t glow blue like it did with the others, instead it turned red and exploded with symbols that made their way to the tablets. This made the people at the table, very nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness!\u201d Dumbledore stated in partial awe, and partial delight. \u201cSo, it is you, at last. Lady Isibelle had said she would be passing soon. I wondered when we would have the pleasure of meeting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope that is a good thing\u2026 The last person from\u2026 another realm that was waiting for me on the order of Miss. Isibelle ripped me apart\u2026\u201d You stated and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness no Boy!\u201d Dumbledore gasped. \u201cIf anything, you will be treated like royalty while you are here. I guarantee, by the time you leave, you will no longer be frightened by Magic, but be delighted. I will make sure of that!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sent your family along with Kelsey and the others to start unpacking. You had seen that some of your younger cousins were anxious to get their Disney Vacation started and refusing them too much longer might not be such a good idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something you wanted?\u201d You asked Dumbledore as he turned to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking. You see, Lady Isibelle, was a wonderful woman. She brought me here and gave me a measure of immortality, while I am here and effectively stopping time from my world. I am very grateful to her for allowing me to remain here as long as she had\u2026\u201d Dumbledore started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you would like to return to your time?\u201d You asked, assuming he wanted to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEventually, and I suspect that you might want to visit my realm at that time. But that is not why I stopped you\u2026\u201d He responded. He then held out a lavishly decorated box that, even without holding it, you could tell had immense magical sealing properties. You took it, then hesitantly opened it. Inside was a ring that looked very simple but for the color of blood red. You could also tell that the box was containing the even more immense magical energy that seemed to resonate from the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you heard me, before. But I really don\u2019t like magic at the moment.\u201d You said in the most polite tone possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Isibelle was well aware of your kind\u2019s weakness for magic. That is why she commissioned me to make this ring. She wanted to give you the opportunity to visit places like my world without fear of magic.\u201d Dumbledore started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly does the ring do?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cPutting it simply, it blocks out any magical energy that is used on you, like a shield.\u201d Dumbledore said as you glanced at the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t something like this given to everyone?\u201d You asked, thinking that there was a side effect that might kill you. Despite him being here and making this from Miss. Isibelle\u2019s request, you still didn\u2019t trust him as a mage quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause everyone has a little bit of magic in them. It is connected to their life force. All except undead level of creatures. While you are not completely undead, you also share the fact that you have no magic in you, which is why you can\u2019t perform magic. To that effect, if a human were able to wear this ring, it would kill them because it would block their minute magical power connected to their life force. That is why I put a block on it. No one that can die from it will be able to handle it\u2026 And it is keyed to your specific DNA, once you put it on.\u201d Dumbledore answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I want to take it off then?\u201d You asked, looking at the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, its effect is both a blessing and a curse. Sure it blocks magic from reaching you, but that doesn\u2019t exclude any helpful spells you may or may not want to partake in. Such as healing or even power striping spells, like the ones here at Disney. That ring will block ALL magic, good or bad.\u201d Dumbledore replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have power striping spells here?\u201d You asked, slightly alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! Think about it. How much fun will it REALLY be to go on a roller coaster? You are probably a hundred times faster than our fastest ones. Not to mention that the \u2018magic shows\u2019 may be lost on you, as there is a fair amount of slight of hand rather than actual magic. So the experience wouldn\u2019t be as good for you\u2026 unless we were able to bring you down to a more human level to enjoy it. It also keeps a level of security here. Wither it be Vampire or giant, Succubus or wind sprite; not too many will have an advantage over your average day to day human\u2026 making the place that much safer.\u201d Dumbledore explained in a calm manner that helped you calm down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut putting this ring on would protect me from even those spells?\u201d You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Dumbledore repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I lose it, or someone steals it?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is quite impossible, after you put it on. Have you seen my realm\u2019s movies?\u201d He asked, to which you nodded. \u201cIt is similar to the Sword of Gryffindor. If it is separated from you, once it is keyed to your DNA, then when you need it, it will simply appear for you to find it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I put it on now?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, such a polite young man.\u201d Dumbledore complimented, then continued. \u201cYes. In fact I would recommend you do so. Just so I can see for myself that you were bound to it properly and no one has an opportunity to steal this VERY powerful magic ring. You can always take if off afterward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then reached for the ring. It was strange. You had assumed that reaching for such a magical item would make you nervous and agitated. But on the contrary, it made you calmer as you got closer. You assumed that it was because of its effect. A protection ring would make you feel protected after all. When you touched it, you felt an immense amount of power flow through you. Almost enough to make you jump back, or fall back more like it. Anyway, you grasped it and slowly put it on your right ring finger. You could feel the power flowing through you subside and settle, then feel as if it wasn\u2019t even there. You pulled it off, just to make sure it could come off and that it wasn\u2019t a trap of some kind, then put it back on. This time there was no power surge. So you took it off and put it back in its box, sealing it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust you are satisfied\u2026?\u201d Dumbledore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think so. I mean I guess I won\u2019t really know until I wear it and someone throws a lot of magical energy to me in the attempt to do me harm.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a Vampire, young man, I will be surprised if you have to wait very long for such a thing. Have you ever known an enemy NOT use a weakness of their target?\u201d He answered, you thought about it and shrugged an agreement. \u201cBut worry not, while you are at Disney, such attacks will NOT happen. Believe me when I say that much more powerful Witches, Wizards, and Mages have made this place of magic a VERY safe place. I implore you to try NOT to have fun, see how that works out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, you smiled to him. \u201cThank you, Mr. Dumbledore.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will have to talk to your parents to compliment them on the polite young man they have raised.\u201d He complimented with his trademark smile, before you two parted ways and you joined your family to enjoy your vacation in Disney.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had felt, as you entered the parks, that the intense magical energy was taking away a very large portion of your active powers. While you had no doubt that if you needed it, your full power would still be accessible, you were currently enjoying something you hadn\u2019t experienced in years\u2026 many year. That is, what it felt like to be human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admit, this is really fun.\u201d You relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to a parade and was delighted that you, at times, couldn\u2019t tell what was magic and what was not. Your family seemed to have a better time when they saw how happy you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right!?\u201d Kelsey replied as she enjoyed a funnel cake. \u201cEverything tastes better here. Usually I hate these things, but I swear that I will gain 100 pounds if I don\u2019t stop now\u2026 or after one last bite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really do miss these tastes\u2026\u201d You said in agreement as you took a bite out of a turkey leg. You looked at each other, smiled then handed each other the food you were enjoying then continued eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, can I have a word?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked as you and Kelsey moved about the crowd. Your family was too big to go everywhere with each other. So most scattered and were having fun. After all, each were given an endless credit limit to spend on as they wished, you were all instructed to charge it to the rooms and it would be taken care of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d You answered as you took a seat and Kelsey moved to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlone, if you don\u2019t mind dear.\u201d Kelsey\u2019s Mother said, which got an almost offended look from her. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long, I promise. Don\u2019t worry, nothing funny.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but hurry. I want to show Caleb everything about Disney and we only have a week to do it.\u201d Kelsey stated then hurried into a store that caught her eye. It looked to be one that specialized in selling glass and crystal things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you need to see me about?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I understand that I can\u2019t force you to do anything, Caleb, nor would I want to. If you don\u2019t mind me saying so, you have become like a son to me. Not that there is anything wrong with your Mother\u2026\u201d She stumbled around nervously. There was obviously something serious or semi-serious on her mind, but didn\u2019t want to offend you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think of you the same. I consider you all family at this point. I am glad that you feel the same!\u201d You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, well, and forgive me for being blunt, but I worry for Kelsey.\u201d Mrs. Dremer stated rapidly, trying to get it all out before she could stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I know that you are\u2026 not as insightful about women, girls, and like topic, especially what is on their minds and how we work. Wither we be human or of mythical standing. But there is something that I thought obvious enough at this point. Kelsey\u2026 she likes you. I dare say that she may love you, not just in the family sense either.\u201d Mrs. Dremer stated, a sense of nervousness and unease in her demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I am clueless when it comes to this kind of thing\u2026 Why would she be interested in me? She could get anyone she wants\u2026?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, there you go again. You must realize by now that you are very attractive. Not just your body either. Being\u2026 what you are, has made you very desirable. Even if you were a horrible person, your body, power, and status would be enough to invoke responses from any female regardless of species. But your honor, kindness, loyalty, and other morally good traits make you even more so. You don\u2019t know how good of a catch you are.\u201d Mrs. Dremer answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d you started. But apparently Mrs. Dremer had no intention of having you finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, really, your humility is admirable. But what I am stating is fact. You will find many people trying to gain your favor. But this is where I fear for Kelsey. She\u2026 well, as I\u2019ve said, she likes you and perhaps more than that.\u201d Mrs. Dremer stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you want me to\u2026?\u201d You asked, wondering if she was getting to the \u2018stay away from my daughter\u2019 speech or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Caleb. I couldn\u2019t find a better person for my daughter to love. But there is another issue here. One that humans in this situation, don\u2019t have to deal with.\u201d Mrs. Dremer hinted. She left you thinking for a moment until she saw your expression change with understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are talking about her having kids, aren\u2019t you?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Forgive me Caleb, but I know that you are incapable of having them. One of the safeguards for being a Vampire. But, a Succubus, we are lucky to have 2 kids in the 200 years we are alive.\u201d She responded then continued after she saw you were following. \u201cThe thing is, Caleb, if you two were to fall in love and spend your lives together, you would outlive her and she would have NO children. After all, why would she love another when she has you? You two would probably find it a very bad thing to have sex with anyone but each other. So, she wouldn\u2019t even be able to contribute that way. And, again forgive me for my bluntness, Lady Isibelle did a number on the Succubus race about a thousand years ago. We, as a species, need every baby Succubus we can get. Each one is precious, even the ones that MIGHT be born. As much as I love my husband. I know he will die and I will have to find another quickly to have another child in the next 50 years\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped talking as you both saw Kelsey come out and look over at you two. Her mother gave he a shake of the head to tell her that she wasn\u2019t done talking to you, to which Kelsey looked fondly at  you then moved on to another store. You had a feeling she was racking up quite a bill. The thought of it brought a smile on your face then realized that Mrs. Dremer was right. While you and Kelsey had a very strong relationship as friends, it was now clear that Kelsey wanted more. It was like your eyes were opened to all the hints she had dropped over that last few years. They had become stronger and more obvious, and for all her attempts, you were still too clueless to pick them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d You asked, finally understanding and taking it seriously.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Growing up in a Christian home, there were certain rules, not to mention society rules on letting your significant other have sexual relations with another person, particularly if you decided to escalate it to marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, I know that you are a good boy and you have been raised to see things a certain way. But a Succubus is not a human, just like you are not. We of the Succubus race are literally made to have sex with humans and multiple partners. Granted we usually have a significant amount of loyalty once we choose our love mate, but we are not humans. I am not saying that you must go by this code as well. But you must understand; if you want a relationship with Kelsey, then I implore you to think of her as she is and what she means to her people. She needs to produce a child.

Wither they were right or wrong was beyond your understanding at the moment, but it was still there. In this case, the fate of entire race was at stake. You also had a vampire pride thing going on. You now realized that you also had feelings for Kelsey. Your own cluelessness was blinding you that she would have feelings for you. But now you understood and, as a Vampire, wanted her to yourself. Both feelings were an obstacle that was preventing Kelsey from moving on and being the mother she was meant to be for her people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen does she have to have kids?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did so rather late\u2026\u201d Mrs. Dremer started then continued, \u201c\u2026 I was 70 when I had Kelsey. I will need to have another when I am 170 at the earliest. Leaving me 30 years to raise my next daughter\u201d She explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t a lot of time\u2026\u201d You stated, still heavily thinking about what you were going to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I make a suggestion?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly\u2026\u201d You answered, deeply hoping she had the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you were to have a relationship with her until she finds a good friend that you both like, and marries him. That way, you can continue your relationship, assumingly with her husband\u2019s blessing, but while he is alive you be their family\u2019s guardian. I understand that it may be the only time you may be considered a father figure\u2026 In this case, you stay connected but save your own morals. The way the Succubus mind works, her husband will have a connection with her that will prioritize him over you during their marriage. That will help her relationship with him. You, will still be there when he passes on and your love for each other remain, with a daughter to help Kelsey raise.\u201d Mrs. Dremer suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if we go our separate ways at some point?\u201d You asked, unsure if that would put you at odds with their family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for saying this, but that would be problem solved. Either way, Kelsey would be happy, and have children. Again, we are Succubus, our minds are ok with that kind of thing.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I do now, about this whole thing?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 YOU are probably the only one I would allow near her in that manner until she is at least 40. So, take it as slowly as you two wish. But I suggest you be honest with her so you both can start searching for her future husband.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, this may be more difficult that I am used to\u2026\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are a Vampire, can\u2019t be harder that being shot at and taking down enemies all the time\u2026?\u201d Mrs. Dremer said, hoping to cheer you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullets I can handle, even silver ones. Girls and feelings\u2026, that is uncharted for me.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as a veteran in this sort of thing, you can count on me if you need the advice.\u201d Mrs. Dremer replied with a smile and drew you into a genuine hug. It was obvious she was nervous about this whole thing for a while, both in addressing you as the Vampire and her Daughter\u2019s emotional health in this regard. \u201cThank you Caleb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!!!\u201d Kelsey said as she saw her mother embracing you and ran over. \u201cMOM\u2026!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, I was just saying \u2018thank you\u2019,\u201d Mrs. Dremer defended and assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why is he acting weird?\u201d She asked as you two separated and you glanced at her in a new fashion. But you decided to head this off and be assertive with her for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelsey, would you like to go out with me?\u201d You asked, almost making her fall over and her Mother to smile ear to ear. She would probably thank you more over later for making it seem like she had something to do with this dream come true for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!!!\u201d She shrieked, making a few around you to look over. But being in the most happy place in the world, to some, made the sudden happy outburst oddly normal and they just smiled and went about their business. Kelsey threw herself at you and hung around your neck, planting a long overdue and strangely well practiced kiss on your lips. A normal kiss from a succubus was deep enough, not to mention one on the lips, like she was doing. It had the power to do many powerful things to many creatures, specifically humans. But this was like she overflowed everything she was feeling in her emotions of the last few years into the kiss, actually making you blush heavily for a moment. She must\u2019ve known that kissing wasn\u2019t your expertise. In fact, she was now your first in this fashion. Feeding, you were well versed, kissing\u2026 not so much. So she unlocked her lips from yours and looked deep into your eyes. \u201cTook you long enough\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were slightly nervous about spreading that you were now in a romantic relationship with Kelsey. It also turned out that Mrs. Dremer was right, Kelsey was completely ok with the whole looking for a mate thing. You both decided that you would constantly look for a husband for her. You talked at length about different things. In the end, your relationship would be official but not exclusive. You both had enough feelings for each other to not cheat on the other. But the definition of \u2018cheating\u2019 was different for you both. As a Vampire, she understood what that entitled and would give you enough slack as far as feeding and like activities. Likewise, you knew that her being a Succubus would require her to do many things, kissing and having sex with other people included, not to mention finding a husband that she would love more than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you understood each other and more had a relationship that would last despite what each other\u2019s race had each of you do. She greatly liked the idea of having a Vampire protector for her future children. That was something that not many people in history had. As for your families, her side was overjoyed at the news. Being intimately involved with a vampire was a definite leg up. But your family was a bit concerned. Then again, they had no idea what a relationship between a Vampire that sucks people\u2019s blood and a Succubus that is designed to please humans sensually and sexually would be like. To be fair, neither did the two of you. However, they were happy for you none the less, and they already knew Kelsey as a part of the family anyway, similar to Eve. On that topic, Eve grilled Kelsey, being overprotective and all that. It was a strange sight to see the giant spider and the Succubus that were deep friends with each other go at it. But in the end they came to some kind of girl understanding\u2026 that you had no desire to understand. You were having a hard enough time with this  new relationship thing to try and understand how women did this kind of thing with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot fair man!\u201d Colin exclaimed as you and Kelsey told your human friends at school the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Kelsey asked with a planted pouting face that melted him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are\u2026 like the hottest person\u2026 ever. That means I can\u2019t flirt with you anymore!\u201d He broke out. It was true, while he was a guy and one that was leagues better than a majority of your other classmates, he did have a tendency to flirt and \u2018play\u2019 the field a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I think you seriously scored\u2026!\u201d Tou replied as he gave you a fist pound gesture, which you met with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you had a chance with her anyway\u2026\u201d Dani teased. Unlike Colin, Dani wasn\u2019t really interested in a relationship at the moment. Though he still blushed every once in a while at something Kelsey did, he was a bit more shy and standoffish about it. He would mainly tease Colin about his flirting attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Colin\u2026 you can still flirt with me if you want\u2026!\u201d Kelsey said in a gentle tone. It may have sounded like a mock suggestion, but you knew she was serious. It was really a small boon that she could give him if it was really that important to him. She was a Succubus after all, allowing some flirting was by far the smallest sensual exercise that she partook in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! Now that you\u2019re Caleb\u2019s girl, I can\u2019t. I may be a playa, but I\u2019m not like that!\u201d He said in a slightly serious tone. \u201cHe\u2019s my boy, there\u2019s no messing with his girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you sweet!\u201d Kelsey exclaimed in a genuine smile. There were odd instances where she would be impressed by the actions of humans, and you could tell that this was one of them. Then again, she was still a High School student so\u2026 emotions and sentiments like that went a good distance with her. The comment however made Colin blush and look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rung at that point and you all started to your classes. Now it was just you and Kelsey walking to class. There was rules against PDA in school, but most ignored it. You, however, wanted to obey the rules. So the most intimate things that the two of you did on school grounds was hold hands and hug. A light peck on the cheek at a game would be ok, but nothing that would be construed as disrespectful by the adults. A fact that Mrs. Dremer appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Why\u2019d it take you so long?\u201d Kelsey asked as you both walked to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as I\u2019ve said before, part of it was my cluelessness. But\u2026\u201d You started then thought before continuing. \u201c\u2026 I guess I was just figuring that you could have anyone in the world, so why pick someone like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone like you????\u201d She asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ve never really had a high opinion of myself. I never thought that I would be someone that a girl would like. Then I became a Vampire and the issue of having kids came the front and put me down further. So, when I looked at you, someone that needs to have as many kids as possible\u2026\u201d You said, then trailed off, not really wanting to finish the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, you are the Vampire. Anyone in the world would die to just get to meet you, some quite literally. Kids or not, you are definitely worth it!\u201d She said strictly, but also with an aura of kindness. She didn\u2019t want to sound like she was scolding you. \u201cWe both know that I will have to have kids with someone else some day. And my mind will put them and my future husband above you. That is just the way it is. But do know, that the way I feel for you won\u2019t die. As long as I am around, I will always feel love for you. You know that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do\u2026 I just never thought that before.\u201d You said then looked her in the eye. \u201cI am eternally grateful that you do, and I love you as well. Now, more than just a sister, but never less than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!!!\u201d She stated happily. \u201cNow, there is a whole school of jealous kids we have to entertain!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cA what?\u201d You asked as King talked with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA MYTHICAL MEETING\u201d he repeated. Regardless of how small he made his voice, there was just no raining in a Amarok\u2019s voice that was this powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that? And why do I have to go?\u201d You asked. It was almost the end of the school year and you were focusing more so on the next realm you were going to as well as your new and developing relationship with Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the general conference that is held every 50 years\u2026\u201d Started a Kitsune that was to King\u2019s side. \u201c\u2026 it is a time that ALL the mythical creatures that want to have a say in the laws of mythical creatures to have a say. From where we can live to dominating the earth and eating humans, all laws are determined there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEating humans\u2026?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, most mythical beings feed off of humans for something. You drink their blood, Succubus feed off their sexual desire, Werewolves and mermaids off their flesh, and the list goes on. In the case of feeding on humans, a law is made for each race, since each has a different way of interacting with humans.\u201d The Kitsune replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense. But what is my involvement? You said that it is VERY important that I come in particular???\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cINDEED!\u201d King replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, the first conference was established by one of the first Vampires. As your power is overall stronger than any of the other species, it is crucial that you know and understand all the laws. If something happens between races you need to know how to respond to it. While you are more or less above the law, you are also looked to as a solution in conflict between groups. That, and the moral of those there is always heightened when the Vampire of that age is present.\u201d The Kitsune explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how do I get there?\u201d You asked, just excepting the fact that it would be best if you went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be shown the way. Your\u2026 predecessors made it VERY difficult to enter this place. Making sure that those that aren\u2019t welcome can enter, either by accident or in attempt to sabotage.\u201d The Kitsune started, took a breath then continued. \u201cMost races are afforded only one human servant to do their bidding while there. You could enter as a race\u2019s human. That is if you want to observe the conference hidden, at first. Otherwise you would be announced upon arrival and be swarmed by people trying to sway your opinions of their races. This way, you can see what they are like before all the butt kissing starts. As you have seen with the mages, they are not always what they appear on the outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me, is the mages coming to this thing?\u201d You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 although, you could ban them if you want. But, to be fair, you\u2019ve only met one family of mages. There are many more, and more powerful mages out there. Like the ones at Disney. I\u2019ve heard that you enjoyed magic while there, correct?\u201d Brad said as he entered, taking the other Kistune\u2019s place, the other bowing as he took his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I did, I still don\u2019t like the Kohlers very well.\u201d You replied. It was true, you wore the ring that Dumbledore had given you, and was actually contemplating going to the Harry Potter realm on your next Summer Vacation. But the Kohlers had a bad taste in your mouth. \u201cSo, there are families or nobility among the mages that I can contact about them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, you can meet many of them at this conference. It will be quite obvious when we all take our seats to start the main law making section, as only the leaders of each individual race is allowed a seat at the table, sort of speak.\u201d Brad explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I guess going to this thing wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. Who am I going with?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is up to you. As much as we would like you to come with us\u2026 if you want to stay hidden until the law making section, then I would recommend not coming with us. Traditionally, there is only one that we would escort to the conference, that would be Lady Issibelle. So, that would be like putting a huge neon sign above you that says that you are the new Vampire. I would suggest either the Succubus race, Kelsey in particular, or Eve\u2026 as no one would suspect you to be coming with her\u2026 most don\u2019t know who you are, much more that you are friends with her. Spiders usually keep to themselves\u2026.\u201d Brad explained. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, this is\u2026 new.\u201d You said as you entered the Mythical conference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been prepared for there being a good amount of species and their one allotted human, but there were literally thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of species and people there. You saw everything from giants, orcs, other spider queens, and other very not humanoid creatures to the President of the United States. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d Kelsey asked as she walked with you. You had contemplated going with Eve, but with Kelsey you would be able to walk with her, not behind her like a slave. \u201cThe attendance will be even higher this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause of you, of course. You are a big deal you know? People keep track best they can when a new Vampire will be among them. They want to know who you are, to either kiss your butt or steer clear of you if they are doing something that\u2026 is less than legal by our standards.\u201d Kelsey explained as her Mother knew she couldn\u2019t give you too much recognition, yet, so she just pat you on the shoulder and went to socialize with other Succubus looking people. Also unlike normal, everyone was in their real forms. Suppose there was no use hiding here, except you at the moment. \u201cLet\u2019s go explore a bit. And\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if I have to be demeaning or offensive in front of others until you reveal yourself. I don\u2019t want to upset some giant or Mermaid and have them take you out of spite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it, want me all to yourself do you?\u201d You joked to which she nudged you playfully, her tail wrapping around you a little, then you two were off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was in and under the ocean so that the water type monsters could come, but it was also like a gigantic covered stadium that would probably house a few states if needed. Unlike your normal preference, magic was the way to get here and you didn\u2019t overly mind. It still made your skin crawl a little bit though and as soon as you got there you put your glyph on a few things to make it so you didn\u2019t have to do it that way again. Most of them nodded at Kelsey and at best overlooked you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is the President here?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell usually a representative for the U.N. comes to these things so they can advise the world leaders on what we\u2019ve decided. They really don\u2019t have any power here. Most of the time no human leader wants to be here, surrounded by so many creatures that can at best eat or seduce them. So it looks like he drew the short straw, or however they decide such things.\u201d Kelsey answered as they walked and noticed how uncomfortable he was, especially since he was all alone and wasn\u2019t permitted even another human for defense, since he was his human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb???\u201d Came a voice that you knew all too well. You both turned as Matt Malcame came over. He was as large as usual. Considering his wrestling carrier you always wondered where he got so strong, for a human at least. He saw Kelsey, recognized her, then saw her other features that said more than enough to divert his eyes downward in respect. \u201cMa\u2019am\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, find me when you are done socializing.\u201d Kelsey said in a authoritative tone, she was good at acting and she was able to pull this off beautifully. You nodded and bowed a little to which she turned and walked away, you could feel the smirk and snicker she had at your two\u2019s little show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Matt.\u201d You greeted with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 So you here with Kelsey huh? Makes sense I guess. Always wondered why you two were so close in school.\u201d Matt replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you could say that. Who are you with?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy family are in service to some trolls. They are\u2026 alright I guess, don\u2019t think much of us lowly humans though.\u201d He said as he nodded over to some large 30 foot tall trolls. Each had a human with them, one of them was in the middle of taking a long lick of one of them, leaving their drool on the poor girl, then setting her half hazardly on the ground. You recognized her as Matt\u2019s younger Sister. You could feel his blood boil a little, but he seemed good at hiding it as his composer didn\u2019t change at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like they have an appetite for humans though\u2026\u201d You noticed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey keep it in check. They generally don\u2019t kill or eat my family as long as we are of use. They got rules that they can only eat their servants or criminals that are on death row. If you\u2019ve heard of those inmates that are that way and secretly put to death, they are some that are sent to my Masters.\u201d Matt explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you get\u2026 tasted as well?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaturally. We are chosen by a member of their family, usually at a young age. While I still must obey any of them, my direct Master is one of the head family daughters. In human form she goes to our school as a 7th grader now. But\u2026 yeah, she likes to lick me clean after working out and stuff\u2026 \u2018clean\u2019 being a very loose term.\u201d Matt replied as he nodded over to a shorter (about 20 feet tall) troll with longer black hair. There were many types of trolls in the group and you were at least a bit satisfied that the one he was paired with was more attractive troll wise than some of the other drooling messes that were around. She almost looked human, if not for the multiple sets of fangs, sharp teeth, hard skin, obvious height, and slightly overdeveloped muscle structure. You saw a long tongue come from her mouth to lick some residual drool from her lips and fangs. Unlike most of her kind she seemed attentive to how she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHUMAN!!! Get your useless ass over here!\u201d Ordered the troll in question as she looked over and saw you two talking. You almost missed it but you bowed at her gaze as Matt hurried over. She seemed pleased by your reaction and shoved Matt to a place by her side, holding him there with her a hand that was putting a good deal of pressure on him as evidence to the slightly strained face and the obvious stress on his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep your eyes off my daughter, meat!\u201d Growled another troll as an impact hit your body and flung you a few feet across the floor. You thought about rebounding like you normally did against people like him. But you were trying hard to pass as a believable human. So you let your body thud against the ground in a way that sounded bad but no bones would break on a normal human. The Troll just growled at you as others nodded and laughed at the situation, at you in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your eye downcast as others pushed you around while you made your way back to Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, human.\" Kelsey said with a superior tone, then clung into your neck as if kissing it like she would do to play with a human. But she did it to get near your ear. \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to meet the trolls and a few others. Not a fan at the moment.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most of us put up a show like we are doing. Just give it a bit of time, but remember it. I think it will be a big piece of humble pie when they realize they were pushing YOU around like that.\" Kelsey said than distanced herself a little and led you around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your vision downcast as she socialized with people. To this most made fun of you or still pushed you around. Kelsey played it off and told them that she was the only one allowed to push you around, to which they honored her request. You met mermaids, who were snacking on some human limbs. Your predatory instinct wanted to join, while your mind was repulsed, even more so when they almost pulled you in to join them. You could feel an attractant let loose at you, but you pretended to be too entranced by Kelsey to be overdone by theirs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only time you broke you cover, was when you saw the Kohlers walk around. Most of the monsters gave them a wide birth. Apparently, even if they weren't the highest in the mage system, they were up there a bit. You glanced up and locked eyes with both Beth and her Father for a flicker of a second. Your deathly glare told them all they needed that you were being treated as a human for a reason and they had best walk on egg shells around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the meeting was about to start and Kelsey led you into the room. Just like outside, it was like a stadium, housing all kinds of creatures. But this time they had their own spots and a section of chairs that showcased the prominent heads of their people. You saw the President take a seat in his chair, King sat in his spot, right next to a chair with a clear purpose of you being in it. Likewise, each seat seemed to scream for the person it belonged to, as if there couldn't be anyone else to sit in them. This was going to be interesting. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>People started filing into the stadium, the big wigs of each species in the seats in the center\u2026 which was sizable as it held hundreds of thousands of predators and most just a tad bigger than a human. Above the center there was an observation area that was used for those not partaking in the main decision making process but want to observe. Like Kelsey said, this one would be one that they all wanted to witness, to see you. Of course, they all had their human slaves, that as a side effect of serving their masters, got a front row seat to this event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long are you going to wait to take YOUR seat?\u201d Kelsey asked as you stood beside her and her Mother, both wanting to know your answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEventually. I don\u2019t want too much commotion\u2026 yet\u2026 not because of me anyway.\u201d You said than noticed a species on the other side of your seat. Considering that King was insanely powerful and at the seat\u2019s left, you wondered what your relation was with the species that was on the right. You looked at them and it was both hard to believe and mistake what they were\u2026 dragons. \u201cWhat is their deal?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the dragons?\u201d Mrs. Dremer asked, this time she knew that Kelsey didn\u2019t know what she was talking about with this question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You answered simply. You took stock to what they looked like. You had seen pictures of different types of dragons in fantasy sites and whatnot. These ones at least stood on all fours and were just as large as King. That was the main difference, while King was impressive, even next to the Dragons, there was only one of him and his mate at his size\u2026 Almost all the dragons were his size. It was clear that they were a species that was not to be taken lightly. As if to agree, your genetic knowledge put in a healthy amount of respect for them. However, unlike the feeling you originally got from King, there was a complete peace with them, as if they posed no threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragons have been the servants and friends of the age\u2019s Vampire since\u2026 well as far back as anyone can remember or find in history. They are by far the strongest predator here, other than you, and number enough to probably topple nations if so directed. To top it off, like the Reapers, they are immune to magic. But unlike them, they are almost more proficient with magic than the mages are. Since, as you obviously know, Vampires are weak against magic, having a deathly loyal group like them is more than welcome. Trust me, even if they have  magic, they are your strongest allies in the room, even over King.\u201d Kelsey responded, slightly put off as she had to admit there was yet another species that were higher trust wise than her to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does seem like they would be good friends to have.\u201d You said, wondering if dragons were that powerful, what your predecessors must have done to force or gain their everlasting loyalty. Or perhaps it was just a genetic thing, like King\u2019s command to the K-9 world. Maybe they didn\u2019t have a choice for some reason. Either way, dragons would be good people to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, most if not all the seats were filled. Everyone seemed to be waiting for you to take your seat, even if most didn\u2019t know who or what you were. They were all looking around, King looked at you a few times but tried to make it as subtle as possible, so others didn\u2019t mass around you if they followed his gaze to find you. The Kohlers were avoiding both looking at you and your gaze, but they were all getting anxious to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is time\u2026\u201d said the low voice of who seemed to be the head dragon. It would appear that he was the speaker for the event. Made sense you supposed. At least what you knew of dragons from books and movies. Even if they had their differences, one thing they all had in their presentation of dragons was their wisdom from living very long lives. \u201c\u2026 if the new Vampire is present, please take your seat. If not, they the Mystical Meeting will begin at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s my cue. I really hope the butt kissing isn\u2019t too painful.\u201d You joked as you kissed Kelsey on the cheek and she smiled, pushing you along to the walk way in front of most of the platforms and seats, to which you followed directly to your seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could immediately felt the gaze of every living thing in the place on you. It was an\u2026 uncomfortable feeling. You passed the trolls and Matt, giving him a mock salute as you went, amidst the gapping shocked expressions of many that had been less than polite to you beforehand, followed by an angered expression. If you weren\u2019t the vampire and just a human trying to capitalize on the position, they looked forward to your demise. But if you were the Vampire, they would have to do some damage control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could also feel the gaze of the dragons, analyzing you very deeply to make sure you were who you said you were. Their gaze was very intimidating, so you switched to looking at King, who bowed to you then gestured to your seat. You walked up the stairs to your seat, between and just high enough to reach King\u2019s and the main Dragon\u2019s high neck area. A small glyph appeared on the small area in front of your seat, identical to the one at Disney, glowing red in reaction to you. The Dragons lightened their intensity when they saw this and you awkwardly sat in the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they all waiting for?\u201d You asked King, you could tell the main dragon to the direct right of you was irritated that you addressed King and not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of the time, the Vampire goes full power before we continue. All the Magic in one spot is like an all you can eat buffet for the Reapers. But once they sense your immense energy, they won\u2019t be caught dead anywhere near this place. Keeps us safe.\u201d King hinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to\u2026? People get hurt when I go full power.\u201d You asked. Sure you had been practicing while playing football, like Luke had suggested. But you usually had to work up to a gentle flow of your full power. But you still didn\u2019t have complete control over instantly raising you to full power. Kind of like cooking a frog. Boil slowly and they will just stick in there, but put them in boiling water and it can get rather interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter hurt than dead.\u201d King advised. His voice still, even in this barely whispering state, was low and rumbling, signifying the power behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d You sighed. You stood up and took a few steps to the end of the little platform in front of your seat that had the glyph on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed again, again feeling all the eyes of all in attendance on you. The feeling brought you chills. You then increased to full power; first was your eyes and fangs then the other effects that tended to happen when you went full power. You began to float involuntarily as the power you were unleashing forced you up. The entire place creaked and sparked under the weight and influence of your power. Most of the humans around were forced to their knees by the weight of it, those that were too weak to catch themselves there were knocked out as their heads hit the ground. Fires erupted in a few places but you tried very hard to contain them and at the very least have them appear in places that were acceptable, like unlit torches and braziers. When you had hit full power and was able to calm the area, you floated back down to the platform. You looked at King, then at the Main Dragon, then addressed both of them who were both proud and wincing from being so close to your power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Master\u2026\u201d The main dragon announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026\u201d you started than dialed back your power and was normal shortly after. \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t overly enjoy doing that at the moment. Makes everyone scared of me and in pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back to your seat and sat gently down, gazing out at the crowd that was recovering. Most of the humans were either unconscious and drooling or pain ridden as they tried standing to their master\u2019s commands. Most of the predators were stretching their limbs, avoiding eye contact as best they could, or looking at you with fearful eyes. They now knew who you were, what you were, and what that meant as far as their position to you. There was no further question that you were THE VAMPIRE. You glanced over at Kelsey and Mrs. Dremer, who both were panting but giving you a smile. You had to expect that they were proud of you, likewise when you looked over at Eve and Drade, and finally you glanced at Kings head to find a favorable gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, the Mythical Meeting begins!\u201d The main Dragon announced.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Most of the meeting was lists of laws for each species of predator. You were glad that each species had a rule on the consumption of humans, and all had a level of avoiding innocence as a food source. Down part was that EVERY species had to repeat each law, then the whole community had to vote on any changes that were to be made. Most had to do with asserting themselves over others, which was quickly squashed by a negative vote. The only change that was accepted was an additional limit on the number of humans allowed to be eaten by the Mermaids. Instead they were to help humans drowning when they could, but only after they were drowned to the point of unconsciousness, in order to keep their existence a secret. However, they did have an allotted conditions where eating the humans in the water were ok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slightly uncomfortable, for you and most of the humans, when the subject of eating humans came up. President Owen was particularly put off, but didn\u2019t dare interject on such points, no doubt in fear of becoming one of those meals they were talking about. Other laws were things that involved using their knowledge to help or hurt mankind. You hadn\u2019t thought about it before, but you supposed that giving humans access to a species\u2019 secrets could be a bad thing if it offset the balance of power in the world. Like if one country learned all the magic that dragons or mages had, or if the Navy of a particular country were helped by giant mermaids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after 3 days of straight law making, the meeting was over. Most Predators had a tolerance to staying awake longer than humans, but all in attendance were exhausted and went to their allotted quarters. Only you and a few other species had a fully awake mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster?\u201d The Main Dragon inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Draco?\u201d You asked. Ironically enough, whomever the head dragon of their kind was adapted that name. It was like a status thing and all other dragons were forbidden to have that name unless they were the leader. It helped with clarification a bit. \u201c\u2026 and please, it\u2019s just Caleb. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ready for the whole \u201cMaster\u201d title for a while.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d He said with a bow, then continued. \u201cWill you permit me to speak with you in private?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, as long as it doesn\u2019t take too abnormally long. There are a few people I\u2019d like to catch before they leave.\u201d You answered then turned to King, who was dutifully sitting by you. It was his voice that said some of your concerns during the meeting, when appropriate. He would sometimes tell you when something was a little too far, as you had yet to learn the ropes just yet. \u201cSee you Later King. Thanks for the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf Course.\u201d King responded with a bow, then turned and headed off for a nap of his own in his chamber, like all had pretty much done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where to?\u201d You asked Draco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you would indulge me, I would hide you until we are in my quarters? I don\u2019t want other races to bombard while we speak.\u201d Draco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026 sure. Why do I feel like this is going to get awkward?\u201d You asked rhetorically as he turned his large head and opened his jaws in front of you. \u201cYep, that would be why.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as his jaws remained open for you to enter. You didn\u2019t want to cause a scene, as the point of this was to get to the designation without drawing attention. So you quickly jumped in his jaws and they sealed behind you. You could feel him moving around, growling at times, and his tongue underneath you adjusting and at times it felt like it was tasting you, but not so much as to be obvious. He probably didn\u2019t want to offend you, his new master, in any way. You looked around and saw some saliva pool, then expertly deposited into the throat, some dripped from the roof of his mouth and down his massive teeth. You could feel and see a glow from the throat, that you assumed was some kind of fire lung or something, as it glowed a fire like glow from somewhere beyond. You waited until he opened his jaws again to a platform and you took this as his invitation to exit. You did so and was greeted by an almost empty room, other than the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for trusting me.\u201d Draco said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrusting you?\u201d You asked, unclear on why stepping into his jaws warranted that. If push came to shove, and he decided to really eat you, you could always bust out of him the hard way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe Dragons are highly magical creatures. NOTHING, not even you, could thwart us if we truly decided to do something, like eating you. That, and I\u2019ve heard of your aversion to magic. Almost slaughtered the Kohler family for what they did to you and your family when I heard. So, for trusting a highly dangerous and magical being like myself, I thank you.\u201d Draco clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 no sweat\u2026\u201d you answered, slightly embarrassed that you didn\u2019t think of that first, and now a little cautious about them. If they really were near your power level and could kill you, then the likelihood of protecting anyone from them wasn\u2019t very high. You still wondered how the Vampires before you had been able to secure such a tight alliance and supremacy with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that this new information is quite\u2026 upsetting. So, let me bring things down more to your level, or size as it is.\u201d Draco offered, then flapped his wings once, by their second swing, he was human and the wings disappeared into his back. You tilted your head, a little confused but also intrigued. You had never seen him before, but there was also an aura of familiarity with him. \u201cMaster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, Caleb, please.\u201d You corrected, to which he smiled and nodded. \u201cI\u2026 have lots of questions, but I guess I can pick your brain at a later date, as it will probably take loads of time to explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a fair assessment.\u201d He agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess, one that is bugging me at the moment is\u2026 Why such a powerful group like yourself would subject yourselves to me. From what I can sense and perceive, you are probably more powerful than I am, could kill and eat me if you wanted.\u201d You stated and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, Caleb. I think you are misunderstanding me. When I said that that you couldn\u2019t stop us, I meant US as a species. A few of us, working together could subdue you, mainly due to our mastery of magic. On top of that, our bodies are resistant to magic, making us the true masters of it, even over mages. But, just like the rest of them, your full power negates our power and puts you on top. As you can figure, we\u2019d probably wait until you tired yourself out, then attack. That is assuming that we want to attack you, which we will NEVER do. I\u2019m sorry if I scared you.\u201d Draco quickly explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I just get a little scared if there is something out there that I can\u2019t protect those I care for against.\u201d You explained back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2026 Master\u2026 You or any you designate NEVER have to fear us. We will always be there for you, wither you deserve it or not, and wither we like it or not.\u201d Draco said with a very serious and also sad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou ever wonder why, out of all the things you could do, magic is and forever will be out of your reach?\u201d Draco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, obviously.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet, going full power makes you completely immune to magic. Without any affinity for magic, how can you have so much power over it?\u201d Draco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother good question I don\u2019t have the answer to.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, the first Vampire, he had no such troubles. He was unparalleled with magic, strongest in the world in fact. His secrets, handed down, are why all others have magic today. But there was one major problem to having that much MAGICAL power.\u201d Draco explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReapers?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly! You see, the reapers, at that time, were the darkest and most feared force in the world. They ate and sucked dry any and all they wanted. No one could stop them. The only one with a prayer of doing so was the first Vampire. But every time he attacked them, he was overwhelmed by their numbers. As you know, they swarm any magic to suck it dry. Him fighting was the richest source they had every seen. Eventually they would trap him by attacking villages and his family, when he defended them the reapers closed in. They would suck him almost completely dry, then let him recharge, then repeat. In that age, he was known as \u2018The Sacred One\u2019. But things couldn\u2019t stay the way they were.\u201d Draco explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did the first Vampire do to change things?\u201d You asked, very interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe split himself into two separate beings. Most of himself he kept in his traditional form, all of his Vampire power and countless supporting abilities. However, anything that didn\u2019t compliment those abilities, thus hindering him from fighting the Reapers, were put into the second species, with a little bit of Vampire power so they could do damage to Reapers, but not the way he could. That is where the Dragons came from. We are, in a sense, your other half. The species has grown and now is very impossible to bring together the two halves, but the fact remains, you are our master, because we are a part of you. Just as your leg has no desire or ability to harm you on its own, neither do we. Do you understand?\u201d Draco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I think so\u2026\u201d You answered. You had felt that there was a connection between you two. But you hadn\u2019t thought it was something this\u2026 connected. It made sense why they were slightly weaker but overall pretty close to you power wise, and why they would NEVER betray you and would want the same as you. They, after all, were you, in a sense. Any morals you had would be transferred to them to a certain degree. They obviously had their own minds, but you apparently had your influence to them without even trying. You shook your head and decided to dive into this later, when you had time. \u201cWhat happened to the offending Reapers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe slaughtered them and took away a good amount of their ability to breed. For every 5000 Reapers that are born, only one survives. He left them alive to police the use of magic, but they are a vapor of what they were when they terrorized this world so heavily. The whole of existence owes him, and you in connection, everything. One of many reasons why you are so revered. Many fear that if you were to actually pass from this world, the Vampire that is, that the Reapers would rise again and be able to breed in excess. Many think that when God takes you from this world, it will be the end times. No matter what their beliefs, you are the most powerful, most feared, most revered, most respected, and most protected person on this planet. No one will oppose you.\u201d Draco answered, finishing the short version of the story. You had no doubt that you would hear the full version later. But for now, you were satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for clearing things up a bit. I gotta go talk to some people, but do you mind sending someone over to my family\u2019s home so I can get to know the dragons some more?\u201d You asked. You still needed some time to process things. Some time doing other things to get your mind off of it and allow you to process it later, at ease, would help. But you definitely wanted to know things about them. Who wouldn\u2019t want to hang with and talk with dragons?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I know who you are, I will be more than happy to come by. I suspect that many will relocate to your area, to be near you. I know that you probably didn\u2019t want all the fame, but it looks like you got it now\u2026\u201d Draco said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so. Thanks!\u201d You replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Thank YOU. If you need anything, and I do mean ANYTHING, let me know. Consider me your magical arm, if you will?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI prefer not.\u201d You answered, drawing a confused and hurt expression. \u201cI would prefer friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I would like that.\u201d He stammered out. He wiped away a tear before it could be overly noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you took your leave. With a few dragons roaming around and guarding the door, there weren\u2019t a lot of people around. And because of the way you were transported there, no one was around to see you. So now it was up to you where to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where to?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You thought about it as you walked, trying to avoid the crowds of predators and humans. Anyone you did pass bowed to you, and at times made a fuss when you told them to stand up and NOT make a scene. You figured that there was one person on your list that you would have a hard time seeing again, and would like nothing more than to leave this place as soon as he could. So, you went in his direction. Eventually you made it in front of a door that was crowded with taunting predators, growling and doing their best to put off the human in the room, the President of the United States of America, your country. You felt like telling them to get lost, but you had a better idea. You turned to mist and entered the president\u2019s room. He was in a chair, gripping the sides of it heavily. He would flinch at every noise and threat from outside, shaking all the while. He tried to relieve the stress and whatnot by getting up and pacing, but no matter what the predators said or how they said it, he obviously did NOT plan on letting them in. He would, at times sit back in the chair and take only sips of an expensive smelling drink. You didn\u2019t know much about alcohol, but the label said \u2018Scotch\u2019. You brought yourself together on a chair facing him. He was a little out of sorts, so you waited until he put down his drink before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come. Now that I know who and what they are, they will follow me and my family forever, until I die. The kinds of things they can do, and eat, I\u2019ll never sleep good for the rest of my life. Waiting for something to swallow me down or tare my family apart.\u201d He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d You replied, making him freeze, then slowly raise his previously downward looking face to yours. As his eyes locked on yours he became rigid and braced against his chair. You figured that no matter what you said, he would not calm down. So you kept it simple. \u201cHi, Mr. President, it is an honor to meet you. I\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to continue when a particularly loud and hard slam hit the metal door, bending it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman\u2026 come out and play\u2026 I only want to bite off your arm, maybe a foot, or\u2026\u201d The voice from the other side of the door said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me for a second.\u201d You said, glowing your eyes in irritation. He just nodded dumbly and watched as you got up from the chair and headed to the door, to which there was still a good amount of noise and banging residing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t open up and talk with me, I can always persuade it to\u2026\u201d the voice continued, to which you unlatched the door and opened it to interrupt him. You were greeted by a loud group of about 15 predators, the big one that put the dent in the door and was in the middle of his taunt was some kind of lizard creature, but a little larger than a troll. Their faces went from joy and leering humor to dread and fear at the sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you must have something insanely important to say if you are so\u2026 insistent on it. Please, enlighten me on the topic that you found so invaluably important.\u201d You said to the stunned group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t know what to do in their shock. The lizard creature had been drooling and making his presence as unattractively hungry as possible. No doubt to put the President off further. Now with his shock, his drool was piling on the floor. You looked down at the approaching pool of drool and mucus as it touched your shoes. You made it boil then evaporate then looked back up at creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2026 Uh\u2026\u201d he started, but for the life of him he couldn\u2019t come up with anything to say. Ironic, because if you were in a foul mood, for all they knew, his life DID hang in the balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeat it.\u201d You interupted with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe or they didn\u2019t have to be told twice. They almost trampled over each other to do exactly what you told them to do. You then shut the door, pushed the dent in the door back into place with no effort, then sat back down in the chair you had started in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d You apologized, your eyes back to normal and trying to put out as much of a good aura as you could. You thought about calming him down yourself, but decided against it. Like so many others, you wanted him to react to you their own way, not a fake way. You were patient and sat there for a bit. He took another sip of his drink, but didn\u2019t start talking, probably not sure what to say. \u201cI would think, from what you just went through, that you\u2019d be on your second bottle by this point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd pass out, by myself, in the middle of this place, with everything and everyone wanting to eat me\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He said, breaking his silence. He turned red, realizing that he just mouthed off to probably the most powerful person here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose you are right about that!\u201d You laughed out. He seemed confused but a little more at ease when you laughed. As if it was a more light conversation. Just shooting the wind sort of speak.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo, what did you want to see me for?\u201d The President was able to bring up. He had obviously seen what you could do to some extent. Why such a powerful individual wanted to talk to him was beyond him. Here, he was only a human. Not like any of the things around him at the moment, certainly not like the insanely powerful Vampire that was in front of him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you looked a bit uncomfortable and picked on by those around. I\u2026 just became the Vampire in the last decade, so I am still very much used to what it is like to be a human, not to mention my still living and loving human family. So, suffice to say, helping you out, if I can, is something I like to do. Plus, I wanted to touch base with you eventually anyway. I figured talking with you now would be better than appearing in the Oval Office or something like that, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d You explained and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Yes, I suppose so. But what is it you wanted to \u2018touch base\u2019 on?\u201d He asked, still tuned to why you of all people wanted to meet with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just the normal stuff really, and perhaps a little influence.\u201d You started, then saw him get a little bit defensive. You continued before his mind could make too many assumptions. \u201cBy that I mean, if I have to do something, mostly predator related, and I\u2019m stopped by some of your people, it would be helpful if I could just give you a call to get them to back off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExample being?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 if I was trying to get into a restricted area to deal with\u2026 a dragon perhaps, that is being unruly, or a few mages, or some Reapers\u2026 and I have to go through some military or federal personnel, I think you would prefer me dealing with it rather than them coming after you\u2026 unless you have some kind of measure in place for such things?\u201d You explained and asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, but from what I saw of you today, you could do much better. I see what you mean. I suppose, having a working relationship with you would simplify matters. Perhaps I could even call on you from time to time.\u201d He rattled off, again, before thinking, to which he froze at his forwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can do favors for you, if I feel like it. But I think you should understand something. While I like helping out my friends and family, human problems, like wars and such things that you would find me useful on, are just that\u2026 HUMAN concerns. Sure, you could ask if I could help out every once in a while, and I could offer, but I am in no way obligated to do as you ask or say.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, forgive my forwardness.\u201d He said, straightening a bit. He had to remember, even though you looked like a kid, you were a Vampire. A Vampire that pretty much had control over almost every predator in the world. He had to handle this with care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. I don\u2019t want to threaten you Mr. President. My Parents always raised me to respect authority. I just needed you to understand things. If I can have my way, I prefer a friendship over slaves of sorts. If you don\u2019t want anything to do with me, that is up to you. However, I would definitely like having a friend like you\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You waited patiently while the President was deep in thought. You could see, even without reading his mind, that he was heavily debating this. On the one hand, you would be a wonderful ally to have. Now that he knew that you were a citizen of the United States, he could hopefully count on you to keep the peace better than if you lived elsewhere. But openly consorting to a being as powerful as you, bowing to requests, asking for favors, seemed a lot like negotiating with terrorists. But you were civil\u2026 for now. Finally, it seemed like he had made up his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept your offer.\u201d He said, standing to be more formal, to which you followed his example and stood to meet him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you do?\u201d You asked. Putting out there that he had to explain a little bit on what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I will accept your friendship, and understand that there are things you will say no to, and things that you are not free or willing to share with me. I assume that politics would be something that you have no interest in helping with?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct, Sir.\u201d You answered with a smile. He had obviously noticed that you were the type of person NOT to overly enjoy politics or being part of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I should greet you more formally and casually. Hello Mr\u2026?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb Konel.\u201d  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Hello, Caleb. I am George Haize, President of the United States of America. Wonderful to meet you!\u201d He said with his hand out to shake yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Mr. President. I am Caleb Konel, Vampire of this world. An honor to meet your Sir!\u201d You replied back, shaking his hand gently (for you). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two smiled at each other, then sat back down and continued to talk for a while on random things. He was very interested about you, naturally\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you got out of there and headed for another person you wanted to see. You knew a few of the predator factions, and they all would see you later. However, there was one person connected with the predators that didn\u2019t know what you were, until you revealed yourself. A friend. Matt. You had seen his and the troll\u2019s faces when you revealed yourself, it was priceless. Soon you stood in front of a door to where you smelled Matt\u2019s scent. You made sure no one was there. He was alone, for the most part. He was in a corner of the room, apparently waiting to be instructed, while the female troll took a shower. You entered the room and made your way behind him. He seemed nervous and you could see a few new bruises, probably from the young troll for some reason or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow in the world are you still awake?\u201d You asked, causing his body to shiver and shake. He had obviously been thinking about you and how high up on the predator authority latter you were. You moved to an area that he could see, but he just declined his eye line and bowed further to you. \u201cThat had to be the longest and most boring thing I\u2019ve ever been to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u2026\u201d He stated with some fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need for that Matt. Please sit up and in that chair.\u201d You requested gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated, then did exactly what you asked. A posture that he obviously didn\u2019t get to do when serving his Master. Now it made sense why he enjoyed class so much, for an obviously dominate athlete. It was one of the only instances that he got to enjoy something as simple as sitting normally. He still wasn\u2019t making eye contact, but at least he was a bit more comfortable. Not comfortable enough however to initiate a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t tell people what I am because I didn\u2019t want them to treat me different. I really don\u2019t want you to fear me like that. For starters, as they said, I am the NEW Vampire. I still value my human relationships greatly, yours included. Please, relax, I promise not to snap off your head or something like that.\u201d You added, trying to make him, again without your attractants and mind abilities, to relax. But, unlike the president, he probably grew up a slave of the predators, and that was a lot of living a certain way to override. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how long, Sir?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, it\u2019s just Caleb, please. Second, it\u2019s only been a few years. So yes, when I met you in wrestling, I was a vampire. More of a baby Vampire, per say, but vampire none the less.\u201d You answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I was\u2026\u201d He started, obviously scared at the implications of some of his wrestling exploits at your expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt? Do you really think, as a Vampire, you did anything to me that I didn\u2019t allow?\u201d You asked. He thought about it, flicked his eye line to meet yours, then adverted it again in thought. \u201cI joined wrestling and football out of fun. You were one of very few people to give me a challenge at a human level. I enjoyed it greatly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 enjoyed it?\u201d He asked. With more of a comical tone than he probably meant to. As much as his growing up with predators had given him a certain way to act around them, he still knew you from school and had a habit of joking around with you. He realized his partial blunder, one that probably would\u2019ve gotten him a beating by his masters and started to sweat and bow before he heard you chuckle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a matter of speaking. My late Father encouraged me in it, so wrestling is something that is special to me. Having fun doing it makes it enjoyable to me\u2026 not as much as making out with Kelsey, but I suppose that makes more sense to you now as well, and why she\u2019s so hot.\u201d You replied, responding slightly to comments he had been giving you about her. She was, by far, the \u2018hottest\u2019 girl in school. Then again, judging humans to the standard of a Succubus was hardly fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 uh\u2026 Caleb\u2026 I definitely see that now.\u201d He said, having a hard time remembering your instruction, fighting his habits, and staying awake. You saw his eyes droop for a second, only to flick open and do the same. It was slight, barely noticeable, probably practice from years of hiding his fatigue from his masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich brings me back to my original question. How are you still awake? That was tiring even for me. I\u2019d think you would be catching some Zs by this point\u2026?\u201d You asked. You already knew the answer, but wanted to establish some conversation points that were a bit lighter than you being, to him, an all powerful Vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have My Master to assist before I can sleep.\u201d He informed as formally as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman!\u201d came a call as an approaching presence made her way out of the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said this he got up and quickly made his way to his previous position. You thought about ordering him to stay comfortable, but decided you didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble after you took your leave. He looked at the chair he was just sitting in with horror. He probably knew that if she found out he was relaxing without her permission, he\u2019d be getting punished. You smiled and used some of your power to put the chairs back and take a spot leaning against the wall by him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Ma\u2019am.\u201d Matt answered in an attentive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDry me off. I just took a nice long shower and could go for\u2026\u201d She started as she walked into the room, completely naked accept for the towel she was holding and dabbing at her hair. As soon as she was within sightline she tossed her massive towel over to him, completely covering both of you, however she could see both of your silhouettes underneath. She stopped mid sentence at the sight of an unknown human sized person under the towel. \u201cHuman, I thought I told you before about what happens if one of your friends come around, especially the human ones\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see but even Matt could hear her lick her fangs at the thought of a fresh human meal. You glared at her through the towel, something she didn\u2019t see\u2026 yet. It wouldn\u2019t be long though, as she was retrieving the towel to see her supposed prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I won\u2019t punish you for such a delightfully tasty smelling\u2026\u201d She started as she pulled the towel away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most predators, she liked to toy with her prey. To that effect, she made a spectacle of ripping the towel off them and standing as sexily over them as possible, which would also invoke, in most, a deep sense of dread. Although, in this case, it was slightly comical to see her go from that pose to a dreaded pose of her own at the sight of you glaring at her, glowing red eyes showing. She stood there, frozen in fear. After all, from what she felt during the meeting, you could easily tear her apart, and she was very young. So her imagination to such an event was probably going overboard.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt seamed to move on instinct and quickly got between you and his master, probably without thinking about it. It was obvious that this was something that he was trained to do in dangerous situations. He was tired enough to realize that his action might be unnecessary. He thought about it after doing it and facing you, giving you a look that said, \u2018yeah, like this is going to work\u2026\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about this bud.\u201d You said, then flicked your wrist a little, gently moving him off the ground and out of the way. Unlike so many others you had done that to, you had no intention of harming him. So you just carefully restrained him against a wall. You could feel that he was feeling strange with a power he couldn\u2019t even imagine restraining him. But being at the mercy of a predator was something he was strangely used to. You then turned your attention toward his Master. \u201cIf I was going to harm you, a human or a bed would not do much in stopping me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please\u2026 D-Don\u2019t kill me\u2026\u201d she whimpered as she continued to hide behind the bed. You thought about disintegrating it to give you an unobstructed path to converse with her. However, it seemed that it was holding a majority of her sanity in check, so you left her to the pose she was in, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan on killing you. I only stopped by to have a chat with my friend from school.\u201d You informed. At first she was confused by your words, fairly certain that you two had never met. But then you looked at Matt, then back at her. She understood, sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy human\u2026 is your friend???\u201d She asked, surprised that a predator at your level would have human friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed he is. I never shared with him what I really am. Now he knows, so I thought a nice chat, void of any B.S. concerning my status, would be nice. That was until you busted into the room and interrupted.\u201d You informed and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m\u2026 S-Sorry\u2026\u201d She stuttered out. You could tell that she didn\u2019t see a problem with treating humans like she was treating him. Sure, at school, she probably had human \u2018friends\u2019, but none with the significance that you were putting on HER servant. But for the sake of her own life, she apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn either case, he is way too tired to talk with, at the moment. See to it that he gets some rest before his next school day. I would like to talk with him without him being dead tired, in fact\u2026\u201d You said, then waved over Matt\u2019s direction, to which he fell deeply asleep, then floated over to HER bed, and laid him in it, tucking him in comfortably. \u201cHe needs sleep now. Unlike us predators, HE needs sleep after days of being awake. Now, I would feel bad if he got in trouble over this. So, play nice, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes\u2026 Sir\u2026\u201d She said, still comically hiding\u2026 well, comically to you. You were going to address her treatment of him, and his family, but knew that would only cause more problems and Matt was as capable as he was because of what he went through on a day to day basis. So, being your friend was probably the least intrusive way to better his life, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you again, at school at least.\u201d You said as you headed for the door. Your tone was less confrontational than before. You opened the door and walked out into the main hall. You looked one way to see her father, jaw dropping at you coming out of HIS daughter\u2019s room. Followed by fear that his previous treatment of you had earned his daughter a premature end, then more fear that he had inadvertently made you an enemy of his family. Which reminded you, these idiots might not have made a full on enemy of you, but there was one group that had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the meeting and all the law making, there was one thing, a governing force of sorts, that you had inadvertently taken out of play\u2026 magic, more specifically the mages. The Kohlers were, apparently, all related. You wondered what type of redneck joke would dictate marriages and kids if they truly only had kids with other Mages, which were ALL family. Then again, of all the weird things you had been introduced to as a Vampire, that was probably up there with the least weird things. However, when you had restricted them from magic, you had unintentionally restricted ALL the world\u2019s mages. Meaning they couldn\u2019t keep eyes on predator groups effectively. Unfortunately, you had to patch things up with them. This was going to be a pain\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You took back ways to get to the Kohler\u2019s suite. You still had to sidestep many predator factions and were not really liking all the butt kissing that was happening. You really hoped that it wouldn\u2019t translate into your normal lives. Eventually you got to their suite and proceeded to knock a few times on the door after a heavy sigh. Not many liked being around the Kohler\u2019s area which, for once, you didn\u2019t mind. You felt them moving around but magical barriers were preventing you from feeling too much. Still, it was about 15 minutes before someone opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou interrupt the great house of Kohler. Whom may I say is at the door so they can\u2026?\u201d The butler of sorts started before even opening the door fully. You just glared at him as he started then almost choked on his own words as you stood there. They might\u2019ve been blind to who you were last time you came knocking, but that definitely not the case anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume that you weren\u2019t about to say something to the affect of coming in to enjoy milk and cookies, correct?\u201d You asked in a very suggestive manner with an ever present glare at him, your red eyes glowing. You were on you guard in this place. While you didn\u2019t protrude your fangs or escalate your power to cripple them, you stood ready to do so if the so much as uttered a single spell word. The hostility was obvious to this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Uh\u2026 I\u2026\u201d He stammered, barely taking a moment to breath, almost passing out. But his profession and training for that seemed to take over and he calmed himself. He must\u2019ve realized that if there was ever a time to be at his best, this was it. It was time to give out as much hospitality as he could. \u201cMaster Caleb, would you like to come in Sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepends, are you guys going to torture me again?\u201d You asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly not sir! We will do no such thing.\u201d He assured with a great deal of sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you know for sure?\u201d you asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, no one in their right mind would slight you, especially now. Please sir, you will come to no harm while here. I will bet my life on it.\u201d He assured, almost sweating as he said this, offering his life to his assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. As it is, if I have to fight my way out, I will not stop at not killing people like I did last time. That is your one and only warning. So, you best be very sure before you invite me to come in again.\u201d You verified with severity of a very real death threat to not only him but others as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u2026 Please follow me.\u201d He affirmed as he gestured inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, as if getting ready for something very strenuous, then walked in. You felt the barrier as you passed it and felt the effects of many spells. Thanks to your ring you were shielded, wither they were good or bad. The Butler quickly closed the door and led you to a meeting room of sorts. It looked to have lounge chairs and couches around so that as many as 20 could very comfortably speak amongst each other, more depending on how comfortable they wanted to get with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will go and fetch the Masters. Please make yourself comfortable Master Caleb.\u201d He addressed and requested with a bow, then headed off as you nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched him scurry of and closed the door. You looked around and the found a spot on a chair to the side and started to think heavily on what was going to happen, and what you intended. You weren\u2019t sure if you liked the idea of having them run completely free, but shackling them only put everyone else that weren\u2019t predators at risk. As much as you didn\u2019t like them, or magic in general, they did keep the others in check and that would make your role easier as well as your family safer. But flashes of torture and what they did came through, making you ring your hands a bit and let some of your power leak out. Your eyes still were glowing red as you waited, you hoped not that long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour power began effecting things in the room as it leaked out. The plush carpet was pushed down so hard that it felt and looked like cement while bugs and almost anything else that you didn\u2019t normally watch out for were flattened by the sheer weight of your power. Then, like a light switch, as soon as the door opened again, you became aware of your surroundings and dialed it back in. You had no doubt that you probably just set off more than a few magical alarms, but that didn\u2019t bother you right now. You simply glared from where you sat as people came in. There were about a dozen in all, including the Butler, whom was told to go, to which he bowed and left, closing the door behind him. You felt him wait just outside to be called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room was Beth\u2019s Dad, her Mother, Her Grandfather, and few older people that looked to be from different nationalities but all had the same family scent on them as you took stock. Lastly, Beth herself was in there. As each of them looked for you they all eventually saw you from where you sat, glaring intently at them. So much so that they each shuttered under the feel of just your gaze. You could both see and smell them sweat at this and they didn\u2019t dare budge an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit\u2026\u201d You ordered, then realized that even if they were by far your least favorite people, they still deserved respect as elders, and the respect of their station. You were raised to respect your elders so you very forcefully put in, \u201c\u2026please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t have to be told twice as they did so, the room came together a little bit so they could converse easier, as if it guessed what they needed. You had no doubt that it was some sort of magic, which made you not ease up on your glaring. You still didn\u2019t know exactly what you wanted to do with them, as you were understandably conflicted. You just knew that they would be back in power in some capacity. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCaleb\u2026 I can\u2019t even begin to say how sorry we are. The way we treated you, your family, we should not be alive. I would not have been as generous. For the lives of my family and myself, I thank you.\u201d Mr. Kohler said as if he practiced it a thousand times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, every word you say makes me want to rip you in half.\u201d You said bluntly. He started to sweat and hold his breath. \u201cI forgave you for what you did to me. That, sure, it sucked, but I\u2019m a Vampire, I dealt with it just fine. Of all the things that have pained me, it wasn\u2019t that bad. Didn\u2019t give me a great opinion of you and magic in general but I dealt with it. But what you all did to my family, even when they dropped my name? That\u2026 is hard to look past.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are all deeply\u2026\u201d Mrs. Kohler started to which you glared specifically at her, making her turn silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I see when you open your mouths is the possibility that what comes out of them could be a spell that will cause pain to me or those I love. So, keep that to a minimum while the wounds are fresh.\u201d You strongly suggested. \u201cI don\u2019t really care if your apologies are genuine or not. Because I don\u2019t really think they are. I do think that the lack of power and the Reapers are causing you to grovel, and there isn\u2019t really anything you can say, at the moment, to convince me otherwise. So, until I can trust some of you, cut the small talk please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u2026\u201d Mr. Kohler replied. You could see Beth not believing that the same kind kid she sees at school all the time was so\u2026 hard at the moment. You were not someone she recognized and it scared her very much so. If you had to guess, you thought that they brought her in here so you would have some kind of connection to her moving forward. Honestly, you couldn\u2019t see around it. She\u2026 wasn\u2019t completely brainwashed by her family\u2026 yet. So, she might be the best option as the person to talk to after this point. In fact, that was your first idea, and it would start right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeth\u2026\u201d you called, causing her heart to stop for a second then beat like a race horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?!?\u201d She peeped out. Both her parents went wide eyed at what you could possibly want with their daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe both know why you\u2019re here. So, I\u2019ll be talking with you specifically from now on. So, get to the front\u2026 please.\u201d You more ordered then requested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Yes\u2026 Sir\u201d She stammered, then made her way to switch places with her Father. \u201cYes? Caleb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI so much wanted to be just be rid of you all. Better than then constantly looking attacking mages everywhere I or my family go. Now that I know I can have dragons, the thought crossed my mind in a very real sense.\u201d You explained, making her shake as you rolled out the annihilation of her family and people in front of her as a viable solution you were considering. \u201cHowever, after days of listening to laws and what not, I realize one thing. As much as I dislike you all, and magic in general\u2026 there is an order\u2026 a balance that can\u2019t be filled by any other. Sure, others have magic, but not like you all. That policing force both clams me, and frightens me. So, my question to you is, if you were me, when faced with the choice of keeping my family safe or the world, what would you pick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess, the world. No world\u2026 my family would be alive but\u2026 not happy, I guess\u2026\u201d She stammered out as eloquently as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, which brings me to how to deal with you, and your family. In my anger, I overreacted, but understandably so. Either way, the balance your family provides needs to be restored. I hate myself to say it, but I NEED your power. But how do I go about doing that and still keeping an eye on you?\u201d You agreed and asked, still glaring at her. She turned to her Father who was about to advise her, to which you glared at him instead, shutting him up before he could speak. \u201cYou had your chance at relations with me, I will deal with Beth, not you. At the very least, SHE has some potential to bounce back. I don\u2019t see that coming from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighed at an answer, but a sigh of fate. She wasn\u2019t wise enough to come up with something like her Father could, which is why she was going to ask him, but with only her dealing with this, the fate of her family, she didn\u2019t know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither do I. So, I will do something against every fiber of my being. I so much want to just wash my hands of all you, or put you under the rule of the dragons or something\u2026 but that is not what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d You revealed, to which they all, especially Beth were paying very close attention. \u201cI am going to give you all your power back. You may govern as you see fit under the law.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!?\u201d Beth asked, the rest of her family not believing their ears. \u201cYou are serious?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery serious. As serious as I am when I say this. If I have to deal with you all again, ever. I don\u2019t really care what the reason is, I will end you. I will be talking to the dragons and others to work to have a backup plan ready if that is the case. You can use magic without threat of the reapers, but you are on paper thin ice. I don\u2019t need much of an excuse to kill you all, as I already want to do that. So, yeah, you are free to use magic, but you best watch it.\u201d You answered, spelling it out for them very clearly. They were both happy and deathly afraid at the same time. What manner of governing would make them safe from you? What would make them live past their next spell? \u201cOne more thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes\u2026?\u201d Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only deal with you. Not your Father, not your grandfather, not your brother or super wise person that you all go to or something like that. No, just you. So, as far as I am concerned, you are the new head of your house. If I see something or request something, I will tell you. If your family doesn\u2019t listen, well, they better hope it isn\u2019t THAT important, because if it is\u2026 then there is a good chance you all die.\u201d You said, making them feel dread and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 I\u2026 I am in charge? You want me, in charge?\u201d She asked, not believing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, but it would make sense.\u201d You answered, then started to get up, then got up in respect as well. \u201cNow, I\u2019m leaving. You all do what you want, I have already given the reapers the order to stand down. You may start using magic immediately, as much as you dare to that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2026 we understand\u201d Beth responded with a bow that everyone followed. As if on que, the Butler opened the door for you then led you out. As soon as you were clear you were able to breath easy again, then traveled back to Kelsey. You were beat, and needed a long overdue nap from all this. You both hoped that the Kohlers would mess up, and that they wouldn\u2019t. Either way, the consequences would be something to dread and look forward to. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When it was fully on you felt a rush of energy flow through you from your hand to the rest of your body and back. A faint blue inscription and pentogram etched themselves into the gold, all you wanted to do was test it out. \" Hey, do you have your wand on you?\" you asked Dumbledore. He sighed and drew the elder wand, flipped it around in his hand and passed it to you. \"just don't cast an unforgivable curse these things have records on what spells have been cast you know.\" Dumbledore advised. You took the wand and with a flick of the wrist you aimed at the wall and uttered \"Expeliarmus\". Nothing happens. \"what's up?\" you said.<br>\r\n\"just checking if you were listening, you need to first com in contact with that kind of magic before you can use it.\" <br>\r\n\"I geuss I should have listened.\" you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"anyway, she didn't tell me just to give you the ability without giving you the means to perform it and since simply being in this building exposes you to this realms magic all I need to do is to give you a copy of Arcanis , the instruction book for this worlds magic , hit you with any kind of spell from my realm and to give you your own wand along with a full spell book compiled by lady isibelle herself detailing all the magics in my world.\" he explained as you passed the wand back to him. As soon as he had his wand back in his hand you felt an impact on your shoulder that would have sent anybody else flying across the room but you stood firm in place, Dumbledore had cast stupefie at you to expose you to his worlds magic. He then passed you over to substantial books A4 in size but at least 800 pages a piece. \"I take it these are the two compendiums you mentioned\" you said turning them around to see there thickness each about 3 and a half inches thick. He then passed you a box that you immediatly recognised as an olivanders wand box. You levitated the pair of tomes next to you as you politly grabbed the wand box and lifted of the lid in the same fashion as you had with the ring, you then lifted up the ribbons to see a sleek shiny black wand with an ornamental cap featuring your crest in an ornate design. \"14 inches long with a phoinex feather core.\" Dumbledore said as you gazed on in awe at the beauty of a wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds for you to realize what he had just said. \"hang on, phoinex feather, as in the same wand core as Harry and Voldemort's wands?\" you asked .<br>\r\n\"the very same phoinex.\" Dumbledore said with conviction. You wrapped your fingers around it and gripped it but it had almost no give. \"it has a powerful ward on it so you don't break it, it could with stand the force of a star exploding on it before it even gets remotly damaged.\" Dumbledore said as he saw you testing its strength. \"that's good.\" you said as you turned to face down the corridor flicked the wand and \"Incendio\". A gout of fire spurted out of the end of your wand projecting out about 10m down the corridor.

So you decided to teleport inside to your room (you had your family draw your crest in your room). Once you had stashed the books in your room you teleported back outside to the mark you placed on the floor outside the door and knocked on the door. Mom answered the door \"hello, what did Dumbledore want to talk about?\" just general precautions as in not to break the rides or use any supernatural powers were humans can see.\" you said lying through your teeth turning the ring on your hand around to hide the magic markings. \"your already unpacked so go get changed and well head off to the rides.\" mom said. \"actually I feel like staying in till night falls then I'll come and join you 'cause I haven't slept a wink in almost a month and I'm feeling a bit tired.\" you said wanting to stay in and read up on magic. <br>\r\n\"ok just remember to come out at sundown.\"  mom said as she rallyed up the troop that was the non supernatural part of your family marching them down the corridor and the stairs to the main amusement park. Brad was about to follow but you telepathically told him to wait and he sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notice anything different about me.\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"no\" Brad said scanning you from head to toe.<br>\r\n\"check again, but use aura vision\" you said<br>\r\nHis eyes glowed blue as he looked at you.\"holy shit\" he said standing up in shock at the streaks of magic aura mixed in with your usual red. \"that's...\" brad begun.<br>\r\n\"magic aura, yep. Dumbledore gave me this neat ring that allows me to do magic.\" you interjected turning the ring around so he could read the faintly glowing inscriptions. \"this is very cool\" Brad said examining the ring on your finger.<br>\r\n\"I also got a copy of arcanis and a big spell book.\" you added.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't want to know where you were going. Helped with the mystery of it all. But you pleaded with them to make it a vacation spot, more or less. With en emphasis on no magic and no silver. But they could pick something like Harry Potter, it was hard to tell. There wasn't a whole lot of ways to mess with you in the day to day life. As much as they would love to please you, they were still your family. So teasing and pulling pranks was not out of their skill set. Suffice to say, you walked through the portal then into the new realm. Almost immediately you felt yourself falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I portal into midair,\" you said to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now falling but that wasn't the weirdest part. From one look you recognized where you were. The landscape of Pandora from the movie was easily recognized, if not then the huge stinking mining equipment that you saw. The weird part was the air. You assumed that the air was not useable, but the movie didn't really explain why it was like that. You were not suffocating or going into shock by any means. Quite the opposite. It was like you just got an adrenaline shot at max dose. Your body started to overflow with power. You felt like you could do anything. Which probably wasn't the best mindset to fly. Cause, as you did, your overflow of power made you accelerate too fast and made you plummet into the ground at an insane speed. Fast enough to cause a crater and knock you out. Not the first time you had been knocked out. But it was the first time you were knocked out by... well you... You didn't know what was in the air, but it was not a hindrance to you, unless it would force you to do stuff like that all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you dreamt, you couldn't help but be grateful to your family. Pandora might have been a hell for humans that were normal. But for you, it appeared like it would be quite the vacation spot. You had a bunch of questions. Like if the blood of the animals here was also as delicious as the air was. There was no silver here, not the same sun to hinder you, and best of all no magic to touch you. You would have to thank them when you got back. But, for now, you had to wake up and get acquainted with whomever you felt around you. With that you woke and felt around, while still lying still. You didn't want to give whomever it was around you any form of control before you were ready. So you probed out and felt like you were in the more normal air than the stuff you were breathing before. You felt humans around you, but a few things were off. Fist was it was too sterile, like a hospital or something. Next was the gravity. You could feel the difference and it wasn't horrible. Although, it would not be your ally in remaining normal. As you started to listen to the conversations around, you got the feeling you were in a scientist's lab, kind of. Just peachy. That is what you needed, being poked and prodded by curious humans. So with that you opened your eyes to let them know you were awake. Although the suddenness of your action made an observing assistant fall back with a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" asked a familiar voice. Must've been because you watched the movie. It was confirmed when Dr. Grace  Augustine was looking down at you. \"Ah, you are awake. Well considering that you should be dead, you look to be doing great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I have you to thank for that?\" You asked then lifted your arms to see that they were free of restraints. \"And the fact that the military force hasn't locked me up yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a quick moment to make sure your abilities were hidden, they were. It seamed that you had spent so much time hiding amongst humans, that concealing yourself had become second nature, natural, and almost effortless. Helped in this instance. All the samples they took would reveal nothing about your other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be me. You crash landed in our little compound. I convinced the powers that be, that you were launched from a faulty escape pod and that it protected you from the impact. But only I and a few others saw that wasn't the case.\" Grace replied as she gazed over your, as if dissecting you with her eyes. She was a scientist after all. Even if her moral center was higher than most, she was still curious by the unexplained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get up?\" You asked in a tone that was asking for permission. She seemed to like the amount of respect you were giving her. But she was confused why you were asking, until you glanced at the wires and tubes they had you hooked up to. She nodded then started taking them off. That was strange to you. You expected her to want to have then attached to record any and all moves you made. She must've had a different method, or was to occupied by her other work to bother with a strange human. You sat up and faced her from the bed you were on. It was one of those test and observation beds, so you were more or less eye level with her. \"Thank you Miss...\" you started then looked at her name tag. You had a feeling that just knowing her name off the bat would not be a good idea. So you made a show of looking at her name tag before continuing. \"... Grace. It appears like I owe you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad you are ok. Although, I am curious about you to say the least. So are the others. I got you out of there, but they will look at the security logs before long and notice that there was no escape pod. I figured you could get your feet before the grilling started... and perhaps you could start with explaining a few things to me. If nothing else, I would like to be well informed on whom I decide to help.\" She answered, in a very well practiced demeanor. You took a quick check on your power level to see if you could risk trusting her. You were full up from the feeding before you left. The impact made a small dent in that supply, but the air seemed to have helped in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, what would you like to know?\" You asked then looked around to all the observing faces. \"Perhaps somewhere a little more private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sounds like a good idea.\" She agreed then escorted you to a smaller but cut off room. You could sense the cameras and things like that still working. They would be recording this. Then again, they probably didn't have many places in this place that wasn't recorded in some fashion. On your way to the room you looked around to get a feel for what was happening. </span></div></div>",

In a very short conversation you had told her a very cut down version of what you were and why you were there. Mainly that you are a Vampire that can thrive in the open air and that was there for vacation. She asked some verification questions but was in partial shock mode at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, probably,\" she answered truthfully. She was pacing while you stood there against the wall. You figured that more people would come in and they needed as much room as possible. So you just reclined against the wall for the moment. You hadn't told her much about your power. \"So, you could probably break out of here if you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a fair guess,\" you answered as you watched her. She continued pacing before her thought process was interrupted by the door slamming open. The room filled with a few armed soldiers with large guns, followed by Miles Quaritch (The chief of security guy). Seems he liked the whole military force thing. Their guns were trained on you, except his. He stood there by an almost flabbergasted Grace. \"Figured you'd be listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you something special. Coming here for vacation is about as much of a true story as my good graces.\" He replied with a tone of superiority as you could expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me, than why the firepower. If I'm not a Vampire, then I am a harmless little kid,\" you almost teased back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A harmless kid that crash landed without so much as a hanky to help him land,\" He put forward, looking like he thought he had the upper hand. \"I would really like to know how you managed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you... or more accurately, Ms. Grace here. I am not about to lie just to fit your conclusion,\" you replied. Grace had taken a position against a side wall to give the entered men some room. She, unlike them, had an idea that you meant what you said. That meant she didn't want anything to do with opposing you. Smart human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colonel Quaritch, this 'boy' hasn't done anything that requires your attention. If you are that sure he isn't what he says he is, then he is my responsibility and I will take him under my wing.\" Grace said with as much authority as she could muster. You didn't know why she suddenly wanted to protect you, but you were ok with it. The question was, if Colonel Quaritch would go for it. You had more or less insulted him pretty good.</span></div></div>",

He then quickly motioned to his men, who hustled out of the door. You could sense that they didn't know why a small boy like you would need such a treatment. But you also had helped them accept that regardless WHAT you were, it was Grace's problem now and they wouldn't interfere. When the Colonel left he slammed the door behind him. Grace gave a sigh then sat in the chair that they had pushed so carelessly aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think he would do that.\" she said, then seemed to remember what you said you were and sat up a little as you sat in front of her. \"You didn't do anything about that did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up.\" you answered then spit a saliva needle at the recording devices. When you retract it, the needle would heal the things that it destroyed, even the walls and cameras. She saw this then looked to you with confusion. \"Saliva needles. My saliva has healing properties but I can shoot it in a needle if I wish. Useful little things, and I don't like showing idiots like them what I can do. To answer your question, I might've made them more compliant with leaving me with you instead of shooting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You really are a Vampire, aren't you?\" She asked, more to be clear than any lack of trust. You let your eyes glow and grew your fangs, then retracted them. She straightened when she saw this. \"Have you altered my mind as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. You already are more than acceptable the way you are. You are more curious than threatened or scared. I don't have to worry about you taking a gun out and trying to kill me. Those others though...\" you said as you looked to the side, as if looking at them through the wall. \"...I have no intension of helping them with destroying more of this planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... How do you know what they are doing?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, that is one secret I have to keep to myself. Let's just say that I am not from around here, or the Earth you know.\" you answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would explain why you can survive in this planet's atmosphere,\" she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have no idea why I can. This is a new place. Sure I've... watched things from afar, but I have no idea why this planet's air effects me in such a way. It is actually acting like adrenaline for me. I am not sure if I can control my abilities outside in a way I could in here. But, from what I hear about this place, a little extra strength isn't necessarily a bad thing.\" You answered in a tone that made her relax and think at the same time. You were right, her type of person responded well when you gave them a problem to solve, even it you didn't care if it was solved. Truthfully, you liked the way you felt outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" She started as she thought then she brought herself back to the issues at hand. \"... well, since you are a vampire, you are probably needing blood right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice, yes. Do not fear though, I am physically incapable of turning anything I bite and I don't have to feed from humans exclusively.\" you answered with a smile, but had to add the last little bit when you saw a fearful glance and your eagerness to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you aren't going to... you know?\" She asked as she gestured to her own neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you wanted me to. I have a very strict no tolerance policy on feeding on innocents without there permission. Although, if you want me to use my abilities, then I will need extra blood to fuel them. Just FYI.\" you answered, making her sigh in relief at that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's get you something to eat!\" she said with perhaps too much excitement. Now that she knew she was off the menu, she seamed eager to watch you feed. She led you down the hall and through the compound. You could tell when you were in her section, cause of all the science stuff. You observed as much as you could. It was a vacation after all, you could gawk and big toys or fun stuff. She noticed your looking around as she led you. \"You know anything about biology or any of the other sciences?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, not too much. I know a great deal about blood flow and some of the organs that regulate it. But what I know is mainly instinctual and dealing with my interaction with them. Like listening to a heartbeat to determine if someone is lying, excited, or various other emotions. People's scent as well. But not very much about what you are talking about.\" you answered as you moved out of the way of someone carrying some expensive looking equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you know most of this stuff isn't harmful to you?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so far, I only have 2 major weaknesses. Neither of them are anywhere near this planet. That and I am immortal. So a bullet to the head... minor annoyance. That is if I let it go into my head in the first place. No offense, but a human with their toys aren't my concern and don't even rank on the danger level.\" you answered, trying not to offend her as you said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am starting to actually like you.\" Grace replied with a smile and you returned one. She opened the door to a lab for you then got a bag of blood from a fridge. It was blue though... well kind of blue. \"Try this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it from?\" You asked as you looked at the bag she gave you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sample from one of the tribe we've been to. Let's just see if you can drink from things that are on this planet, or if we have to get you human blood when you are hungry.\" she answered. She seemed like she was dissecting you with her eyes. She was obviously excited about watching something new. You shrugged then drug your fangs into the bag. Your eyes immediately went red as you tasted the surprisingly amazing blood. The bag was spotless in seconds upon this new taste. You couldn't believe it, but it was just as good as human blood. \"Good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah... It is just as good as Human blood, which is really hard to beat. Best thing to describe it is if you have two favorite food like Pizza and Chicken. They are obviously different in taste, but still both your favorite. This blood is, tangy and got a little bit of a kick to it. Very refreshing.\" You answered with excitement that only fueled hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think I will like you very much.\" Grace thought out loud. She was acting like she had just found a new toy. But you could tell she was slightly worried that she just gave you a new sapient food source that she also liked as friends. But that was for later. For now, she was just getting started, you'd expect.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are you sure about this?\" Asked another doctor that was escorting you to a door to an outside compound of some kind. Grace had already linked with her Avatar and had offered to show you around. Even though you had Grace's confidence, that didn't go to far with some of the others. But perks of being the boss in your area, what she said goes. She budded heads with some people around her level of authority or higher about you. She actually asked you to help her convince them of letting you roam free, out there or in their visual range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" you answered with a smile. They had their masks on and had one ready for you if what they thought happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the door and your body was already reacting to the air. As you took steps outside, you couldn't help but let some of your powers go. Your eyes turned red on reflex and you could feel the adrenaline like feeling again. You had a hard time not just bolting as fast as you could. Your senses were in overdrive as well. Yes, you would enjoy this vacation if you could feel like this all the time. You walked a little bit into a grassy area then closed your eyes and just took in the feeling for a while. Breathing in deep breaths of the... delicious air. They Doctors and guard soon realized that you would be doing that for a while and you didn't need the other mask they brought out, just in case. So they left you in your little bliss heaven you were currently occupying. You didn't know how long you were just standing there, but eventually you were pried into reality by a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Caleb, you ok? I've been looking all over for you.\" Said the voice to which you looked its direction. It was coming from a large blue creature that you knew to be Grace's Avatar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dang, the movie really doesn't compare to being in contact with these things,' you thought as you looked at her. She was a little off kilter at your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask you that. But more immediately, why are your eyes glowing?\" She asked as she bent down to look at them. Yep, they were still huge up close. Huge and Blue. Then again, small compared to King and some of the creatures you've met. Still, the fact you'd be communicating with them was interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. The air, it is like supersizing everything in me. Like adrenaline for my Vampire side. Let me see if I can tone it down.\" you answered then closed your eyes to concentrate. When you felt like you had limited yourself enough you opened them again. \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want glowing eyes, you can. But yeah, this is better for now. Still a bit red, but not glowing anymore. You know, for humans, this air is highly toxic. How is it the opposite effect for you?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Best guess is that it contains some nutrients that my body craves in the same way I crave blood. That, and I'm not human so... there's that.\" you responded. You started stretching a little bit, trying to get the kinks out of your body and restlessness. \"Dang, I feel so powerful right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can talk about that as we walk. Although trying to talk to you way down there...\" she joked as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up blue girl.\" You replied back as you started walking. She showed you some fields of food that were for the Avatars and tribe people, if they ever came there. You were still having a hard time moving so slow. But you figured that it was good practice for later. She showed you the fence line and talked about the jungle beyond. You had to refrain from jumping the fence and running off. There was something else as well. It was as if there was an immensely powerful being somewhere very nearby, but you couldn't pinpoint where exactly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... now that you've seen the place, for what I can show you like this. How do you like it?\" She asked, as if your expressions weren't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is amazing here. I can't believe there is so much. I can't wait to go into the Jungle and stretch my legs a little bit, sort of speak.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not now?\" She asked as you both made it to a makeshift basketball court. You gave her hopeful but confused glance. She waved for a large basket ball, to which the players threw her one. \"I mean you aren't allowed to enter the jungle, but you can run around for a bit. That is if you can handle as much as you said you could.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said it in a challenging tone as she dribbled the ball clumsily a few times. She was, after all, a Scientist, not a pro ball player. She did this a little bit as you walked onto the court. She played around you a few times till she settled in front of you, between you and the hoop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on. Don't leave a girl waiting.\" She said as she bounced you the ball. It was large, obviously, but you easily caught and palmed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you asked for it.\" you answered then started dribbling. She tried to swipe the ball but left her legs more open. You dribbled it through them, as the thing was too big to fit through your legs, then easily made a quick shot. The others around were watching with great interest. Egg heads...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few were like that. Mixed with some jumping and running, just to see where your muscle flow was. A few times you jumped too high, which they marveled at. You then sped out of the court on accident. But now you were done experimenting on holding back and was able to dominate on the court. Usually you wouldn't, especially with a girl. Just good manners and all that. But you wanted to make sure she knew that you were in no way at risk if you or she wanted you to go along with them when they went into the jungle. A few times you dunked the huge ball in the really tall hoop. After a while you all stopped and invited the others to play as well. You were still the best player with all them there and trying really hard. You had never really liked the game before. But you had to admit, it did take all your minds off things and bring them together. A few of the guards and what not watched as you took the huge blue guys and girls to school. When Grace had to catch her breath and you were still barely starting was the point you sensed she understood, as well as the others you would be hanging around for a while. But only Grace knew that this wasn't even a small amount of your power. Either way, from that moment on, they wouldn't bother you about going outside again. Now, the next step would be going into the jungle. But they had to wait for security clearance for that, and the Colonel didn't like you very much. So that might be a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now, remember, be careful...\" Grace said as you all flew out to the jungle. It had taken a while for the Colonel to agree to letting you out of the base. In the end, he figured that if a big animal ate you, while you were out here, than that would be one problem fixed for him. In that sense, you were glad that he didn't like you very much. As for Grace's comment, is wasn't for you. You had demonstrated, through tests and trials, that you could more than hold your own pretty much anywhere. However, she didn't think that having you fly around would be a good idea. You assumed she was right... so you just jumped really high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing, little guy?\" asked the pilot. Her name was Trudy. You were glad to meet her right off the bat. You even helped her with her bird more than once. She was the unofficial babysitter for all the egg heads. When they needed to be flown into the jungle, she was the one to do it. To be honest, she was the only one that COULD do it. Something about \"the flux\" messing with the instruments and whatnot. She was an excellent pilot and you respected her for her increased morality, amongst other things. But regardless how many incredible things you did, she continued to refer to you as \"little guy\"... oh well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck Yes!!!\" You exclaimed as you leaned out the \"Samson\", then sat back down and just looked out the door. \"This is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Caleb, calm down... uh.. a little bit.\" Grace instructed. Although, halfway through, she realized that it was impossible for you to do that. If  you were effected by this place inside the limited exposure human complex, than out here you would be like crazy. As evidence of this, you could barely keep your eyes from glowing \"Before you run off and explore, I would like your opinion on something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sounds good!\" you answered pleasantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little bit, but Trudy finally landed the Samson and you jumped out, even before it completely touched the ground. You sped around a little then waited for Grace, remembering that she wanted you opinion on something. She laughed at  your apparent \"little kid behavior\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, this is what I wanted you to see.\" She said as she pointed to a considerably thick root. \"Without me telling you anything, I want to see if YOU pick up anything from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, eager to get this done so you could stretch your legs, sort a speak. You bent down and examined the root. There was a lot of life going through it, even for a human, which it wasn't, it was just a root of a tree. So you slowly reached out and put your hand on it, to connect with it. But when you did something crazy happened. You were use to entering an object or person to see what was inside. But you weren't so familiar with something entering you, forcibly. Truthfully, you hadn't met anything that could do that before. Sure the Mages could restrain and torture you, but not open and enter your mind like an open book. You felt an insane amount of power as the entity searched you, not letting go. However, it wasn't a violent intrusion. More like a loving and understanding one... which you didn't think was possible. I mean, how can someone force their way into someone's mind, and still be gentle and loving? This was just another instance that you felt the inescapable truth. You may be powerful, but there were loads of things that were more powerful than you. It never ceased to humble you in that regard. As quickly as it entered and learned from you it separated, allowing you to disconnect from the root. You fell back and stared at the root with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Crap!!!\" You exclaimed, as you tried to grasp what just happened. It was so powerful and yet so quick that you were unsure what to make of it, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Grace asked. Her expression was very astute and ready for anything you were going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the most powerful person I have EVER sensed. I admit, that I have been sensing her sense I got her. But I didn't make the connection, until now.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HER, what do you mean, \"Her\"?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I believe you and the Locals call her, \"Eywa\". She... I don't really know how to describe her, and I only touched her mind for an instant. She was so powerful, that she blocked me and entered my mind with ease. As if all my defenses and mental powers were nothing more than tissue paper.\" you tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... I have speculated for a while, that all the Flora was connected. But... are you saying that you met \"Her\"? You met... the planet, I guess you could say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a manner of speaking, yes.\" you answered, still mystified by the experience. One thing was for sure, you had to introduce yourself properly in the very near future. You had to assume that Eywa had see everything about you, in your mind. From watching the movie, you knew that she would be able to influence and control the things around you, including animals. So, perhaps, she would be giving the wildlife a warning to NOT attack you. You would hate to kill one of them, before you could explain things to her... in your own words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible! We should run some tests and gather samples!\" She exclaimed then got to work. You smiled as you saw her joyously, in her own element. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sense the strange things around you. To be honest, you were trying to do that sense you landed. But things around here didn't have the same signature that you had become so familiar with. However, even through the differences, you could sense a few things beyond the ever steady and present presence of Eywa. You could sense movement, blood, a few other things like that, and a few Avatar like creatures that were watching your group. If you had to guess, you would say that they were the Na'vi. For now they were just watching. Probably making sure that the you all weren't intruding too far or making a mess. Judging on how the rest of the humans were doing and presenting themselves, it was a worthy and accurate concern. Either way, you didn't find any harm in them, so you left them be... even if their blood was tempting you.</span></div></div>",

The last part got her to smile. You both didn't like the arrogant attitude of the Colonel and the other people around him. They either wanted you confined, used for their ends, or completely gone. Ironically, they had the same attitude about the Na'vi. That was probably another reason why Grace liked you so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've demonstrated before, that you don't necessarily need my permission to go out. If I said \"no\" and you wanted to, you could do it anyway. All I ask is for you NOT to harm the already fragile communication with the Na'vi. I would like to mend things with them if I can...\" Grace asked. You knew, as a scientist, she had other reasons as well. But the local population's lives were more important to her than her data and samples. Something that you admired about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do my best. If they try to cut off my head though, I can't just sit there and take it. Even so, I will... refrain from any unnecessary activities that would damage relations for you. Like unauthorized feeding and killing.\" you agreed with some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I appreciate it.\" She returned as you both walked back to the Samson. She began looking around nervously and it caught your eye. \"Strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is strange?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually I have to sidestep some of the larger and unfriendly life on my little trips. I haven't even heard them, or the small ones for a while now,\" she explained in a confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was probably Eywa. She touched my mind and read everything about me. If I had to guess, she would've directed all she could away from me, at least until I prove that I am NOT a threat,\" you induced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that makes sense. And I am really intrigued that you were able to \"connect\" with her. If you get some more information, you will have to tell me later.\" Grace agreed and more asked the last part with a eye brow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" you agreed with a smile up at her. Yep, she was still big and huge. Something you hadn't really gotten used to yet. You both walked back and arrived at the Samson, where Trudy was patiently waiting. When you didn't get in, she got concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we don't have all day!\" she hollered.to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to stick in the jungle for a little bit, already got approval,\" you answered steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Are you crazy? This isn't a place for kids or humans.\" she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget who or what you are talking to.\" you answered back as you flashed your eyes at her. \"I will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you say so. Just... check in every once in a while. I would feel really bad if you died because I didn't have you come back with us.\" she requested hesitantly. She knew you were not normal, so you having her straiten up and what not wasn't taken lightly. But she still cared about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I can't die, remember? But just for you, I will check in when I can. Probably not for weeks or months at a time. But I'll make sure that you all get the message.\" You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they left. Trudy did a double take, just to be sure you were ok. When they were finally out of human eye reach, you looked around and went about your business. You could feel the Na'vi person getting more agitated. You were debating what to do. You could either find a spot to contact Eywa, or address this Na'vi person and start on that road of communication. Both had risks. The likelihood of this one knowing any language you knew was not very likely. But Eywa was so powerful, it was giving you Goosebumps. </span></div></div>",

While communicating with the Na'vi would be important, they would not take kindly to a person that looked like one of the \"sky people\" that was poking around where you didn't belong or was invited. If you had Eywa's blessing, then it was just one more thing in you corner. So you walked for a little bit, not showing anything abnormally amazing about yourself to your Na'vi observer. You were going to find a tall tree, but then you would have to reveal yourself to get up there. So you found a hub of tree roots that were above ground and sat in a meditation posture. You made sure you were out of danger then attempted to connect with Eywa again. Like before, as soon as you did, you felt her awesome presence and was a bit overwhelmed by it. But this time she didn't intrude into your mind. You felt around and entered a neutral space that was in both of your minds, but not intruding on either one. It was hard to do, but Eywa seamed to be helping a great deal. Then you opened your eyes, well inside the connection anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings...\" said an ominous but insanely beautiful voice. Not in the sensual way though. Her voice was like one of those Hollywood star moms. The ones that every boy is in love with, but is also the ultimate Mother. Not overly seductive, but definitely loving and understanding beyond anything that you had heard. She was like a glowing, blonde, and vibrant version of Kelsey, but older. Not too much to look too old. It was like she was at the peek of her prime, and stuck there, immortality you guessed. She was wearing a dress that was the color of the world that was around you. Vibrant hue of colors and glowing lights of sorts that made her multi toned skin look... breath taking. She had a blue hue, like the avatars and Na'vi, but not so much as to clash with her hair or gown. She was a very unforgettable sight, in a very good way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, it is wonderful to meet you Ma'am,\" you said with a bow. You held that position for a moment then straightened. \"I am sorry if this is intrusive. I just wanted to introduce myself and express that I mean no harm to you or this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at peace, young one. I understand. I have looked into your being and I was not repulsed by what I saw. I saw great power, and a great person behind it. I know that you are not here to cause conflict, but that you don't shy away from it either. It is a position that I don't share, understand, but don't implement myself. I also sense that you are not like most of these \"humans\" that are here now. There are some that wish good. But most just want to take from me, and destroy me. Even after my chosen people explained things to them, they do not hear, they do not listen. It seams, not to you either. I will protect the balance, but you... You could do more that that.\" She responded, not moving from where she originally stood. It looked like she was straining to keep this up for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to interfere? I admit that was going to ask if I was allowed to feed on those here and if I could interact with them. But are you saying that you want me to effect things more than that?\" You asked, slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I wish for these humans to stop, but I wish for more is for those under me to be protected. I will not ask you to slay the humans. I will merely request that, while you're here, you look out for them and help when you can. They are ignorant of what dangers they face. They are not what you call advanced, but that is what keeps this place the way it is. I keep myself for them, I do not wish for them to come to ruin wither by advancement or war.\" Eywa responded in the same powerful but kind voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they don't want me to be near them?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will send word and support you. You already feed off my energy, without even realizing it. I will make it known that you are to be trusted and listened to.\" She assured and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do my best to help when I can. Thank you for allowing me to stay her on my vacation of sorts.\" you thanked with another bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go now. I will be watching over you, young one.\" She said then broke the link between you with surprising gentleness. When you opened your eyes, your entire body and the ground for about 20 feet around you was covered with those white floating things that signified Eywa or \"very pure spirits\" as the Na'vi called them. Either way, they were all around you. You didn't know if it was because they were pure, or if they held some kind of power. But you felt very calm and peaceful around them. You looked around noticed that the Na'vi person that was around your before was gone. You wondered where they went but was content waiting among the little white things that were making you feel so good.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You contemplated what to do for a while, taking in the presence of Eywa threw the many \"pure spirits\" that were landing and residing around you. You had nor problem staying there while you thought about it. In the end, you decided to wait for them to approach you. Regardless of what Eywa said, you thought it wouldn't be a very wise move to just barge into their territory, especially if you were an assumed human. Grace's Avatars were one thing, they kind or looked similar, but you... not even close. So you waited, and relaxed, taking in the vast area around you. With Eywa's permission to interfere, you were able to observe much more without fear of effecting things by doing so. You felt all the life around you, the strange insects, the interesting animals, and the vibrant flora were very new and very exciting to you. Eventually though, you felt the same Na'vi from before come back, with another. The first one was male, and this one was female. You couldn't tell too much more, other than some minor words. Despite being able to understand a great deal of languages and Eywa directly, you had no idea what they were saying. One thing was for sure though; they seemed enamored by all the \"pure spirits\" and Eywa's seeds that were surrounding you. The Female came down and started to openly walk toward you, careful not to intrude on the things around her, while the other one watched from a distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Sky People are not welcome here!\" She said after speaking in her own language. She obviously meant it, but not so much as to chase you out with her bow. She was still a little bit away, so you waited till she got closer. She seemed annoyed by this. \"Do you understand? Go Back to where you belong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless I am mistaken, none of the humans belong here,\" you said calmly, not disrupting the entities around you. She seemed taken back by this. Obviously, no human had actually admitted that to her before. She had just thought that saying what she did would send you back to the camp or whatever. \"I am not one of them, in species or in theology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit a stopping point as the spirits and seeds were too thick to take a step without damaging them in some way. So you opened your eyes at once and they dispersed. It was like the rapid falling of bubbles, but thick ones that could be considered a swarm. The female had a mystified face as she watched them, completely missing your glowing eyes... until she looked at you again. You stood, not that it helped much. She was still huge and blue, even from the distance she was away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like one...\" She induced, as she got closer, having to kneel down to make eye contact. Her accent was thick, but understandable. From hearing about Grace's school, this one must've learned English from there. \"... thought your eyes, they are different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The avatars look like you too. Doesn't mean that they are the same.\" you replied back. She frowned at the mention of them for a second then thought about it before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true. However, you look much like the Sky People.\" She agreed, but tacked on the last part. She was still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you wouldn't understand the term if I said what I am. So I guess I will just describe myself, if that is ok???\" you asked then continued as soon as she gave you the nod to do so. She took a upright seat in front of you, still eye level with you... damn these things were big... \"The best way to describe what I am is to say that I am a predator version of a human. Humans, or the people you call \"Sky People\" are my natural prey. But I am more moral than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you hunt them, the Sky people?\" she interrupted and asked, catching on to key words that she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but not for meat. I can eat normal food, but I primarily don't eat them like that. My kind drink the blood of other things. While I can drink from animals and other sources, humans are at the top of the list. However, I know that ending a life is not a very good thing. So I usually drink just enough and let them go.\" you explained. You paused for a moment then continued. \"That is also why I can breathe your planet's air. The Sky people can't because of what their body needs to survive. Mine thrives on what is in the air. I am actually stronger in the open like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why Eywa has blessed you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of. I spoke to her directly... which is probably why her seeds were all around,\" you started and saw her shock at this. But thought that continuing and explaining might help her racing mind. \"You see, I am very powerful. I was not sure if she would allow or want me to influence the things around me. I understand that this is all her, quite literally. So I introduced myself and she gave me permission to explore and interact as much as I want. In fact, she actually wants me to interact with you and others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not possible!\" she exclaimed, shaking her head then looking to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power statement, or the speaking with Eywa part?\" you asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both!!!\" she returned, staring at you now. She obviously didn't feel threatened by you enough to get up and be on guard. But she wanted to observe you very closely. Even if she didn't believe you, there was something different about you that she wanted to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you wanted to get past this, so what do you do??? </span></div></div>",

But just so you have a name to go with WHAT I am, here it is. I am known as a Vampire... Anyway, there is no real way to prove that Eywa and I had a conversation. She doesn't really like to interfere in anything that would alter the balance. I doubt I could talk to her again. So, instead I will show you some of my power. If Eywa supports me, than her seeds will gather. If not, then that part is false, fair enough?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" she said, after thinking about it for a while. It seamed like she was calming down. Yet she still hadn't gotten up from the position she was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decided, you rose you hand and floated at the same time. You used a bunch of abilities to form an elemental aura around you. You also allowed a few of the more impressive elements, mainly fire and lightning, to dance in decorative designs on your hands. She bolted back when she saw this. Slowly she came forward as she observed the things around her that were bending to your will. Trees were swaying, rock and stone were forming. As usual, the only thing that wasn't doing something cool was the water. It was a very impressive display. Then, just as she came within touching distance with you floating at her eye level now, Eywa's seeds and other things of that nature started gathering. They gathered and bounced around, as if they were dancing with each other in their support of you. The female Na'vi warrior turned and marveled at the grand spectacle. The other one that was watching fell over in amazement as well. She ended her shocked observation by gazing at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe me now? I can do a lot more than this. However, I believe this is all that is necessary. Yes?\" You asked as your eyes glowed and your teeth were shown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is very well.\" She answered. With that you lowered your power level and canceled all the effects you were having. As if on cue, all the seeds and other things that had gathered had dispersed into the jungle. The trees were still swaying, but not from you. They were just residual waving from the awesome power before. \"That was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started talking to herself as she paced around. You didn't know what she was saying, but she was obviously having a hard time and arguing with herself. She was young, and probably didn't know what to do in such a situation. She would go one direction and rattle off some words that were, you guessed, not too flattering about you. Then she would walk the other way with a more calm and contemplative persona, as if answering questions she was asking herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

Figured, the first one of them you meet had to be one of the main characters. But you were given permission to effect things. You figured that as long as Jake got the necessary attention when he got there, then you wouldn't have a problem. You both talked as she led you to the village. You further talked about what you could do and she tested your physical abilities by running, climbing, and falling. At one point, you appeared where she landed before she did. She seemed to like this a great deal and laughed about it. She was still huge and blue, but she was a cool girl to be around. She led you further and you began to feel others around you. You weren't going to address it, but they did the same thing they did to Jake... or were going to do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are something else.\" Neytiri said as you both walked on a sort of path. The Na'vi seamed to in tune with nature and Eywa to make permanent paths in random parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel any better, you are interesting as well. I usually don't get a very good reaction when I feed for the first time,\" you replied back. She had wanted to see what you were talking about. So she let you attract a large animal and drink from it. She was more fascinated than concerned. It was by far, a welcomed change of pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Sky People disapprove?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Grace doesn't. But most everyone else have all heard stories about my kind. Most do not paint a very good picture of me. The worst is that Colonel, head of security guy. He really only thinks with his gun.\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" She stated, but was cut off by a weapon being flung at you. It was something to ensnare your legs. You thought about letting it hit you. But that wasn't something you were interested in. This was suppose to be a vacation. You didn't have to worry about preserving the timeline and whatnot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thing came you jumped just enough to avoid it, but flipped upside down to catch this thing by the end and land while twisting it into a ball and holding it. Neytiri stopped as well but you were already circling around to address the others that were coming into the area. The road around on those horse looking things and circled you. You looked around until you saw the main guy who threw the weapon at you. Once they had stopped and pointed their bows at you. You threw the curled up thing back to him. He caught it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you dropped that,\" you replied in a stare down of sorts. They shouted and pulled back their bows, just to have Neytiri jump in. She hissed then started talking and yelling back at them in their language. You weren't as impatient as Jake would be. You just stood there in a relaxed state... that was until one of them pointed their spear at you then jabbed forward. They were obviously trying to scare you, to prove how insignificant you were. But when you didn't move, the spear dug into your back and came out your chest. Neytiri looked on in enraged shock. But you just looked as bored as you did before. You looked down at the protruding object then up at her. \"You know, if I had any less restraint, I would definitely kick their butt for this. As a favor to you. But I am definitely taking this spear away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said you grabbed the protruding tip and pulled hard enough to pull it out of the warriors hands. You pulled it all the way through you then held it out. With noticeably little effort you snapped it in half, then used your power to burst it into dust. They both shouted and marveled at this. You looked down at your chest and gave an annoyed sigh. Then you used your power to mend and clean your clothes, your body already had dealt with the insignificant wound. Then you crossed your arms and stared back at her, this broke her shocked posture and she started yelling at them with more emotion. She obviously didn't like people she knew getting hurt or threatened. Granted, she only knew you for a very short time, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you come with us?\" Neytiri asked as she came from talking with the others. A few more came forward and reached for you, probably to restrain you or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but you better tell them that they can touch me again, if they are willing to lose those hands of theirs. I let them touch me once with that spear. With that trust broken, they will have to think long and hard before trying it again,\" you advised as you looked at the two approaching hands of the Na'vi warriors that were coming to restrain you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeytiri stopped them with another course of yelling and hissing. At that point she came back and you all were off. She offered you a ride on her horse thing, but you said you wanted to run instead. She laughed as the others laughed at you, then laughed harder when they turned to a shocked silence as you ran... sometimes faster than they were at full gallop. It was unclear what would happen when you got there. You had never been this open before, but it felt good not to have to hide... for once. </span></div></div>",

It seemed that you running there helped with the respect level but not the weirdness level. That and they were still bigger that you were. A couple hundred big blue people is a sight when you are among them. You let your eyes glow, as it was hard to restrain them. They also needed to know that you weren't a normal human. Well... technically you weren't a human at all. However, to their eye, you looked enough like one... which was fair. Eventually you were brought before her Father and chief of the Clan. He asked her a few things, some in an angry tone. Then the one you knew as Mo'at came down. You remembered her from the movie. You knew what she would do to decide. You decided to have some fun with it. She walked around you and seemed to evaluate what and who you are, without talking to you. It was so much easier when you could understand different languages. This one... not so much. Then she pricked you and tasted your blood. This would be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you!!!\" she exclaimed as she took stock in what she had seen, felt, and tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already answered that. I am a Vampire.\" you answered and then realized, from the looks on their faces, that they didn't understand. \"A predator that lives primarily off of the blood of other living things. I have abilities beyond normal people. Despite my appearance, I am not a human, or what you call \"the sky people\". I was given permission to interact with you and your people, as well as this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By whom???\" asked Mo'at. She didn't seem like she was challenging you. So you didn't see the harm in telling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eywa. I thought it wise to connect with her. I didn't want to be disrespectful and effect your lives if she had a problem with it. As it turns out, she didn't,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we would believe that you spoke with Eywa?\" asked Eytukan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered by holding out your hand and bringing some of Eywa's seeds and other \"pure spirits\" to you. You figured that they would respond better to such a thing. Within a few minutes there were hundreds of them floating around and landing on you. Then they disappeared as quickly as they had arrive, back into the jungle and where they had came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said that she would make it known that I had her support. While she won't interfere with things, she has given me the authority to do so.\" You replied after they were done wondering at what you had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... this is hard to handle.\" Mo'at responded. Neytiri was smiling with the situation. She had taken to you quickly, and she knew that your other abilities would also make them pause and stare in a manner of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time, I have all the time in the world.\" You replied.</span></div></div>",

Unlike in the movie, she was not irritated by the idea of teaching you. Perhaps because you were already competent in your own right. Maybe your attractant was effecting her, even if you had it suppressed. You checked just in case, it was completely sealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it will be fun.\" you answered to which she nodded and proceeded to talk with some of the others than they left you, most with a bit of distain. But those that had already witnessed you do a few things stayed to see what you would do next. You held up your hand to her when she came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked. Again, she had to kneel and bow low to meet your eyes. She seemed fascinated by them as they glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No completely, not yet... but I find that I have a very strong pull to you. Not as a mate, even if that were possible. Just a strong pull.\" She tried to explain as she stretched out her hand. You smiled as you finally understood how Eywa would influence them if she chose. Not surprising, she was a very powerful lady after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then hold on, I want to give them something to gawk at.\" you said. She looked at you with confusion before you dove under her, lifted her easily, then took off into the air. The sudden action made those under you rush in to see what was happening and Neytiri to hold you in a death grip, with the speed you were going you weren't surprised by it. You kept going until you were above the great tree that you were previously under then put her down on the air. Well not on the air exactly. You had a thin layer of your body under her feet. But it was too small for her to detect. Even if the amount was bonded with her feet so she could walk around up here. She did so but seemed as timid as a mouse. As if the slightest wrong step would cause her to plunge to her death. \"You don't need to worry. While with me, you can do stuff like this. Well to be fair, I am still holding you up. I hope I wasn't too forward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... flew, like the great beasts of the air. And I... I am standing on... nothing. How is this possible?\" she asked as she gazed around then at you, nervously glancing underneath her on occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will find that I am capable of many things. Including flying, and much faster than that. I promise this, I will not be a burden to you in any physical way. Thank you for agreeing to teach me. It would be really nice to not have to guess what you all are saying. You have learned my language, I find it only fair that I learn yours. It wont take long and we can learn other things as well.\" You answered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this will do.\" She responded, having trouble coming up with rational words to describe her feelings at present.</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t know why you where so eager to accept Ms. Isabelle\u2019s offer, maybe it was because she seemed so Desperate, which for you was a first. You had known Ms. Isabelle for many years now and she always carried herself like royalty, she had a certain elegance that even you a 12 year old could see a plan as day, so maybe, just maybe you didn\u2019t want to disappoint her, or maybe it was because deep down you wanted this power, you couldn\u2019t help but think that maybe you were the kind of person that Ms. Isabelle wanted to avoid giving this power to. You lost in thought didn\u2019t realize Ms. Isabelle staring right at you with eyes that could pierce the very soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving second thoughts Caleb?\u201d Ms. Isabelle asks with a calm demeanor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly breakout of your train of thought and focus your attention back towards Ms. Isabelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh no Ma\u2019am I\u2019m just...... not sure.\u201d You never wanted to get Ms. Isabelle\u2019s hopes up but you had to tell the truth. The truth was that you were scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not blame yourself for feeling fear Caleb, the life that I\u2019m asking you to have, the burden that I\u2019m asking you to bare is unimaginable. But for all that is good you must be the one to carry it.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says with a gentle smile that seemed to melt away your fear like ice under the blazing sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll do my best Ms. Isabelle.\u201d You say with a new found confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you will Caleb.\u201d Isabelle says pulling you in for a hug that seemed to last for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow we should begin, for upon midnight my life will be extinguished.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says releasing you from her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell all you need to do is..........\u201d Ms. Isabelle abruptly stops talking and stares at the front door that rested in front of the house. You didn\u2019t know why but Ms. Isabelle had a serious look on her face as she did nothing but stare at the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Isabelle are you o.....\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!!!\u201d Suddenly without warning the door burst open, splinters of wood go flying through the air. You cover your eyes as dust fills the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the dust starts to clear and 5 men walk through a large hole which stood where the front door use to stand. You with only a glance could tell that these men meant business, each one held a gun, which was pointed at both you and Ms. Isabelle. You could tell they weren\u2019t cops, nor where they detectives, so the question was who where they?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon one of the men step forward. The man in question whore a black leather jacket and black jean pants with thick black boots. The man had a small beard \ud83e\uddd4 and short blond hair, with sea green eyes which were fixed on Ms. Isabelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve finally found you crimson queen \ud83d\udc51.\u201d The man says with nothing short of discuss in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Ms. Isabelle wondering why the strange man called her by such a name, and what was the meaning behind such a name and the hatred that came with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you think you were going to be able to hide forever vampire?\u201d The man asks pacing back and forth unable to remain still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHide yes.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says with a sigh \ud83d\ude14. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForever???? Alas nothing lasts forever.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says with sorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed and now we are going to prove that claim, for today is the day you die by our hands.\u201d The man says with purpose as he points his gun right at Ms. Isabelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already know their is no point in talking with you barbarians so let\u2019s just make this quick.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says standing up and brushing her black dress with both her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet her have it boys.\u201d The man in front says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further warning the sound of gun fire is let loose all through out the house. You close your eyes, you couldn\u2019t bare to watch these crazy maniacs commit such a horrible act. Soon the sound of gun fire disappears and you with unspeakable fear open your eyes. What you saw you couldn't believe. Ms. Isabelle was standing right in front of you, and right in front of her in the middle of the air floated hundreds of bullets. You weren\u2019t the only ones in shock. The men who fired the bullets were also shocked from the recent developments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN- no how can this be, how could she have stopped all of them so easily.\u201d The bearded man says with a little bit of fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt truly is a shame that you boys came to challenge me at the wrong time.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says with another sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see I\u2019ve had a little bit of blood this evening so I\u2019m. It as weak as I use to be.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon remember when Ms. Isabelle had drank some of your blood earlier. It was such a little amount but she could stop bullet in her tracks with such ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you boys don\u2019t mind I would like to finish this quickly.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says with a smile \ud83d\ude0a that was anything other than friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Isabelle soon vanishes from where she is standing as if she had never been their. H <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d A scream of pain surrounds your surroundings. You soon realize it is coming from one of the men Armed with guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take you long to realize why he was screaming. Right behind him stood Ms. Isabelle with her right arm sticking out of the mans Stomach. Ms. Isabelle wore a cold look as if she didn\u2019t care about anything. Ms. Isabelle soon disappears again and this time even more screams echo through out the house. Man after man was killed in some kind of gruesome fashion. They where either stabbed, sliced in Half, or where missing a certain body part and died from massive blood loss. Soon their was only one guy left standing, the same guy from earlier with the beard. He stood completely still as Ms. Isabelle splattered all of his comrades. Tears running down his face and he gritted his teeth. You could tell that not only was he afraid he was angry with himself for being useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then their was one.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says with a seductive tone as she walks closer to the paralyzed man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-you will never get away with this. A-as we speak more of our comrades are coming this way. You will never escape. So you might as well just kill me.\u201d The man says with certain eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill you?\u201d No, no, no I\u2019m not going to kill you, that would be to easy.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says with a smle as she grew closer to the man. Without warning Ms. Isabelle grabs the mans throat and lifts him in the air. Ms. Isabelle\u2019s eyes soon start to glow red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour punishment is to live. Live in a illusion of horrors and pain.\u201d Ms. Isabelle soon puts the man down and as if he were nothing but a empty shell the man drops to the floor seemingly lifeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never been so afraid in your life, and as Ms. Isabelle turned towards you that fear soon escalated. Ms. Isabelle\u2019s face was covered in blood, so were her hands and dress. Her eyes flowed crimson red and her beautiful hair was a mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb?\u201d She asks walking towards you slowly. You couldn\u2019t help but back up, and soon you turn around and begin to run towards the front door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb wait, don\u2019t run away from me it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says but it was to late. You where gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to find him before the hunters do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Never before had you ever beheld such a vile act, the taking of ones life, and the utter apathy while doing it, you knew deep down you would never be able to look at Ms. Isabelle ever again, not without seeing the apathetic monster underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to hurry home, were it was safe, from all of this madness. The sun was going down and if that man from earlier was telling the truth than more men with guns were on their way to kill Ms. Isabelle, and you knew from their behavior they didn\u2019t care if you lived or died from the crossfire. Tears fell from your eyes, you after everything that had happened still cared about Ms. Isabelle, you didn\u2019t want her to die, but what could you do, these men were obviously trained in the art of combat, while you were just a child that didn\u2019t know what you were getting in to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe finally found her!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop abruptly hearing a noise ahead of you. Someone was coming but who. You quickly look around, trying to find a place to hide. You were surrounded by a myriad of apartment buildings, you were so close to your apartment that it wasn't even funny, you couldn\u2019t  be discovered now. After a few seconds of looking you finally decide to hide in the thick bushes that stood beside the apartment buildings as a sign of decoration. The green leaves were cold as you covered your whole entire body with their branches. Suddenly a large group of men were running by the bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry men (Team A) hasn\u2019t responded.\u201d One of the mans said with a rushed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry (Team B) should be close to their location.\u201d Another man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take you long to understand. This men are more hunters, and each one was headed in the direction of Ms. Isabelle\u2019s house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes had gone by and the stamped of hunters had finally ended. You could finally keep going. Your apartment, your home was just a few blocks away, all of this could be over, all you had to do was forget about Ms. Isabelle, forget about vampires \ud83e\udddb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, and the responsibility that was yours to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took one step and found that you couldn\u2019t take another. Sweat ran down your forehead as you partook in a inner battle in your head, a battle between right and wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god protect me.\u201d You say as you turn around facing the same direction the hunter from before had ran towards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Isabelle I\u2019m coming.\u201d You say a you run towards Ms. Isabelle\u2019s house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you around 20 minutes to return to Ms. Isabelle\u2019s house, and honestly it was a lot harder to get to Ms. Isabelle\u2019s house than you remembered. Hunter after hunter was stationed at every street, each hunter making sure to block the way that led to Ms. Isabelle\u2019s house. You with all the craftiness you could muster managed to sneak right past all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wore a shocked look on your face as you stood before Ms. Isabelle\u2019s house, that was now torched to the ground. You knew at that moment that those horrible people didn\u2019t just want to kill Ms. Isabelle, that wanted to completely wipe her ver existence from the face of the earth. The recharge was quite large, and worse you didn\u2019t know if Ms. Isabelle had been killed from the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe found her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you hear a voice but this time it was coming from behind you. You without wasting time run and hide behind the wreckage of the now destroyed house. Looking through the small cracks of burned wood you see 4 men in black jackets, wearing military style boots running past the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Crimson Queen had been spotted.\u201d One of the men said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let her escape, not this time\u201d another one of the men say as they continue to run past the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but feel relieved. Ms. Isabelle was still alive, and you knew just how to find her. You had to follow those hunters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the men, not to closely of course, always hiding yourself in the shadows when you where in danger of being discovered, and after a few minutes of following the hunters closely you soon find yourself at the Saint Cross Graveyard, which was the graveyard right down the street to were you lived. The men had walked through the iron gates that, to your surprise was completely open. The gates would usually be closed around 7:30, and right know it was pushing past 8:00. You came to the conclusion that the hunters was behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run through the gates and run Down the brick roads that ran throughout the whole graveyard still falling the 4 hunters from before. You along with the 4 hunters soon make it to the front of the whole graveyard, and what you see brings tears to your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Isabelle surrounded by around a 100 hunters was covered in blood from head to toe, and was breathing hard. You could tell from the ripped dress \ud83d\udc57 that Ms. Isabelle had fought a hard battle. You wanted to help her but what could you do. Looking around you could help but take notice of the dead hunter bodies that littered the ground everywhere. You understood that this was a graveyard but this was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the battle from behind a stone statue of a angel, and while watching you fill a strong tug of your jacket. Turning around you see a man with a giant Scare on his face. The man had brown curly hair and wore a leather black jacket with light brown pants and black boots \ud83e\udd7e. The man also gave off a vibe of danger whenever you looked at him. Both of your eyes met and deep down you just wanted to curl up into a ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well, just look what we have here.\u201d The man says as he pulls you with him, as he walks in the middle of his soldiers, and stand right in front of Ms. Isabelle? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Isabelle upon seeing you couldn\u2019t help but reveal a shocked and yet fearful look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow if I remember the reports correctly, they said that a boy was seen leaving the Crimson Queens house .\u201d The man says with a devilish smile as he looks at you then at Ms. Isabelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelease him Samuel, I\u2019m the one you want.\u201d Me. Isabelle says with a stern voice and sharp eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, oh my is this the same Crimson queen I know from the pass. The same creature that had killed countless of people, the same vampire that drove people mad from the meat mention of her name.\u201d The man named Samuel says with a little laughter in his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks at you for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what your connection is to this boy, but from the look on your face I can tell he means a lot to you.\u201d Samuel says reverting his cold red eyes back to Ms. Isabelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel pain.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t see him move, it was just to fast, all you felt was the sharp pain in your gut, and the screams of Ms. Isabelle. Looking down you see a large silver knife sticking out of your gut. You and been stabbed. You fall down on your knees one hand in the ground, the other gripping the injury. Where you going to die?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bloody fool!!!\u201d Ms. Isabelle screams with eyes glowing red and a red crimson aura flowing all around her body. Waves of crimson energy shoot out of her body a cause every single hunter close by to fall back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Isabelle runs over to you and quickly pulls out the knife from your stomach. A pool of blood rushes out from your wound making you feel dizzy. Ms. Isabelle looks at you with concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb hold on.\u201d Me. Isabelle says as she stand up and holds out her hands. You soon realize that you where covered by a crimson barrier, a barrier that protected you both from the hunters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Isabelle once again bends down to get a closer look at your wound, and soon she wears a grave look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb please listen, I\u2019m loosening strength fast, my time is almost up. At this rate you are going to die, and I don\u2019t have enough strength the heal this wound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to make the choice, will you live as the one and only vampire, or will you die.\u201d Me. Isabelle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you choose to die, then I promise you, you will not die alone my sweet boy.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says, the kindness returning to her eyes with a smile, that almost made you forget everything she had put you through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for you to decide, at this moment you stood on the Abyss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll become the vampire, a-all of your burdens, I\u2019ll take them all.\u201d You said with a painful smile. You didn\u2019t want to die so you only had one choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well the choice has been made.\u201d Ms. Isabelle says as she brings her face closure to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose your eyes, this won\u2019t hurt a bit.\u201d She says gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as you are told and close your eyes, and soon you fill Ms. Isabelle\u2019s cold lips on your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod forgive me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There sits a woman who is dressed in a business style pinstriped corset, a long black flowing skirt that is tight in all the right places, very easy on the make-up, has two-toned hair, and a single signature necklace on. After Andrea finished her speech she walked up to the table in the back to make a formal introduction. When she makes it to the table, the young woman introduces herself, my name is Isibelle Zhtomir, and it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. I was intrigued by your fundraiser. I myself quite enjoy the chance of wearing my more formal dresses. I\u2019ll buy a ticket as long as you will do me the honors of allowing me to go as your plus one. Andrea was awe struck and began to stutter, she had never had a proposal like that come from a stranger, yet she seemed so familiar. It took several seconds but she was able to give Isibelle her ticket to the dinner. They set up a date so Isibelle could take her out shopping for a dress that would go well with what she was envisioning on wearing to the dinner party.<br>\r\nThat meeting was the beginning of a great start to a long friendship. With Isibelle coming into the coffee shop every Tuesdays and Thursdays it was the perfect cover for her real reason. What she really wanted was Andrea. She has become infatuated by Andrea, it was her wit, her charm, and her determination that made her the focal point. They chatted about trivial things, basically it was her way of learning more about Andrea without raising any red flags. When Andrea was alone she was dreaming of freedom from her home life. It was those long chats with Isibelle that made her feel free and she could let her guard down. Yet alone she felt trapped by her mother, who refused to let her grow into a young lady. She will run away if that is what it takes to have her freedom. Her mother stops at nothing to let her know that she owes everything to her mother. Andrea has no other plans, she will get her freedom, no matter how it is offered to her. Andrea wants to prove to everyone that she is old enough to make it on her own. She befriends Isibelle, Isibelle seems to understand her pain of wanting to shake off her past and start anew. Isibelle can sense Andrea\u2019s pain and wants nothing more than to help her see there is hope at the end of the tunnel. She wants Andrea to feel there is so much more to life than working part time and coming from a broken home. She wants Andrea to know that nothing is out of reach, you just have to reach out and take it. They both are in dire need of each other for different reasons. They just don\u2019t know the full extent they are willing to go before they find a positive outcome for both of them. Isibelle must find her replacement and soon or else her body will parish, her powers and wisdom will pass to the nearest life form. There is nothing she can do to stop her body from turning to ash. Her successor is young but just maybe she is strong enough to survive the next 2099 years. She must find another to accept her gift/curse before she dies. This is why the coffee moments with Andrea are crucial. The more she learns about Andrea the clearer her choice becomes. Andrea is only 18 year old, she comes from a broken home and her only joys comes from being a cheer leader captain and her job at the local coffee shop.<br>\r\nAndrea hears her mother\u2019s voice ringing through her head that she will never amount to anything, that all that is waiting for her is a baby and a husband much like her father. This is her lowest point she is dripping with insecurity. She cannot seem to shake her mother\u2019s voice. Isibelle cannot shake the feeling that time is not on her side, she will fail to pass on her gift before the hour glass runs out of sand. She knows her successor, yet it is all about timing. How and when to pass on the gift is running through her head. This takes a great deal of planning and a very soft hand. Soft hands and lots of planning must be done to insure a smooth passing. With every great plan comes great risk and failure. If Andrea fails she will become her mother and work two jobs, one at work and the other as a servant to her husband, who is like that of her father. If Isibelle fails her body will parish and fate will be out of her hands and her gift will be passed on at random.<br>\r\nIsibelle has offered to do coffee at her place on more than one occasion. Andrea\u2019s home life was becoming more than she could bare, so she gave Isibelle a call to see if tonight was a good night to stop by for coffee. Isibelle was more than eager to say yes. Once Andrea showed up, she made two cups of coffee and walked them into the nook. That way they could have a more personal chat about what was on Andreas mind. Both inadvertently tipped their hands, Andrea first, she told Isibelle about her home life was less than desirable. Isibelle told her, she could make all her pain go away by that of a simple bite. She told Andrea of her powers, but that time was not on her side. Andrea realized what she told Isibelle and quickly made her exit. She was lost within her own thoughts that she only half heard what Isibelle said. Isibelle felt that she had ran Andrea off and was not seeing just how vulnerable Andrea really was.<br>\r\nAlmost a week has passed before they would meet again. Isibelle came into the coffee shop for her usual coffee and chatter. Andrea walked up and said, a penny for your thoughts. Isibelle was miles away and unaware that she was twisting her hair into a large knot. It was then that they tried to apologize for their last encounter. Andrea proceed to sit down so they could have a quick chat. She asked Isibelle if they could have a longer chat after work tonight about her gift. Isibelle was delighted to know that she in fact did the opposite of what she thought she had done. They set up a time to meet after work at Isibelle\u2019s place. She told Andrea that she had an errand to do and gave her the key so she could let herself in. After work Andrea went to Isibelle\u2019s place and let herself in with the key. Once inside, she found the study, she was amazed by the volume of books that Isibelle had. Some of the books dated back to the 1800\u2019s. She heard a noise that came from the backyard, it was Isibelle, and she went upstairs to change her clothes. She meet Andrea in the kitchen. It was here that both have come to an understanding and Isibelle revealed her true self. This was a huge step with a great deal of vulnerability, she was trusting that she made the right choice. It was a moment of clarity, one that Andrea took in great stride. She soaked up all that Isibelle had to say. She is so eager to learn more. Isibelle has told her everything, they talked until almost dawn. Andrea gets a message from her mother demanding that she gets home at once. So she told Isibelle that she wants to know more but it is in her best interest that she gets home. <br>\r\nIf Andrea fails she will become her mother and work two jobs, one at work and the other as a servant to her husband, who is like that of her father. If Isibelle fails her body will parish and fate will be out of her hands and her gift will be passed on at random.</span></div></div>",

Some contained her image and others merely showed the spirit in which she viewed the subject that she wanted to capture. Though these pieces were a mere representative of the body of works that existed in greater amounts elsewhere, they were selected with care to tell the story of her humble beginnings to the mastery of the skills that took several lifetimes to achieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Picture frames contained newspaper clippings from different eras and in various languages. Some were written by others regarding her work. Others were actually written by her during one of her latest lifetimes when a career in journalism seemed to suit her tastes and the photographs were merely a contribution to the work of the male pseudonym she used in the more misogynistic era of the newspaper's history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Derek ran his hand along the shelves that housed her books. From century-old first edition manuscripts to more recent vintages, they ranged in subject and style from genuine literary treasures to trashy best sellers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Some of those are mine.\" Her pathetic voice practically screeched out, breaking the silence of the barely lit room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stench in the room spoke of a body that had begun to fail long before the mind. Upon entering the apartment, many of the would-be caretakers she had hired would always grimace at the smell. They would comment on the clutter and how she needed to get rid of some \"stuff\". They certainly never longingly looked at the books as though lost in a time and place they had never seen, but wanted to be a part of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Standing at five feet, the boy was barely finished with the early half of his twenties, a little overweight, stocky and unsure of himself, with glasses that kept slipping from his brown eyes.  His therapist had suggested he do some volunteer work. That getting some human contact with people outside of his work environment would make him feel more alive again. Not content to work with large groups of people, Derek found an ad in the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the end of her very long life, Isibelle\u00e2\u0080\u0098s body had begun to show signs of decay. It started slowly, just a year before. Her once long and vibrantly black hair was now so faded as to appear as a ghost. Her skin, once smooth as marble and softer than goose down was cracked and fragile. Her strength failed her and she was confined to the bed for much of the day, resulting in some fairly embarrassing occurrences that contributed to the tapestry of unpleasant odors now hanging in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If Derek was uncomfortable he showed no signs of it. When his eyes popped out of his head at the sight of the signed copy of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, she fell in love with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOthers were written by the descendants of my many children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Derek came to her side, his face alight with indignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd none of those descendants could find the time to be with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She managed a weak smile, no longer able to chuckle at his anger on her behalf. He gently took her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of them believe I am dead, Derek,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she reminded him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to let them go on believing this, just as it will be for you when you accept the gift.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Derek looked up at some of her photos. The ones where she clearly hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been shy about people knowing she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t age a day between her 1800\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daguerreotype and the very last digital photo of her at her very last book signing almost three years ago. Granted, there were some obvious changes in styles and appearances, but there was no mistaking the curve of her nose and the penetrating glare of her eyes. In some photos, she even bore the caste mark she had received during her five century long stay in India.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou really won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be around?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked.

From the pain in her eyes, Derek could tell it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you will have 2100 years to figure it out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said. Her breathing became more labored. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I got it right the first time. I was as nervous as you and made many mistakes that could well have cost me my long life. What you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read in the books I have written you will have to figure out for yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next few moments were a blur.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unknown to most, you are a war veteran and former elite soldier. In the last week of your active service, during the last Desert War, you had suffered a head-shot from a sniper. The quick medical care from your comrades, the helicopter pilot's swift arrival and a near-miracle surgery had saved your life. Yet you could no longer serve as soldier and neither would you ever graduate at elite-university due parts of your brain being destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were mustered out with all honors. A war veteran with no stain in his file. It took eight weeks of strenuous physiotherapy and recovery measures, to regain full control of your body. It took three additional months, because you were repeatedly scanned for psychological trauma. You did not suffer one, by now it is scientifically evidenced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before circumstances had forced you into living a simple life, you had learned lessons from both God and the Army. You had seen comrades torn to shreds by landmines, fellow soldiers assassinated by religious assassins in disguise and you always knew, that was the Line of Duty. You had chosen it and part of that was, that the enemy would of course be of a violent and antagonist opinion. Your ego was not crushed or shattered, yours was just transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had agreed to the divorce, as you did not blame your wife to be horrified with the new situation and how far it would drag her down socially. She was innocent of this and even though it made you cry, you respected her freedom of choice without any proverbial bad blood. Life was no church-chorus and few could bear such an allegorical cross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still had support by the veteran program and friends to pay you a visit once or twice per year. You applied for the job as janitor, did rent a small apartment and fluently went into your new line of duty. It was a gift few could perceive, yet while impaired, you still remain a happy man. Two weeks ago the doctors allowed you to restart jogging and workouts. Mrs. Whiteley from down the street had invited you to her bible-group on Sunday afternoons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cook here at school had recruited you for a neighborhood-project, on Tuesdays and Thursdays you deliver food to people who cannot go shopping themselves. Your life had one brutal setback, yet it had more than a thousand blessings. Even the Friday evening Online-Card-Game with beer and fast-food is welcome joy to you. You know that millions of people will never be as blessed as you are and you always do your best, to support your country and your people unconditionally.</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing at 5'11'' you are slightly above average in terms of height. Your blonde hair is down just past your ears. At home you are a quiet teen and rarely have any outbursts of emotion. Your friend circle is pitiful and this is mainly to do with your aspergers disorder. You were diagnosed upon entering kindergarten much to your mothers dismay. In terms of grades you are a straight A student in all but PE and are slated to be valedictorian. You could easily be doing college work but your Mom wants you to live like a normal child. You are quite scrawny but your mind is sharper than a scalpel and can solve complex logical problems with extreme ease as long as the dont involve emotion. In fact you couldn't get comfortable until that equation you saw on the board in physics for a few seconds before it was rubbed off, was payed out in your book with explanations and examples. In your life you have been called cold and spiteful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family consists of your Mom, Lucinda 38, your Dad, James 39, your twin sisters and your brother. Your sisters are both 10 and are completely identical in each and every way. They both wear light pink dresses and are never seen without one another. There names are Grace and Lucy. Your brother is 7 and is aspergic like you. He was also diagnosed in kindergarten but this time under your fathers orders as he discovered that his father was autistic and so was his brother. Your brothers name is Luke. Your father works as an executive in a large corporation and your mother is a teacher at the local community college. Your father is atheist and your mother is slightly spiritualist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour alarm clock went off and you groggily flopped your hand onto the snooze button. Slowly you sat up and got ready to go down for breakfast. You pulled on a pair of jeans and a fall out boy tee shirt. For breakfast your mom had served up some English muffins and fried eggs. \"remember Matthew, we've got to visit great aunt Agatha later so dont start any long games.\" You mom, Lucinda, reminded you. <br>\r\n\"Ok, mom.\" You responded as you squirted ketchup into the breakfast muffin.After breakfast you leaped up the stairs and started playing skyrim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours of slaying draugrs in ancient Nordic tombs your mother called you down to go see your great aunt. The car journey was about half an hour and took you well out of your comfortable suburban neighbourhood and into the small villages. You great aunt lived in a small cottage beside an old mansion that must be well over 200 years old. You stepped out of the car and stretched. Your sun came outside. She was an old women in her late eighties and was quite spry for her age. She didn't use a frame or have any medical issues. Her enigma friend stood beside her. You had met her before, apparently older than your grandma but she never looked it. Your aunt and her had been friends for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked closer to her you noticed that she looked older and exhausted, but still kept her smile.</span></div></div>",

You were a little lost. Why was this women taking you into the sitting room when the rest of your family was in the kitchen. \"I bet your wondering why I've separated you from your family? You see I have a proposition for you.\" She said as she walked you over to the sofa and made you sit down with a firm but not forceful hand. \"See I'm a vampire.\" She said. Your first thought was to laugh but when her eyes shifted from blue to red and she summoned a small flame into the palm of her hand, your face dropped. \"There's no need to be scared, I've chosen you as my successor. If you accept this proposition you will have all my powers and complete immortality for 2100 years. What do you say?\" She explained. You thought for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ok I accept. But one thing.... What's the catch? You inquired. During the whole conversation you couldn't lock eyes with her.<br>\r\n \"Clever boy. One catch is that once those 2100 years are up you will die. Another is that you can only make one person live forever. The third and probably biggest one is that you wont be able to procreate whilst in possession of this gift.\" She explained with a sly smile. You nodded as she said this and considered it for a few seconds.<br>\r\n \"I still accept. Immortality even in a limited amount of time is still a very big point in favour and dwarfs the downsides on its own.\" You confirmed.<br>\r\n \"Good, your Aunt helped me organise this and so she can help after the change. We have set up a cover story for my disappearance. We where attacked and you got knocked unconscious and I got kidnapped. Ok?\" She explained and you nodded to show you where following. <br>\r\n \"Your Aunt has already taken them out for a walk.

A single bead of perspiration dripped down your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We shall begin.\" She said as she pulled you close and tilted your neck to the side. \"This wont hurt.... Much.\" Her fangs extended and plunged into your neck. At first you felt a small sharp pain then a rush of pleasure. In less than a second you felt the numbing waves of blood loss go through your mind and you felt your heart stop. She then started pushing her own blood in you through her fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your mouth was open and gasping in pain as the blood was pumped around your body and just before she had finished your own fangs extends for the first time and your eyes misted into a scarlet red.

Being the last on your list for food delivery, you gladly invested the extra hours of effort. You are certain that most Americans would have done the same. You even waited with her, until the doctor finally had time to pay her a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally departed you ran into Cassia Pennington, the daughter of Mrs. Maria Pennington. With one look you had assessed the situation, and so you helped her carrying supplies into the house. God has his own way to reward the minor niceties. At least that was the thought you got, when smelling the wood of the stairs leading into the cellar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven on your walk home you still thought about good craftsmanship, and all the little blessings of life. It helped you thinking less about the Army. Sometimes you missed your unit, and the feeling of being one among equals. Still you rejoiced at the thought that tomorrow there would be another sinful Friday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinful Friday. Fred, Anderson and Mike had liked it, as they had feared you would be too well-drilled to enjoy beer, barbecue, or burgers. You were not. You learned to give others the time they needed to become the best possible person, and you liked your new friends without judging them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust six more lantern-posts. And indeed, you were close to home, when you heard a scream for help, and sounds of a struggle. Ruffians in your hood? It was a weird thought. Your body had already reacted, and you ventured towards a badly lit parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree muscled brutes were circling a business woman. It was injustice by the book. Like predatory beasts they allowed their greed to guide them down the road to hell. You remembered that Chris Rea Oldie named Road to Hell. It ran on the radio some nights before you were stopped from being a soldier anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a pretty clear estimation about your chances here. You even felt that a shadow of darkness was lurking for you. Yet justice had to be done, as allowing the wicked to win breeds only more injustice, and suffering. Maybe you would not be able to save the woman, as brawling versus three thugs had bad odds for you. Yet that was a maybe. The option of abandoning a woman, nearly like giving her as a sacrifice just to save the own life, was no option at all to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo man is left behind.\u201d In your time female soldiers did already exist, and were treated like soldiers. The thought of abandoning anyone in danger was pure dishonor. You would be beaten to death, even when they raped you first, too, before you would even consider it. The trio of ruffians was in position, and the lead-rabid dog had to attack you first. He did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile far from your maximum efficiency, you had restarted your workouts six weeks ago. Real workouts, not just the gym stuff. The brass knuckle came flying towards your face, just that flinching, or cowering, was not your reaction. You blocked the swing while positioning your feet, and retaliated with a brutal thrust kick, sending the criminal stumbling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went too quickly for you then. The three ruffians were standing against you. The expression on their faces changed from wrath to something else, just that precisely in that moment God told you something. And that somebody else told you something, too. It was during this moment, when you realized that God and that other person had told you the same, that you lost conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry.\u201d a female voice had said to you. One instance before you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac Barton was killed that night. Even though a different truth does exist. You are certain of this by now. Whatever you are it is no longer human. The ruffians, much like you, had been like peasants on her chessboard. She sacrificed whatever, and whoever, did not further her goal. And you did understand, why she did this to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause from all the mortals, who I had encountered through the centuries, it was you who convinced me that you would do your very best to be the least of a monster, and not the most of it.\u201d This was her first note to you. An entire library full of lore awaited you. Several houses, bank accounts, apartments, and holdings just as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod had tested you, preparing you for your greatest trial by fire. Being a creature of darkness, and damnation, while keeping your faith, and goodwill, intact! From now on it would be up to you, if such faith in you would be a good idea. <br>\r\n</div></span></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This interactive will be more modern than typical vampire stories and interactive. I know that I am going to step on some feet with this one but in the end if you like it than who really cares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Keep it accurate ------- I don\u2019t want to see things that drastically change a character. For example, you can\u2019t have them be straight one minute and gay the next or kind one moment and ruthless the next, unless that is the character choice you have decided to reveal. There are plenty of ways to subtly change a character but for a straight guy to suddenly make out with another guy, vampirism aside is not ok nor is it ok for a character that has been established as gentle and kind all of a sudden kill his family for their blood. There is plenty of ways to turn the story in that direction if you are willing to take the time and write it. However I am not limiting any of these either. You can make the character whatever you want, as long as it makes sense and is ACCURATE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Keep grammar a priority -------- I know that there are many ways to add to a story and that no one is perfect, especially me. I only ask that you do not add an entry that others will have to decipher in order to read it. Just because you can read \u201ctest language\u201d as fast as a book, doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us can or would like to. Also, do yourself and everyone else a favor and use spell check. And remember that some document programs need 2 spaces between paragraphs to make 1 on the site. Take notice on your first entry to see if you need to put the extra space in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Keep it interesting --------- This is a no tolerance policy for this interactive. You must keep ALL additions to be at least a paragraph long (Minimum 3 sentences). Absolutely NO one word or line entries. I don\u2019t really care if you have to write out of your but to make up the extra lines but you must fill at least 3. Even if it is a choice based chapter. Entries like \u201cmale of female?\u201d or \u201cwhat about these?\u201d or \u201cmore choices\u201d these are not acceptable and will be deleted regardless of what comes after it. Just fill it with something, anything, Quote a poem if you have to just don\u2019t add those small entries that are only good for taking up space and giving more choices. I like reading your stuff not being bogged down with more choices than content. Also, it goes without saying, but sudden stops will also be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Keep your pants on or off ---------- I will allow ANYTHING as far as content is concerned. However you have to keep it realistic and obeying rule 2. Suddenly having the main character have 15 chapters of sex, drugs, and rock\u2019n roll is not cool. Also, I like certain things as much as the next person but suddenly having a blood sucking vampire swallow someone whole is not ok. You can gradually have him/her gain that ability then use it but not a sudden change that is obviously conflicting to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Keep it polite ------ I don\u2019t care who you think you are and if you think you are the best thing since sliced bread. If you aren\u2019t going to take a risk and write for yourself then don\u2019t just rip on someone else\u2019s hard work. I will defend those that write and add properly and I am very lenient with my rules when people ask. But ripping on someone for a difference in opinion, style, religion, race, fetish choice, \u2026 is not cool and I won\u2019t even bother listening to such a close minded idiot. If on the other hand you have some helpful advice or compliments for someone I will gladly write you back or pass your compliments along, anonymously if desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that thanks and have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
