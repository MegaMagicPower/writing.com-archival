            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link couldn't believe how bad it became; how outclassed he was. He'd collected 23 masks but they all seemed useless against just this one. While he fared well enough against Majora's Mask, when it transformed into a lanky humanoid cyclops, things got bad. It moved too fast, attacked relentlessly, and Link could barely keep up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was forced to don the Goron's mask and chase it down. The fight was erratic and Link was constantly bouncing off walls. But eventually he defeated this new form. But it only got worse from there. The monster's arms and legs bulged in mass. Its face became more demonic and menacing. And from the tips of its hands, two long whip-like tentacles grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's new form was much stronger and more direct. Link couldn't even  get close to it to attack, without either getting kicked away or ensnared with the whip, and flung across the room. The crack of each whip was a stinging lash. They left sore, red bruises, and some were powerful enough to draw blood. Link could only stop its assault by stunning it with a light arrow. But by the time Link had sprinted close enough to attack, Majora had already recovered. It leaped across the chamber, laughing at Link as it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was tired, and fatigued...He couldn't even catch this thing. And what's worse, using the Goron form to fight Majora's previous shape, had drained most of his magic. He didn't have enough for anymore light arrows. He realized he had to change strategies. The Bunnyhood managed to speed him up to where he could get close enough, but Majora still jumped away. And worse, when it landed this time, it cracked a whip on the top of Link's head, snapping the bunnyhood in half, and whipping the pieces from his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink decided to try a stealthy approach. He donned the Stonesmask. Knowing that it made him invisible to other enemies, he'd hoped Majora didn't see him. The monster stood up straight and turned its head from side to side trying to see where Link went. It was working! He slowly crept toward the monster. Majora turned around to examine the room behind it. This was his chance. He crept up behind it, hoping to stab it or slash its legs clean off.<br>\r\nMajora suddenly turned and backhanded Link away, knocking him to the ground. Stunned from the attack, Link couldn't flee before Majora suddenly stopped a foot on his tiny body, pinning him to the floor. With another crack of the whip, the Stonesmask flew off, and Link returned to visible view. Majora then lifted its foot and kicked him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora then spotted the bag where Link kept all of his equipment, including his masks. It cracked the whip at him, and knocked the bag away. Link was in trouble now. He didn't have any of his weapons and had lost most of his masks. He only had three left; the transformation masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to use one, when suddenly, Majora tensed up. It began swaying while holding it's head; like it was dizzy or something. Suddenly the dark purple and red skin began to crack like an eggshell. A bright light shined between the cracks and it looked like Majora was falling apart. Had Link's light arrow somehow had a delayed reaction? Had he defeated it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was unfortunately a short-lived belief, as suddenly the monster's body exploded, revealing it to be only an outer-shell. A smaller being that was inside, was now revealed, standing in the middle of the bitch black smoke. Link began to ponder that somehow, Majora's other forms were somehow cocoons. And if it had now broken free, then this was to be the main attraction...And what an attraction it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Majora was a Woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink blinked his eyes to make sure he was seeing it right. It didn't seem real or even possible. But there she was; standing in the almost living darkness of black smoke was a woman. And worse; she didn't look injured at all from their battle. It was like transforming had healed her. Link took a moment to notice her; she was unlike any of the monsters he'd faced yet. Her skin was a lavender color, whereas her hair was a dark purple. Her lips were painted a matching purple color, with eye-shadow to match. Her face had red and green markings, that were reminiscent of the mask...And her eyes were a piercing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke around her suddenly drew inward and began to cling to her body. Amazed, Link saw that the smoke was now becoming clothes, modestly hiding her form. She wore a long flowing purple dress skirt that rose only up over her hips. Her midriff remained exposed. Her chest was soon covered in an armored breast-plate that resembled the mask itself, complete with two glowing orange eyes over her bosom. The pads on her shoulders were covered in spikes.<br>\r\nThe smoke began to braid parts of her hair, and pull it back. And finally the smoke finished by forming a spiky tiara on her head, almost like a crown. The spikes wrapped around her face near her long Hylian ears. And the final touch was a thin band that wrapped around her forehead, with a yellow gem in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly raised her head and stared at Link. There was something odd about her gaze. She was beautiful and threatening at the same time. She slowly began to examine herself. \"How fortuitous this is,\" she spoke to him. \"I must admit I was worried when the life force I drained from the Imp wasn't enough to fully revive me. But the remains of my fallen servants had just enough left in them for me to take. Thank you for bringing them back to me. The life energy I stole from you was also helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink glared and gritted his teeth at her. He was in no mood to be told how much he'd helped this creature.<br>\r\n\"Link,\" Tatl whispered. \"This new form is definitely more dangerous; you have to keep your focus. Try stunning her and then attack before she can recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink immediately donned the Zora's Mask, taking the form of Mikau. He immediately threw his boomerang fins and sprinted toward Majora. The two fins began to fly at her from the sides while Link charged her from the front...Majora was moving faster than all three of them. She immediately grew a tentacle whip from one of her arms. Twirling it in the air, she swatted the boomerangs away. Link jumped into the air, preparing to flip-kick her. She cracked her whip forward, wrapping around his leg, yanking back on it, pulling Link out of his jump. She then twirled it around and slammed him onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Link could recover, she snapped her whip at his face. The stinging impact somehow whipped the Zora's mask from him reverting him back to his Hylian form. Link went down, face stinging from the attack. The Zora's mask had failed, and was now out of reach. Majora slowly began to approach. She was smiling. Part of him felt like she was enjoying this; like she was merely playing with him.<br>\r\nHe got back up and donned the Goron's Mask, taking the form of Darmani. He charged her and threw a flaming fist at her face. But she raised one of her petite hands to stop it. Link couldn't believe how strong she was. But before he could attack again, she pulled him forward and punched him in the stomach, knocking him away. She approached. As he began to sit up, he was greeted with her reaching toward his face. With a painful wrench, she pulled the Goron's mask off of him, reverting him back to normal. She then tossed it aside and took a few steps back, waiting for Link to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, you can't take much more of this,\" Tatl whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there isn't much I can do,\" he retorted under his breath. \"It's not like I can run away; plus we're working against the clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know; but we need to formulate a plan,\" Tatl said. \"Those floral patterns on the floor; they act as Deku flowers. If you take your Deku form, you can hide in one, where she won't be able to touch you. You can recover your strength, and we'll figure out a plan down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink liked the idea, and readied himself. He quickly rolled toward the nearest flower and donned the Deku Mask. He immediately burrowed into the flower, and quietly sat underground, trying to catch his breath. Majora however wasn't deterred by this action. She merely stood over the flower. The aforementioned tentacle slithered like a snake into the hole. Since it was so dark inside, Link didn't know what hit him until it was too late. The tentacle wrapped around him and ripped him out of the ground like a weed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora raised Link up to her face. The tentacle constricted even tighter, squeezing Link until his face turned red and his eyes teared up. Finally the Deku Mask seemed to pop off of his face. It dropped to the ground and Majora kicked it away. She loosened her grip on Link for only a moment, allowing him to catch his breath. He tried raising his sword to attack her. But she tossed him away.<br>\r\n\"Naughty Boys,\" Majora began to say. A second whip grew from her other arm. \"Need to be punished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly began whipping Link with both whips; mercilessly and swiftly snapping them up and down over his body. Each crack of her whips was a painful sting that beat his body. When she was finally finished, Link didn't have the strength in his arm to even hold his sword anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to Link slowly and stood over him. Her tentacles wrapped around him and lifted him off the ground. She used her hand to turn his head to face her. \"You were the last thing to stand in my way,\" she said. \"You gave all those people down there a hope that you could not possibly live up to. There is no way you could stop me, boy. The moon is going to break those giants any moment now...And as amusing as a whipping-boy you've made so far...I believe our little game is at an end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...I know when I'm beat,\" Link said. \"Just make it quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I won't do that,\" Majora said. \"It's no fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...what are you going to do?\" Link asked, now a little afraid of even more pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you before that I shall consume everything,\" Majora told him. \"...It seems fitting I should start with you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It's been centuries since I've been in my true form,\" Majora said. \"I'm starving...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt very nervous when she told him that, while staring at him with her penetrating red eyes. Then he heard the sickening growl of her stomach; the sound made him go white. As if on cue, a new sound came in the form of a fierce rumbling that shook the chamber. Link realized that the Giants' strength had failed, and the moon was close to impact.<br>\r\nBut that hardly worried Link as much as the prospect of what Majora just told him, and what her growling stomach implied. Link was to be her next meal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora's tentacles now began to wrap completely around Link, pinning his arms to his side and coiling all the way to his legs. Link now felt like a helpless mouse, trapped in a snake's coils. Majora slowly reached up to his head and pulled his green hat off his head. His yellow hair bounced slightly with it's new freedom. Majora looked at him oddly, as if admiring him - or examining him the way a predator would look over its prey. \"...Such a handsome face,\" she said. She suddenly moved him closer, turned to one of his cheeks and began to drag her tongue along it. She licked him! She quickly pulled it back in and smacked her lips. \"And tasty too. You'll make a fine snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if to confirm his beliefs, he saw a the sickening display of Majora slowly open her mouth. He heard bones cracking as he watched her lower jaw expand. Her mouth was unhinging and becoming wider, much like a snake's. Soon it was without a doubt wide enough to fit his head in. He could look inside of her fleshy purple mouth, to the pulsing black chasm of her throat. And that is when it all became real; she was going to eat him, alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fearful tension was broken when her tentacles began to lift and tilt him. Link soon found himself hanging upside-down, his legs in the air, and his head pointed downward. His face was just beyond her mouth now. As much as he would like to, he couldn't bring himself to look away. It was like her throat had hypnotized him into some kind of trance. And then without warning, Link felt the tentacles move him, and the purple flesh inside her mouth came closer. Link felt his chin slide over her white teeth. Link hoped that once she reached his neck she'd just bite his head clean off - end it quickly. Saliva began to drop onto his face. It was disgusting. Suddenly her tongue lifted up and licked the front of his face, tasting him again. And judging from the pleasant \"Mmm\" sound, she couldn't get enough of Link's flavor. And when Link's face finally touched the back of her throat, he began to realize the terrible truth; she was swallowing him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink finally snapped out of his trance. He was prepared for any sort of death as long as he'd died fighting. But the prospect of being swallowed alive was a truly awful death. He wasn't willing to go out like this. He began to thrash and struggle about, but the tentacles were too much for him. But even worse, he felt her hands come up to his arms and slowly guide his shoulders toward her mouth. Link felt absolutely powerless now. He kept trying to thrash and kick but it did him no good. He felt the muscles of her throat grip his face and with a horrid gulping sound, Majora swallowed. Link was yanked downward and his head began to descend into her throat.<br>\r\nMajora's neck began to bulge out with Link's head filling it. Majora had now stretched out her lips and cheeks to stretch out over Link's shoulders. She was beginning to make her way down his torso. Tatl meanwhile had been watching from the sides. This was awful. Link had become her friend and he was her partner; he'd helped reunite her with her brother. They had been through so much together already; she couldn't let it end like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe charged in, ringing her bell. She stormed up to Majora, glowing red. She began slamming herself into Majora's face, much as she had to Link when they first met. She was so desperate to save Link from this horrible fate, she gave all her strength. Majora winced at the attack. But she simply raised an arm and swatted the tiny fairy away. Tatl was thrown across the chamber and she crashed against the wall. The wind was knocked out of her, and she fell unconscious; the last thing she saw, was Link's chest disappear into Majora's mouth, bulging out her throat even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom deep in her esophagus, Link could just faintly make out the sound of Tatl's bell ringing, through Majora's pulsing body. But it was soon silenced, and what followed was another gulp from Majora. Link slipped down even further. From the slippery soaking feeling coming from his tunic, he could tell that Majora now had him up to his waist. Link suddenly felt a relief come from his waist when Majora unbuckled his belt and scabbard. She tossed them away. Then she reached up to his green tunic and completely tore it off. So far all of Link's body that she'd consumed was bare and she happily lapped over his taught belly. Link couldn't help it, but it tickled him so much, that he gave a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink suddenly felt his head rub against something squishy, but firm. It began to give and he began to slide into it. It must've been the sphincter that blocked off the esophagus to the...the...<br>\r\nAnd Link suddenly realized the spacious chamber his head had slipped into was Majora's stomach! At the bottom of the chamber was a glowing blue light. Link didn't think he was lucky enough to be headed for an exit. He came to the conclusion that Majora's stomach acid glowed blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora tore Link's under-cloth off of him; with the exception of his boots, Link was completely naked. She grabbed his thighs and forced another bountiful bit of Link into her mouth, swallowing as she did. She was up to Link's groin. She lightly placed a hand on one of his soft butt-cheeks and began to push it into her waiting maw. His prepubescent manhood rolled over her tongue. She couldn't resist it; she raised her tongue and dragged it over Link's crotch, teasing him. Link felt the sensation stir in his most private parts; a feeling he'd never felt before. And Majora particularly enjoyed the unique flavor these bits added to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eye downward and saw her belly was beginning to round and bulge out, with the tiny hero filling it. She realized that it would soon be time to end this. She reached up as far as she could; grabbing Link's ankle, she pulled him in more. Her mouth went over his buttocks; she bit down on it, playfully before it slipped back. Down in her stomach, Link's hair finally touched the pool of acid. His head dipped into it for a minute before hitting the bottom. It was so slippery that Link's head began to slide backward. Soon his head resurfaced. He was laying back against the sloping round wall of the fleshy organ, while his chest and torso remained submerged. Due to the glow, Link could see his lower half still passing through the sphincter into the stomach. He was so tired that he couldn't fight anymore. His arms had been freed ever since she swallowed them, but they'd been held so tightly by the tentacles, that they went numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora was up to Link's calves. She was finally able to reach up far enough to pull off Link's boots. Her meal was now completely nude. She grinned seeing what little resistance Link gave; he had completely surrendered to her will now. He was hers. She swallowed up to his knees. It was at this point that she was licking every bit that she could, lathering her saliva all over his body. Link tasted incredible; he had to have been the BEST meal she'd ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few more gulps, only Link's feet remained outside of her mouth; this allowed her face to return to its more slip design. Seeing his feet, she smiled deviously; this was always one of her most favorite parts to eat. Usually her prey were so ticklish that when she ran her tongue over their feet, they would burst out laughing. Majora often enjoyed eating her prey feet-first, to see their faces turn red and listen to them hysterically beg her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her hands and simply swallowed from here on. When Link's feet finally began to pass into her mouth, she ran her tongue along his soles. The sensation caused Link to tremble, and she could hear something from inside her belly. She smiled contently at her last bit of fun she could have with him, before ending his existence. Soon his toes passed under her lips and she closed her mouth; Link had completely vanished from the world. With her final gulp, Link's fate was sealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt his feet traveling down her esophagus. The bulge they'd made in her neck was slowly fading as they traveled down. Before long, Link's feet dropped into the chamber with a pop, and splashed into the water. Link was incredibly how stretchy this chamber was. It was barely big enough to contain his head when he arrived, and now it held his entire body. Not to say it was roomy; he had to curl into the fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt so defeated; so alone. He had just been eaten alive by the monster he'd fought so hard to defeat. He was nothing more than breakfast to her. And now he was just so incredibly tired. The fleshy sack that he was trapped in was so warm and cozy, it was almost inviting. Link didn't have anything left; no more fight. He just wanted to lay his head back and fall asleep. Maybe it would be less painful that way...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link was startled as Majora raised her skirt and began to part it down the center. What was she doing? She wanted him inside her...was she going to rape him? Link struggled and fought to resist. But he was helpless against her tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Majora's dress parted to reveal her lavender lace undergarments. She pulled the waistband and lowered them to her thighs. Pulling them down below her knees, she began to step out of them. She dropped them to the ground. Her nethers were exposed and bare, and amazingly clean shaven. \"Now to get you ready,\" Majora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning to do with me, Demon?\" Link asked, thrashing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora lifted up her hand and began to trace his face with her fingers, moving his golden hair away from his forehead. \"You really are a cute-one,\" she said. \"Such a handsome and strong specimen of mortal. You have entertained me so much...I've decided to keep you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Link asked struggling even further. \"Are you going to make me your pet or something?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been so entertaining,\" Majora said. \"I'd hate to loose such an entertaining little friend to play with. But...I'd say that pet is a bit degrading compared to what I plan to do...\" The devious and almost sadistic look on her face melted away. She now looked at Link in a somewhat kind and caring way. Frankly it disturbed him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Majora's tentacles began removing Link's clothes. He fought against them, but he was still sore and weak from the fight. Now he hung from her powerful grip, naked. Majora looked at all of the bruises and cuts across his body. She suddenly looked concerned. She brought Link closer to her and began to inspect him. Her face was so close to a bruise on his shoulder. \"Oh dear,\" she said. \"I really have done quite the number on you. Well don't worry cutie; soon it will feel all better.\" Majora then suddenly kissed Link's bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she getting at? Why was she suddenly acting...maternal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the tentacles lowered Link and began to turn his body at an angle. At the same time, Majora leaned back and spread her legs. Now Link's head was pointed directly at Majora's sex. Link looked up at it, seeing the deep purple lips of her labia were swollen and wet from arousal. Link was suddenly alarmed as Majora's tentacles guided his face toward them. His face was pressed into them, and Link was shocked to find that half of his face now slipped into the small vulva.<br>\r\n\"Hey! What are you-\" Link yelled. But his voice was cut off when Majora pressed more of him inside of her sex. Link felt the lips of her sex clamp around his neck. His entire head was inside of her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Link felt the muscles all around his face pull him upward, almost like a swallow. He couldn't believe it. Somehow her pussy was eating him! Before long, his face brushed against another barrier; it was her cervix. The passageway immediately opened up and accepted Link, taking him into a much larger and roomy chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajorah gently guided Link's shoulders up to her lips, and as she anticipated, they grew up over his chest and consumed him. She smiled and began taking deep breaths. Her cheeks were blushing deep red. Ever since she'd regained her true form, looking at this boy had stirred up so many feelings. Messing with him over the course of his journey, trying to stifle him at every turn was fun. But he was so stubborn and persevered so much...it was adorable. How could she resist unbirthing him? And not only was he cute, but he was also strong. As her own child, she could mold him into something great and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent her knees as Link's weight added to her own. It was getting tricky to keep balance. She felt the muscles of her sex take over and move Link in up to his waist. She removed her hands from him, letting her body do its work in consuming the boy. She felt his head and upper torso enter her womb. His hair began to rub against the roof and Link began to slide backward. He tried to struggle against her, but her tentacles kept his legs bound, and her birth canal wrapped around the rest of his body like a vice. It was very dark in here, and it was filled with some strange liquid. Link had to hold his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was now up to his knees inside of Majora. His thighs just poured into her womb. Now Link had to curl his body into a fetal position in order to fit completely inside of her. Soon Majora had taken Link up to his ankles. Her tentacles had long-since released him. Now they did one last action, tickling the bottom of Link's feet before they disappeared inside Majora. The tickling sent vibrations across Link's body as he struggled against the feeling. It caused Majora's lower body up to her belly to shake. She giggled feeling this, pleasurable sensation. Link's toes wiggled as he tried his hardest to press against the walls, to stop himself from going deeper inside of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was futile as Majora's body completely sucked him inside of her uterus. Link's legs completely filled into her womb. He couldn't breathe and was dangerously close to passing out. However he suddenly felt a strong jerk to his midsection. He looked down and saw a fleshy umbilical chord had attached to him, connecting him to Majora. Link suddenly felt better, as Oxygen and Nutrition from Majora's body poured into him. He was still incredibly tired from this whole ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly began to hear a steady beating up above him. He soon realized it was Majora's heartbeat. It was so steady and so calming. It was like it was hypnotizing him, lulling him to sleep. He suddenly noticed how warm the inside of her body was, as was the umbilical chord. It was like it was filling him with warmth. He didn't know what this monster was doing, but the thought and worry was soon missing from his mind. It was like his thoughts were becoming cloudy. All he could think about was Majora. The thought of her strangely began to comfort him. He tried thinking, desperate to remember something else. But she encompassed all his thoughts. And soon it all began to go dark and calm. Link soon fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora's knees buckled. She tried with her strength to stay on her feet. The twelve year old boy was heavier than she thought. She took deep breaths and looked down at herself. Her once petite midriff now bulged out from her body like an enormous ball. She still blushed. It had been so long since she'd unbirthed someone. She mostly did it for fun. But Link was different. She was certain that his will would be broken soon enough, as the process was now clouding his mind with confusing emotions for her. She was hoping to keep him around for a long time...She was certain he'd be a good son.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Majora's legs finally gave out on her and she sat in the center of the chamber. She tried to do so as gently as she could as to not disturb her precious cargo. She was already thinking of her latest victim as precious to her. The bond was forming already. She gently began to rub her engorged belly and felt Link shift and shuffle around. She guessed that he enjoyed the sensation. She began to lightly giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Majora hadn't noticed for a while now was that Tatl was still present here in the chamber. The tiny yellow fairy was still inside of the flower that Link had tried to hide in. She peered over the entrance to the flower and watched as her friend and partner disappeared inside of the Demoness' snatch. She couldn't believe what she'd seen as she stared wide-eyed at Majora's belly. What did it mean? Did she somehow eat him? Was Link still alive in there? Should she try to rescue him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know exactly how though? She was so shocked by what she'd seen she was frozen where she was. And she wasn't exactly strong or large enough to pull Link out of there. What was she going to do? She looked around the chamber trying to find a way out. But the room was completely sealed. Besides it wasn't like she could go to anyone for help. In moments, everyone in Termina would be dead. What was she going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there frustrated, trying to think of something to do, she accidentally nudged her bell, and it gave a little ring. Majora's head perked up, and Tatl froze where she sat. Majora turned toward the flower and spotted Tatl's yellow glow, despite the Fairy's best efforts to conceal herself. Majora's sadistic and playful smile returned.<br>\r\n\"I know you're there,\" she said. \"Come on out and show yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that demand terrified Tatl so much that, without thinking, she immediately tried to flee. She shot from the flower and tried to fly away. Hopefully she'd find some way out, or maybe since Majora was now weighted down with her latest meal, she wouldn't be able to catch her. But Tatl was mistaken.<br>\r\nA tentacle-whip grew from the tip of Majora's index finger. She immediately snapped her whip toward Tatl. Immediately the whip wrapped around Tatl's tiny body, pinning her small arms to her sides and uncomfortably pinning her wings. Tatl's eyes went wide when she realized Majora had her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of the tentacle began to coil back down the length, wrapping Tatl up as she was brought to Majora. The tiny fairy was completely helpless as Majora's fingers gripped around her. Tatl trembled being caught in Majora's grasp like this.<br>\r\n\"Well-well...what have we here?\" as Majora brought the tiny fairy up to her face and stared down at her with her piercing red eyes. \"The little fairy companion of my new plaything?\" Majora asked. \"Well, maybe you can entertain me as much as he did.\" Suddenly Tatl felt Majora raise her arm off to her side and snapped her hand downward. Suddenly Tatl found herself falling from Majora's hand, the tentacle around her unraveling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl screamed as Majora dropped her and she was forced to spin downward with the unraveling. Suddenly Tatl stopped while she was still a foot above the ground. She was suspended there in the air. The tentacle was still gripping onto Tatl's midsection. Tatl now had a headache as all of the spinning had disoriented her. Suddenly Majora flicked her wrist upward. And suddenly Tatl began to rise up, once again be wrapped up in the tentacle and soon returned to Majora's hand. Tatl couldn't believe it; Majora was using her as a yo-yo! And the process was repeated several times. And now Tatl was crying with each scream, she was desperate for it to stop. Only her crying was now drowned out by Majora's laughter. She was beginning to think this fairy would make a great toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she soon decided to have mercy on the tiny girl once Tatl began begging for relief. So now Majora held her to her face again. \"Aw, what's wrong little girl? Didn't you have fun?\" Majora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster!\" Tatl yelled. \"How could you do all of this?! We aren't toys for you to play with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're funny, little fairy,\" Majora said. \"Lecturing a Goddess such as me. I have the power to do anything I want, to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you use a moon to wipe out everyone on the planet...and you eat my best friend?\" Tatl yelled. \"WHY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora raised an eyebrow. She then smiled and closed her eyes. \"Silly girl,\" Majora said. \"I didn't <i>eat</i> your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the gigantic bulge in your belly would disagree,\" Tatl spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish little fairy,\" Majora said. \"Your friend is in no danger...in fact, he is perfectly safe inside of my body; the safest place he can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How? What did you do to him?\" Tatl demanded. \"Tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hero friend is one of the rare people who amused me and impressed me. Enemy or not, I would hate to loose him. So I simply began the process to make him an ally,\" Majora said. \"Understand yet, little Fairy? I Unbirthed him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Tatl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend is inside my womb right now,\" Majora said rubbing her belly with her other hand. \"I have chosen to make him my baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl's eyes widened. What she was told was so disturbing. \"That's...disgusting,\" Tatl said. \"You're crazy! Link would never see you as his mother. He will never stop fighting you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora sneered at Tatl; the tiny fairy's insults regarding her precious new child were beginning to upset her. Tatl was soon beginning to loose whatever entertainment factor she had, and her patience for the tiny fairy was waning. \"You know nothing,\" Majora said. \"When your friend returns to the world, he will not be as you remember him. He will be mine, and I will raise him as my son.\" Tatl was about to deny it again, but Majora interrupted her. \"I feel like my toying with you is at an end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl's eyes widened and she became fearful yet again. She knew now Majora would try to get rid of her. \"Now...what should I do with you, little Fairy?\" Majora asked looking at her. She suddenly lifted Tatl above her head and leaned her face back. \"Perhaps I should eat <i>you</i> to feed my new baby.\" Majora opened her mouth, and began wiggling her purple tongue at Tatl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny fairy struggled and screamed in Majora's grip at that prospect. \"Wait - wait, please! Please don't eat me!\" Tatl shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Majora asked. \"And why shouldn't I?\" Tatl tried desperately to give an answer, but suddenly Majora spoke again. \"I suppose I could be persuaded to spare you...If you had something of value to offer me. So tell me Fairy...what do you have to offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...\" Tatl began to say. \"Well...you said that you like to play with people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhm?\" Majora agreed, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you eat me; that's it,\" Tatl said. \"Sure you get to toy with me while doing it...but you only get to do it once. If you keep me around, you can play with me just as much you can Link...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...well,\" Majora said. \"An enticing offer...I suppose I can keep you as my servant. Or I could find some other function for you. Hmm...what to do? Decisions...decisions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Majora decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright little one,\" Majora said as she lowered Tatl away from her face. She held her out over her pregnant belly and opened her palm. Tatl was still bound in the tentacle to keep her from escaping. Majora looked down at her with a dominant gaze. \"I'll make you a deal...From this moment on, you will be my Servant. You will be with me always, unless I send you away. You will do everything I command of you without question...And if you do not follow these tasks, or do anything that displeases me...Well, you won't have to worry about me eating you...Instead, I will torture you for the rest of time; your punishment will be everlasting and your pain will be never-ending. Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl was shaking. She seemed so meek in her new Mistress' presence. She didn't know what to say, but she was certain that Majora was waiting for an answer. \"So...from this moment on...I'm your slave?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you'd rather be swallowed,\" Majora said licking her lips and beginning to curl her fingers around Tatl again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO-No!\" Tatl suddenly shouted. Majora's fingers backed off for a bit. \"I accept,\" Tatl said breathing heavily. \"I'm yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm Good,\" Majora said. \"Rather be my slave than my meal...I love it. But first, to make it official, you will have to pledge yourself to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How?\" Tatl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you will bow down before me, placing your hands and face to the ground,\" Majora instructed. \"Then you will solemnly pledge yourself to me by saying, 'Lady Majora, I pledge my service to you. From this moment on, you are my Mistress and I am your Slave, willing and obedient, loyal and humble, for the rest of time. I will put you first before all selfish ambition and desire you before all desires. From this day I swear.' Then you will rise and kiss my feet...on the toes.\"<br>\r\nMajora barely gave Tatl any time to absorb that information before she lifted her palm out in front of her body and overturned it. Tatl was gently lowered to the floor by the tentacle, and it slowly began to release her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl now stood in the shadow of Majora's engorged pregnant belly. She could see Majora's piercing eyes just barely above the horizon of the lavender globe. \"I...\" Tatl began to say. She lowered her eyes trying to remember the words. When she lowered them she suddenly spotted Majora's enormous sex. The lips were still swollen and aroused and Majora sat in a pool of her own juices. For the first time in her entire life, the Fairy truly felt small in the presence of this beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Majora suddenly asked leaning forward. Tatl yelped and immediately moved away from Majora's center, toward her right foot. Tatl immediately fell down to her face, sprawling her arms out before her. The horrible words that she had to parrot suddenly came back to her in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Majora, I pledge my service to you. From this moment on, you are my Mistress...and I am your Slave,\" Tatl tried her hardest to resist all her desire to stop and spit at the horrible demon woman. She forced herself to vomit up the rest of her pledge. \"Willing and obedient, loyal and humble, for the rest of time. I will put you first before all selfish ambition and desire you before all desires. From this day I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, very good,\" Majora said. With that, Tatl rose onto her feet and readied for the final act of her pledge. She watched as Majora lifted her leg, raising her petite right foot out of the deep purple heel she was wearing. Majora immediately laid her foot down nearby and wiggled her five gigantic toes. Tatl cringed nervously as she watched them wiggle. She slowly approached the foot. She bent down and kissed the enormous big toe. It was a bit rough and coarse. Tatl made it just a light peck before immediately standing upright. However quickly after, she saw Majora's foot rise up on the heel, putting the toes and the arch of the foot into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the foot sprang upon Tatl and pinned her to the ground, resting on top of her. Majora's toes wriggled, bumping into Tatl's head as it was trapped between the big and second toe. Tatl struggled against them, trying desperately to get fresh air. But the only air she could was the stale air from between her new Master's toes. She then felt Majora press down on Tatl, pressing her into the floor.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Majora moaned contently, clearly pleasured exercising the power she had over her new slave. \"You feel very nice under there. I think you'll make a great toy, slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Tatl opened her mouth, it was filled with the flesh on Majora's toes. It tasted salty and bitter. The taste was awful. But finally Majora stopped wiggling her toes and let Tatl's tiny head rest between them. Tatl took in several deep panting breaths before looking up from her vantage point. \"I am...yours to do with as you please...Master,\" Tatl said, fighting back tears from her utter defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you are,\" Majora said with a content smile. She lifted her foot off of Tatl, freeing her. \"Rise,\" Majora allowed. Tatl did as she was told and slowly stood up, wiping off her tiny yellow dress. \"Come where I can see you,\" Majora said leaning her head back. Tatl began to flap her wings; both were incredibly sore from this past ordeal. They managed to carry her up and she hovered over Majora's enormous Link-filled belly. Majora raised her right hand and suddenly a bottle of lotion magically appeared in her palm. \"Since you've officially sworn your life to me,\" Majora began. \"Your first task will be to rub this oil over my belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Majora,\" Tatl said with a slight blush in her face. Majora squeezed the bottle over the round curves of her pregnant stomach and then sat back, waiting. Tatl immediately began to hover down and pressed her tiny hands into the glob of lotion Majora gave her to work with. Kneeling down on her flesh, she began to move her arms back and forth and her hands in a circular motion to kneed the oil into Majora's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tatl got hard to work rubbing oil into her Master's stomach. She was already becoming tired and sweaty. She was so small, and it was so huge...She didn't know what she was expecting, considering it was currently housing her friend and partner. Link...She hadn't thought about him for a while. She'd been so focused on her own survival. She was hoping he was alright. She paused for a moment to look down at the expansive flesh beneath her. Could Link really be perfectly safe in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work diligently now, Slave,\" Majora suddenly spoke out noticing Tatl had stopped. Tatl immediately flinched and continued rubbing obediently. \"Good Girl...Wouldn't want my baby to burden me with ugly stretch-marks now, would we?\"<br>\r\nTatl continued to do as she was ordered. But as she continued she began to notice that it was becoming harder and harder. She soon noticed that some oil was being absorbed by her dress and was weighing her down. The sticky cloth was now completely ruined. Tatl sighed; it was the only set of clothing she owned. \"Aw that's a shame,\" Majora suddenly said, causing Tatl to look toward her with alarm. \"But fret not; with your new place in life, you'll no longer need clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl immediately blushed and raised one hand up to her chest, trying her best to readjust the front portion to keep herself covered. Majora raised an eyebrow and grinned. \"Oh, bashful are we?\" she asked. \"Well I suppose that I could allow you to keep your garments.\" But then Majora's eyes narrowed and her devious smile returned. \"For now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl said nothing and returned to work. Majora began chuckling darkly as Tatl resumed her duty. It was several more minutes of Tatl working silently and promptly before something else happened. Tatl was startled when the flesh underneath her began to shift and move, pressing up against her from underneath. Majora giggled when it happened and looked down at the scene. \"I think he likes that,\" Majora said. \"Please keep it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Tatl a moment to realize that Majora was talking about Link. She saw how content and pleased Majora was. And talking about him seemed to make her even happier; maybe it was an opportunity to get some more information.<br>\r\n\"So uh, speaking of Link...how is he?\" she asked. \"Is he really alright in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajora opened one of her eyes and cutely asked, \"Hmmm? Link?\" she pondered. It took her a moment, but she finally realized who Tatl was talking about. \"Oh that's his name...Well I suppose he does need one. Not too good with picking names myself, anyway.\" Majora raised both her arms and began to stretch, extending her legs as far out as they could go as well. She sighed contently when she was done. \"Yes...he's fine,\" Majora said. \"He's sleeping right now; he must be dreaming.\" Majora sat up again, leaning as far as she could and finally placed her hands over her belly, causing Tatl to flee. Majora paid her no mind and simply rubbed her skin. Majora began humming a calming tune. Tatl was getting very weirded out seeing Majora like this; she was actually humming a lullaby! \"The longer he stays inside of me, the more the process will take hold,\" Majora said. \"His mind is being reshaped. Soon whatever past he once had will be gone; all of his fears and hopes and cares will be replaced by me. I will be his everything.\" Tatl went white when she heard this news. \"That's right, my precious boy. Soon, Mommy will be the only thing you know,\" Majora began to coo. \"So sleep...and dream away...Safe and sound inside...And when you come out, I will be the only thing that matters to you.\" Majora began to lean back and chuckle darkly and slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it as a cue and seeing Majora close her eyes, Tatl immediately descended back to her place and continued her work, rubbing more oil into Majora's body. Everything that she just heard about what was happening to Link was horrifying. She was actually thinking it would've been less sadistic if she'd just killed him. But instead she was completely ripping his identity from him, and replacing it with whatever she wanted. They had to get away from her! But there wasn't much Tatl could do alone. Only Link stood a chance against her.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Link,\" Tatl whispered quietly, leaning as close to the skin as she could. She was certain the sloshing sounds of her rubbing drowned out her words. \"I'll find a way to get you out of there...I'll think of something. Just try and hang on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link was treated to the most horrifying spectacle he'd ever seen. Majora was sporting what Link originally thought was a third, oddly-deformed leg...Only he soon realized the truth. Dangling between Majora's thighs was an enormous dick! Link's mouth quivered in shock when he saw it. It had to be as thick as a Dodongo's leg. And behind it was an enormous pair of balls, dangling in a wrinkly purple-skinned sack. The way it dangled, coupled with its size, reminded Link of a cow's utters. The seam down the center, highlighting the round form of each individual testicle, reminded him of cleavage. It had only been exposed to him for just a few minutes, and already Link could smell the awful musky scent; the overpowering aroma of pheromones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink didn't know much about girls in his young-state, but he was certain that they weren't supposed to have those. They were meant to be different from boys. How was this possible?<br>\r\n\"H-How?\" Link stammered, trying to form words just to ask a simple question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a primordial, all-powerful, chaotic Goddess,\" Majora answered with a malicious grin. \"I can BE whatever I want. It was worth it just to see the look on your face.\" Link was constantly switching his gaze back and forth between Majora's face, and her enormous genitals. She leaned back a bit, forcing her crotch forward a bit. \"Well...what do you think?\" she asked. Link flinched as she asked that question, breaking him out of his trance. Was she serious? The look on her face seemed so insistent; was she waiting for an answer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...um,\" Link didn't exactly want to say something to make his situation worse. But he couldn't seem to find any words. He looked at how she bit her lower-lip; was she really expecting a compliment or did she revel in messing with him? \"It's...Incredible,\" Link managed to force himself to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, isn't it?\" she asked. Link suddenly saw the enormous shaft twitch and begin to straighten. She was becoming hard. \"It's probably much larger than any you have ever seen. I bet it puts yours to shame...In fact - let's have a look!\"<br>\r\nLink was taken aback when she suggested that. Suddenly he felt the grip the tentacles held on his body change. Suddenly one held his arms by their wrists above his head, as the other tentacle whipped his belt off and began to lift his tunic up over his head. The tunic was soon tossed away from his body, and soon the tentacle was removing his undergarments and slipping them off. Link blushed at being exposed to this monster.<br>\r\n\"Aw...how cute,\" Majora began cooing seeing Link's exposed boy-bits. They weren't much; Link had yet to go through puberty. \"So tiny...Barely comparable my monstrosity here...Still so young though...I bet that in a few years you'd be quite the shower. Too bad you won't be getting to such an age.\" Link tried struggling against her, trying to wiggle his wrists loose. Unfortunately the second tentacle returned to its position, wrapping around his body. The one holding his wrists soon joined it, releasing his arms for a moment, only to pin them to his side. Link was soon distracted when he noticed that Majora's shaft was now raising to jut from her body nearly horizontal. She was becoming more and more aroused, and the monster's length increased the harder it got. \"Almost ready now,\" Majora smiled looking down at her shaft. \"And what do you think of my balls, hmm?\" she suddenly asked looking up at him. She reached a hand underneath the sack to lift it up slightly. \"The twins are nice, yes? Very big? They'll make a nice home for you, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught Link's attention with that one. She had been showing off her male genitalia so much that he'd completely forgotten that Majora had started this after the declaration that she wanted Link inside of her. \"Wait a minute...you can't be serious,\" Link suddenly began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that it's one of my favorite ways to eat someone,\" Majora said. \"Watching them helplessly disappear into my cock, and slip struggling into my balls. It's quite fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! Please not that,\" Link said struggling harder. He never imagined that this would be how he died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be scared,\" Majora tried to coo him with a calming voice. \"You should be honored to receive this fate.\" Majora lowered her eyes down Link's body. \"Besides...judging by the looks of things...you seem rather excited about this idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink didn't know what she meant, but over the past few minutes, he did feel a strange stirring in his loins. Something that he hadn't felt since being in his adult form...Or that time Cremia hugged him. Link saw his eyes roll down and noticed that his own penis was becoming aroused.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I was wrong,\" Majora said. \"You are a grower.\"<br>\r\nWhat was the meaning of this? Was Link actually aroused by the thought of sliding into this monster goddesses' cock? He couldn't be; he was terrified of the thought. Made even more so considering that it wasn't even fully erect and it was already longer than he was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was soon short lived, as Majora now staggered backward, spreading her legs in order to stay standing. Her dick was now fully erect and pointed toward the ceiling of the chamber. The deep purple head of the phallus rose above her own head, and the shaft was now riddled with veins. The already enormous sack had swelled as did the testicles inside it; they now dangled beneath her knees. \"It's finally ready,\" Majora said marveling at it. \"It's been so long since I've been at full-mast. I'm going to enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink struggled greatly against her, knowing now that his time was up and his nightmare was about to begin. Seeing him struggle, Majora grinned and raised an eyebrow. She covered her mouth and she gave a light chuckle. She decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peering toward the twin silhouettes of Outset Island, Aryll saw two glowing orange orbs- the setting sun between the massive black plateaus, and the shimmering congregation of paper lanterns hung in front of her house. She lied against the King of Red Lions\u2019 curved neck and looked on. Rolling wind wafted the scent of saltwater into her nose, followed by the fiery smell of charcoal swept from Outset\u2019s beach. Aryll took a deep breath and turned toward the stern and saw her brother, Link. He was clad in his blue crawfish shirt and orange pants, happy to get a break from adventuring. She wore her usual cyan, flower-speckled dress. Bar the celebration and boat ride, it was a day like any other for the two siblings. Link smiled, gripping the rudder and steering the boat toward the island, toward the celebration. The wind caught the King of Red Lions\u2019 sails and thrust the craft through the calm sea water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Aryll whined, \u201cbig brother, can\u2019t we stay out a little longer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sighed. \u201cCome on, Aryll! We\u2019ve been out for half an hour, and I still haven\u2019t eaten!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. \u201c\u2026I know, I know. Sorry, big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tilted his head to the side, offering that warm, reassuring smile that Aryll loved. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s go and get some food, right sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hm,\u201d Aryll nodded, her stomach groaning in agreement. She forced a smile, but the truth was that she couldn\u2019t feel anything but anxiety. Having vanquished the King of Darkness and rescued Tetra, Link\u2019s plans were set on joining the pirates for continued adventures in the uncharted seas. Aryll was not afraid for her brother\u2019s safety; she knew he could handle himself. She had admired his strength since her earliest memories of him. Even though he could be lazy, Link was always there for her. Even an army of monsters didn\u2019t stop him from rescuing her. He was so tough, and brave, and affectionate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And when the sun rose tomorrow, he\u2019d be gone forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King of Red Lions\u2019 sail retracted as it reached the dock. Link held his sister\u2019s hand and helped her off the boat. Aryll loved how considerate he was, even though she was fully capable of disembarking herself. The siblings walked back toward their house and sat down at the picnic table and dug into the spread of ham and vegetables. Link was sure to pass his sister the spices and sauces, just like when they were little kids. Aryll licked her lips as they zesty flavor exploded over her tongue. She reached out in all directions, grabbing chunks of food and stuffing her face. Each meaty gulp produced a subtle lump in her throat before settling in her stomach. The pirates watched her in fascination. Niko in particular was stunned; \u201cI can\u2019t believe such a little girl can pack away such a big meal!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Tetra was impressed. \u201cWow, Niko. Last time I heard anyone say that was the first time you went to Windfall Caf\u00e9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA storm of hearty laughter, from islanders and pirates alike, roared into the warm night at the diminutive pirate\u2019s expense. Aryll leaned into Link and giggled. Her brother chuckled too, running his fingers through her hair. She loved him so much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And tomorrow, he\u2019d be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, the full moon hung high and the whole island had fallen asleep. Everyone, from the townspeople to the pirates, was snoring away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor old times\u2019 sake, Link had chosen to sleep in the house he had grown up in. He, Aryll, and their grandmother were sitting in the candlelit kitchen by the stewpot. They dined on grandma\u2019s soup as Link told stories about his adventures. Or, to be more accurate, Link and grandma had taken a couple sips as Aryll greedily slurped her third bowl. \u201cDon\u2019t have too much, dear,\u201d grandma warned, \u201cyou don\u2019t wanna wake up in the middle of the night for some emergency relief!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll blushed profusely. \u201cG-grandma! You\u2019re embarrassing me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink laughed. \u201cHey, we\u2019re the only ones here, Aryll! But grandma\u2019s right\u2026 You sure did eat a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so,\u201d Aryll said, lifting up her skirt and poking her potbelly, feeling the digested slop slosh about within. \u201cI dunno, I felt like I could eat an octorok!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, maybe you should go to an eating contest on Windfall. I hear those rich folks give out crazy\u2026 prizes\u2026\u201d Link reached toward the ceiling and yawned. \u201c\u2026Man, I\u2019m ready to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma followed suit with an exasperated yawn. \u201cYes, I\u2019m feeling rather exhausted myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and grandma rose from the table, heading to their respective bedrooms. Aryll sat still and watched her brother and grandmother shamble off to bed. \u201cG\u2019night Aryll, g\u2019night grandma. That was a fun party...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma hummed in agreement as she shut her bedroom door. Link waved to Aryll as he, too, reached his sleeping quarters. She was left alone in the dim candlelight. Only her thoughts kept her company now. Those thoughts drifted to her brother, naturally. She had so much fun. She didn\u2019t want the day to end, but it was already over. She was still full of energy\u2026 And hunger, strangely enough. When Aryll said she could eat an octorok, she wasn\u2019t kidding. She could have easily drank the whole stewpot, but she simply didn\u2019t feel like it. Aryll wanted something more filling. And at the exact same time, she wanted her brother to stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-skirted girl never thought those two desires could ever correlate, yet here she sat, wanting two things: to fill her belly and to keep Link forever. To combine them was impossible, though. She knew there was no way she could fit Link into her stomach, no matter how hungry she was. But she did know one of Gonzo\u2019s legendarily strange pirate stories. One that centered on an island of warrior women who could eat men whole\u2026 Wait, was that really one of Gonzo\u2019s stories? And was Aryll really standing, waddling over toward Link\u2019s room\u2026? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to at least one of those questions was \u201cYes.\u201d Aryll clutched the doorknob, slowly opening the door and peering inside. The shaft of faint light cast from the doorway revealed Link, in his white nightshirt and pants, splayed out on the messy bedsheets. He was already deep in slumber, his unkempt blonde hair wildly spread over his pillow. He snored lightly. Aryll looked to the front of the bed and saw his bare feet dangling off the edge. Those wrinkled soles, those curling toes\u2026 She couldn\u2019t deny it any longer. Aryll\u2019s tongue ran over her lips. Her brother looked delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut could she really bring herself to devour him?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The urges in Aryll\u2019s mind became one with the gurgling in her stomach. She bent forward, shivering from the cold wood on the bare skin of her knees. As if in a trance, drunk on familial affection, the girl took hold of Link\u2019s ankles. She shut her eyes, almost trembling in excitement. \u201c\u2026Just a quick taste,\u201d she thought to herself, fuzzy warm shivers running down her spine. Aryll\u2019s mouth spread open and she leaned forward, slipping the left foot\u2019s toes inside. She tasted each individual salty pad. The flavor melted into her tongue as it lapped at the underside of the foot. But as she attempted to taste further, advancing onto the tender insole, her eyes shot open. The upper portion of Link\u2019s foot had already filled her mouth. Her cheeks bulged with his saliva-slathered toes, stretched to their limit. She suckled nervously on the upper ball of Link\u2019s foot. He was still fast asleep. If she wanted, she could have given up and headed off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut letting Link go wasn\u2019t what Aryll wanted. Truthfully, she wanted to devour him whole, even though it was impossible. Yet affection burned within her, joining with the noisy groaning of her digestive system. Determined beyond reason, she yawned as hard as she possibly could. She grunted in pain. Her jaw muscles felt like they were on fire. Her face like it was on the verge of tearing in half. \u201cThis is my limit,\u201d she thought, a tear rolling down her stretched cheek, \u201cI just want to get his whole foot into my mouth\u2026\u201d Again Aryll closed her eyes, sniffling. All she wanted as to spend every day with her brother. She felt so ridiculous, with her overburdened mouth stretched with half of Link\u2019s foot, with her fingers clenching his bedsheets, with her thoughts of swallowing her brother whole creeping around her mind. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how hungry I am\u2026 This just isn\u2019t possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pop!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll\u2019s musings were interrupted by a sharp cracking sound, followed by a zesty new taste flooding her tongue. Her eyes slowly opened, bulging out as they beheld a new sight. Where the upper half of Link\u2019s foot had once dominated her view was now replaced by his ankle. She laid a hand on her cheek, which no longer felt stretched to bursting. In fact, the strain now felt rather pleasant. As she felt her distended cheeks, Aryll found that Link\u2019s entire foot now occupied her mouth. His toes tickled her uvula but did not trigger a gag reflex. His hefty heel pressed down into her tongue. His wrinkly insole tasted even more scrumptious than she could have imagined as her tongue busily lapped at it. It was mouthwatering, like sea salt and spice. If she could have gasped she would have. Somehow, she had unhinged her jaw and fit her brother\u2019s entire foot in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I did it\u2026 His whole foot! Wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, her gaze drifted over toward Link\u2019s right foot. \u201cI wonder\u2026 Could I?\u201d Concluding that there was no way to know without trying, Aryll grabbed the ankle and opened her mouth even wider, enough to stretch her lips over the other foot. Slowly but surely, her maw began to engulf Link\u2019s right foot, advancing over the toes, sole, and finally, the heel and base of the ankle. Link\u2019s feet were now mashed together inside her mouth. Her cheeks to ballooned out, each the size of her fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmmh,\u201d the girl heartily moaned, feeling the wonderful taste double in potency. But she then looked both of Link\u2019s ankles, which merged into the bridge of her nose and vanished into her mouth. Aryll\u2019s face was starting to hurt again. She winced as Link tossed and turned a bit in his sleep. The slight movements shot pain throughout her mouth. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she wondered, \u201cmaybe this is as far as I can go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll\u2019s stomach disagreed, howling to be properly filled. \u201cB-but there\u2019s no way\u2026 He\u2019s too big.\u201d She snorted. She could still regurgitate his feet, turn back and go to sleep. But even if that ended being the case, Aryll wanted to make this moment last. \u201cIf my insides are stretchy, I bet I can at least get to his ankles,\u201d she thought. Aryll tilted her head back and took a small gulp. She pulled herself forward, onto the end of the bed. Her gullet expanded to suck Link\u2019s feet down. Aryll massaged the bulge in her throat. Her lips now formed a fleshy ring around Link\u2019s forelegs while the sphincter of her throat gripped his ankles. She was surprised at how much she managed to devour. Aryll was now staring at Link\u2019s knees, with his silk-clad thighs and pelvis stretching tantalizingly beyond. His bellybutton peeked out from behind his white nightshirt. He felt so\u2026 Strong. Aryll felt powerful, almost maternal, to have any of Link\u2019s muscular form inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-maybe just up to his thighs,\u201d she thought, \u201cthat way I can\u2026 I can still let him go at the end.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll now took might, sequential swallows. Each gulp stretched her lips just a little father as they expanded over his ample hips. Her neck now held a fat, tubular bulge that brushed against the bedsheets. Her chest was now on the bed, growing with Link\u2019s legs inside. Aryll advanced over Link\u2019s body like a snake swallowing a rodent, yet she was smaller than he. She shuddered as she felt Link\u2019s toes tickle the sphincter leading into her belly. She hadn\u2019t even reached the apex of Link\u2019s hips and she already felt like she\u2019d reached another roadblock. It felt like trying to stretch her mouth over a hill, or even a mountain. \u201cM-maybe I should give up now\u2026 This is good enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly roared in disagreement. \u201cNo, no\u2026 I can do this! Big brother, you\u2019re going straight to my belly!\u201d The sphincter in front of her stomach suddenly dilated. Link\u2019s feet almost fell inside, speeding the process of devouring him along considerably. Aryll\u2019s muscular throat rippled and clenched, squeezing more of Link\u2019s legs into her bulging belly. A particularly meaty gulp got her over the widest point of Link\u2019s thighs. She had conquered the hill, and now she was permitted to descend into the valley below. Aryll practically crawled over Link\u2019s bed, easily swallowing halfway up his waist. Her stomach had expanded into a peach sphere that tore her dress open. From an overhead view, it would almost look as though Link was lying in a fleshy sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink\u2019s shoulders would be Aryll\u2019s final challenge. To ease the burden, she grabbed his hands and slid them under her lips, pinning them to his sides and beginning their journey into her belly. She proceeded to eating his chest and arms. By now her stomach had now expanded far beyond its physical limits. She lied upon its rounded form like a beanbag. It sank into the soft mattress. Aryll felt like she was lying on two beds at once. Link\u2019s legs were fully sealed inside her stomach. His midsection was well on its way. His torso had just finished entering her mouth as she conquered those broad shoulders\u2026 Her lips sealed around the base of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, only Link\u2019s head remained in Aryll\u2019s gob. His face was bordered by his sister\u2019s lips, like a fleshy picture frame. Aryll took a moment to admire her work. Through sheer willpower, burning love, and roaring hunger, she had sent her brother sliding into her soft, squishy innards. There, he would be safe. He would be hers, never to sail away. He would always be at her side, lending her his strength. She ran her tongue over his face, enjoying his taste one last time. Unable to wait any longer, Aryll threw her head back, her lips sealing over her brother\u2019s placidly slumbering face. Using her tongue, she pushed Link\u2019s head back into her gullet, leaving only a single muscular contraction to seal his fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GULP!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink\u2019s upper body dove down her gullet, spilling into Aryll\u2019s belly. The head-shaped bulge distended her neck before being lost behind her ribcage, funneled into the constrictive stomach. Inside his sister\u2019s bulbous gut, he curled into a fetal position. Aryll sighed happily, stifling a petite belch. She giggled, rubbing her waterbed of a stomach with big circular motions. Aryll curled up around the belly that was larger than she was. Swallowing her brother wasn\u2019t easy, and she was tuckered out, ready for a good night\u2019s sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2026 Nighty-night, big brother,\u201d Aryll smiled, drifting off into sleep\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link\u2019s eyes shot open and beheld total darkness. As he lacked vision, his other senses were left to pick up the slack. He felt his knees nestled against his face, his arms folded under his chest, and his back curved over. He was curled into a fetal position by some elastic material. Judging by the feeling of gravity, he was facing the ground, wherever he was. All he could hear were watery groans and bubbly pulsations. A particularly dense throbbing sound seemed to coincide with tremors in the stretchy walls. The more Link felt his surroundings slip and slide against his skin, the more he noticed that they seemed to be organic in nature. Link also noticed was that he was soaked and slickened by some viscous slop. It was pouring over him. It seeped into his underclothes. The sloshy juice saturated his hair in a way that reminded him of being swallowed by Molgera. The smell was not nearly as bad, though. \u201cWell,\u201d Link thought, wiggling his arms, barely able to move in the cramped space, \u201cI think I\u2019ve been eaten\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nA monstrous groan, unmistakably a gastrointestinal motion, seemed to confirm Link\u2019s assumption. He didn\u2019t feel as though his fleshy prison was swaying from his devourer\u2019s movement. That, along with the muffled snoring Link heard somewhere above him, confirmed his eater was asleep. Apparently, whatever creature swallowed him thought he was little more than a treat to gulp down and effortlessly sleep off. That thought irked Link more than slightly. \u201cAlright, monster. Get ready for a wakeup call.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink tightened up his legs, gathered strength, and threw a mighty kick at the muscled wall. Like rubber it stretched and tightened, constricting around his legs, slowly pulling back into its original shape. Link tried to keep his legs outstretched but the firm, fleshy walls were determined to smoosh him back into a ball. \u201cUgh, c\u2019mon\u2026\u201d He spread his arms and tried to put the stubborn muscular network to the test by stretching it thin. The hero was lying with his arms and legs outspread in an X-shaped pose. He hoped he would wrestle the creature\u2019s digestive system into some fatigue. Unfortunately, the slimy chamber was up to the challenge. The walls tightened around Link, causing his extended limbs to buckle. All around him the amorphous sack angrily contracted, determined to end his rebellion. Link shut his eyes and grit his teeth. This stomach had turned this into a test of his endurance instead. His strength was dropping. \u201cDamn\u2026 Not sure if I can keep this up.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBack outside, splayed out on Link\u2019s bed basking in the moonlight was the slumbering form of Aryll. She was atop her oversized belly, her arms wrapped its circumference, her faze nuzzling the featureless peach blob. A smile passed over her open lips. Drool leaked from her mouth and ran down the side of her stomach. She was deep in a dream, which her brain was making far more pleasurable experience by incorporating the feeling of her gastrointestinal movements. \u201cMmuh,\u201d she licked her lips, \u201cBig brother you were so tasty\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAryll!?\u201d Though her voice was muffled through the intestinal fortitude and organic soundscape, Link knew the sound of his sister\u2019s voice anywhere. The stomach walls suddenly closed in. Slimy muscles squeezed his body from every angle, forcing him into a tightly packed ball. \u201cGrr\u2026 Let me out of here!\u201d Link\u2019s struggles saw an enormous rise in vigor. He punched, kicked, and thrashed in every direction, but the visceral sack seemed immovable. Link realized he needed a change in strategy. He began focusing on his hearing, seeking the source of the monster\u2019s infernal heartbeat. Craning his head upward, he noted the intervals of each thump, eventually locating the heart somewhere above him. He wiggled and twisted, turning himself in the slippery stomach folds, repositioning where his back was facing downward. From the feeling of gravity Link was sure he was looking up. Timing his movement to avoid the kneading stomach walls, he curled up his knees. \u201cAryll! If you can hear me, just hold on!\u201d Aiming his legs toward the monster\u2019s vital organs, Link unleashed a powerful kick.   <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Mh? Big brother\u2026?\u201d Aryll awoke with a great yawn. \u201cWhere\u2026 Are- OW!!\u201d The next feeling Aryll experienced was a stinging pain that exploded through her chest. She was shaken awake. Her bulbous belly trembled like a splash in a pond. \u201cBig brother\u2026 Ouch\u2026 That hurt.\u201d Link allowed his legs to recoil. He slid back into the moist pit in complete befuddlement. \u201cWh-wha? Aryll? Is\u2026 The monster hurting you?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cW-what monster?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Wait\u2026 No\u2026 Aryll.\u201d Link\u2019s jaw hung agape, allowing a drop of gastric fluid to splash onto his tongue. \u201cYou ate me. I\u2019m inside you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Aryll\u2019s cheeks flushed a bright red. While swallowing Link her mind had wandered off to another place. She had actually intended to let him out, but she had ended up containing him completely inside her. And she had to admit, the feeling of her brother\u2019s weighty body distending her rounded belly was rather nice. But she had never considered how he might react to being inside her stomach. \u201cAryll,\u201d he said, \u201cUh\u2026 did you really swallow me?\u201d The girl felt embarrassed, but she fought it. Telling Link the truth was more important. \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted, \u201cI-I gobbled you up, big brother...\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? This has to be a dream,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cAryll, how is this possible? Am I shrunken?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really\u2026 I just kinda swallowed you whole. I\u2019m lying on top of you actually.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible! I\u2019m bigger than you, how, did you do this?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno\u2026 I just really wanted you to stay, big brother. I just wanted to have you forever, I guess. And\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll sheepishly smiled with ruby cheeks. \u201cI was kinda hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cBut Aryll, if you eat me, you\u2019ll digest me.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Link tried to facepalm, but he couldn\u2019t move his arm. \u201cSo I\u2019ll die!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll gasped. Her eyes darted around the room, as if to find something to fish him out of her stomach. \u201cOh no! Big brother, I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019ll get you out, I promise!\u201d The engorged girl stuck her finger into her mouth, trying to stimulate a gag reflex. She hacked and heaved, her gut trying to squeeze its contents back up her throat. Her efforts were in vain, however, as Link\u2019s heavy body refused to pass through the stiff sphincter. She tried again, coughing queasily, but nothing exited her belly. Aryll sniffled, a tear rolling down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, big brother\u2026 Oh\u2026 What are we going to do?\u201d Link sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. But actually\u2026\u201d Link felt around the stomach walls, coating his hand in thicker gastric fluids. Aside from a warm, wet feeling, he didn\u2019t seem to feel anything from the liquid. \u201cI don\u2019t think your stomach is digesting me at all. All the juices in here are just sliding off my back like nothing.\u201d Aryll shivered with pleasure when she felt her brother massage her insides. She was no longer crying. \u201cR-really?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Though Link didn\u2019t verbally admit it, for fear of how Aryll would perceive it, being inside her stomach was actually quite relaxing. The smell was inoffensive, the humid air kept him cozy and warm, and the muscular contractions were like a combination of massaging and rocking. He wasn\u2019t losing vitality. If anything, the environment was doing the opposite. It was almost womblike. Link was puzzled, but he had experienced plenty of weird things in his travels. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to get me out of here, Aryll. But I\u2019m not dying, so we can sleep and figure this out tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? I really don\u2019t wanna hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been eaten by uglier monsters than you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll giggled. \u201cOkay, I trust you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe siblings went silent in their embrace, falling asleep\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link was dreaming. He was on the beach at the water\u2019s edge, just a quick walk away from his house. He was younger, lacking an adventurer\u2019s experience. Seated firmly in the sand, he watched as the seawater washed over his bare feet. He curled his toes and shivered. The cool liquid sped away as soon as it had arrived, leaving his soaked feet chilled by the breeze. As a child he loved the feeling. He couldn\u2019t comprehend what it was that was so pleasing about it at the time. Perhaps it was the sense of being at the edge of something as incomprehensibly large as the Great Sea. That sense that was followed by the call for adventure. Regardless of how developed his brain was, it was easy for Link to lose himself in the cold, watery embrace\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig broooootheeerr!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026But it was difficult for him to stay there. Link\u2019s head turned to his left. Aryll was on her knees, slapping uselessly at a mound of sand. At age four, she was somehow even cuter than her current self. Those big doe eyes were even bigger and doe-ier. Her dress was green, speckled with pink flowers. Her hair lacked pigtails, a messy pixie cut instead. \u201cHelp me finish this sand castle,\u201d she pouted, \u201cplease?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smiled and stood up. He went down onto his knee, by Aryll\u2019s side, and grabbed handfuls of sand. He began hastily sculpting a rough approximation of Hyrule Castle. Link wasn\u2019t much of an artist unless pictography was involved. The resulting lumpy mess was nothing to write home about. \u201cWow, big brother,\u201d Aryll gasped, \u201cThat looks great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 It\u2019s perfect as long as you made it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? How do you figure that, sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll turned toward Link and wrapped her arms around him. She buried her face in his chest. Link felt his heart throb against her tiny head. \u201cCuz\u2026 You made it for me! And you\u2019ll always be there when I need you, right big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink\u2019s head tilted downward, his chin resting in Aryll\u2019s hair. \u201c\u2026Of course I-\u201cA torrent of water splashed against Link\u2019s back. He turned, only to behold the sea rising, washing everything away, and utterly swallowing him within its waves\u2026<br>\r\n_ _ _<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll\u2019s eyelids twitched as morning sunshine flittered through the bedroom window. She reached up and yawned, trying to hop off the bed as she always did. Yet she seemed anchored to a heavy mass attached to her waist. She could not move. Her bulbous stomach, still full of her big brother, was her \u2018bed.\u2019 Aryll grunted and began rocking left and right, eventually rolling herself upright. She managed to seat herself on the side of the actual bed. Her belly hung between her legs, spilling out towards the floor in a cacophony of watery gurgles. \u201cAh,\u201d she cutely yawned, \u201cGood morning, big brother. Are you awake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a small wriggling under her skin. \u201cYup,\u201d Link replied, \u201clet\u2019s get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Get going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo Tetra and the pirates. We\u2019re going on a little trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo where?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot sure yet. Thing is, the more I think about it, the more I think you managed to eat me with some kind of magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhoa! Am I a witch, big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Maybe. Even with the handful of spells I can cast I honestly don\u2019t know much about magic. I\u2019m still trying to think of an island where we\u2019d find someone who does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Wait, I just realized,\u201d Aryll stopped and clutched her stomach with her hands, allowing her fingers to sink into her soft skin, \u201chow am I gonna explain my big belly, big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just tell \u2018em what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. They\u2019ll get it. You were on their ship for a couple weeks, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Aryll nodded, hopping off the bed. Somehow she managed to keep herself upright. \u201cWow,\u201d she gasped, \u201cI feel really strong, big brother! I\u2019m holding you up\u2026.\u201d She kneeled over onto her knees. \u201cOuff,\" she clutched her stomach and picked it up off the floor, \"You\u2019re still really heavy, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSudden bursts of strength, huh? We\u2019ve gotta get to the bottom of this. Can you walk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 Yeah\u2026\u201d Aryll shakily got back on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overstuffed girl waddled out into the main thoroughfare of the house. Grandma was sitting by the kitchen table sipping tea. She turned to see her granddaughter standing with a massive peach dome hanging from her waist, dangling past her knees. \u201cAryll\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, good morning grandma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma sat with her mouth agape. \u201cI\u2026 forgot about how much you ate last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup\u2026 I, uh, was gonna go with the pirates\u2026 On a trip. Um\u2026 See ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Grandma\u2019s face suddenly became neutral. \u201cHave a nice trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a swift string of knocks clattered against the front door. \u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Aryll said, hurrying to the door and pulling it open. She was met with Tetra\u2019s stern visage as she tried to walk inside, only to bump against Aryll\u2019s stomach. \u201cWha- Aryll?\u201d Tetra backed up and examined the chubby little girl. She playfully prodded at the fat gut. \u201cJeez, you\u2019d make Jalhalla look anorexic. How the heck did you eat even more than last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll\u2019s eyes rolled around the room. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no need to be embarrassed. I was just looking for Link.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 About that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll\u2019s body suddenly emitted a muffled groan, which sounded to Tetra almost like a voice. She chuckled at the thought. \u201cI\u2019m in here, Tetra,\u201d mumbled Link from behind the flabby rolls. Tetra cocked her head. \u201cHuh? Link, this isn\u2019t funny,\u201d she began scanning the room behind Aryll, \u201cWhere are you really?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll blushed. \u201cHe\u2019s not kidding, Tetra. I\u2026 Kind of ate him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cOh.\u201d She leaned forward and laid a hand on Aryll\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou swallowed Link. He\u2019s in your belly right now, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach shuddered as Link readjusted himself. Tetra simply stood for a while. Aryll felt a chill run up her spine. Tetra began shaking, her eyes bulging. Then she shrieked. \u201cWHAAAAAAAT? H-how! When? You- you\u2019re just a kid! And how are you even standing? Your back must be killing you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll reached behind herself. She patted her back muscles. \u201cNo, I feel fine! I\u2019ve been feeling really strong today, actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra folded her arms and bit her lip. \u201c\u2026Ugh, this is just too weird. I\u2019m still having trouble processing a person just eating another person whole. Can\u2019t you spit him up, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just about to get to that,\u201d Link said, \u201cAryll can\u2019t throw me up, and I have to figure out what kind of magic is letting her do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd? How do you plan on getting that info?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re gonna need a ship\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra sighed. Aryll smiled and giggled. \u201cWhee! We really are going on a trip, right big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for preparations for the trip to be completed, Aryll relaxed on the deck of the house facing the infinite blue. She breathed in the salty air, kicking back in a folding chair, her belly resting on the cushions. Almost everyone on Outset Island heard about what happened. Many villagers visited her, fascinated by her oversized stomach. Upon seeing Aryll, Rose was concerned that her children, Joel and Zill, would try eating each other. The kids ended up being transfixed on Aryll\u2019s belly, though. Joel and Zill approached her asking to be swallowed, which Aryll politely declined, claiming she was already full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll was helped aboard the pirate ship thanks to the combined efforts of Gonzo and Senza. Strong as she was, Aryll found difficulty ascending the slanted gangplank with Link\u2019s weight throwing her off balance. The engorged girl was to bunk in Tetra\u2019s quarters for the duration of the trip. Meanwhile, Tetra stood on the bridge of the ship to inform her crew of where they were headed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright guys,\u201d Tetra announced, \u201cLink told me where we need to go. Let\u2019s plot a course for\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tetra\u2019s bed was the most comfortable thing Aryll had ever rested on. She was splayed out on her side, her back supported by a row of pillows propped against the wall. Her stomach shared half the bed with her. Link benefited from the embrace of warm flesh and the softness of Tetra\u2019s mattress. Aryll was directly facing Tetra\u2019s desk and framed sea charts. Yet she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of the pictograph of Tetra\u2019s mother. She looked so daring and imposing. Aryll wondered if Tetra would be like her when she grew older. She then asked Link a rather important question. \u201cSo why are we going to Dragon Roost Island, big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSis, don\u2019t you remember Medli?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll scratched her head. \u201cOh yeah, the bird girl! Does she know magic?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a sage, and she draws her power from an ancient sage\u2019s spirit. She\u2019ll have more magic knowledge than me. Plus she can manipulate a little magic with her harp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe she can help then! You\u2019re so smart, big brother.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026 It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll smiled, only for her countenance to quickly straighten. Swallowing Link had brought him closer to her heart than ever before. The sensation of Link moving around inside her felt amazing. She had even started rubbing her stomach habitually. But like any good feeling it was destined to end. Aryll recognized this fact and she was saddened by it. Swallowing Link was almost an accident, but the more she thought about it, the less she wanted to never let him leave her body\u2026 <i>But,</i> she thought, <i>I\u2019ve got to help my brother\u2026</i><br>\r\n_ _ _<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey to Dragon Roost Island took one full day. On the morning of the ship\u2019s arrival Aryll walked out on deck, momentarily blinded by the rising sun. When her vision returned she beheld the towering silhouette of Dragon Roost, like a shadowy shark tooth shooting off into the heavens. The ship found a suitable port on the eastern side of the island. Aryll disembarked onto the beach with Tetra and the pirates as escorts. She entered the Rito village inside the mountain. The birdlike people were astonished as they beheld the fleshy orb hanging past the little girl\u2019s knees. Eventually Medli appeared to greet them in the village\u2019s central chamber, asking numerous questions about Aryll\u2019s physical state. Aryll, Link, and Tetra offered conflicting accounts, but ultimately Medli reached her own conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Medli nodded, \u201cI think I\u2019m starting to get it. So, Link. You think your sister has some latent magical power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much,\u201d Aryll\u2019s belly replied. Medli laughed. She felt like she was having a conversation with a girl\u2019s digestive system. Such a bizarre thought\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAryll, Tetra, come with me to my quarters,\u201d Medli offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Nico scratched his head, \u201cwhat\u2019re we gonna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Medli trembled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tetra said, turning toward her crew, \u201cYou idiots like alcohol, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYEAAH!\u201d the group heartily howled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d She turned back toward Medli, \u201cYou guys got a watering hole, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, actually we do\u2026 It was built recently by merchants from Windfall, over by the eastern beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra shrugged. \u201cPerfect. Nico! Gonzo! Crew!\u201d The pirates in question stiffened up their posture. \u201cGo get smashed while we deal with grown\u2014up things, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pirates cheered and stormed out of the village. Medli\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe how loyal those men are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. There are only two things I can count on in this world- the wind behind my sails and the scumbags at my command.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was surprised by Tetra\u2019s word choice. \u201cScumbags?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll set a finger on her lip. \u201cThey can get kinda rowdy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re scumbags, but they\u2019re my scumbags\u2026 Heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli turned and beckoned the two girls to follow. She led them down a rocky hallway to her personal quarters. The room was a modest circular chamber decorated with crimson and cerulean tapestries, bearing the marks of Din and Nayru respectively. A row of square windows offered a view of the boundless blue sky. A shining orange sphere, surrounded by Windfall couches, sat at the center of the room, supplying most of the illumination. \u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Din\u2019s Pearl?\u201d Tetra asked. Medli nodded. \u201cAfter the Tower of the Gods vanished the tribes responsible for watching over the pearls retrieved them from the Triangle Isles. The pearls are still powerful vestiges of magic, so I should be able to use Din\u2019s Pearl to detect whatever magic is currently coursing through Aryll.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll took a seat on a couch in front of the pearl. Her belly hung between her thighs and brushed on the floor, glowing orange from Din\u2019s burning light. Tetra sat on another couch across from Aryll. Medli kneeled between Aryll and the pearl, laying one hand on the fleshy sphere and the other on the orange one. Aryll shivered a little as the Rito girl\u2019s cold hand made contact with her stomach. \u201cStay calm, Aryll,\u201d Medli said, \u201cI\u2019m going to start scanning the magical energies\u2026 Er\u2026 I think that\u2019s right. Sorry, I\u2019m still new to this, even as a sage.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time,\u201d Link said.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli certainly did. It took her nearly four minutes, but Aryll\u2019s hand suddenly began to glow. It was a golden glow, in the shape of a triangle. All three girls gasped. Tetra stood up. She stared at the girl\u2019s hand. \u201cAryll\u2026 Is that a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli was entranced as well. \u201cA Triforce piece\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Link seemed to be in the greatest disbelief despite his face being invisible. \u201cThere\u2019s no way! I\u2019ve got Courage, Tetra\u2019s got Wisdom, so that only leaves-\u201c<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nSuddenly, Aryll hacked and hiccupped. Medli retracted her hand. Aryll stood up, her stomach writhing and condensing. A storm of groans and gurgles began brewing in the squirming organic sac. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting a reaction,\u201d Medli yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll frowned and belched. \u201cOooh\u2026 My belly feels all queasy\u2026\u201d Her bubbling belly heaved and squeezed its contents back up her gullet, forming a massive bulge in her throat. She opened her maw wide, allowing Link to escape. Aryll\u2019s eyes shut. She winced in pain as her brother\u2019s head stretched her esophageal muscles on its way back up through her neck\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aryll lurched forward. Her once-bloated stomach was rapidly shrinking, nearly its original shape, and her dress was settling back over her knees. Her mouth gaping open, her legs spread apart, she expelled something dense and slimy. It fell onto her lap and landed with a weighty plop. It then rolled off her thigh and fell between her knees. She coughed and sputtered, her eyes tearing up a little. She shut her eyes tightly and laid a hand on her groaning stomach. \u201cOoh\u2026 My poor tummy\u2026 Hey!\u201d Aryll\u2019s eyes shot open as she beheld her lack of a Link-sized belly. \u201cI\u2019m back to normal!\u201d She looked at Tetra, who sat with a startled face, then at Medli, who was kneeling on the floor with a similar expression. Aryll was confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know, that was just a little intense I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli shook her head, regaining her senses. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s good that your stomach has returned to its normal size,\u201d the Rito girl said, \u201cBut I still have one concern\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? What is it, Medli?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Where is Link?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll felt a chill run down her spine. Her eyes frantically darted around the room for any sign of her brother. \u201cBig brother! Where are you!?\u201d She stood up and turned around to check behind the couch. There was still no sign of him. She turned back around and started hurrying toward the other side of the room. As she passed by Tetra, the pirate girl reached out and grabbed her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAryll, hold up\u2026\u201d Tetra pointed toward the lower rim of Aryll\u2019s skirt. \u201cUm\u2026 Don\u2019t freak out, but I think I found Link.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll cocked her head. \u201cHuh?\u201d She followed Tetra\u2019s gaze toward her skirt and caught the slightest hint of a silhouette of something hanging off the fabric. Medli appeared at Aryll\u2019s side, examining the object. The blue-skirted girl backed up and sat back down. Medli and Tetra followed her, standing before her, closely studying the object. Aryll then lowered her head to get a better view. Whatever it was, it was clinging tightly to her skirt. The longer Aryll looked the more humanoid the shape seemed to look. The clinging seemed to be accomplished by a pair of hands reaching from its body. Between the hands was what looked like a head, with short, blonde hair growing out of its scalp. In fact, that particular shade of blonde actually reminded Aryll of her own hair color\u2026<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWait a sec,\u201d Aryll said, \u201cCould that be\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Medli whispered, \u201che couldn\u2019t have\u2026 Shrunken?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll reached down and picked the object off her dress. She pinched it between her thumb and pointer finger brought it before her face and confirmed her suspicion. It was Link! Somehow he had been shrunken, somewhere around three centimeter\u2019s in height, held by his bare waist. He was still wearing only his underclothes. His legs kicked uselessly at the air. His tiny eyes were locked onto her pond-sized pupils. Aryll gasped. \u201cBig brother\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra kneeled and closely examined the shrunken hero. \u201cWell, I guess he isn\u2019t your \u2018big\u2019 brother anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli planted her knees on the floor and joined Aryll. \u201cThis must be a result of the magic reaction\u2026 Er, sorry, Link.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink was still a little overwhelmed. Aryll\u2019s face loomed before him like a sheer cliff. Glancing behind himself to his left and right, he saw Tetra and Medli\u2019s gigantic visages as silhouettes in Din\u2019s light. He was surrounded by giantesses, a fantasy that his thirteen-year-old mind had occasionally concocted. Yet to be thrust into this situation with his sister and two of his friends was a little much. He felt frozen. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Medli whimpered, \u201cI think he\u2019s scared\u2026 Aw\u2026 Poor little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll gasped. \u201cBig brother, please don\u2019t be afraid! I\u2019m not gonna hurt you!\u201d<br>\r\nLink blushed and shook himself out of his shock He was mature for his age but he still felt a little patronized by the girls\u2019 tone. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Medli,\u201d he looked back toward Aryll and nodded, \u201cat least I\u2019m back outside, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Aryll replied, \u201cI\u2019m just happy you\u2019re okay, big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink shuddered as he felt Tetra\u2019s fingers clench around his waist. \u201cWhoa!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra rolled her eyes, then brought Link\u2019s minute form closer to them. \u201cAw, gimme a break. I just wanted a closer look at you. Hm\u2026 You know, if you were to stay this way, you\u2019d make a pretty handy thief.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna stay this way! Medli, do you have any idea how to undo this?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d The Rito girl\u2019s eyes fell to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Link, I don\u2019t know if I can. I\u2019m no expert on the Triforce of Power.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on,\u201d Tetra said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know if she really\u2026\u201d Aryll\u2019s open fingers moved in to take Link back. Tetra saw the back of the girl\u2019s hand and beheld the unmistakable golden triangle glowing atop her skin. After Aryll seized Link, Tetra told her to look at her hand.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Aryll obeyed and turned the back of her hand toward her face. \u201cWow,\u201d Aryll exchanged Link with her other hand. She looked at the amber mark, transfixed by its three-pointed shape. \u201cMy hand is glowing! See, big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink watched as the Triforce mark on back of Aryll\u2019s hand turned toward him. He could not believe the energy that had once fueled his arch nemesis now inhabited his young sister. \u201cAryll,\u201d Tetra said, \u201cThis is pretty serious. The Triforce of Power can do some real damage if you don\u2019t keep it under control.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink nodded, though Aryll could hardly see it. \u201cTetra\u2019s right, sis. We\u2019re gonna have to deal with this somehow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Link,\u201d Medli chimed in, \u201cmaybe Ganondorf left some information on the Triforce of Power at Forsaken Fortress? A book, perhaps?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra crossed her arms. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming your dragon didn\u2019t barbeque his whole library.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli cupped her hand around her chin. \u201cLord Valoo certainly did some damage.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Link agreed, \u201cbut that really is all we have to go on. Can we leave tomorrow, Tetra?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cBut where are we gonna sleep?\u201d Aryll asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm.\u201d Link had to admit, that was a good question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra shrugged. \u201cThe crew &amp; I can sleep in the ship.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAryll looked to her shrunken sibling. Despite the obvious size difference, she still looked to him for guidance. \u201cWhat about us, big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink gave it some thought, and decided\u2026</span></div></div>",

You three have been my friends for a while now. You can all stay the night here if you\u2019d like.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d Tetra turned to leave the room, \u201cI gotta wrangle some pirates. And it\u2019s easier for me to keep them from breaking things when I\u2019m watching them, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli nodded again. \u201cIt was nice seeing you, Tetra. Would you mind if I walked with you? I wanted to discuss a few things, actually.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Tetra said, offered a single wave to Link and Tetra as she and Medli left through the door. Aryll sat down on the couch and placed Link on a knee-high table off to the couch\u2019s side. She reclined and yawned. \u201cMm, the last few days have been pretty crazy, huh brother?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Link chuckled, looking up at his mountainous sister\u2019s head, \u201cwith you eating me, us heading back to Dragon Roost, you puking me up, and me shrinking? Nah. Weird stuff like this is business as usual for us.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, I guess you\u2019re right, big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink sat cross-legged on the table. \u201cYou know, we never really talked about your time in captivity. Was it scary?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll took a deep breath. \u201cIt felt like it lasted for months. I wasn\u2019t sure if I would ever see you again. But when you came to save me that one night, it filled me so much hope. Even though you failed, just knowing that you were out there, that you were fighting to rescue me\u2026 It made it a lot less scary.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYou believed in me that much?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did! You\u2019ve always been more than my brother. Link\u2026\u201d Aryll blushed. His name was a sacred thing, something that could seldom be spoken. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been my hero.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink smiled. His lips trembled as tears welled up behind his eyes. He lifted a hand and wiped the salty droplets from his brow. \u201cT-thanks, Aryll. I never knew I meant that much to you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll hunched over, looking more closely at Link. \u201cAre you\u2026 Crying, big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWha- no! I just- it\u2019s nothing!\u2019<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe young giantess giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay! You can cry, like that time you got your toe pinched by that crab!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding? That\u2019s not how it happened! First of all\u2026\u201d Nearly an hour of conversation passed between the two siblings. As the day faded into night Aryll curled up with a blanket on the couch. Wistfully gazing at the sun and clouds through the room\u2019s lone window, the girl descended into slumber the moment the orange orb vanished under the horizon. Link rested on a clump of handkerchiefs that Aryll had arranged atop the small table, incidentally behind her feet. Her ankles were propped on the end of the couch and he could see her soles and toes dangling off the arm. Her big toe was now larger than his head. Link turned from Aryll\u2019s wrinkled soles to face the door. To his surprise, the door creaked open, and in stepped Medli, her eyes half-open, lazily scanning the room. A goofy grin was splayed across her face.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMedli,\u201d Link called up to her, \u201cyou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWha- what\u2019s that,\u201d Medli stumbled forth, \u201cSomeone\u2026 Calling\u2026 Me?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink stood up and walked toward the edge of the table. There was something off with the way she was walking and talking. \u201cMedli, I\u2019m down here on the table.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cTa-ble\u2026\u201d Her gaze drifted down toward him. Her pupils almost exploded when she spotted the shrunken hero. \u201cWhoa! You\u2019re so tiny\u2026\u201d She reached down and awkwardly groped the air around Link. He ended up stepping between her open fingers to help her, and they closed into a fist around him. With only his head exposed, Link tried to free his arms from Medli\u2019s iron grip, but he could not budge. She brought him before her pond-sized eyes and gasped. \u201cYou really are just a tiny little thing\u2026! Wow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink felt Medli\u2019s hot breath waft up from her mouth. He sniffed at the air and caught a stale grape-like scent. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d Link exclaimed, \u201cMedli, are you drunk!?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli lowered Link in front of her chin. She laid a finger on her chin and pondred her present state of existence. \u201cHm\u2026. Uh\u2026 Hurk\u2026\u201d A low gurgling moan sounded somewhere inside Medli\u2019s body. Then the Rito girl\u2019s mouth opened and released a raucous belch. Link recoiled as the smell of alcohol blasted past his face. \u201cEheheh,\u201d she licked her upper lip, \u201cYeah\u2026 Tetra, she uh\u2026 She is such a nice girl\u2026 Y\u2019know?...\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMedli,\u201d Link looked up toward her eyes. She was staring off into space. \u201cC\u2019mon, focus!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Medli\u2019s eyes fell back toward the little hero in her hand. The girl grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink\u2019s face came to hold an expression of abject terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d she said, \u201cYou kinda look like\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s me, Link. You helped me save the world, remember?\u201d Medli ignored Link and hoisted him upside-down over her head. His face dangled over hers. She looked up at him and licked her lips. Her belly growled in anticipation. \u201cMedli,\u201d he screamed, \u201cplease don\u2019t eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli arched an eyebrow. \u201cHey, quit talking\u2026 Worms don\u2019t talk\u2026\u201d The boy in her grip began frantically struggling. She tightened her grip and giggled. \u201cAw, you\u2019re a squirmy little guy! Just like the worms I used to have for breakfast! You\u2019re gonna feel soooo good wriggling on your way down\u2026\u201d Her jaws began creaked apart, giving Link a front-row preview of his destination. Ropes of saliva linking her teeth snapped as her maw opened fully. A slobbery bubble rolled back over her undulating tongue and burst as it brushed against her uvula. Shiny orange reflections of torchlight and Din's Fire danced around her cheeks. But no light met the black void beyond the tongue. The fleshy outcropping around the girl\u2019s gullet contracted, sucking a thick flow of spit down the slippery tube. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rito girl winked. \u201cDown the hatch, little wormy~\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli shut her eyes and let Link go. He plummeted past her beak and plopped onto her salivating tongue. The slimy, almost frictionless surface was angled upward, so Link immediately began sliding headfirst toward the back of Medli\u2019s mouth. He flipped horizontally and grabbed a tooth with both hands, somehow managing to slow his descent. Link now hung over the steamy pit, taste buds sampling his face. \u201cGr, I\u2019m <i>not</i> gonna end up as birdseed,\u201d Link groaned, barely able to keep his grip. \u201cToo bad I can\u2019t use the Command Melody\u2026\u201d Suddenly Medli flicked her tongue, sending her treat sailing toward her gullet. The boy flew through the humid air and felt a sudden stop, followed by a firm fleshy grip on his waist. Half of Link\u2019s body was stuck in the tight ring of muscle serving as the gateway into the Rito girl\u2019s digestive system. He tried pushing himself back out but he only slid in further. His legs fluttered pathetically outside the throat. Back outside, Medli laid a finger on her neck and swallowed.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n<b>*gluck*</b><br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli sighed. She felt a squirmy lump throb against her finger and disappear beyond her collarbone. Her tongue slid over her lips. \u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Link kicked wildly against the dense viscera inside her chest. His frenetic struggles felt immaculate. Medli waddled over toward her bed. She shivered in pleasure as she felt Link plop into her stomach. Falling back into the bed, the Rito girl viciously rubbed her gurgling belly. \u201cSuch a tasty worm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMedli, you idiot\u2026\u201d Link grumbled in the steamy darkness, lying flat on the wrinkled floor. Half his head was under in a puddle of gastric juices and alcohol. He stood up on his knees and wiped the thick liquid off his face. Sweltering air circulated Medli\u2019s stomach. It carried a faint, acrid odor, overridden by the fruity scent of whatever the girl was currently drunk on. The intense heat made Link glad that he was clad in only his nightclothes from two nights before. He pulled his shirt off and tossed it aside. He backed away from the acidic pit and sat on the undulating floor, on the spot where it curved into the pulsating wall. \u201cCan\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been eaten by two girls in a row\u2026 I guess it was only a matter of time at this size.\u201d Link laid his hand into the slimy wall and grabbed a handful of viscous liquid. He closed his fist and felt the goop slip between his fingers. \u201cHm, it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being digested. I wonder if the Triforce of Courage is protecting me\u2026 Or maybe Rito stomachs aren\u2019t strong enough to process a Hylian.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAs if to challenge Link\u2019s claim Medli\u2019s gastrointestinal system roared to life. Liquid poured in from all sides as the muscular walls harshly contracted. Link yelped as his fleshy seat ejected him. \u201cOh, come on!\u201d The shrunken hero was shoved into a whirlpool of gastric juices. The waves sloshed him all around the organic chamber during its vicious effort to digest him. \u201cMedli!!\u201d Despite Link\u2019s present frustration with her, Medli was lying contently on her bed, massaging her bubbling belly. One last burp slithered up her throat as she drifted off into slumber, oblivious to the raging maelstrom inside her body and Link\u2019s struggles to stay afloat in it. Before long she was snoring alongside Aryll, and by morning everyone would be blissfully unaware of the boy\u2019s predicament. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThankfully for Link the waters soon calmed and he washed up on the fleshy shore. Rather than attempt to stand, he turned over and laid back. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my movement prompted that craziness, but I\u2019m just gonna play it safe. Hm\u2026 Hopefully I can rest in here\u2026\u201d Link figured that on the next morning everyone would wonder where he was. He would wiggle a little against Medli\u2019s stomach folds when he heard her speak. A simple but solid plan.</span></div></div>",

Wake up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rito sage felt her arm being jerked. Her eyelids fluttered, and she saw Aryll\u2019s face bathed in the pink dawn\u2019s light. Then her eyes squeezed shut. \u201cMmf\u2026 My head hurts\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Ms. Hangover,\u201d Tetra\u2019s annoyed voice barked, followed by a light flick against Medli\u2019s forehead, \u201cWe\u2019re looking for Link. He\u2019s gone missing.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Medli exclaimed, scrabbling out of her bed. As soon as she stood up she clutched her stomach and hunched over. \u201cOoh\u2026 My tummy hurts... What did I do last night?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It wasn\u2019t really your fault. We went aboard the deck my ship to hang out, but unfortunately my crew was having a wild party. You were drinking a glass of water, and unfortunately Niko was a little tipsy so he mistook it for his grape wine. So the drinks got mixed up. You wouldn\u2019t think grape wine would have much of a kick, but\u2026 Yeah. My crew can get ahold of some weird stuff, combined with you being a bit of a lightweight. No offense. Anyway, I walked you back to your room, but I had to hurry back to supervise them.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli rubbed her temple. \u201cI can\u2019t remember anything, and now you\u2019re saying Link is missing. I probably didn\u2019t notice he was gone when I came back.\u201d  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Medli,\u201d Aryll said with a reassuring pat on the shoulder, \u201cWe can look for him together.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe two girls nodded and looked to Tetra, who shrugged. \u201cI guess we should inform the rest of your tribe, eh Medli?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Medli agreed, \u201cI\u2019ll go and find- huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll cocked her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Medli?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli felt around her abdomen. \u201cI feel something inside my stomach. It\u2019s\u2026 Moving around, I think.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra gasped. \u201cWait, you don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll\u2019s face was drained of color. \u201cL-Link?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 It\u2019s still moving- ack!\u201d Medli gasped as Aryll sped over toward her, laying an ear on her abdomen. \u201cBig brother,\u201d she shouted, \u201cC-can you hear me in there?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThankfully, behind the dense network of gastrointestinal tissue, Link heard his sister loud and clear. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Medli! Just let Medli know she\u2019s gonna have to get me out of here somehow, and I think both of us would rather have me leave the way I came in!\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, big brother! Hang in there for just a second!\u201d Aryll stood back up. Medli was exceedingly pale. She covered her eyes, on the verge of tears. \u201cOh, gods\u2026 I\u2026 I ate Link\u2026 I\u2019m such a moron!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra groaned. \u201cOh, suck it up! Link\u2019s been through worse. Heck, this isn\u2019t even the first time this has happened to him, remember?\u201d Medli shakily nodded. \u201cJ-just give me a brief moment,\u201d the Rito girl said, maneuvering over toward the couch and taking a seat. She tilted her head down and cupped her hands under her mouth. After a harsh round of coughing and sputtering, a glob of bodily liquid plopped into her palms, carrying Link inside. Medli sighed as the minute body twitched weakly. She stood up and brought him to a water basin near the doorway, dipping him inside to cleanse him. As soon as he seemed to have fully recovered, Medli began her apology train. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cLink, I\u2019m so, so sorry. Truly, I am. I will suffer any penance that will equalize us.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink sighed. \u201cMedli, it\u2019s... It\u2019s fine.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not! I swallowed you whole! I can\u2019t imagine how unpleasant that would be!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIt sucked, that\u2019s for sure. But you don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cLink, I\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you know what? Bring me close to your cheek.\u201d Medli frowned, but then relented and obeyed. Link delivered a quick punch to the giantess\u2019s face. Despite the strike\u2019s weakness she gasped when she felt it. \u201cHuh? What was that, Link?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYour punishment. There, you\u2019re punished.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat- Link!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra sauntered over with a smirk. \u201cHey, if you\u2019re in such a hurry to get punched, I can oblige you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cTetra! Th-that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Aryll walked after Tetra and giggled at her comment. She reached for Link. Medli reluctantly offered him. She sighed. \u201cI think I\u2019m okay\u2026 As long as Link\u2019s safe I feel fine. But\u2026\u201d The Rito girl reeled Link back in. \u201cAryll, would you mind if Link &amp; I\u2026 talked for a minute? Alone?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll winked and smiled. \u201cSure, as long as you don\u2019t eat him again!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli laughed nervously. \u201cThank you, girls.\u201d Aryll and Tetra left the room. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli sat down on the couch and set Link on her thigh. She folded her hands. She took a very, very deep breath and exhaled. \u201cLink, I just wanted to clear something up. When we journeyed into the Earth Temple, we worked together. We protected each other. We conquered that place together. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 when I fought alongside you, I felt really good.

She stood on a balcony, watching his every movement. \u201cLink\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink sighed. \u201cYou know we\u2019re going outside the charted waters, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nShe nodded, choking back a storm of bawling. \u201cI-I know, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink clenched his fist. His lip trembled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I understand. But\u2026 Link?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I hope this doesn\u2019t sound selfish, but\u2026 Please don\u2019t forget about me.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink reached toward her face. Medli offered her open palm. They touched for a moment, then split. \u201cI won\u2019t, Medli. Honestly, the times I spent with you were awesome. I won\u2019t forget you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMedli breathed for several seconds. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe pair sat in silence for a while.  <br>\r\n_ _ _<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Dragon Roost beach, Medli handed Link to Aryll. The two waved to each other as Medli walked away. Aryll and Link turned toward the pirate ship, where Tetra waited, peering over the starboard railing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tetra said, \u201cnow that we\u2019re all back together, are we ready to go to Forsaken Fortress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink thought about it for a moment\u2026</span></div></div>",

Aryll, clad in her maroon skull dress, crossed her arms behind her head as she listened to her brother\u2019s tales of his numerous Great Sea exploits. The tiny hero was clad in nothing but his undershorts, perched on his sister\u2019s thigh as he related his exploits. \u201cIce Ring Isle was the coldest place I\u2019d ever been. I had no idea how I would get in, and then I ran into a cyclone on the sea. It seemed like bad luck, but it turned out that the storm had been caused by one of the wind gods, Cyclos. He gave me the power to travel using cyclones, which helped me to reach the inside of the Mother &amp; Child Isles. That was where\u2026\u201d Link interrupted himself when he and Aryll heard a rumble of thunder. \u201cHuh, that\u2019s funny. I was talking about storms just now.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra barged through the door, panting heavily. \u201cGuys,\u201d she shouted between gaps of breath, \u201cWe\u2019re- heading- toward a- big- cyclone!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll gasped. \u201cNo way! Link was just telling me about how he could control cyclones!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I came down here. Shrunken or not you should still have some influence over that wind deity, Link.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe hero grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll try to talk to him, but I\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll, Link, and Tetra assembled with the pirates on the deck. The ship\u2019s prow was aimed at the dead center of the gigantic gray wind column. The smell of vapor mixed with seawater tickled their nostrils as cool, moist air whipped through their hair. Link, fearing for his sister\u2019s safety, told her to hand him over to Tetra. Aryll obliged and told him to be careful. As Tetra reached the bow she held the tiny hero above her head like a divine offering. \u201cHey, your name is Cyclos, right? Check it out- I\u2019ve got the Hero of Winds right here! Now knock it off and end this storm!\u201d  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nStanding on Tetra\u2019s hand-platform, Link tried to remember the Ballad of Gales. Without the Wind Waker he would have to use his hands to conduct. Down \u2026 Right\u2026 Left\u2026. Up. For a moment, nothing happened. Then Link felt the winds beneath his body grow stronger. He was pushed to the edge of the hand. \u201cUh\u2026 Tetra?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Li- EEK!\u201d The shrunken, weightless hero hovered up above Tetra\u2019s hand. She tried to grab him but he simply drifted away. Link flew away, hurtling toward the cyclone. Aryll dashed to the mast, shoving Tetra aside. \u201cBig brother!!!!\u201d <br>\r\n_ _ _<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink woke up in a warm, mysterious forest. He pushed himself to his feet, his head on a swivel as he took in the shadowy outlines of twisted trees. Looking upward he saw the dark violet sky broken up by twinkling stars. It seemed to be night, yet the color of the sky seemed off somehow. Judging by his size relative to the trees he seemed to be back at his normal height. This realization relieved him, but his comfort was interrupted when he heard a rustle. In the darkened woods sparks of red, cyan, green, and pink suddenly appeared, illuminating nearby trees. Fireflies danced between the branches and leaves like a rainbow of flashing spheres. Wind rustled the trees and sent a stream of crystalline grass and leaves past Link. He turned and saw the gust, its shining contents reflecting a trailing swarm of fireflies, hurrying off into the forest. The glittery mass revealed a pathway to Link. Wearing nothing but his underwear and lacking options, he followed the wind into the woods. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nHe was led to a grassy clearing with a large circular pond. The cyan waters glowed and rippled as a small geyser gushed at the center. Link recognized the spot. It was the interior of the Mother &amp; Child Isle, where he had received fire and ice arrows. Or at least he thought it was- the pond he remembered was surrounded by rock but this one was in a forest. Otherwise it was identical. Link approached the water, feeling warmth radiate from it. The water was naturally heated, just like on the Isle. He dipped a foot in, feeling refreshed after walking through the woods nearly naked. Link took a seat and let his ankles slide beneath the water. He almost felt like he could drift away and sleep\u2026 <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThen he heard a familiar giggle. It whisked through the trees like a wind chime.  \u201cThe Fairy Queen\u2026?\u201d Link turned around and saw that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link beheld the Fairy Queen in all her luminosity. Her silvery cyan skin shined against the ethereal darkness. Her big blank eyes were locked onto his pupils. Her short bob of hair swayed ever so slightly in the wind. A smile curled around her lips. \u201cWe meet again, little boy! How have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019ve been okay.\u201d Link had trouble making any coherent thoughts. The last thing he had expected was for the Fairy Queen to appear again, standing right behind him. Well, not standing per se. She was floating over the ground. Her flowing gown came down to her ankles. She giggled in that twinkling succession of cries that only a fairy could emit. Link\u2019s lips were straight. \u201cUh\u2026 Thanks for returning me to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMm? Normal\u2026 Oh, you think I restored you to your true size. I\u2019m afraid not. You see, in the fairy realm physical proportions are rather different from how they are in the mortal realm. In fact,\u201d she pointed at herself, \u201cthis body is just an astral projection, another one of my puppets. I hope you\u2019re happy that I chose a form you were familiar with!\u201d\t<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink hung his head low. \u201cI was really hoping I was back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid the Triforce of Power\u2019s curses are beyond my ability to dispel.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why\u2019d you bring me here,\u201d Link asked, \u201cDid you control that cyclone?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cCyclos brought you here,\u201d the smiling Queen\u2019s reply electrified the air, \u201cbut it was a favor for me. Now\u2026\u201d She giggled again as she watched Link stand up and turn to her. \u201cI brought you here so we could play a game of hide-n-go-eat!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nA worried frown formed on Link\u2019s face. \u201cWhy do I have a bad feeling about that name?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe! Because, you guessed it- the winner gets to eat the loser!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink shook his head. \u201cAfter all the eating that\u2019s been going on I should\u2019ve known that would be the catch\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is the catch, but if you manage to win\u2026 Let\u2019s just say I\u2019ll let you in on a little Triforce secret. So will you play with me, little boy?\u201d Link considered her offer. On one hand, he didn\u2019t know what kind of magic she would use to mess with him. For all he knew she would just teleport him into her stomach. On the other hand, if he won he might get some juicy info. Speaking of juicy\u2026 Link was starting to get curious of sweet a fairy girl would taste. Saliva pooled beneath his tongue. He clenched his fist. \u201cAlright. You\u2019re on!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe Queen laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll hide first! Come &amp; find me if you can!\u201d Her body was engulfed in a bright rainbow of energy before disappearing into the warm air. The cloud of energy seemed to float toward the forest. Link followed it, descending back into the bioluminescent glow. He noticed that the light from the trees and roots was colored a subtle green when earlier it had been mostly blue. As he stalked between the trees in search of the Fairy Queen he began to have second thoughts. Finding anyone in this surreal network of dense, motley flora would be a challenge. Finding the fairy deity who held domain over it would be impossible depending on her mood. Of course, if she sent a projection of herself then that probably meant she was willing to be caught. Or maybe that was how she appeared to everyone, lest she disintegrate them by the sheer energy of her presence. At any rate this was just a game to her. And if she was playing a game, she had the potential to lose. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nCrouching in a thick wall of foliage, Link was shrouded from sight. Looking across a pathway he was able to see the Queen seated next to a stream, beneath the swaying vines of a willow. She was cupping her hands together and slurping up handfuls of water. Link wondered if he could sneak across the median and successfully stuff her head into her mouth. Link had not seen how his sister managed to eat him but he assumed it was as simple as opening his mouth so wide that it exceeded its normal limits. He had no time to test his theory, though. He had to act immediately. Link stepped out of the bush and advanced silently.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink came to a stop as he stood a foot from the Fairy Queen\u2019s back. He shut his eyes. <i>I guess it\u2019s now or never,</i> he thought, his jaw unhinging past his collarbone as he lunged forth\u2026</span></div></div>",

He slowly opened his eyes and saw only the shimmering waters that the Queen had been seated in front of. <i>Huh!?</i> \u201cEhehehe,\u201d the Fairy Queen\u2019s voice whistled through the trees like the night breeze, \u201cyou didn\u2019t think it would be that easy, did you?\u201d Link staggered backward, rotating and scanning his surroundings in search of the Queen\u2019s taunting. The bioluminescent roots in the trees began to flash and change from green to white. The energy-filled veins then shifted to a glittering cyan. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now! Hehehe\u2026 You\u2019d better hide, little boy! I\u2019m quite famished!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink groaned. \u201cIt was all a trick. Now what am I gonna do?\u201d The hero\u2019s answer, for the moment, was to walk back into the woods and try to find a place to hide. The specifics did not matter as long as he was hidden. Link knew that if she wasn\u2019t playing fair then he would already be swilling in her stomach. Or perhaps it was all for her amusement, who could say? Link spotted a massive hollow log, big enough to house at least eight people. It sat dead ahead of his position, at the end of a corridor of trees. The branches hung over the pathway, casting blurred shadows over the dirt. Link began his trek toward the log. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d he figured, halfway to his destination, \u201cI just hope she doesn\u2019t- OUFF!\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nSomething heavy and covered in cloth slammed into Link\u2019s bare back. The hero tumbled over, the object pinning him to the ground. He pulled his face out of the dirt and turned to see a familiar pair of cyan eyes underlined by a mischievous smile. The Fairy Queen\u2019s delicate rear end weighed him down like a pair of squishy cannonballs. \u201cFound you!\" she squeaked. Link let his head fall back into the dirt. <i>I can\u2019t believe how easily I was caught.</i> He felt her elegant fingernails drum against his scalp. \u201cAw, chin up, little boy! I promise the inside of my body is just as beautiful as the outside!\u201d  The Queen hopped off Link\u2019s back and waved her hand in his direction. He hovered off the ground, positioned upright, floating surrounded by glowing blue energy. The Queen and Link locked eyes as she giddily rubbed her hands together. Her impatient stomach gurgled in anticipation. Link winced a little. \u201cOh, this is so exciting! But, how to enjoy my snack\u2026\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Fairy Queen stuck her fingertip between her lips. She pondered for a moment. Then her eyes lit up and her finger emerged, a rope of saliva clinging to her nail, and tapped her chin. She smiled. \u201cWell, I suppose there\u2019s nothing wrong with going down the \u2018ol hatch, huh? Hehehe!\u201d Link could barely move in the Queen\u2019s magical restraints, but she gave him enough leeway to cross his arms and pout. The Queen\u2019s smile faded a little. \u201cAwww\u2026 What\u2019s the matter? It\u2019ll be like a waterslide! And when you <i>splash</i> into the juices\u2026 Mm. I\u2019ll keep my belly nice and warm for you, little boy.\u201d Link felt himself hovering higher up. The Queen gestured downward and he suddenly flipped upside-down. Link saw the Queen\u2019s piercing cyan-green gaze, surrounded by the grass and trees sharing the same colors, seemingly looming above him. The fairy offered one last giggle. All the leaves and bushes seemed to dance with each syllable. \u201cHehehehe\u2026 Remember to squirm a little for me, okay? I love eating things that fight back!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n<i>But you don\u2019t even have to ea-</i>Link cut his thought short as the Fairy Queen\u2019s lips parted, revealing a gooey, turquoise cavern within. Her mouth, stretching and dilating in all directions, still assumed a smile throughout its transformation. Half the Queen\u2019s body was obscured by a crescent-shaped gateway into her slimy, shimmering innards. The inside of her mouth looked like an abyssal pit hiding a sky blue bonfire. Link\u2019s floating body was positioned at just the right angle to slide right inside. The Fairy Queen took advantage of this as she snapped her fingers, conveying the boy\u2019s body into her gaping maw. Her warm breath washed over him and he found himself breathing it all in. It smelled of roses and fresh soil. Link\u2019s nose wrinkled at the pleasant scent while his eyes adjusted to the alien lights inside the Fairy Queen\u2019s mouth. The flashing bioluminescent veins in her cheeks and at the back of her throat dazzled the young hero. His vision refocused just in time to catch a glimpse of her uvula above dangling the contracting muscular ring. As his head found its way past the gums, the Queen\u2019s tongue, like a serpent lying in wait, sprung to life and frenetically slathered his face and shoulders.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh,\u201d the Queen moaned, her echoing voice seemingly rising from the forest itself, \u201cYou\u2019re quite a mouthful, and such a delectable taste! But all good things must end\u2026 Bottoms up!\u201d The hero felt the magic gripping his sides vanish. Link saw the veins framing the mouth interior suddenly become streaks of light as he plummeted headfirst into the Fairy Queen\u2019s gullet. Rippling esophageal muscles caught him and slowed his descent, softly kneading his face and chest. Hot, humid air wafted all around him. He snorted out some gastric fluid he had caught in his nose. He felt his legs still kicking on the outside. The Queen\u2019s lips suckled on his hips, firmly sealed over his skin. Link wondered if he could squirm his way back up. Then a watery sound swelled around him as glowing turquoise liquid gushed down the fleshy tube. \u201cGULP!\u201d The powerful throat muscles contracted, violently squeezing his chest deeper inside.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMm-mm,\u201d Link heard the Queen\u2019s youthful voice chime around him in a sing-song tone, melodically punctuated  by the beat of her heart, \u201cJust squirm a-little, squirm a-little\u2026 It\u2019s no fun when ya don\u2019t struggle and wriggle! GUULP!\u201d Link\u2019s body plummeted deeper into the throat, closer to the ominous glowing pit that gurgled away below. He could see the faint rays of light from the luminous digestive juices peeking between the puffy throat muscles. Only his knees and ankles remained outside now. Panicked and claustrophobic, Link bent forward in the constraining flesh tunnel and thrashed, punched, and shoved against the Queen\u2019s exotic digestive system.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh-!\u201d the Queen lovingly patted the undulating bulge in her distended chest, \u201cThe struggles of a hero, fighting it out in his last moments\u2026! But I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s far too late for you now! GULP! GLUCK! GLURCH!\u201d Link felt the throat muscles resist his struggles and shove him back into position. They squeezed him again and his head popped through a tight sphincter. Now Link found himself gazing straight into the milky, shimmering pool of liquid inside the Fairy Queen\u2019s stomach. It was as though all the bioluminescence in her entire body was concentrated here. Link saw every wrinkle, contraction, and salivary rivulet in the intense illumination. Another gulp squeezed his hips through the slippery tube. Only his feet remained in the Fairy Queen\u2019s mouth. She carefully licked each salty toe and moaned in ecstasy. Link growled and wiggled his legs, trying to kick her front teeth but only bringing her more pleasure. \u201cYour struggles are almost as palatable as your flavor, but I\u2019m afraid one more gulp will pack you away for good! Au revoir, mon casse-cro\u00fbte! ULLLP!\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nA long, greedy swallow pushed Link\u2019s whole body through the esophagus in one decisive motion. The enormous bulge hanging from the Fairy Queen\u2019s neck wobbled and contracted. Her mighty muscles flexed and suddenly, the heavy, squirming form of the hero was transferred down into her tight, goopy stomach. The Queen\u2019s upper body returned to normal, but under her dress a fleshy sphere was expanding. Her bubbling cauldron of a belly swelled magnificently, tearing through the weak fabric and leaving her with half a skirt. A Link-sized ball of flesh spilled out from the Queen\u2019s abdomen, swinging pendulously as she hovered above the trees. She reached for the stars, licked her lips, and yawned. \u201cAh\u2026 How the mighty have fallen, straight into my belly that is! Ehehehehe- URP! Hey! Simmer down in there, okay?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink had yet to give up. He was curled into a ball, his knees pressed to his chest. The blue liquid swirled around his shins. He had taken to thrashing and kicking against the slimy, clingy viscera. The wrinkly walls barely budged, but he still made enough of a commotion to get the Queen\u2019s attention. \u201cHmph! If you\u2019re gonna play rough, I\u2019ll have to put you in time-out, little boy!\u201d Suddenly Link felt the organic sack tighten around him. The taut flesh held his arms and legs firmly in place, rendering him immobile. On the outside, the Queen\u2019s lithe form sported a quivering distension in the shape of a humanoid in a fetal position. She smiled discreetly, feeling as though she was pregnant with the little hero.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now that I\u2019ve had my fun\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her gut sagged against the soil as she spread her legs apart. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why your sister suddenly gained all this \u2018Power,\u2019 huh?\u201d Link adjusted his position in the shifting stomach folds. \u201cThe goddesses don\u2019t talk to us fairies too often these days.

I\u2019ve lived longer than most Hylians can fathom, but unfortunately I can\u2019t fully understand the goddesses\u2019 power.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink nodded, despite being invisible to his captress. \u201cHowever,\u201d she said, \u201cI recall Ganondorf\u2019s ascension using the Triforce of Power. As a boy he was very lonely. A stranger amongst his tribe and a stranger to the Kingdom of Hyrule. All he wanted was to have his emptiness filled. When he tried to steal the Triforce, it split into its three pieces, leaving him with only Power. A creature driven by fear, who wants nothing but to feel secure, is a creature who thirsts for Power. Power can fill emptiness.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nEverything Aryll had ever said shot through Link\u2019s mind. For the first time in quite a while, he was struck by how often she proclaimed her love for him. He realized that no other person in her life meant as much to her as he did. So, what could Aryll possibly have to fear? Link already knew the answer. \u201cIt makes me feel so selfish,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t just stay on Outset forever. I\u2019ve gained all this experience adventuring in in the world. I can\u2019t let that go to waste. I have to push into the unknown waters.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cBut Aryll\u2019s Power has not reached its limit. It still grows like a weed. And it wants to enfold you in its love\u2026 Like how my stomach softly churns you with its warmth, or how her stomach did. Why do you think you were cursed with reduced size? It made you easier to carry and engulf. It was just another extension of her wish to have you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink sighed. \u201cSo, even if I get unshrunk and leave she\u2019ll go crazy and chase after me? She\u2019ll use her powers to try and contain me? \u2026I could never fight her. I can barely process that thought.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. You simply need to satisfy her.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Link blushed. \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe Fairy Queen smiled and snickered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your sister\u2019s dreams. When you reach Forsaken Fortress and you find the Book of Magic\u2026 Don\u2019t be so hasty to use it. Offer to share a feast with your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026 Feast?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe Queen slapped her belly. \u201cYou\u2019ll see! Now, I\u2019ll be sending you on your way\u2026\u201d At that moment Link felt the blue liquid start to rise. He struggled to stay above the surface but it quickly submerged him. Immersed in the liquid-filled sack, Link lost consciousness and blacked out\u2026<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he found that he was on\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link was lying flat on a hard surface with his eyes shut. He was roused by a gust of cool, moist air. Vapor soaked his hair and wetted his skin. His eyes opened to a view of the gray, stormy sky and the foamy ocean waves. He knew he wasn\u2019t on a boat- he didn\u2019t feel the ground beneath him bobbing or swaying. Looking down he saw that the floor was made of some gray stone. His skin was not making contact with the cold ground. Raising his hand in front of his face he saw a blue sleeve covering his forearm. Apparently the Fairy Queen had re-equipped him with his casual Outset outfit. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBefore Link could wonder where he was, a sweet, warm scent blew past his head. \u201cOrder up,\u201d a mature female voice called, \u201cOne Deku Nut Cake for\u2026 Uh\u2026 Aryll?\u201d Link jumped to his feet and spun around to behold a familiar room. The Caf\u00e9 of Windfall Island- a cozy little restaurant that Link had visited to relax between dungeon crawls. Gonzo, Niko, and Tetra sat at the table on the far corner of the room. Aryll was walking up to the counter where Gillian, the blue-garbed waitress, awaited with a piping hot cake on a platter. Gillian looked as unhappy as ever, while Aryll looked more miserable than Link had ever seen.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nApparently the shrunken hero stood in the Caf\u00e9\u2019s window. Peering inside, he watched Aryll return to the table. Thanks to the blustering winds he doubted he would be audible from his current position. Aryll sat next to Tetra, who rubbed her shoulder to comfort her. Link could hear just well enough to listen in on the ensuing conversation. \u201cAryll\u2026 I\u2019m really sorry about what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nShe sniffled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know it wasn\u2019t your fault. I don\u2019t wanna blame anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou\u2019re really mature for your age, you know that? A lot of kids would be freaking out and pointing fingers, but you try to view the situation objectively.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks.\u201d Aryll peered into Tetra\u2019s eyes with a look she would give a big sister. \u201cI just hope we can find him.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWe will. Your brother\u2019s one of the toughest people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Niko agreed, \u201cI\u2019ve seen that boy take down monsters bigger than this room. A little wind ain\u2019t gonna keep him down.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nGonzo nodded without a sound. A smile slowly crossed Aryll\u2019s lips. \u201cYou guys are great friends. I bet we\u2019ll find him before tomorrow ends. Uh\u2026\u201d Aryll shivered as her hair swayed from a cool gust. She and the pirates looked to its source, identifying it as the window Link was standing in. \u201cBrr, the wind from that storm is a little chilly.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Gillian frankly remarked, \u201cI\u2019ll get the window.\u201d Before Link could protest the barista grabbed the wooden flaps surrounding the window and slammed them shut in his face. He was knocked off the window and sent plummeting toward the ground\u2026 But fortunately, the wind carried him toward a nearby tree and he landed on a branch, wrapping his arms and legs around it. Dragging himself to his feet, he saw that the Caf\u00e9 now stood at a distance. It would have been a quick walk for a normal sized-person but for him it was more like looking at Ganondorf\u2019s Tower from Hyrule Castle. \u201cI don\u2019t remember their windows having shutters,\u201d Link grumbled. The tree he stood on appeared to have been recently planted to the east of the Caf\u00e9 and Zunari\u2019s shop. It stood between the trading area and the Hall of Wealth, which Link recalled was now occupied by Maggie and her father rather than Mila and hers. Upon closer inspection, Link realized that the tree was made of Deku wood. He figured that Zunari probably imported it with rupees he made from his ridiculous auctions.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nConsidering that the tree came from Forest Haven or an island with a similar ecology, Link also realized what that meant for its leaves. He climbed to the end of the branch, which pointed southward- effectively a border marker for the two buildings the tree stood between. He spotted a lone leaf that was the size of his torso. He yanked it from its stem and held it above his head. \u201cI got the Deku Leaf! \u2026Again.\u201d Turning toward the Caf\u00e9, he waited for the wind to blow at his back to he could sail back over to it. The moment he felt the current change he hopped off the branch. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Link found himself whisked away by another gust that carried him off in the opposite direction. He clung to the leaf as he hurtled through the raindrops. Then he smacked face-first against a pane of glass. The leaf flew out of his grasp and drifted into the darkness. He slid down the side of the slickened ceramic wall until he reached a soggy stone floor. He slowly opened his eyes and beheld the blinding golden light of a chandelier. He looked away, realizing the windowsill he stood on was facing the ocean with nothing below it. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nHe then looked back into the interior of the building and saw it was decorated with posh red carpeting, ornate wooden furniture, and various paintings. The window he stood in front of was on the second floor. There was a rectangular walkway with a central opening to the first floor, and a larger lounge area with a couch toward the window. The first floor held few noteworthy sights, save for eight shiny blue vases, four on either wall. Link quickly recognized this as the Hall of Wealth, which doubled as an Auction House for economic purposes and an actual house for the Windfall nobility. He remembered that Mila and her father used to live here, before being supplanted by Maggie and hers.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLooking to his left Link spotted one of the window panes slightly opened. Left with no other choice he hurried inside, breathing a sigh of relief as the warmth washed over him. He hopped onto a table near the wall. A white doily was spread out on the surface. Link grabbed one end of it and dried himself off. He knew Maggie was a reasonably nice girl and would probably help him. The wealthy Mila who once resided in the house would probably not have given him the time of day. With her nasty attitude, she might have done something far worse. Link heard a door creak open on the left wall of the second floor. In stepped\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He remembered that dress- she was wearing it when he rescued her. She was even clutching the fluffy fan he had seen her with. Her blue crystal earrings glittered in the chandelier\u2019s light. Her corset was tied tightly around her waist, revealing her surprisingly defined curves. Her thin, piercing eyes seemed to ignore all things inelegant as she strode across the room toward the lounge area- Link\u2019s direction. Watching the posh giantess\u2019s approach, Link wondered what had happened in the time he had been away from Windfall. Hadn\u2019t Mila and her father slipped into poverty?<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nUnsure of what to think, Link darted behind a row of ornate plates as Mila reached the couch and took a seat. She stretched her arms as her mouth slowly opened into a black oval. \u201cYaawwwwwn. I forgot how busy my life could be when I lived here. But I guess having three meals and a warm bed is a fair trade for learning\u2026 well\u2026 trade.\u201d She picked up a teapot set on the table, shaking it and frowning when she realized it was empty. \u201cAnd to think that Zunari just has to have those auctions each and every night. With those pirates about it\u2019s sure to be noisier than ever. If he wasn\u2019t the key to this island\u2019s economic stability I\u2019d bet my father would ballot for his banishment. He can be such a pain\u2026 Hm?\u201d Her eyes were suddenly drawn toward the window. \u201cWhat\u2019s that reflection?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink staggered backward. He turned around and saw a mirror image of himself in the clear glass, courtesy of the powerful chandelier light. He also saw the giantess\u2019s reflection standing up and growing massively as she approached him. \u201cIs that\u2026 It looks just like a person\u2026 But that can\u2019t be possible. Hm? He even looks kind of like that one boy I once knew\u2026\u201d As Mila\u2019s slender fingers hovered over the plate descended upon Link, he darted away from their careful grasp. \u201cHey! It moved!\u201d Mila\u2019s hand dexterously swooped in and snatched Link just as he neared the table\u2019s edge. She brought him before her icy stare and examined him closely. \u201cThis is impossible\u2026 I\u2019ve seen you before, when I was poor. How did you get so small? And what kind of tailor made such tiny clothing?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cEr, it\u2019s a long story,\u201d Link said, awkwardly moving his arms in his soggy outfit, \u201cSo, I see you and your dad got the place back.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHm, yes, it was truly only a matter of time before that idiotic father of Maggie\u2019s spent all his earnings. With the power vacuum he created my father &amp; I were quick to reclaim our place. What an odd old man\u2026 Though I must admit, Maggie makes for some delightful conversation.\u201d Link was confused. He remembered Mila\u2019s sass when she worked at Zunari\u2019s shop (and tried to steal from it). He had never had a conversation with her formal side. \u201cYour name was Link, was it not?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYup, an Ally of Justice, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. But you still haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. It sounds crazy, but my sister acquired some magical powers and she accidentally shrunk me. I ended up here because I was captured by the fairy queen, but when she warped me here I got caught on a current of wind. That\u2019s how I ended up in here.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila arched an eyebrow. \u201cLink, I\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Trust me it\u2019s true!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila chuckled. \u201cI am impressed that you were able to create such an elaborate story, but it is meaningless. It\u2019s obvious you concocted a way to shrink yourself so you could sneak in here and steal from us. I long suspected you were one of the parasites who claim to be virtuous, but in the end you only serve yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cBut I saved you!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cFor the reward, obviously.

Did you really think he wouldn\u2019t notice that his safe was missing hundreds of rupees?\u201d She tightened her grip around Link. He coughed as the air left his lungs. \u201cAnd can you guess who was blamed for that?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink struggled to respond under the pressure of the godlike girl\u2019s grip. \u201cI- didn\u2019t- do- it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of your lies, Link. You really are just another parasite who sucks at our underbelly, unable to appreciate the elegance and beauty of what we\u2019ve built. And the only way to deal with a parasite\u2026\u201d Mila began walking, with Link held to her hip. He saw she was heading for a red door that he had not noticed before. She pushed it open with the fist around his body, apparently valuing her fan more than his comfort. Link had a new appreciation for Aryll\u2019s gentleness. Behind the door sat a massive, red-sheeted bed, large enough for four people but designed for one. \u201c\u2026is to exterminate it.\u201d She brought him before her imposing visage again. \u201cWhich means I\u2026 Get to have some fun.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink shuddered to think what cruel things she could have in store. \u201cCan\u2019t we talk about this?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, little spy. Although,\u201d she sniffed at him, \u201cyou smell of dirt and rain. I must rectify this.\u201d Mila took Link into a washroom through a door that was connected to her bedroom. She dipped him into a water basin and quickly scrubbed away the dirt and grime he was covered in. Mila then brought him back into the bedroom and stood next to the bed. She held him before her face. He was stark naked in one hand, while his clothes sagged pathetically in the other. \u201cBut why,\u201d Link asked, \u201cwhy even clean me?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila licked her lips. \u201cBecause my way of disposing of you will involve some rather intimate contact.\u201d Link heard a low groan behind Mila\u2019s corset. \u201cBut how, exactly, will I go about this\u2026?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It bothered my parents quite a bit, especially when they found out where they were ending up\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink scoffed. \u201cWhat, down your throat, into your stomach? Whatever, I\u2019ve been eaten plenty of times now.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila winked and giggled behind her fan. \u201cHahahaha\u2026 Yes, many of those toys did find their way into my stomach. But the way they got there was rather interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cAs a girl I stumbled into a book on the practices of survivalists. Some took to storing items inside their bodies, using every little orifice. The thought excited me for reasons I couldn\u2019t explain. Before long, I was pushing larger and larger objects into my rectum, allowing my intestines to suck them deeper inside of me. You will be my first live subject.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink felt his whole body turn to ice. She couldn\u2019t be serious\u2026 Could she? Mila set her fan down on the nightstand by her bedside, revealing her sadistic grin. \u201cW-wait,\u201d the boy stammered, \u201cCan\u2019t we talk about this!?\u201d  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila\u2019s pupils expanded. Her heart pounded. \u201cOh\u2026 You\u2019re pleading. I always pretended that my dolls were squirming in my grasp, fighting to escape my body. And now I have you\u2026 Your fear is real\u2026 Your struggles will be real\u2026 Mmmgh. This is going to feel so GOOD.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMila, please,\u201d Link wrestled against her thumb, trying to push himself out of her grasp, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to be shoved up someone\u2019s butt!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, don\u2019t worry, little thief\u2026 I keep my anus as clean and refined as the rest of my immaculate, feminine form.\u201d With her open hand Mila reached behind herself and pulled up her skirt. She fiddled with her panties too loosen them up. \u201cNow\u2026 I will engulf you!\u201d Mila brought Link around, gripping him tightly. He saw the arch in Mila\u2019s skirt, which was held up by her arm, hovering over a dark abyss. The shadowy outline of her white lacy panties was just barely visible. Her fingers clutched the waistband and held it open, eagerly awaiting Link\u2019s arrival. The hero saw the darkness growing before him. He was being carried inside. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Link protested as he passed under the wrinkled fringe of the skirt, \u201cMila, please!\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHmph,\u201d the rich girl pouted, \u201cI will always get what I want. The big devour the small, and I choose to devour you with my derriere.\u201d With that Mila dumped Link into her panties and released the waistband. The boy was snapped back into place, sealed tightly between cotton and flesh. Mila shuddered as she felt his tiny arms and legs wriggle against her soft butt cheek. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she released her dress and allowed it to fall back to the floor, \u201cWiggle all you can, but escape is impossible.\u201d Link heard her and began wriggling his whole body. He wormed his way through the amorphous flesh mound in hopes of reaching the upper waistband. \u201cHahahaha,\u201d Mila haughtily chuckled, \u201cDo you think it\u2019ll be that easy to escape your punishment?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink had just laid his hands on the firm band as he felt his young dominatrix begin to move. Mila sauntered over to her bed, sassily swaying her hips. She turned and plopped her butt into the mattress. Link\u2019s progress stopped. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d Mila taunted, \u201cexcept deeper into me~\u201d Link squirmed and kicked, but he was held firmly by the weight of the snobby girl\u2019s butt. Smooshed into a tighter space, the heat was intensifying. Sweat beads slid out of Mila\u2019s pores and dripped over Link\u2019s body. He began to sweat as well, adding to the salty mixture. The rank stench wafting from the anus was beginning to circulate. Link had hoped that a prim girl\u2019s anus might smell a bit better than the average butt, yet if anything her arrogance made any part of her not saturated in perfume stink even worse.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nHe felt the crushing pressure lessen. The waistband was lifted. Link looked up. Seeing a few rays of light enter his smelly prison filled him with hope. That hope was dashed when he saw a trio of elegant fingers form an ominous silhouette as they descended upon him. Link was pushed back into the valley of curved flesh. No matter how hard he thrashed and squirmed he could not slow his descent. All his struggles yielded were more sweat beads, which further lubricated his journey, and pleased moans from Mila. Link\u2019s surroundings grew darker, damper, toastier, and smellier as he slipped into Mila\u2019s buttcrack. Her fingers prodded him into the moist abyss, a wrinkly canyon of delicate flesh. Link\u2019s struggles became increasingly aimless as the noble girl\u2019s cheeks enfolded him.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe shrunken hero felt himself pressed against a tight, slimy puckering of dense muscle. The sphincter, reeking of sweat and oozing slimy waste, dilated open to accept him. He fought away from the rectal opening, but Mila battered him around with her fingers until his body was suspended over the humid pit. \u201cMila- *cough* this is disgusting! Let me out of here!\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm\u2026 No, this feels so good\u2026\u201d  Mila gave a forceful push and Link\u2019s head popped through her firm, pulsating rectum. His torso slowly slid into the dark, hot tunnel. The slimy tube wrapped around him, forming an airtight seal around his midsection. He whipped and wriggled against the frictionless flesh. Mila\u2019s fingers kept prodding him along until his legs vanished into her crack. As her anus closed around Link\u2019s feet she removed her fingers and allowed her dress to fall to the floor. She shivered and moaned. By contracting her rectum and flexing her buttocks, she began working Link into her large intestine. She felt him punching and kicking her from within, yet every strike was absorbed by her elastic muscle. His struggles were such a wonderful sensation after years of \u201cabsorbing\u201d inanimate objects. Every intestinal undulation drew him deeper into the steaming depths .The further he was drawn the more frantic he became.   <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nLink was lost in Mila\u2019s intestinal labyrinth. None of his struggles slowed his progress into the smelly wet blackness. He had rounded so many corners in the pulsating tube that he was no longer sure of his position in the rich girl\u2019s body. Abruptly he was squeezed from the tight, sweltering tunnel through an even tighter visceral packet. The contractions became more violent, moving him faster than before. Wiggling flesh strands lined the walls, flicking him along and hastening his journey further. Link had stopped struggling as moving his limbs had become impossible. The firm, damp walls restricted any movement. He hurtled through the twisting and turning tubes, faster and faster, tighter and tighter, until the pressure suddenly released. He was spat into an enormous empty chamber. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAs Link was being transferred through Mila\u2019s intestinal tract, she had been removing her complicated pink dress. Mila now stood barefoot in her milky white nightgown. She smiled and shuddered as she felt the tiny body squirm its way into her stomach folds. She then held up his blue shirt and orange pants. In the process of washing Link, she had ended up washing his clothing as well. \u201cHmph. I suppose I owe him some modicum of kindness.\u201d Without another word Mila popped Link\u2019s clothes into her mouth and gulped them down. She poked her belly and chuckled. \u201cThere you go, \u2018hero.\u2019 One last act of mercy from your better.\u201d She reached to the ceiling and yawned, hoping for a good night\u2019s sleep with  the pleasurable movements of the thief inside her\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c\u2026BEGIN!\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila was just about to relax in bed and drift off to sleep, only for a familiar grating voice to tear her from her slumber. \u201cZunari,\u201d she snarled, slowly dragging herself out of bed to give that annoying merchant a piece of her mind. She stomped toward her door. Each heavy step created a tremor inside the girl\u2019s body. Link tumbled around the slimy walls with every quake. He heard her voice when she cursed the name of Windfall\u2019s infamous merchant. Her anger seemed to result from a breaking of intimacy. Link didn\u2019t know much about the inner machinations of women\u2019s minds, but he knew that what came next would not be pretty. By now he was quite familiar with the internal structure of women\u2019s stomachs, however. He had even managed to enter one from the exit. He wasn\u2019t sure if that was something to be proud of.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe raging rich girl slammed her door open. The moment her door smacked against the wall the sounds of conversation on the lower floor vanished. \u201cZUNARI! I am trying to sleep!\u201d She peered over the railing and saw everyone looking up at her. There were the usual Windfall suspects, from Linda to Garrickson to Gummy. And then there were two blonde-haired girls who Mila recognized. The older one was more of a mystery- a pirate, one who had assisted Link in rescuing her. For the money, obviously... though she supposed that it was nice of Link to help her. But then there was the younger one in the maroon-colored skull dress. That one was from her imprisonment. What was her name\u2026? She didn\u2019t talk about much besides her \u201cbig brother,\u201d whoever that was. Mila vaguely remembered the girl describing her brother, but\u2026 That had been nearly a year, and she really didn\u2019t care. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u2026Come to think of it, that specific shade of yellow was quite similar to Link\u2019s. And when Link appeared alongside the pirates, rescuing them before taking the rest of her father\u2019s money, what was it that the younger one cried? Mila felt the sudden urge to slap herself in the face. \u201cWait,\u201d she called, \u201cisn\u2019t your name Aryll?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nDeep inside Mila\u2019s bowels, Link\u2019s ears perked up when he heard his sister\u2019s name reverberate through the sweltering chamber. He sat with his back to a slickened wall. He had laid his Outset clothes out in front of himself. Putting them back on wouldn\u2019t make much sense in here, with the heat and stickiness. He could survive the inside of an active volcano with the Triforce of Courage, so a snooty girl\u2019s guts were certainly doable. But survival was one thing, Link wanted to escape. Striking Mila\u2019s stomach folds without weapons would probably only tickle her, so Link didn\u2019t even bother. His options seemed limited. He tried to think of where Mila could be, and based on \u201cZunari\u201d and \u201cAryll,\u201d the only possibility seemed to be the auction room.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cZunari,\u201d Link thought to himself. He remembered trading with him for several pieces of useful gear, but what of it could help him now? \u201cWait,\u201d Link realized, \u201cthe Magic Armor!\u201d Link recalled one of the few items he hadn\u2019t needed to physically wield. As a reward Zunari granted him a diamond-shaped artifact. When he touched it he gained the power to manifest a protective coating of volatile purple energy. The actual item was not needed to activate the armor. Link knew he had more than enough magic energy to do it. Striking Mila\u2019s gastric viscera with an electrified layer coating his skin would get her attention, if nothing else.  <br>\r\n \t<br>\r\nBack outside, Aryll\u2019s eyebrows rose as she heard her name called by such a luxurious, important-looking girl. Wracked with nerves, she bowed. \u201cUm, yes, I am Aryll,\u201d the young girl stammered, \u201cI, um, apologize, if we were too loud. I was just looking for my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila\u2019s face turned white.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra nodded. \u201cYeah, we heard from that depressed guy on the steps that a \u201ctiny blue fairy\u201d flew into this house. We were just gonna ask Zunari if he had heard anything about it. Have you seen any \u2018tiny blue fairies\u2019 lately?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila fidgeted with her hands. \u201cUm\u2026 Ah!\u201d The girl suddenly cringed. A burning feeling erupted within her abdomen. It was centered on her bellybutton. It stung periodically, slowly rising in temperature, becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Mila clutched her stomach. A low groan rose up within her. Her stomach swelled, inflating with some kind of warm energy. She bit her lip. The heat made her belly feel like a bubbling stewpot. And like any stewpot, steam rose from it and flowed through the chimney- her esophagus. A packet of hot air slithered its way up her throat. It made a small bulge on her neck that displayed its journey.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHurk.\u201d Mila shut her maw as tightly as possible.  </span></div></div>",

But the pressure built tighter\u2026 tighter\u2026 Until her maw flung open and released an enormous \u201cBURRRAP!\u201d that echoed dissonantly through the auction hall. Mila fell to her knees and coughed. Tears fell from her eyes. \u201cThat\u2026 hurt! \u2026Ow\u2026\u201d Mila wanted to curse Link for his impudence. But a more pressing matter was right before her eyes. The blue shirt and orange pants once belonging to the hero were gently drifting past the railing. The wealthy girl could only watch as the clothes drifted gently down. Her heart sank as she watched Aryll reach up and grab the falling articles. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTetra looked upon the tiny clothing in shock. \u201cHey\u2026 Isn\u2019t that Link\u2019s\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll was shaking. She stared blankly at the saliva-drenched shirt and pants in her hands. \u201cWh-what happened\u2026 to my big brother?\u201d She peered upward. Mila was visibly alarmed. \u201cYou,\u201d Aryll pointed, frowning, \u201cyou ate my big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUm, w-well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll\u2019s hands became fists. \u201cGive him back.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll grit her teeth. Her hair began to rustle, as though a slight gust was blowing on it. A deep red energy began emanating from her skin. \u201cI said give him back!\u201d Aryll vanished in an explosion of red smoke and lightning. Everyone in the auction house, save for Tetra, screamed and scattered. In no time at all an identical explosion flared up on the second floor, directly in front of Mila. Aryll\u2019s skull dress billowed in the crimson cloud. Mila staggered backwards, reaching for her bedroom door. \u201cUm\u2026 As exciting as this night has been, I have to go!\u201d Mila swung the door open and dashed through, hoping she could reach her family\u2019s provisional exit before Aryll caught up with her.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d the hero\u2019s sister growled, \u201cCome back here!\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila slammed her door shut and locked it in pure desperation. She backed away and began searching for the lever that would raise her bed and reveal a trapdoor. \u201cWhere did they leave that thing,\u201d she muttered as she tried to push her dresser. She stopped as she heard a deep rumble, like thunder, directly behind her door. A wave of red energy blew the door right off its hinges. It fell over like a tree, landing with a thud. Mila saw Aryll standing in the doorway. She shivered in abject terror. The young girl began inching toward her. Mila looked at the fallen door and pointed. \u201cUm, you\u2019re gonna have to pay for that!\u201d Aryll continued moving. Mila skittered away, her back against the wall. \u201cP-please don\u2019t kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAryll froze. She cocked her head, then her blank expression began to curl into a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna kill anyone. I just want my brother back,\u201d she raised her hand, which glowed with red sparks, and formed a fist, \u201cso give him back!\u201d Aryll lunged forth and punched Mila right in her gut. The wealthy girl gagged, spitting all over the floor. She fell forward and landed flat on her face with a dull thud. Aryll slowly walked around the fallen girl, standing off to her left. Mila turned her head in Aryll\u2019s direction and heaved. A bulge shot up her throat, leaving her mouth as a ball of saliva containing Link. He slid out of her cheek and rolled out onto the floor. \u201cOw,\u201d Mila groaned, \u201cI could have thrown him up my\u2026 ouff\u2026 self\u2026\u201d Aryll quickly kneeled down and picked Link up. She formed a bowl with her hands and allowed him to slide down into the dip. He quickly sat up and wiped the fluids off his face. Aryll\u2019s eyes lit up.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cBig brother, you\u2019re okay! You\u2019re, huh,\u201d Aryll sniffed at the air, \u201cyou kind of stink\u2026 What happened?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I\u2019d rather not talk about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine! Give me a sec.\u201d Red electricity coursed through her hands. A sphere of energy enveloped Link. Its powerful warmth caused his hair to stand on end. Then it vanished and left him warm and clean. He held up his arms and marveled at how spotless he had become after being shoved up Mila\u2019s ass. \u201cThanks Aryll. Your powers have really gotten stronger, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYup,\u201d Aryll giggled. She then noticed that Mila was no longer in front of her. Turning to her left she saw that the wealthy girl had begun crawling away. \u201cI think that mean girl deserves a little more punishment, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMila froze. Her head turned back, her eyes bulging in terror. \u201cUm,\u201d Link wondered. Despite being inserted into her anus he didn\u2019t want to hurt Mila too badly. He also wouldn\u2019t be able to stop her if she chose to take an unpleasant revenge. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Just don\u2019t go too crazy, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Aryll said, not really listening to her brother. She thought of how Mila could be punished, ultimately settling on\u2026</span></div></div>",

But for some reason he kept coming back to Colin, who had recently taken a job at the local bakers and was giving off the wonderful scent of baked bread mixed with little boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided, Colin would be Link\u2019s first meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you trying to show us Link?\u201d the boy asked as Link moved closer towards him, becoming a little nervous as he looked at the wolf\u2019s hungry eyes. He couldn\u2019t help but be a little scared around the animal, even though he knew Link would never hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow wrong he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf pounced on Colin, knocking the boy to the floor and trapping him beneath his thick muscle. \u201cI think he wants to fight you\u201d Talo laughed, although he quickly shut up as Link opened his jaws wide and spread them over Colin\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing the boy ever saw was the moist pinkness of the wolf\u2019s mouth before it encased him in darkness. \u201cWait, Link!\u201d he cried out, barely audible over the loud suckling and growling sounds of the predator as it tasted him. His nostrils filled with hot wolf breath and his eyes with saliva as the wolf pulled him in further and further towards the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink\u2019s eyes closed for a moment as he took in the boy\u2019s delicious taste and scent, drool leaking from the sides of his mouth and splashing on the ground below. Colin already had a delicious human flavour and smell which was wonderfully complimented by his recent baking job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf quickly bolted down the rest of his meal, past the boy\u2019s rump and up to his kicking feet. Link used his forepaws to remove Colin\u2019s shoes and socks, he wouldn\u2019t need them where he was going. The wolf\u2019s tongue coiled out and curled around the bare feet, tasting them one last time before Link raised his head to heavens and swallowed down the last of his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin spilled into the tight stomach, coughing as his lungs and nostrils filled with hot, rancid air. \u201cPlease Link, let me out\u201d he cried, pushing against the squishy wolf innards, but Link wasn\u2019t listening. He was too busy licking his chops for the last remnants of Colin\u2019s exquisite flavour and listening to the boy\u2019s futile begging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Link was devouring Colin the other children had run up the stairs and were banging on the door, \u201cplease help us\u201d they cried \u201cLink\u2019s gone insane!\u201d but no one could hear them from the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nuzzled his huge stomach, the little boy wriggling feebly within, and looked at the other children. Colin was nice, but now it was time for the next course of his meal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does he go for next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
