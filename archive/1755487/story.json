        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello to you, reader! Welcome to the interactive story taking place in the realm of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The place where you can do what you want, when you want, and the world will wait for you. Now, before you enter, there are only a few rules that I will lay down:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) D0 n0t tlk txt. It's a pain in the ass to read. If you're going to write a chapter, write it with the anticipation that people who don't read in texting format are going to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Keep it fairly clean. I do not need images of graphically described sex clotting up my brain, because yes, I will read every addition made. It's an efficient way of moderating, and making sure people at least try to adhere to these guidelines. In short, yes, you can say two characters had sex, but don't go into detail too much.  Besides, implied leaves so much more to the imagination. ^-^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Use spell-check, please, and try to make it coherant. And on a related note, pay attention to prior chapters. Discrepancies aren't fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Fetishes are allowed TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. Examples of things not permitted: Rape, sex involving minors (under 18), I don't think I need to go on, so I'll express it this way, if there's a law against it (that I'm aware of) then do not put it in the story. Exceptions MIGHT be made, but contact me first, and wait for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with that out of the way, I will add one final word of warning; violate those rules, and your chapter will be deleted, without exception. I know, it probably seems like I'm being a stick in the mud about this, but I like a story to be well written, and I'm sure plenty of you out there do too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before I forget, lore-friendly mods to Oblivion can be used in the story. If you want to look for some, I'd recommend www.tesnexus.com .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that aside, come on in, have fun, please add a chapter, and help make this a wonderful experience for everyone.</td>",
