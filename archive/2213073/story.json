To celebrate this long holiday, I decided to go on an InterRail trip with a few friends of mine! Allow me to introduce you to:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRose, Sam and Hadley!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese girls have been my best (and only) friends for the past year or so. Unfortunately I'm not that good in making new friends unless someone else takes the initiative, which these girls did, and how! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short; we bonded over our shared talent, that we alone possess (as far as we know).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat can we do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Morph into who and what we like, changing clothes and reality alike. Disadvantage is that we have to have touched the person or thing once before in our lives. Although if we touch a person that is wearing something we haven't touched before we can still change into that, or have it change with us.<br>\r\n2. Swap bodies with whoever we like, as long as we can see that person.</span></div></div>",

To be honest, this comes as a shock to me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we got the tickets ready, and the bags packed, so let's get on our way!\" as said by none other than <i>the</i> Rose herself in the group call we made just a minute ago. As we all agree with Rose we decided that Rose and I will drive with my parents to the railway station. From what I hear in the background is the same thing happening to Sam and Hadley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I threw my bag in the trunk of my parents' car Rose arrives, on foot, followed by a large hiking bag. (Not that my bag was that much smaller, but hey, you got to make the joke about girls taking so much stuff with them when they are carrying a hiking bag that is a good 30cm taller than her head).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had the tents for us four right?\" asked Rose me, after which I hit myself on the head (how could I forget right!) and ran upstairs to the attic, where I quickly grabbed two two-person pop up tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this quick disruption we did a last check of passports, a visa for the UK and enough money to last us the entire month we're gone (but let's be honest, we've all saved a small bit that we didn't tell the others, because we're going to have fun, but do need food every now and then). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn our way we started the first vlog that we're making, and will be sending them to William so he can edit and upload them to our YouTube channel, where we hope that a few weeks in the trip we'll be making enough out of ad revenue to give William some money for his service, and of course to party harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we were making the vlog we arrived at the station, and with a hug and kiss from mom (of course I'll call you when I'm able, aka not) we put the way too large backpacks on our shoulders and went on our search for the other two of our travel party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of standing around (and calling multiple times, duh) we entered the tunnel to the platforms, and guess who we saw?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, you're wrong, we didn't see them coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sneaked upon us. Now it does make me wonder how the two of us missed two neon coloured hiking bags, but hey (Hadley's was neon green, while Sam's was neon pink), we both have pretty bad eyes. At least I'm not stubborn enough to refuse to wear glasses (although Rose did bring them; for a change). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we entered through the gates with our InterRail passes we were wondering where we'd actually start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that's right, we didn't plan ANYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly thing we know is that we needed to get out of the country before 4am tomorrow morning, since the passes are only valid in your own country for the outbound and inbound journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, time for some fun choices, where are we off to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When we saw the departure board, we planned on going to Germany, and maybe explore Scandinavia (did have the perks of free stay in the wild). But, of course, knowing our luck, that train to Arnhem was cancelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go to London,\" suggested Hadley, and Rose, Sam and I quickly agreed. <br>\r\nOff we went, platform 4, IC to Rotterdam Centraal. We did allow ourselves a bit of luxury and saved that extra \u20ac100 for first class tickets, so we went in a luxurious 4 seater, with enough space to NOT sit on top of each other (man we were lucky we learned at the next stop, as \"cattle\" class filled up and even here, in the top 1%, there was no more seating available. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my duty to reserve the seats for the Eurostar (\u20ac30 per person!), but that was quickly paid back after I've got the tickets. With one hour left on the train to Rotterdam we decided to make some more footage for the vlogs, and with a pack of UNO suddenly appearing (definitely not from my bag or anything), the time flew. After not much time we arrived in Rotterdam, and headed for the Eurostar terminal so we could have our visas checked, and bags searched. &lt;Tom wanted to put another Brexit bad, EU good rant in here, but I changed his mind. xx Rose&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily we were one of the first who arrived here since the queue started to get longer and longer. As we looked out of the window we saw the border police close off the platform, and searched for any sneaky lifters who really want to get into the UK. It didn't take long before the green light was given and we were allowed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with that perfect timing, the 400-metre long train almost glided into the station, ready to bring us to another country, passing through two others. Now, since we weren't in \"cattle\" class we went to the front of the train, boarded and found out that I actually did book a 4 seater with a table in between! Quickly making some more footage for the vlog we sat down and talked, while Rose (who's English is the best by the way) called a youth hostel in London to see if they had space for four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out they did, so with that fixed Hadley took a board game of Risk on the table, and next to the few glances out of the window at Lille (we have to remember to visit that later!) we played for the whole journey. Of course did Sam beat all of our asses, but yeah, she's the pro in this game. We finished the game (after a quick complementary lunch on the train) just as we passed Ebbsfleet International. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we enjoyed the sights of London from the train we quickly raced into the beautiful station of St. Pancras International. Of course I had to ruin the mood by asking if anyone thought of taking some pounds with them (which I did by the way) or an Oyster card if they had one, since our InterRail passes aren't valid on the Tube or buses (but they are on the London Overground). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enjoying a few seconds of pure panic I showed them four Oyster cards we had at home that we got a few years ago when we were in London. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Rose booked, she leads the way to the youth hostel, where we met a very nice lady who helped us with the locking of our lockers in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice room actually! With a grand view of Covent Garden, and the best theatres of the world right around the corner. My applause Rose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we put our stuff away we had to decide on what to do. I want to go out in the city (use morphing powers) while Hadley wants to go shopping (possible using of morphing powers) and Rose wants to go to a theatre \"In my defence, I heard they do a Frozen musical here!\"</span></div></div>",

She's in Croatia now, so a very small chance we'll meet her here.\"<br>\r\n\"And I've known her for a while, there is no snowball chance in hell she'll go out on her own in a city far from home!\" as said by Sam.<br>\r\n\"Well then, any preferences for how I dress? Should I go with a dress, or just jeans and a tank top?\"<br>\r\n\"I think that a dress would be nice! You remember that black one I was wearing on the graduation ceremony? I'd like it if you're wearing that tonight,\" said Hadley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while preparing ourselves we decided that it's time to go to a club and enjoy life here for a while.</span></div></div>",

The first was that I am naked, the second that the person I'm in bed with is so too, and the third is that his dick is in my vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and he's still asleep. Maybe now is a good time to tell that I could actually sense that it's one of us underneath that layer of skin (we have this weird thing where our \"magic\" can recognise if we're touching, although it doesn't tell who's who). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that person was still asleep, and probably just as hung over as I am right now I decided to get out, get together my clothes and maybe change back first, and then get breakfast for all of us, or just go out in this body again, still to get breakfast for all of us. Of course, I also have the option to just wake the others up and we could get breakfast together, but what's the fun in that right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally made my choice, to not change back just yet, but to wake the others up right away. The <u>fun</u> way <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after I wet some towels with ice cold water I first pressed it in the face of the person I slept with (most likely Rose now that I think of it), who kept pretty silent, but did send me death glares... oops?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing the same to Hadley and Sam we went and got breakfast.

I shouted to the rest of our little group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring breakfast the real question arose, what were we planning on doing today, and tomorrow.<br>\r\nWe could go to Cambridge, Sam suggested<br>\r\nGood one! But what about staying in London for the day and taking the Caledonian Sleeper to Scotland tonight, as suggested by me.<br>\r\nSorry Sam, but Tom's idea sounds a lot cooler than Cambridge. Also, gives us the time to explore London for a bit today, Hadley said.<br>\r\nScotland sounds cool indeed! But I do want a real bed on that sleeper! Not in a chair or something! Rose stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom searched on his phone for a bit he found the perfect thing. Two Club twin rooms, with showers, food and drinks included for 400 British Pound Sterling, to Fort William on the Caledonian Sleeper leaving London Euston at 20:57, although we can board from 20:15, and only have to leave by 10am. where we then are allowed to go on a hike through the Scottish Highlands and put our tent down to sleep there free of charge. If we just quickly stock up on some food before we leave, I do have a camping pit with me for a \"proper\"cooking stand, and a single pan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
