And despite her size she can outrun anyone except Blondie, and outmuscle anyone except for Addy (Although ALL the girls on this team can outmuscle you... you have superpowers tho, so it doesn't bug you in the least) Her favorite thing to call you when you point out something obvious or say something stupid is \"Dipshit or Dumbfuck\" Which is degrading, but you're the submissive type so it's not all bad. Also, she doesn't seem like it, but when she's not teleporting around, skateboarding is, in her own words, her LIFE! Your nickname for her is Smiley cause she almost never smiles and it annoys her.

Can also absorb substances, however if she for example absorbs a liquid, she can use it grow or change her appearance. However, if she for example pees, anything she changed will return to normal. Shanna has developed chemicals that Amber can take to stay changed for a few days. She has no need to eat or drink because she absorbs nutrients through touch, that doesn't mean that she doesn't like food though, in fact, she can pig out all she wants and never get fat due to her powers. It is unkown if she can completely absorb a person, essentially \"killing\" them, if she could she wouldn't anyway.

Dont you ever get sick of the taste? Nope. Are you gonna save some for the rest of us? Maybe. Here, you can have this. She scoops some out and holds the spoon out. As you walk over, she flips the spoon, dropping the icecream on her bare feet. You watch as it absorbs into her feet. It causes them to grow a couple sizes, being at about a 9 now instead of their normal 7. You always did say my feet were too small. I never said that, I just prefer like a 9 or 10 rather than say a 5. Addy's bitchness isn't the only reason I dont bug her about her feet that much. Well, in addition to their new size, my feet took on a... characteristic of this icecream. Like? Why dont you come over and take a lick. Being lazy, you teleport over to Amber in an already sitting position. She raises her feet to your face. You immediately notice that they smell a bit creamy. Almost like a Zombie, you begin subconsciously licking her feet, savoring the vanilla taste. All the while she's absorbing your saliva to keep her feet dry. Good thing her powers aren't automatic, or you'd have quite a big problem to deal with. Good little foot monkey, she says as she pets you on the head. Normally something like that would offend you, but when Amber says it, it just turns you on. She's at least more creative than \"Footboy\" or something along those lines. DJ. Mmm... yes Amber? Will you sleep with me? What?! No no. Not like that, I mean like a sleepover in my room type thing. You know, with your own sleeping bag? I can do that. Cmon foot monkey, follow me. I know where your room is. Shanna has everyones' names lasered on the doors.<br>\r\n<u>Casa de Snickers aka Amber's Room</u><br>\r\nOk, here's yours. She tosses you a rolled up sleeping bag. Amber could I erm... Sure. What?! That?! Now?! Mhmm, I do quite love the way that certain substance feels as I absorb it. All the pleasure of sex with none of the risks. I love my powers! Ok then. Since you cant sleep without whacking off first, drop pants. Can I at least sit down... She pushes you onto her bed and pulls your pajama pants down with her toes. She then reaches for your boxers...</span></div></div>",

Shortly after you feel Amber's soft feet on your face, which you cant help but lick. She then quickly pulls them away from you. You have to get up if you want some more. Fine. The misson warning klaxon goes off, and you all rush to the briefing room. You: What's the problem Shanna? Shanna: Well... a family member of one of our very own is causing trouble... Addy: It's her isn't it. Shanna: Afraid so. Addy: Then I'll enjoy kicking her ass that much more... Catie: Family issues Addy? Addy: Let's just say she wasn't so nice when I was a kid... Shanna looks at S.I.M.O.N.'s screen. Shanna: What the... I've never seen an energy signature like this before... You: We'll be fine. Everyone suit up and roll out! Autobots transform! Shanna: And I'm the geek...<br>\r\n<u>The Site of the Disturbance</u><br>\r\nAmber: Hey guys. Check out this cute little octopus I found! Shanna: Where? Amber: A pet store. Duh. And now I can do this! Her arms turn into octopus tentacles. You: That's very nice Amber... Get down! Amber: Wha- Gah! Amber get's hit with a bright blast of energy. Every looks over and see's that the source is... Deathwatch? You: Since when do you have powers Deathwatch? ???: Deathwatch... Deathwatch... Sounds familiar... You must be referring to my little sister, I am known as Overkill. Shanna: Why? Overkill: Three... Two... One... Amber: What the? Amber's feet absorb her boots and she starts absorbing pavement through the soles of her feet, slowly growing taller in the process. Shanna: Since when can you absorb anything inorganic? Amber: I cant! And my powers wont shut off! Malice Alice: That's my cue! Addy's sister flips over Amber and briefly touches her face mid-flip. Amber stops absorbing pavement. Addy: Oh no! All: What? Addy: My sister's powers. Anyone she touches turns permanately evil! Shanna: What? How? Then why are you... Addy: I'm her sister, I was around her so much when I was little that a little of her rubbed off on me. Shanna: Meaning? Addy: Well I wasn't born a bitch... You: That actually explains alot... Wait, if Amber's evil and out of control... You all hear a random scream as Amber lassos a woman with her tentacles and absorbs her, taking on her physical characteristics, selecting only the best ones, making herself overall hotter. Her neck length blonde hair now has brown streaks in it and is shoulder length, she grows from 5'1 to about 5'6, her boobs grow from an A to a C cup, and her hips widen slightly, giving her a more hourglass shape. Her facial features rearrange from cute to downright sexy, and she smiles evilly. Amber: Ha ha... Ha ha ha... Mwahahahaha! Alex: Everybody behind me! Alex puts up a force field as Amber's tentacles are about to get you all. Amber looks slightly confused then pissed as she starts beating on the forcefield, making an audible crackling sound with each hit from her tentacles. Alex: It should hold, as long as she cant absorb psychic energy... Amber focuses and slams both of her tentacles into the force field. They slowly penetrate through. You: Run! Everyone on your team retreats into the jet just before Amber's tentacles breach the field and wrap around you. Shanna: DJ! You: Go! I'll be fine, trust me! You wink at her, letting her know that you have a plan. Tag. You're it. He he he. Well, do it already. Who said I was going to absorb you? You're still my best friend, she says squeezing you a little too hard for comfort... But why absorb another living being? And a sentient one at that! A human nonetheless! That, that right there. I'm never good enough for you, am I DJ? What are you talking about? You like the other girls on the team better than me, you even told me that you dont like girls who have tiny feet like mine. I never said that, they're just not my preferance. Just like how Rachael likes Emo guys, but still likes me even though I'm not Emo. Really now? Then you wont mind if I do this... Another woman is grabbed off the street by Amber's impossibly long tentacles and absorbed. Amber audibly moans this time as you watch and nothing changes. Uhh... I can store and rearrange as I please. Now eyes on my feet. You look at Amber's feet as they grow slightly to about a size 10 and her toes lengthen slightly, her feet narrow and her arches heighten slightly, as well as her polish changing from silver glitter to black glitter. Ok, now look upstairs. You look at Amber's face and her makeup style has changed to Goth, as well as the brown streaks in her hair being replaced with green. I should've started absorbing people years ago... It's so nice... And I bet you wont be resisting anything I tell you anytime soon... What makes you say that? Please. I gave you your preferance in feet and in type of woman, I know you have a thing for Goth chicks, wait a sec... The look in Amber's eyes changes as if a switch in her head was just just flipped. Amber sighs. Amber: Go away... You: But you just asked me to... Amber: Unless you wanna like, rub my feet or something. I dont care, whatever. Her tentacles turn back into her arms and she sits down. Are you feelin alright Amber? You're still here... Well then... Kiss em... I'm not gonna kiss you fee- The octopus tentacles grow out of her back and force you onto your knees in front of her. I tried to be nice, but you forced me to do this, and I know how you love dominant chicks. Amber I... Her tentacles force your face mere inches from her feet, which you begin to kiss solely because it just feels... right... Good boy. She pets you on the head. You cant hold it in any more and lick her feet, which she lifts so that you can get at her soles. A few minutes pass and the tentacles let up, only to breach the lower half of your armor and tear it off, Amber's tentacles pull down your pants and boxers as her feet slowly approach. A-amber. Shoosh, be peaceful. Amber begins giving you a foot-job. Miraculously after only about a minute of her slow stroking makes you erupt all over her feet, which quickly absorb your jizz. Amber lets out a loud moan. Wait, what does... You'll see. Amber extends a hand as it drips multi-colored goo, which puddles up and forms a perfect clone of Amber. Meet Nicole. Your middle name, cute. Shut up. Nicole, I have things to do. Entertain him while I'm gone. Nicole nods as Amber grows wings and flies off...</span></div></div>",

I'm not supposed to let you out of my sight! Relax. I'm just gonna give you a massage. Besides. Why would I want to escape from a cute girl? Oh... You cant see her face, but you know she's blushing. It's true what they say, flattery gets you everywhere. You begin to massage Nicole's shoulders. Oooh. That's nice... Right there... You can physically feel Nicole loosen up. Do you like it Nicole? I dont usually do shoulder massages. I love it hun! Nicole? I mean DJ... Hmmm... It's seems Amber kept all of the evil and Nicole came out pure... As pure as a teen girl can be anyway, but Nicole seems like a genuine sweetheart. Hey Nicole? Yeah? Wanna play a game? Sure! You sit down in front of Nicole, now to be a little evil and take slight advantage of her. So Nicole, do you have all of Amber's powers? Mhmm. So you can look like anyone you want? Sure... Oooh! I know where this is going. She says as she looks at you seductively. So what do you wanna start with? Wait! Dont tell me... Comics! Nerdgasm... What? Oh right Nicole. Sure. That'd be awesome. You smile at her. Oh! I can do clothes too. Nicole morphs and changes and ends up looking like Supergirl, outfit and all. If this is what Supergirl would look like in real life, you'd totally be a supervillain just to see her. Ha ha. DJ? Are you drooling? What? No! Of course not Supergirl! I mean Nicole... Damn you're convincing. Tee hee. Thanks. She's so sweet. It'd be wrong to betray her. You can try and reason with Amber later. The others are safe, that's all that matters. Nicole... Yes? Could you maybe... Umm... Yes? I want you to dominate me with your feet... Oh... Oh! That's right, Supergirl is your favorite superhero! Sure I'll dominate you honey! Now why dont you crawl over here on your knees and kiss my boots hmm? As if under a spell you do exactly what she says. After a few minutes of kissing her boots, she takes them off. And you lovingly kiss her bare feet. After a while a strange woman flies in. Nicole... Supergirl... Good job on keeping our friend here occupied. Who are you? I'm Amber! I just went a little crazy with the absorbing is all... You look mad different... again... I dont even remember what I used to look like anymore... It's only been a day... Just pick a comic girl like me! It'll be fun! Zatanna! You blurt out. Amber smiles at you and seconds later, looks like Zatanna, outfit and all. This is all so hot... So DJ, since you have us and we can be any girl you want... Why dont you stay with us? For a while, but I'm not joining the dark side. Been there and done that with Sarah. But... You're my best friend! Amber... Nicole hugs you from behind... Gnah... Two girls that can be anyone or the whole team with their unique powers... Oh Genie... You rang Master? Genie? That was barely audible... Nicole... Sorry... Does it bother you? No... One week, that's it. Fine... Agreed... Now let's figure this out. Who do you want me to be and who will Nicole be? How about...</span></div></div>",

Kiss of Death (She kisses her target and blows flames down their throat, igniting their lungs), control of shadows, can look at anyone's soul to see their true intentions, personality, etc., honestly you dont know what she's really capable of... She seems to be able to pull random powers out of her ass as is convenient to her...<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Extreme Cold nullifies her fire based powers (No effect if she's pissed enough), but considering all of her other powers it's kind of pointless to even try to weaken her. However... June can be mortally wounded by the one she has opened her heart to, and only by that person, by a blade through the heart. Even though she is evil, she has asked you to do this to her should she ever lose her soul. After all, the two of you are destined for each other...<br>\r\nOther Info: 5'8, Blonde, Red Eyes, Demon (Well technically Fallen Angel because her father is the Devil) She has pale skin. Way above average body temperature, her skin is very warm, almost hot to the touch. Also she is actually the most powerful on the team as she has the power to destroy the world if she wanted to, in fact it is her destiny to start the Apocalypse with the help of the Horsemen because she is the Destroyer, you and the team are trying to prevent this at all costs.<br>\r\nFeet: Size 9, Red and Orange Nails<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's Note: June has been much further developed since her debut in this arc, as such she may differ slightly in the newer arcs, this is her updated bio.)</span></div></div>",

DJ, teleport us out of here before someone else gets hurt, or worse. You: Tactical retreat! Back to base!<br>\r\n<u>Team Super X HQ</u><br>\r\nTech: This team is not going to disband because of me, I will stay here at the base and monitor the missions, S.I.M.O.N. has been rebuilt and converted into the base's supercomputer. I'm no doctor, but I can tell you that there is no sensation in my legs whatsoever, so I built this teched out wheelchair. You: You said legs, what about your, erm, girl parts? Tech: I haven't done any stimulation or impotency tests yet. I have an idea, DJ, follow me.<br>\r\n<u>Shanna's Lab</u><br>\r\nI've developed a serum, but I cant give myself a shot. Take this, levitate me, and jab this into the base of my spine. Is that safe? I'm already paralyzed, it wont hurt me any more than I already am if it goes wrong. Fine. You jab the rather large needle into her back and push the plunger. Jeez the footrest is cold! Wait, it worked... nope, still cant move them. But, I can feel them at least. DJ, I'd like you to do your thing on my feet and see if I can feel my, as you say, girl parts. Sound fun? Sure Shanna.</span></div></div>",

You: The Ice Queen is at the door. Olivia: I go by Olivia now, it's kind of my name, can I come in? You: Of course mistress. Olivia: April sex charged you didnt she? Whatever. She takes a seat next to June. April: Now the fun begins! They sit around you in a circle. June puts her feet on the left side of you, and Olivia puts her feet on the right side of you. You're warm on one side and cold on the other, but it feels really good as they rub their feet on you. May sticks her feet in your mouth as April plays with your antennae using her toes, that makes you feel all tingly in an awesomely hot way, something June discovered about 5 years ago while \"Playing\" with you. A few hours pass... You're back in your right mind. You: That was awesome! Thanks honey. And April, May, and Olivia of course. May: Bye Slug, she winks at you and sticks her tongue out. April: Later little green dude, she waves at you on her way out. Olivia: This was fun, see you later DJ. June: You know, we should take Tessa to go see Super X! It'd be fun to catch up with everyone!</span></div></div>",

She's no longer evil, but still a bitch.<br>\r\nAfter you retired, Shanna took over as Team Leader after having her legs properly healed by Halo. Lai Lai and most of the new members retired from Super X. Only the original members and your \"adoptees\" Cindy and Halo remain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Super X HQ</u><br>\r\nYou: Hi everyone. Miss me? You are ambushed by Cindy, Mai and her clones, who mercilessly hug you into oblivion. You: Cindy... Mai... Ami... Flo... And Rita... Will you please get off of me? Mai: Sorry about that, it's been a long time. Cindy: Sorry little alien dude. Looking over the room, everyone looks about the same, just some of them are a bit... curvier than they were 15 years ago... June: Hey! Your soul belongs to me remember? June says flashing her demon eyes at you for a second. You: I love you honey... June: Good to know hun. Tessa dear, stop hiding behind me and say hi. Tessa slowly creeps from behind June. Tessa: H-hi everyone... Catie: She's adorable! And she looks just like June, so that can only mean... Catie looks at you and smiles devilishly. I'm proud of you lil bro. Catie turns her arm into slime and lassos you over to her, hugging you like a stress squeeze ball. You need to visit me more often cuzz... You: Right... Sorry... You aren't mad are you? Catie: Of course not. Catie lets you go and you chat it up with a few other team members before... Shanna: Hold on... She looks like that one we picked up a few months ago... Shanna pushes a button on her wrist and a woman who looks the same age as June flames in. Woman: I'm Cynthia... Mom! Dad! Cynthia runs up and hugs you and June. You: What? June: Ooops... Did I forget to tell you about Rome hun? You: I've never been to Rome. June: Trust me, you have, you just dont remember... I sort of... forced myself on you... It was like 2,000 years ago. Forgive and forget right? You: What? Huh? June: You forgive me right? You: As soon as I figure out how the hell I went to ancient Rome... June: Trust me on this... It'll only hurt your feelings... You: What do you mean? June: Remember how you and Shanna were doing so well together? Then all of the sudden things just got worse and worse out of the blue? You: Yeah? June: Well Shanna created a time portal. You all went to ancient Rome, and needed a way back, I was the only one who could help you... I... had my two daughters hold you down while I... you know... and as you know, my girl parts have fangs... Said fangs are cursed, so... I cursed you causing all of your relationships to fail except for the one with me... And then there was the incident in 1066... There, Shanna was captured by the zombie sisters and turned undead. The only way to save her was to make a pact with me... Essentially I cursed you twice and forced you into my arms... I was a very naughty girl many years ago, and for that I am sorry... Addy: Damn... And I thought I was evil... That's just messed up... You: The only question I have is why dont any of us remember this? June: Mortals and young immortals dont have memory of time travel. It's ok if you hate me... You: I dont hate you. I just wish you would have told me sooner... So Cynthia is... June: Our first born... Tessa: Wait. I have a sister? Cynthia: Sister! Cynthia hugs Tessa. Tessa: Hey big sis... The Klaxon goes off. Shanna: Everyone onto the jet! We head out in 5! You: Yes! Finally some action! June: What about our children? You: They're half demon and all immortal, let them come with us. Unless all those years of having me as your personal servant/husband have made you soft and weak? June's eyes ignite. June: Dont come crying to me if someone gets hurt... Tessa: Yes! I finally get to break stuff! Cynthia: I'll teach you all the tricks of the trade.<br>\r\n<u>The site of the disturbance</u><br>\r\nShanna: Sensors indicate that our target should be directly ahead... What the? Shanna looks down as she tries to lift her feet, but they're stuck like glue. Addy: Is this someone's idea of a joke? Catie: Looks like you gotta help us DJ. You: Why me? Shanna: Cause you levitate to move your little squid booty around and therefore are the only one not stuck. You: Hey Shanna... you say getting a devilish idea. Shanna: Yes? You: Dont human feet have a bunch of oils and things that prevent sticking? Unlike your rubber boots? Shanna: In theory we should be able to slowly make our way through... You: Then I suggest you get to it fearless leader! Addy: I have to walk through this crap? You sadistic little bastard... You stick your tongue out at Addy, who quickly strips of her boots and slowly starts making her way toward you. You love watching her struggle to lift her pretty feet out of the muck to try and come over to you and pummel you. The way the green goop complements her orange nail polish is just awesome. The rest of the team follows suit behind Addy, some cheating a little. Your family mostly. Catie walks with almost no trouble due to being made of goo herself, but a little sticky goo gets on her feet, and her pretty French Pedicure. June, Tessa, and Cynthia simply burn the ground in front of them, walking on the dry cracked ground in front of them. Toward the end you turn the ground into goop just to watch them struggle a little. It's a good way to get back at June. Mai has a congo line thing going. She, Ami, Flo, and Rita each take turns taking a couple steps, then flipping the next in line over her shoulders, and repeating. You like to watch the goop ooze between their toes as they land, coating her shiny blue toenails in the process. Alex: Hey! What about me? You: Oh... Want me to help you? Alex: Yes! You: Why didn't you just say so? Ashley: Wait! It's impossible for me to move. Every time I lift my leg it goes up and stretches, but my feet stay on the ground. You look over at Ashley wiggle her toes in the goop, shiny green toenails barely discernable from the goop. Then at Alex's cute wiggly dark purple painted toes, green goop coating her pale white skin and oozing between her toes. Julia's made good progress, turning herself into a Vampire to make the trek, goop covering her feet and pretty red toenails. Shanna is making... slow progress... taking a step then drying the bottoms of her feet with a laser pointer type thing, goop all over her feet and pretty pink toenails. Cindy fares the same as Julia, her equally pale feet and shiny red toenails covered in muck. And then there's Halo, who simply stands there and scrunches her toes in the goop. You float over to her. You: Uhh Halo? Halo: Yeah? Aren't you gonna at least try to walk to the other side? Halo: Nope. I'm not gonna feed your little stuck fetish. You look down at Halo's angellic feet, her alabaster skin and white toenails covered in green goop. You: Please? Halo grabs you and whispers something to you. \"Only if you let me have a little fun with you later.\" You: Hmm... Fine... June CANT actually kill me, the whole being indestructible thing and all. Halo: Good. Halo begins walking slowly toward the others, using her wings to provide extra oomph. Now for Alex and Ashley. You fly over to Ashley first. Alex: Hey! You: Ashley needs my help more. Ashley: Thank you DJ. You float down close to Ashley's feet. You spit a lighter green colored liquid on them. Ashley: DJ... Why does that look like green jizz? You: It's not... Trust me... You want out or not? Ashley: Fine. You lick Ashley's feet all over and like majic they come up. You then hold her bridal style in your tentacles and fly her over to dry ground with the others who've made it already. Everyone except Alex has made it to the other side at this point. You: Cmon Alex. You can do it! Alex blushes a little. Alex: I kinda just wanted you to play with my feet... We didn't have time back at HQ. You: Fair enough. You lick Alex's feet all over and pry her loose, then carry her bridal style to the others. Everyone has strangely lined up side by side and sat down with their feet in front of them. Shanna: As leader, I feel that our little squid friend should clean up our feet before we continue. You: Oh... I can do that. You say giving them all a Cheshire grin. You turn the goop that was on all their feet into chocolate syrup and go down the line like a squeegee. Addy: Why didn't you do that in the first place? You turn slightly pink... You: I kinda have a umm... June: I know why. She says smiling at you. Catie: Sneaky sneaky DJ. You got to have fun with both of your little fetishes today. You: Sorry... I just couldn't pass this up... Shanna: No more mucking around, no pun intended. We move onward!</span></div></div>",

You: I just feel like we've been here before, well, somewhere similar, it's... warmer than last time... Cindy: Can we take a break? I'm feeling light headed... Shanna pulls up her sleeve and puts her arm in front of Cindy. Shanna: Your Hemoglobin levels are extremely low right now, here. Cindy: But Shanna... Shanna: Really. I trust you Cindy. You: Cmon Cindy. We dont want you to pass out on us. I would help you out but... I dont have any blood to speak of... Cindy: Well if you're sure Shanna... Cindy takes a bite and begins sucking blood out of Shanna's arm. She's been moaning in pleasure the whole time. About a minute passes and Cindy pulls away, licking the blood from her lips. Shanna uses her laser pointer thingie to cauterize the two holes in her arm then rolls her sleeve back down. Shanna: Feelin better Cindy? Cindy: Thanks. I feel much better. You continue walking until you run into a giant metal door. You: Archangel! Halo: But I'm not... You: Not you, the city in Russia. It's where we first encountered Dr. Walker and his scorpalizards... Cindy looks uneasy. You: You still good to go Cindy? Cindy: I'm fine. But when I see him so help me... June gets a very big smile on her face. June: Such dark thoughts fill my heart with glee! You: June... June: Look honey. I cant help what I am... June flames over and starts kissing you. Tessa: Mom! Cynthia: Oh little sister, you'll soon learn... Shanna: Hey hey! Focus! Save that for later... June: Sorry... evil just makes me so horny... Addy: Makes you wonder what's brewing in Cindy's head... Cindy: Stick around for the before and after of my father and you'll find out. June: Cindy you're killing me here... I might just start kissing you if you dont clean up your soul soon... Tessa: Mom! Shanna: Let's just go before things turn into a porno. You walk for what seems like hours, Cindy walks forward with determination while June tries her hardest not to pounce on Cindy and start making out with her. Finally, you arrive at the center of the complex and see Dr. Walker with his back to you, he's typing some stuff into a console. Dr. Walker: So meet again Super X. Cindy. Cindy: You abandoned me when I needed you the most, for that you'll pay! Cindy charges at Dr. Walker but is stopped a few feet short by a big wall of fire. Cindy: What? June! June: Think about it Cindy. If you do that your soul will be forever stained... then, it belongs to me for all eternity. Cindy only growls before stepping back. Dr. Walker starts laughing before over-gesturing causing his sleeve to catch on fire comedically. Dr. Walker: Fire! He starts running around like a headless chicken before stripping of his labcoat and gas mask. The smoke clears and what you see before you shocks you. Cindy: Mom?! Dr. Walker: That's right. I'm your mother, your father left before you were born. I just figured you'd be more obedient with a fatherly figure in your life rather than a motherly one. Since my plan has failed, I have to use my secret weapon. How are your fangs Cindy? Cindy: What? They're fine. Dr. Walker: Are you sure? They aren't <i>broken fangs</i>? Cindy straightens her back up and walks over to her mother. You: Cindy? Cindy: Who is Cindy? I am Project Two... Dr. Walker: Cindy. Be a dear and destroy them. Cindy: Of course... Dr. Walker: And destroy the green one first... Cindy lunges at you and starts pounding on you. To everyone else it looks like she's beating on a stress squeeze ball. Dr. Walker: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... ha... ha... huh? If this was an anime Dr. Walker would have a big sweat drop run down the back of her head. Cindy: Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. Error... You: Are you done yet Cindy? That tickles! Cindy twitches before passing out and falling on you. Her boobs end up on your facial area. Everyone else looks at Dr. Walker. Dr. Walker: You wouldn't hit a girl would you? Especially one with glasses? Forgive and forget? June: All I sense from her is embarrassment... She's clean, but I sense something... off... Shanna: But she's only human... Dr. Walker: Am I? Dr. Walker runs over at superspeed before flashing a fanged grin at all of you. Shanna: Let me guess. Cindy was your second test subject and you're Project One? Dr. Walker: Of course. Cindy. <i>Sickle cell.</i> Cindy bolts up like nothing happened. Cindy: Where am I? And what is stuck to my boobs... DJ! Cindy pulls you off of her boobs and finds you slightly pink. June: DJ... You: Hey! She collapsed on me! Dr. Walker: Interesting... You: Dr. Walker... Personal s-space... I see where Cindy gets her looks from... Dr. Walker: Amanda. Shanna: What, so we're all buddy buddy now? Just like that? Halo: I see her soul and it is quite clean, moreso than some on this team actually... You: T-team leader... What say y-you? Shanna: Fine, Dr. Walker can join... Dr. Walker: Amanda. I may be your mom's age but I certainly dont look it... Shanna: How old are you anyway Dr. Walker? Dr. Walker: Oh... 58 maybe? I lost track honestly, I stopped aging at 33. You: Wow... You l-look more like C-cindy's sister than her mom... June: Why are you still studdering DJ? You: C-cmon June... You know how I feel about vamp-pires. And with a h-hot m-mother-daughter pair practically p-pinning me to the floor... June: Fine. You're justified...<br>\r\n<u>A while later, Back at HQ</u><br>\r\nYou: Sweet mission Shanna. Tessa: So disappointing. I didn't get to break a single thing... Shanna: I guess it was a success... Halo: DJ. You: Halo. You both nod at each other and resume normal behavior. Cindy: Hey mommy. Did I ever tell you about DJ? Amanda: No. You haven't. But I'd love to study him some time. Cindy: Well... he has a really strong foot fetish, and gets all pink and stupid around girl's feet. At that point he's open to almost any idea or suggestion. Amanda: Oooh... He he he... Cindy: Mother... We had a talk about the evil plotting... Amanda: Sorry... old habits die hard you know? Cindy: Fair enough. Amanda: DJ darling. A word please? You float over to them. You: Yes Mrs. Walker? Amanda: Please. Call me Amanda. You: Sure. Whatcha want granny? Dr. Walker twitches a little bit. Amanda: Aren't you... charming... She's obviously holding back a temper. You: Good. You pass... Cindy: In short mom wants to join me in one of our... play sessions. Sound cool? You: Sure...</span></div></div>",

She hugs S.I.M.O.N. and starts crying. No, I have to pull it together, for the team! Ms. Electric: Mwahaha, who's next? Addy: I'll crush them all! She grows to about Godzilla height and tries to crush all of the supervillains. Deathwatch shoots multiple arrows from her crossbow into Addy. Addy: That didn't even tickle, I dont feel so good, she shrinks back to normal and collapses. Deathwatch: Blowfish toxin tipped arrows, he he. Ashley: I got Deathwatch! Before she can move, The Ice Queen freezes her. The Ice Queen: Freeze! Get it? He he. Gravity: You didn't finish the job. She uses her powers to shatter Ashley. Tech: Addy's not gonna make it, and Ashley is- You: Dont say it. Tech: Dead. Virus/Leech: Hello little red head. They both touch Alex's face then run off. Alex: What did that do? Deathwatch charges with a Katana. Alex: Stay back! Tech: Dont! Alex falls to the ground braindead. Tech: Her powers backfired into her brain and caused it to basically explode. The Flying Squirrel: I'll take Deathwatch. Kayla and May fight it out until May gets Kayla in the neck with the Katana. Tech: *Gasps* Corodid Artery! Running Fawn: Look out! She uses her powers to teleport you all out of the way. Infinity catches her with her power and Spirit Fire is instantly aged to dust. Tech: She just saved our lives. You: This isn't happening. You turn black with fear and curl up into a ball. Julia: I'll take Yin and Yang. Julia turns into a dragon and attacks Yin and Yang, but she is bombarded with their powers and falls. She returns to human form. Julia: K.I.A., just like something from Naruto, ugh. Nightshade: Natasha, now! Natasha pours something on the ground and a giant mutant red rose sprouts. Nightshade: Kill that traitorous bitch my pet! Nightshade makes the rose crush Lusty. Tech: Even a meta human couldn't have survived that. Mantis: That weed is going down! Mantis flies around the rose and hacks it to pieces. Mai: I got the twins! She multiplies herself and charges at Gravity. Gravity: Hope you like Space! Gravity flings Mai and her clones into space. Tech: DJ! I could clone all of them from the remains, even a tiny fragment of DNA- You: No Shanna, they wouldn't want that, they deserve a proper burial. <b>BANG!</b> You: Sniper? Shanna! Shanna looks down at the bloody hole in her left breast and falls to the ground. Tech: DJ, dont put flowers on my grave, instead, put the newest Pok\u00e9mon cards on it, ugh. You: She really was a diehard fan till the end. Hottie: That's it! I'm gonna crank it up to Hellfire! You: But you're a good guy now. Hottie: I know, but Hellfire burns forever, can never be doused, and burns all of the way through to the soul. They all deserve it. Hottie flames (teleports) over to the villains and burns all of them to death. You: June- she flames over to you and puts her finger on your lip area. Hottie: I have to report to my dad, I'll be right back. She flames out. You: Catie, Cindy, Lai Lai, let's go home.

Cindy: I'm staying with you guys. Lai Lai: Like DJ, I am an orphan, I have nowhere else to go. Mai: Guess I'm a veteran member of the team now.

Spider Rider: Check it out, I found a flash drive! Ami: Well, put it into S.I.M.O.N.! To your surprise, a holographic image of Shanna's head appears on S.I.M.O.N.'s screen. S.H.A.N.N.A.: If you are getting this message, the unthinkable has happened, and Emily is probably trying her best to keep my stuff running, probably with mixed results and- oh, I'm not pre-recorded, I uploaded my conscienceness into a flash drive, so I have completely replaced S.I.M.O.N. with, well, me. You get the idea, I'm going into sleep mode. The monitor goes blank. You: Any other dead teammates wanna show up? Addy: Yes. You: How? Addy shapeshifts into Catie, wait, Catie! Catie: I couldn't resist, sorry. You feel numb all over and black out. </span></div></div>",

You: Since you're back, I need help obtaining information about the new team's powers and weaknesses. Shanna: Got it, I'm keeping my old moniker of Technetia, you wont change my mind about that! You: How about Tech 2.0? Shanna: Damn you, I love it! So first for interview is... Aqua a.k.a. the Spider Rider. You: So Aqua, what are your powers and weaknesses? Aqua: Hmm, I've been trained to use all sorts of weapons, I'm awesome with a spear! Oh, and I can ride giant spiders, tough to master. Weaknesses, uh, I'm only human, well, genetically enhanced human, speed, strength, endurance, durability, etc., I guess I have none then tee hee. Tech 2.0: Next is... La Vira. You: So La Vira, what can you do? La Vira: My real name is Portia. I can turn into a giant spider, and have all the abilities of a spider. I'm a mutant so weaknesses... well none really, like Aqua I'm better than your average human. Tech 2.0: Next up is... Samantha the Fish Girl. You: So Sam, what can you do? Nice necklace by the way. Samantha: Thanks, Emily built it so I can breathe without that Saw torture collar, tee hee. Well, I can generate heat, well all Atlanteans in the Antartica territory can. My callsign in my Atlantean Defense Corps days was Firefox, cause I can make so much heat that fire burned... underwater... Weaknesses, well I'm better than an average human, the sea is a tough place, unfortunately, I cant breathe air very well, but water, is obviously not a problem for me to breathe. Tech 2.0: We know what Ami and Emily can do so that just leaves... Deadly Mist... You: So Deadly Mist, what can you do? Deadly Mist: Just call me Reiko, it is my name after all. Let's see, I can teleport, and my four working senses are almost superhuman. I am trained in several Martial Arts, the art of stealth and with various assassination tools. Weaknesses, I am only human and a blind one at that. You: So how did you lose your eyes Reiko? She removes her blindfold. Reiko: I was captured and slashed in both eyes by a rival assassain, I wear the blindfold so others dont see my hideous scars. You: They're not that bad, in fact, I think you have pretty eyes. Reiko: They're glossy and my irises are grey. You: Well I have no eyes, call me a hippocrate. Reiko: Thanks. She teleports over and hugs you. You smell like Lime Jello.

Well, she's the flirty one who's a little more domineering. Really? She starts taking off her boots. Do you know anyone else like that? Well- plufirbff! She just started using your face/body as her personal footstool. Ami is awesome! Oh, I forgot that you turn pink around girl's feet, tee hee. She starts smooshing your face/body with her feet, which you are loving! So much so that you involuntarily stick your tongue out. She has cherry? foot lotion on, how you didn't smell that before is beyond you. Aww, you're just like a little puppy! Come here! She pulls you off of her feet and starts hugging and kissing you. Ohh! I forgot to let you get a good look. She turns you around and you can see that she has shiny purple polish on. She flexes her toes. You like? Mmhm. Emily: Hey Ami, Mai wanted you to- I can see that you're busy. Ami: Would you like to join me? Emily: Fine, Software at your service. You: Software? You think back to an old news report from when you were still human. \"The supervillain known as Hardware has just broken into Fort Knox! This is unheard of! Reports say that this technologically advanced supervillain travels with others like herself. And she's a known genocidal Anarchist who wants to destroy India!\" You remember the security footage, and it's... Emily! Ami: DJ, are you okay? You break free of Ami's grasp and spray Emily with a sticky substance to hold her down. You: Start talking. Who are you really? Emily: Fine, I'm an Ex-supervillain and I did destroy India and drop the world population by a billion. But that was my personal goal. My boss, Lexi also known as The Valkyrie, wanted more than that, so I left and decided to switch sides. For all I've done I'm truly sorry. Punish me as you see fit. You: I get the feeling that you erased all physical records of your previous life. Am I right? Emily: Correct. You: I really shouldn't do this, but... I wont tell the authorities. Not like they can do anything about you anyway. But. I'm gonna torture you a little, in my own way. You fly over and remove her boots. Emily: Oh, no! I've seen that look before! You drag your tentacle along her sole. N-no, stuhap! That, t-tickles ha ha ha ha ha! You continue to do this for the next hour. Emily has stopped laughing and started crying at this point, her toes curled to try and protect her feet. She also has shiny purple polish on, tempting. You go over and lick across all ten of her perfect little toes. You release her from the goop and she runs into the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes are almond shaped and her irises the color of Topaz. She's overall very hot, she always wears black lipstick, her lips hide two small fangs. If you didn't know that she had spider DNA in her you'd think she was a Vampire. As for her body, she's quite thin and with limbs on the longer side, not in a digusting skeletal way, more like supermodel, which she could be if her boobs were bigger. She says they used to be bigger until her muntant DNA surfaced, it puts her at an A-cup now, but you couldn't care less, it's her feet that you like. All you know about her feet is that they're long and slender, and her toes are kinda long, you do know that she has ten of them though, and always wears black nail polish. In deep thought there Deej? Wha- no! She glares at you. Yes, about you actually. How sweet. She takes off her boots and puts her perfect bare feet in front of you. You slowly start turning pink. Go ahead. You take both of her feet and put them on your face/body. I kinda wanted a massage, oh well. Aqua: You should've known that by now Portia. Portia: I guess, he really is hopeless. Aqua sits next to Portia and assists her in smooshing you. This goes on for about an hour. Aqua: Portia and I have something to do, we have to- ooh! She is startled by you licking her feet and Portia's. Aqua: Why didn't you flinch Portia? Portia: I dunno, I guess my feet aren't as sensitive as yours aqua hair. He he he.

I wish I'd met you when I was a teenager, I did alot of running in those years... Slow down kid. That really tick- Actually, it feels kinda nice... erotic even... You continue to lick your aunt Nightshade's feet... Something about this is extra hot for you... Oh. Ooooh. H-honey. Ho-oney. Honey-y. D-dJ! Slow du-hown! Hmm? Oh. Aunt Sylvia... I- I'm so sorry! You say noting the big wet spot on her pants, and it's not pee... No honey, it's fine. She says out of breath, playing with your little antennae with her toes. This serves to overcharge your fetish even more (the antennae are your \"hot spot\") and you slurp her other foot's toes into your mouth and happily suck on them. Ah. My favorite little nephew is so hopeless... Of course, you're my only nephew, but even if you weren't you'd still be my favorite. She smiles at you. Who would've thought that you'd be here now, that Nightshade is your mom's sister, that her feet would be so attractive to you... She pulls her feet away. Ok, that's enough. I'm going to bed now, I haven't slept in 6 months. How- You think you're allowed to sleep down there? Right. Sorry auntie. You say trying to be like the \"innocent\" little kid that knows they've just done something wrong. It's ok honey. She rubs your head briefly then walks off somewhere to sleep.<br>\r\n<u>Training Pool</u><br>\r\nSam sometimes meditates at the bottom of the pool, should be about midnight now, and the moon is full, she's probably there now. Sam pops her head from her eyes up out of the water and only sticks one of her legs up in the air. She wiggles her bare toes, enticing you to enter the pool. Samantha. You know I can only doggie paddle... Sam sticks her other leg out of the water and wiggles all of her toes, her cerulean blue nails glistening in the moonlight. S-sam... Stop it... (When Sam get's hormonal like this, she usually doesn't speak and only teases you with her feet, knowing that you're too afraid of drowning to go play with her...) Wait. You dont even have lungs anymore. You float over the water's surface over to Sam and kiss her on the cheek. She responds by fully un-submerging her head and kissing you fish-lips to alien-mouth. Just kidding, her lips are sexy. She finally changes positions and basically does a floating underwater handstand. She bends her knees and dangles her feet in front of you. I love you Sam! You wrap your tentacles around her feet, making sure they dont escape your hungry mouth, and you have a taste for fish feet tonight... You start by kissing her toes, but it quickly turns to licking, then sucking... This goes on until the sun comes up... Sam flips over with you attached... A few seconds later you burst from the water's surface like a submarine's missile. So, you finally got the guts to come out here and play with me. Hmm footboy? When Sam calls you footboy it just sends shivers down your spine... the good kind of shivers. I-I-I. Sam puts her webbed finger to your lips (Technically you dont have lips, but you get the idea) No talking. Only smooching. Sam grabs you and starts making out with you. Since you were already bright pink from her feet, the kiss only ignites the pink flaming aura that appears only when Sam kisses you. She pulls away. There we go! I love you so much! She pulls you in for a hug, boobs squishing against your face/body with only her wet T-shirt between you and her lovely flesh lumps. I'm hungry. Let's go get some breakfast ok? Sure Sammie, I'll go get some fish food and throw it in the pool for you. Her smile turns to a flat look. Cmon now, that was just racist. Sorry Sam... Guess you have to punish me for being a naughty boy... I just might have to my naughty little cuttlefish... after we eat of course. And I want pancakes! With sardines of course. You are so cute when you talk about food. Cmon now, I'm cute all the time. Yes you are Sammie wammie. Tech 2.0: Get a room you two. Reiko: Really, the levels of fish pheremones in this room are unbearable... You fly over to the stove to make Sam her favorite sardine pancakes. About 5 minutes later you return to Sam who is happily sitting at the table. Here's your pancakes honey. Aww! You didn't have to do that for me DJ. It's what all good boyfriends do, even if they are tiny squid creatures. Well I think you're cute. She says as she rubs your head lightly. Using her fingers to play with your antennae. Sam... S-sam! Oh! I'm sorry hun, I forgot that's your erogenous zone. I-it's ok. You smile at her. Oh, aren't you gonna eat DJ? I would, but it would be rude of me because I literally swallow my food whole. Oh, are you embarassed to eat in front of me? I uh... You turn a light shade of red... DJ honey, my dad's side is part grouper, half my family swallows their food whole. Oh... You are so fascinating Samantha. Me? No! I'm just your average fish-girl. That can throw fireballs. Right... My mom's side is part electric eel... Uh... I dont know why I got fire powers either, mutation maybe? You're so cute. Hey DJ, watch this. Sam opens her mouth, and continues to open it until it's the size of the plate. She puts her face to the table and closes her mouth around the pancakes, swallowing them whole. Thanks DJ, they were delicious. Your jaw is still on the floor, literally for cartoony dramatic effect. I told you I was part grouper. It's not that. I just didn't think there was anyone else here that could down a stack of pancakes in one bite. Samantha jumps on you and starts making out with you. Cindy: Again? This is like the 11th time this week I come in to get a snack and see you two slobbering all over each other. Animals... She grumbles as she walks out...</span></div></div>",

Out in the distance you see a large figure out in the ocean wading it's way toward the base. As it gets closer you realize it's Addy! Who you and the rest of the team saw die back in a battle with Deathwatch. About five minutes later she reaches the base as she shrinks back down and collapses in front of you and Sam. You carry her to the Lab where Shanna and Emily scan her. A few minutes later she wakes up. Addy: Which one of you assholes decided I was dead and buried me? You and Shanna point at each other. Tech 2.0: Addy. We saw you succumb to Deathwatch's poison tipped arrows and die. Addy: You saw me pass out! Looking at the amount of dirt that covers Addy's body, you figure that she had to dig herself out of the ground. You: Well Addy, I'm really sorry that- WHAAA! Addy: And you... Addy says as she has her nails firmly dig into your Jelloey flesh. You: Y-yes? Addy: I missed you so much! She says as she pulls you in for a hug. You: Huh? Addy: I missed the way you always treat me and my feet like a princess, and I brought a friend. A small lizard crawls from inside Addy's outfit and looks like it's glad to see daylight again. The lizard hops off of Addy and grows... It's Julia... Julia: You all should NEVER go into the medical field. What made you think a few volleys from Yin and Yang would actually kill me? I just passed out is all! All of the sudden Alex appears, apparently she was cloaked. Alex: Idiots. All of you... Tech 2.0: Wait. Your brain exploded! Alex: No miss knowitall. I merely passed out! One of the spots of dirt on Alex jumps off and grows, it can only be Ashley. Ashley: Cmon now! You guys know I'm like indestructible! Being frozen makes no difference! Tech 2.0: Guys I'm sorry. My mistake. Alex: It's ok, we forgive you. Mr. Burytheliving on the other hand... You: Hey! I didnt know! Julia: We're not mad. We just miss you is all! They all gang up on you and hug you to death. You: Shanna! Fight your own battles DJ... Alex: Whoa wait a minute Shanna. Didn't you take a bullet to the heart? Tech 2.0: Yes I did. Before we left on that mission I downloaded a copy of my entire brain into a flashdrive, which our newbie friends found and uploaded into S.I.M.O.N. 2.0. My genius cousin Emily built this robotic body for me. Addy: Wow... Ashley: I guess the only ones who really didn't make it were Running Fawn, Mai, Kayla, and Juline. You: Mai sent clones on that mission... Julia: Mai has supervillain level strategic abilites. She's a quiet one, we should watch her. Ha ha... Alex: I think we should all gang up on DJ and rub our sweaty feet on him!</span></div></div>",

Alex telekinetically lassos you and drags you off to a secluded spot on base, Addy, Julia, and Ashley follow. Alex: So who goes first? Julia: I say we just all do it once. That'd be fun. All four of them remove their boots and rub their bare feet all over you... This goes on for hours probably. Addy: Wake up pinky! You: What who what?! Oh... Hi everyone. Julia: Good morning DJ.

Orchid shrinks down to be slightly shorter than her sister. She looks like her sister only blonde and with crazy double pigtails, or are they quadruple ponytails? Also her irises are an Amber color like her sister's, but she doesn't appear to have fangs like her sister either. Addy: You guys are really setting the bar low...

Or firearms maybe? Shanna sighs again as she speaks into her communicator. Shanna: DJ to interview room. I need you to test the prospective heroine here. You: I'll be there in a second. You teleport in. What do you need me to do Shanna? Shanna: She needs something heavy or firearms. You nod as you materialize a 1 Ton weight in front of Becky. You: We're waiting. Becky: Why is your robot bossing me around? Shanna: Uh... He's not a robot... And he happens to be the boss... Becky blushes luminescent red. Becky: I'm sorry... Anyway...

DJ, if you would call in your wife please? You: Of course... You activate you communicator. You: June to interview room. June flames in, wearing a pair of sunglasses for some reason. June: You rang hubby? Becky: Holy shit she just appeared in a flame! June: It's not that impressive. We have several teleporters... Such as Ra- Rachael teleports in. Rachael: Guys! I just found out something awesome! Shanna: Rachael... We're conducting an interview... Can it wait a few minutes? Rachael: Yeah I guess... Continue. June: Anyway. What did you want me to do? If I hit her with my Hellfire she'll just die... Shanna: Well then dont use the black flames. June: But they're fun... You: June... June: Oh fine... Becky: What do you mean by Hellfire? June: Is it not obvious? She says as she removes her sunglasses. Becky: Your eyes are red... That aint natural... June: Oh... A backwoods hick... Do we really need her? Becky: Listen here you red eyed bitch! We're not all inbred you know! For your information- Mffphh! June pinches Becky's lips shut, as a dark aura forms around her. You: Oh boy... You've gone and pissed her off... June: Stop and think for a second mortal... Do you really want to challenge Satan's daughter to a one on one fight? If you lose your soul is mine for all eternity... But unlike my hubby here your afterlife will not be pleasant... I'll see to it personally. June releases Becky's lips...<br>\r\n<u>And then...</u><br>\r\nBecky: Nice try but I'm a Christian. And I've never killed anyone or stolen anything! June: Wait... You think <i>that</i> is what gets you into hell? June starts cracking up laughing. Eventually calming down enough to speak. Becky: What's so funny? June: I wont even bother going into the details... Shanna am I done here? Shanna: Not yet. So what is your other power Rebecca. Becky: Super Durability. Shanna: Ok... So we'll put you through some stress testing... Rachael: I'll fight her if it'll speed this up... I'll go out and say it. The thing I wanted to tell you all is... Like back in the Civil War or something my great-and-something grandfather was a slave. Guess the mistress got frisky with one of her slaves. Ha ha. Yeah I know... I look so black. Rachael says pointing to her blonde hair and blue eyes. Guess I'm one of the sistas now huh? You: That's funny. Although I already have a sister... Rachael: I said sista my nig. You: Eh. What the hell. You high five Rachael and do the handshake. You: So how do you <i>know</i> for a fact? Rachael: Well there's the dark birth marks on my ass. Just take my word for it... Unless you wanna break up with June to find out? She says winking at you. You: Uh... That would be hazardous to my health... June hugs you from behind. June: Good choice hubby. Becky: It's a shame you have tainted blood Rachael... You're pretty... Rachael: The fuck you mean tainted blood?! You talking shit on my family? Shanna: I better call Halo... Someone's gonna get hurt... You: Do tell Becky... You say as you retract your helmet. Becky: Well obviously I think the Civil War should have never even happened in the first place and we Southerners should've just been allowed to continue as we were. Rachael: Shanna... I'll get you that battle data all right... Rachael says as she unsheathes her claws (By this timeline she had mutated further and her previously filed nails became actual claws that can be used in battle) Rachael: I'll make her bleed like my wrists... She says as she takes on an aura worthy of June. Becky: You wanna start something bring it you fucking n-----s! Shanna: She just dropped it with a hard \"er\"... Blood will be spilled...<br>\r\n<u>Round 1: Fight!</u><br>\r\nYou: As much as I'm offended by that I was raised to never raise a hand against a woman in anger. I gotta sit this one out Rach. Rachael: Not a problem... I'll make this bitch bleed like a stuck pig... Enough for the both of us and our families. Becky draws a pistol as Rachael teleports around her in a flurry. Looking like a black blur (From her cloak) as she teleports around Becky rending and tearing with her claws. Rachael finishes by sonic screaming at Becky (Knocking her on her ass) and holding her claws mere inches from her throat, kicking her gun several feet across the floor. You watch as several wounds open on Becky's skin and begin to ooze blood. Rachael: I avoided any major arteries... That's the only sympathy you'll get from me... You aren't even worth killing you racist scum. Rachael flicks the blood off of her claws onto Becky's face as she teleports back over to the crowd. Shanna: Impressive Rachael. I'll move your combat proficiency rating up several places on the chart. Rachael: Thanks. But I dont need it. This was personal... Becky simply lies on the floor in shock. Partly from blood loss... And partly because she cant believe that she was beaten by the thing she hates the most... At about this time Halo teleports in in a flurry of blue lights. Halo: I heard Rachael charged in aga- Oh... Halos turns around and looks at an unscathed Rachael, who waves at her with a smile. Shanna: Try the girl on the floor. I hope Angels are indifferent to who they help... Becky's not the greatest person around... Halo: It is my sacred duty to heal those in need. Be they saint or sinner. Halo walks over to Becky and crouches down. Halo: Your soul isn't the cleanest I've seen... But I've seen worse. Deep down you're a good person... Deep deep down... However... Though I may heal your body... I am willingly choosing not to cleanse your soul as well. I leave that up to you. Halo bathes Becky in a healing light, closing her wounds. Halo: It is done. With that Halo teleports out in a flurry of blue light.<br>\r\n<u>Finish!</u><br>\r\nShanna: I think we should keep her... For her own sake... Obviously she's all talk... You: I agree. If Halo thinks there's hope for her then why not. June could you go grab my aunt please. June: Back in a jiff hubby! With that June flames out. 15 seconds later she flames back in with your Aunt Sylvia in tow. Becky is sitting up now. Sylvia: Which one of you is Rebecca? Everyone points to Becky. Vines erupt from the floor an tie her up as Sylvia walks over to her. Sylvia: You know... You're a lot like my mother... I hated my mother... The racist bitch... That's why I ran away from home and became a supervillain, just to spite her. After a while my little sister Chrissy grew up she met a certain Eddie D. Thompson... DJ's father... Who was black... Becky: But you're white. If your little sister is DJ's mom then... Sylvia: Correct. She had a child with a black man. And mother disowned her. Mother later died bitter and alone. See where I'm going with this? Becky: What about your sister and his dad? Why dont you bring them here to tell me this story? Sylvia points to the ceiling. Sylvia: Ask Halo. She's met the both of them. Becky: Oh... I'm sorry... Sylvia: Car crash. When DJ was still a toddler. You: You forgot to mention that I'm not actually black. The term is Mulatto. Sylvia: Shoosh! I was getting to that. Anyway. Dont judge a book by its cover... And also... *SMACK* Sylvia slaps Becky across the face, leaving a red handprint on her cheek. Sylvia: That's for being rude to my family! That's all. With that Sylvia vanishes into the shadows. The vines around Becky slowly wither as she falls to her knees. Just kneeling there silently... Everyone save for you leaves the room. Mostly out of boredom. You: It's kinda late. My room is three doors down to the right if you need a place to sleep. That is if you can stand being near \"my kind\". I dont think the others would... Be as accommodating to you... Anyway good night Becky... With that you walk off to your room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: A few minutes later there is a knock at your door... It's Becky with tears streaming down her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: The next morning you walk by the interview room...

Well I do like Parmesan Chicken which is fried technically so I guess you got me there... Becky starts giggling. What's so funny? You're just... The whitest black person I've ever met! I'm Mulatto... You even talk like a white guy. If we'd never met and you were talking to me on the phone I'd guess you were white. Hey- Yeah that's pretty much true... I get that a lot... You slyly use your powers to make Becky's boots disappear from her feet and appear next to your bed. So why are there only women here? Hmm... Never really thought about it... I guess superpowers are sexist... From what I've observed it's like a 95/5 ratio female to male. Genetics maybe? That wasn't my question... I'll ask again. Why are there <i>only</i> women here? Hmm? Well uh... It's not like there aren't guys that want to join... The girls just kind of... Scare them off... True I'm team leader but... I'm not exactl- So you're submissive towards women? You blush. Eh- Yes... You say sinking into your bed a little as you lean against the wall... Becky grabs your wrists and pins them to the wall... Even without super strength she'd probably still be able to pin you... She stares into your eyes... Be honest with me... This is turning you on isn't it? You squeal... Yes... Hmm. So... What turns you on the most? Although... I have an idea already... She says pointing to her boots. You got me... You say as the blush returns. Becky simply smiles as she pushes you so that you're laying on the bed the normal way as she plops down on your stomach. Your breathing and heartrate skyrocket. Well well... Aren't you excited? She says as she begins to rub her sexy bare feet all over your face. Causing you to wish you could reach downstairs from this position... Becky notices as she begins to reach her hand into your pajama pants... You \"jump\" a little in shock at her forwardness. Shhh... Just enjoy it... Let Becky make it all better... Becky says adding an oozing sexiness to her accent. (Normally her accent is pretty subtle) You dont last long, and watch as Becky sucks and licks on her sticky fingers like a porn star. In turn she also gently worms her toes into your mouth, which you suck on fervently. Now dont get me wrong. I'm not in love with you or anything... But you are a dear friend to me... I trust that you'll defend me from everyone else who pretty much hates my guts... And in turn... I'll make sure that your needs are properly taken care of hmm? You nod. Awesome! Becky pulls her foot out of your mouth and gives you a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<u>That Morning, in the Mess Hall</u><br>\r\nYou: Everyone. Please try to be civil... I realize that Rebecca made a poor first impression... But nonetheless please <i>try</i> to be nice to her. She already promised me that she wouldn't cause trouble. Right? Becky: Mmhmm! She says smiling cheerfully at everyone. Getting only a cold stare from Rachael. Rachael: Well... You two seem to get along great now. You: Rachael... Do you want to hang out today? Rachael: I never said that I was lonely! Dipshit... She mumbles as she blushes and takes a huge bite of one of her waffles. But she also nods. Meaning that she wants to hang out with you... June: I'm fine as long as she's nice to you hubby. Becky: Why do you call him hubby? Neither of you wear rings. June: It's more of a symbolic thing. His soul is literally bound to me. Oh... And we have two daughters... In the future of course. Becky blushes heavily. Becky: Oh... I see... June: Truly he's free to date whoever he wants... He just likes having me as a mistress... You blush luminescent red... June: Tee hee hee. See? Everyone else just kinda nods...<br>\r\n<u>Later... At Rachael's Room</u><br>\r\nRachael opens her door and looks down both corridors before pulling you into her room. Rachael... You whisper... Why all of the secrecy? You continue to whisper. Knock it off dipshit. We're alone now... She says as she sits on her bed and you sit in front of her as her feet assault your face... In the good way. Then you realize that she's wearing dark Gothic stockings... Basically regular black stockings but with like spiderweb patterns and such. Well... You know that she did it just for you. She continues to rub her feet all over your face for about 5 minutes, and you are loving it. Alright perve. Tear 'em up. But... They look expensive... Dude... I have a million of these. They're costume stockings. Still I- Alright ya pussy. Rachael extends her claws and easily tears open the toe part of her stockings. You're lucky I like you dumbfuck. She says as she pets you on the head. You know she means nothing but love by it. But also the Masochist in you kinda likes it... You pull back the rest of the fabric of her stockings and begin to massage her sexy feet. What are you doing? Rubbing your feet. Why? Well I expected you go all beast on them and like... I dunno... Like lick and suck on them and shit... Trust me... I really want to... But I also enjoy massaging pretty girls' feet. Does that bother you? P-pretty? You dipshit! Rachael says with an extremely red blush on her face. She begins to lightly slap you with her feet, which you kind of enjoy... Eventually she calms down, still blushing. Fine... You can rub them... But I am not cute! I mean- Gah! You dumbfuck! She says shoving her foot into your mouth. Still blushing heavily. Just stop talking! You make me act stupid! As you suck on her toes you massage her free foot. Eventually her blush subsides and she begins to enjoy your massage. You really think I'm cute? You nod. Well thank you... It helps my self confidence a lot... I really mean that... Maybe even enough to not do this... She says as she shows you her wrist scars. Anyway, thanks... Rachael says as she takes her foot out of your mouth and pulls you up for a kiss...</span></div></div>",

Nothing. She has no powers. So what, is she like a maid or something? Well... Shanna says as awkwardly rubs the back of her head. She's here as a pet... Shanna. That is dark... Even if it is one of your science experiments... You should know we dont do that sort of thing here... Before you continue DJ. I'd like to point out that Duchess here is technically not a human. This lil beauty here is technically a dog. What I mean by that is, dog brain, human body. She was in an accident that left her comatose for years. Her brain eventually died and she was signed up to donate her body to science... He he he... Shanna... You've officially turned into Fran from Franken Fran. I'll take that as a complement to my genius. Anyways, it seems Duchess has taken a liking to you. What do you mean... Oh... Duchess is crouched down gently nuzzling your leg with her face. Have fun you two. Shanna winks and walks off. Wait what? You sigh. Cmon Duchess. You say as you lead her to your room.<br>\r\n<u>Your room</u><br>\r\nAt least Shanna thought to clothe her. But the collar is a bit much... Hold the phone... You see a note attached to her collar. It reads: \"Dear DJ. Just so you know. I found a way to boost Duchess' intelligence. While not quite at human level, it is much higher than your average dog's. Again. Hope you two have fun <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" Oh Shanna... Shanna is very nice... Gah! You can talk! Duchess nods at you. Right, intellect boost... So uh... What is it dogs do? I'm more of a cat person really... Cat! Where! I'll chase it for you master! She says as she scans the room like a spaz. No cats here. I was only mentioning them... Oh... Dont get my hopes up... You speak just fine... I'm beginning to doubt that there's an actual dog's brain in that skull of yours... She lifts up her hair and shows you a large medical scar in the back of her head. Shanna wasn't telling the whole truth... Inside my head are <i>parts</i> of a dog's brain. I have most of my original brain. Think of me as a human with dog tendencies... Even before the accident I kind of always wanted to be a slave girl... She says as she blushes a bit. The role of pet suits me nicely... So will you be my master? I... I'm sorry I cant do that. What?! But why? I'm a bit submissive myself... Oh poo... Well there's always Addy... But if you value your freedom I'd suggest not bringing it up to her. Well this sucks... She says as she stretches her legs and spreads her toes... You let out an involuntary squeak. Hmm? What do my feet stink or something? Not exactly... Do you mind if I um... Touch them... If you want to touch my pretty lil paws then by all means. Tee hee. I am only the dog. She says as she winks at you and rests her feet in your lap. Her nails aren't painted but her feet are very well taken care of. You begin to massage them... This is gonna sound weird but... Since you wont be my master will you at least be my boyfriend? I mean you're already massaging my feet on command so... Sure Duchess. I'm currently single anyway. Melinda. Shanna doesn't know that my intelligence was largely unaffected or that I can speak perfectly. Or have any memory of who I was before for that matter. So this will have to be a secret and you'll have treat me like a pet... around other people and... Oooooh... Mmmmm... Melinda says as she begins to get turned on thinking about it...</span></div></div>",

Better yet, I could turn you into something that doesn't have a dick, let's see, male frogs dont have a penis. Oh, but they can still ejaculate, so I'm gonna have to improvise, and maybe bribe your genie into helping me, cause something of this magnitude is tough even for me. A few minutes later, Shanna comes back with Genie. Hello master! Genie! Why are you helping her? Because you dont let me have fun with you nearly enough! <i>Great, now two women have it out to get me...</i> Genie snaps her fingers and you are strapped to a table, Shanna puts on her goggles.

Ha ha, no! I still need to punish you, and Genie just wants to dominate you. Yes I do master. I think that you're rather cute like this. And you change colors too! Genie's feet look really tempting right now, you float over to them with some difficultly and start licking them. You figure since you dont appear to have clothes, you might as well masturbate. You reach down with your tentacle- AHHH!!!! Shanna! Did you make me a girl?! Um, no, you need a vagina for that. You, my little boyfriend, are gender neutral. It's part of your torture, since I know you just love girl's feet soooo much, but cant properly enjoy them at the end of the day.

You feel the scent of Genie\u2019s feet slowly enter your body. Your mind takes the time to process and analyze it but almost instantly decides that you like it. Her feet smell wonderful like a rich scent of cheddar and lavender which you attribute to the lotion she uses. It seems to fit her well adding an exotic quality to the familiar smell of sweaty feet. You find yourself really happy to inhale it. The smell seems to get stronger as it moves through your body gradually going from your nose to your lungs. Genie slows down time even further allowing the scent of her feet to linger with you for an extended period of time along with the sense of pleasure. It feels like you\u2019ve been smelling her feet for weeks\u2026 maybe even months. It\u2019s long enough that you have to think a bit to recall what your life was like prior to taking the breath. Her foot scent feels like a part of you now\u2026 like it\u2019s home is in your lungs. Then ever so slowly it begins to leave your body exiting your lungs and then your nose. You find yourself missing it\u2026 like you are incomplete without it. Then time returns to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d It takes you a moment to process what just happened but you smile when you do. \u201cThat was awesome Genie!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie giggles. \u201cThought you might like.\u201d She grins mischievously. \u201cI\u2019m just getting started though. You\u2019re gonna smell my feet for the next Sixty years!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait- wha-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately presses both her soles against your face smothering you lightly before once again slowing down time. She then proceeds to rub her feet in your face several times as she forces you to smell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically if time had been passing at its actual rate, she had only been doing this for a minute or so but because she slowed down your experience of it\u2026it feels considerably longer. Just like before, smelling her feet is an intense experience with each breath you take lasting the equivalent of one year. With little else to do, you find yourself focusing on Genie\u2019s feet as a source of entertainment. You stare at Genie\u2019s feet as they slowly slide across your face analyzing every detail about them. With the ample time you\u2019re given to study them you learn everything there is to know about them. You can visualize the shape and feel of each of her toes with your eyes closed and identify the subtle differences in smell that each part of her feet has. You even know the exact number of wrinkles on her soles. For anyone else being under Genie\u2019s feet for so long would be really tedious but for a fetishist like yourself\u2026you enjoy every moment of it.<br>\r\nEventually after what feels like a lifetime, Genie lifts her feet off your face to check in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back up at her with a contented look on your face feeling very subdued and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie smiles playfully. \u201cWell DJ that\u2019s roughly 61 years as my foot slave down\u2026only 939 years left to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she make you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I never kissed your toes on the first day Genie, it was more like you rubbing my junk with your foot. Oh yeah, I made you blurt out that first wish, ha ha...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, why'd you buy this dusty peice of crap anyway? It's just more work for me to clean. You're 17, you live here for free and dont have a job, a little dusting is too much for you? Fine. You breathe on the lamp with an audible breathing noise then wipe the dust off with your sleeve. The lamp rumbles and purple smoke shoots from it. The smoke materializes into a really hot woman dressed like a genie... wait... Dusty lamp + magic smoke... She's an actual genie! H-hi. Shy guy huh? I am Ashley, I will be your genie until you make 3 wishes, blah blah blah, be warned that they may backfire, blah blah blah, I'm sure you watch the movies, you know the drill. So what is your first wish? Whoa. Ashley, I need some time to think- You wanna play with my feet? What makes you think that I- Dude, I'm like 6,000 years old, I know things. Ok, we can go up to my room. Mom: Friend of yours honey? You: Huh? Mom: The girl, is she a friend from school? (Your mom is blonde) You: Sure? Mom: Ok, have fun you two. And I'm not ready for grandchildren yet, so keep the sparks to a minimum ok? You: Mom! Ashley: I like your mom, tee hee. You: C'mon, let's go upstairs already. Ashley takes off her flats and starts rubbing your crotch through your sweatpants. You blurt out, I wish the stories that I write were my actual life! As you have wished, so shall it be. You blink and when you open your eyes again you're standing in a techy looking control room like the one from the story that you're writing, Super X. Alot of girls you used to go to school with are here, and a cousin here and there. Shanna: New recruit huh? You: What... Hey Tech. Yeah, Ashley here is genie. Shanna: Why dont we call her Genie so that we avoid confusion with our Ashley ok? Genie: Ooooh. That's kinky. I like it! Shanna: She's a catch DJ. Shanna winks at you and walks back over to her com- S.I.M.O.N., and finishes doing whatever she was doing before. Genie: So master, can we finish up from before? You: Not now Genie... Genie: Pleeeease? You: Fine... Shanna: What is she talking about? You: Nothing! Genie teleports you and herself to inside her lamp. Dang... You like it? I decorated it myself. So what's your second wish sweetie? Well... All I ever really wanted was a cute girl who'd stay with me and let me have fun with her feet when the mood strikes me. I'm gonna miss you Ashley. I wish you were free. Genie's expression changes to one of pure joy. She then hugs you to the point that it starts to hurt. Genie... Ribcage... Sorry. Thank you so much! She kisses you on the lips briefly. I will stay by your side forever. Ashley, you dont have to- I want to. And call me Genie kay? It makes everything sexier, rawr. But Genie, I'm 17. Fine, I will respect your dimension's laws, but on your 18th birthday I will go 100% cougar on you. Sound fair? Sure Genie. But until then...</span></div></div>",

Go to her. Genie winks at you. You exit the lamp and June is standing there waiting for you.<br>\r\n<u>Your Room</u><br>\r\nHubby! June hugs you tightly. Anyways I've been thinking... I know that I love to dominate and toy with mortals... but I feel as if my life and everyone that I know is having their life written out for them by some perverted lonely guy with the urge to be dominated by women... But then again what do I know right? You laugh nervously. June sets her eyes ablaze. What aren't you telling me hubby... She says as she literally starts twisting your arm. Ok ok! I'll talk! Ok... So this reality you live in... Well actually... I'm just an Avatar for the creator of this world... Basically none of this is real... I mean it's real to us but really only exists on the internet... You ever seen the Matrix? It's like that... kind of... Are you telling me that I'm not real? That hurts my feelings deeply... That you would lie to me like that... You sigh as you move the painting on your wall, revealing a portal to the real world. This is it. But under no circumstances are you to use it. Ever. It's far too dangerous to let you loose in the real world, especially with the amount of power you hold. They'd be defenseless to stop you with the current technology they possess. Plus you have that whole immortal/indestructible thing going for you. You slide the painting back in place and lead June out of your room...<br>\r\n<u>Meanwhile in the real world...</u><br>\r\nAnother chapter written... Another uneventful day. Just as you are about to close the lid on your laptop, a pair of feet exit the screen and begin to play with your face. (This reminds you of that one Ah! My Goddess OVA when Urd and Keiichi first meet, where Urd sticks her legs and feet out of the screen and plays with his face.) You're pretty sure this is just some lucid dream so you decide to just roll with it and start masturbating. After a while the sexy pair of feet that have been assaulting your face let up a bit and you see red letters on your screen simply reading \"Pull\". You figure \"Eh, what the hell?\" and pull. With almost no effort the owner of the sexy pair of feet comes flying out of the screen and lands on top of you. She shifts positions and you can see her face. Holy shit! June?! So you're the one who created me huh? You would be correct. So. Did you enjoy my little treat earlier? Oh hell yes! It was a first for me actually... Oh you'll be fun... I like you. I wonder if I still have my powers in the real world... June... Please dont set my room on fire... Puh-lease. You didn't make me that clumsy. Honestly... At this point your mom walks in. Mom: I told you to do the dishes an... hour... ago... Who is she and why is she in your room? And why is she wearing contacts that make her eyes look red? You: Mom I can exp- Actually I really cant... June: He is my soulmate. Right honey? You: Right. This is June, she's my GF. June, this is my mom. June: Hi DJ's mom! Mom: Whatever. Just use the door next time June... And get the dishes done DJ... Your mom walks away just shaking her head. See why there are almost no parents in Super X? I see but what about your father? Long gone, left when I was two years old. My parents were never married, I'm a bastard child. My mom works all the time, puts her in a bad mood when she gets home. And my two little brothers are visiting their dad this weekend, guess I should say half-brothers then... Well they're assholes anyway... Well I'm sure you dont care June. Hmm... Fascinating... What a broken family you have. I'm actually a little jealous... Tyrannical father... Older sister who gets all the praise... I'm just the outsider, what with having a soul and all... Guess we're the same in that way. Families that dont accept us for who we really are. June closes the lid on your laptop. I want us to be alone... So that I have you all to myself... June says as she puts her arm around your shoulder. How about we become friends first... and lovers later hmm? Sure June... Wait... I forgot about that lovely little detail about your lady parts.... I can shapeshift remember... Oh wow... That never dawned on me as I was writing your chapters... Ha ha. I'm a smart one. Oh DJ... That's why I love you. I guess no one would suspect that you weren't real up until 5 minutes ago. Except maybe your eyes... Silly. That's a genetic anomaly, extremely rare. June winks at you. Oh! Right. I love that evil brain of yours! You hug June. Oh... and DJ... I have to live with you... Just brainwash my mom and make her think that you've been engaged to me for the past year and moved in with us. I can do that? Yep. I designed you so that you can just pull random powers out of your ass for whatever's convenient to the storyline. You can do whatever you want. Just promise me that you'll be a good girl here in the real world okay? By my cold black heart. June says as she crosses her heart. Oh... I hate to ask you this but the dishes... June snaps her fingers. Done. Anything else? Hmm... Dunno. Just still in shock that you're actually here right now, and that this is all real. Well you'd better believe it. Cause mamma wants a foot massage. You'll oblige me wont you? June says as she makes a cute pouty face. Of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Proceed to rub your sexy future demon wifey's feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Your laptop rumbles. Out pops Halo. Your mom walks back in. Mom: What is this?

Let me tell you a story about my sidekick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Stacie's Flashback, 5 years ago</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacie's costume wasn't always the streamlined bulletproof Kevlar material it is today. She used to have a plain cloth costume. Because her third encounter with criminals ended with a bullet in her leg, she decided to at least wear a bulky bulletproof vest. At this time she picked up her sidekick Crow and even went on a couple successful missions with her. This takes place during Stacie's third mission with Crow. Stacie's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow: Slow down Stacie! This vest is heavy! Stacie: That vest saved your life yesterday Annie. Be thankful that you have it. Crow: Whatever. Hey! I see some thugs up ahead! Stacie: Wait! They're armed! You run after Crow. Thug: It's them. Fire! The thugs open fire at you and you both get hit. Thug: Grab the loot. We're out of here! You look down and see the bullet lodged in your vest. Stacie: Phew. Hey Crow. How you holdin up? Crow? Annie answer me! Annie are you ok? Are you ok Annie! You grab Crow's shoulder and roll her onto her back. You cover your mouth in shock and horror. Annie lay there motionless, with a bloody hole right in the middle of her forehead. Stacie: No... It's my fault... All mine... Never again... From now on this Raven flies solo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>End Flashback</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh... That's why you never talk about her... Sorry for asking so much. I had to tell her mother what had happened that day. She committed suicide a week later, she had lost her husband to cancer and her only child to a bullet in the same month. That day I swore to myself that I would never let that happen to another family again. I've never had another sidekick since. Stacie I had no idea... I'm fine... I've moved on with my life... Stacie rests her head on your shoulder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: You put your arm around her back.

June: That one has much darkness in her... You: No soul stealing June. We agreed on that... June: Yes. But we didn't make a deal on it. You know how my family is with deals... Catie: So who exactly is this girl DJ? June: Satanica Lucifer II, second born child of the Devil himself. Rachael: I call bullshit. As far as I'm concerned she's just some chick that can make fire. June: An Athiest huh? Your kind are especially fun to torture when your time comes... Rachael teleports over to June and punches her in the face, only to fall to her knees clutching her fist in pain. June doesn't flinch and shows no signs of damage whatsoever. Shanna runs over to Rachael and scans her. Shanna: Your hand and entire right arm are broken. Rachael: Oh? I didn't know that... Of course my arm is broken! I swear. For a genius you're pretty stupid sometimes. Shanna: Do you want me to help you or not? Rachael only grunts and walks off with Shanna. June: Any other questions? Blondie: So could you like tell us when we're gonna die? June: Not in my jurisdiction. That's a job for Azrael and the Reaper. And if I'm not mistaken the new Reaper is a young woman, she's quite attractive actually. It almost makes me jealous. Any other questions or disbelief of my existence? Catie: Why are you here? June sighs. June: A few years back I got a soul. I'm repaying humanity by doing some good for it to right the wrongs I've commited in my lifetime. Catie: I dunno. I still dont trust her. June: But I have a soul and have to masquerade around in this disguise. Catie: A soul huh? I guess that makes you a perfect little angel huh? June: But I am an angel... well... the spawn of a fallen one anyway. Same thing. You: Leave her alone Catie, she's trying. Catie: So you take the Hellspawn's side and not your own family? You: Hey I- June: She's jealous. Catie looks away briefly, confirming June's theory. You: How- June: The eyes are the window to the soul, that's how I was able to see that Addy's evil and manipulative and that Rachael is an Atheist. I have to be able to see souls to determine which are the best candidates for... No... I dont do that anymore... Happy thoughts... Catie: Should she be glowing like that? You: Uhh... June? June clenches her fist and the glow subsides. She exhales. June: Sorry about that, sometimes thinking about my old job gets me all riled up. You'd all be scared shitless if I would of transformed into my true form just then. You: You mean the wings, horns and tail? June: Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! No. I only look like a succubus when I get turned on. My true form is... I dont want to give you nightmares, I'll stop talking about it now. Addy: Well I think it's about time DJ. Dont you? You: Yeah sure. June: I'm going with you. Addy: Hey June? Can you teach me ancient domination techniques and stuff? June: I'd love to!</span></div></div>",

You: Dammit June! June: Sorry... Old habits die hard. Halo: I take it that you're one of <i>His</i>. Am I right? June: Satanica Lucifer II, pleasure to meet you. Halo: Well DJ. At least it's her and not her sister Demonica after your soul. You: After my soul? What are you talking about? June... June: She lies! She says tossing another fireball, Halo putting up a protective barrier this time. Halo: Yeah... I can totally see the lust for you that is consuming her soul as we speak... It's looks about 90% complete... You: June. Care to explain? June: Ummm... June grabs you and digs her now claw-like hands into your flesh. You feel yourself shrink a bit and your memories of the past few years beginning to blur. June opens a time portal behind Halo. Halo gets sucked in and spit back out. The date is two months ago, right before you met her. Halo: Where am I and why do you have that child spawn of Satan? June: Oh... Read my soul all you want, you'll find it quite clean. I swear by my cold black heart. June says as she puts her hand over her left breast. Halo's eyes glow white briefly before returning to normal. Halo: Hmm... I've got my eyes on you... Halo leaves. A few minutes later Shanna comes back in holding some documents, which she drops as soon as she sees you. Shanna: DJ! What happened? Why are you like 12 years old all of the sudden? June... June: It wasn't me I swear! He got sucked into a random portal and got spat out like this. I tried to help and he kind of... You: Mommy! You say as you hug June. June: ...thinks I'm his mom now... I already have two kids, I dont need another one, especially considering he's their dad... Shanna: WHAT! June: We'll it is all your fault dear, you built the time machine that brought him to me in ancient Rome, and a second time in 1066, then again during World War II... My advice. Stop messing with time... because it's pissing me off... Shanna: But I wouldn't... June: Oh but you will... All is predetermined, there is no such thing as destiny. When you were born, who your parents were, who you will marry, when you will die, it is all predetermined, no one has any say in the matter. You <i>will</i> fuck up time and create my stupid children and leave me stuck with this guy for all eternity... You run over to Shanna and hug her. You: Hi auntie Shanna! Shanna: What? Oh... um... Hi little neph! June shapeshifts to what she must've looked like when she was 12 and takes your hand. June: Come on. I want you to be my new bestest friend! You: What should I call you? June: How about Junie? You: Ok Junie... June flames into one of the empty rooms. June stares at you with her piercing red eyes. Trust only me. Love only me for ever and ever. Ok? S-sure... Anything you say... You shouldn't be scared of me... After all... who else can you trust with your dirty little secret hmm? W-what are you talking about? You have a foot fetish. I'm the only one you can trust with that secret... Anyone else would seek to use that against you. Well I guess so... June returns to her normal age and floats in front of you. She puts her now bare feet mere inches from your face. Your overwhelming pre-teen hormones get the better of you and you begin to kiss her toes. Good boy, she says patting you on the head while crossing her fingers behind her back...</span></div></div>",

June waves her hand and you are flame teleported to Halo. <br>\r\n<u>Halo's Room</u><br>\r\nWeird... Why is my name on this door.... And why is all of my stuff in here? Auntie Halo! Auntie? Do I have a sister? Shanna wants you to babysit me. Baby... Sit? She wants me to sit on you? Why? You know. Watch over me? Oh... That makes a lot more sense than babysit. Yeah fine. I'll do it. Halo opens her door and nudges you in. Go on little one. Halo plops down on her bed and spreads her wings. Man these things cramp up like crazy... We need wider hallways here... Want me to massage your wings Halo? Hmm? Uhh. Yeah, that'd be great. You sit behind Halo and begin to massage the flesh around the base of her wings. So did they hurt when they popped out? How do you know that I wasn't born an Angel?! I dunno. I just guessed. You're funny! Whatever kid... A little lower please. Ok Auntie. You begin to rub Halo's lower back. She sighs in relief. That's nice... Lower... He he... That's your butt. Just rub it... Halo lays on her stomach and rests her head on her crossed arms. You sit on her back and begin to squeeze her butt cheeks. Whoa they're like... I dunno, but they're nice... Do you wear panties under this gown thingie? Shut up and rub... Lower. You begin to rub her legs. Lower. You pause when you get to her bare feet, her perfect soles just sit there, waiting for you. Hello? Rub my feet already! You grab her ankles and bend her knees until her feet are mere inches from your face. You scoot forward until you're sitting on her nice butt. Her feet are close enough to smell now... They smell simply divine. You take her big toe and stick it in your mouth. Oh wait! I almost forgot something! I sensed that your age is incorrect. Could you shove your face into my soles for a few seconds? Mhmm! You pop her toe out of your mouth and bury your face into her silky soles. You feel yourself grow a bit. You're back to your original age, but you still cant remember a damned thing... Now then... Since I'm technically your babysitter and I did just restore you.... Rub my feet already! You get off of Halo and sit at the foot of the bed. Halo reorients herself and is now sitting on the bed with her legs dangling over the side. You grab one of her feet and begin to rub it... But Halo's pearly nail polish is still distracting...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You step into the arena that your team has created for training situations just like this. Earlier you had challenged Satanica to test your abilities. Satanica was one of the more powerful members, if not the most powerful, and you wanted to test you abilities against hers, as she stepped into the arena she swished her golden hair to the side. She didn't even take a battle stance, but instead stared at you unblinking with her deep red eyes. It didn't matter she wouldn't expect your next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began your opening move by using your matter control. You planned to shrink her, knowing that if she were smaller, her powers wouldn\u2019t be as useful. This may give you the edge you had been looking for. You aimed directly at her, focusing your matter manipulation on her. Nimbly as if she had been expecting your attack the whole time, she opened one of her time portals, your matter manipulation passing through it and away. It didn't matter. You weren't counting solely on that attack to take her down. Making yourself lighter, you sped across the room, easily jumping over a lance of flame that she had sent towards you. Making, your fist as solid as steel you threw a punch at her, bus she nimbly stepped back as your fist slammed the ground, cracking the cement around where you hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up taking battle stance once more, only to see Satanica smiling devilishly at you. Why was she making that face, and why wasn't she taking this seriously? Then it hit you, literally. Now that you were standing where Satanica was only moments before, your matter control blasted you from behind. Everything in the room began to get larger. She had planned this from the beginning; she lured you into that spot just so she could hit you with her own attack. You knew better than to let yourself be lured into such a trap, but you were too focused on your new strategy to notice what she was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter you could make your self grow again, It wasn't any trouble for you. It wouldn't have been a problem for you at least if she hadn't already launched her attack. She was on you in no time, she attempted to grab you, but you slipped out with moderate ease. She attempted to grab you again, but you rolled out of the way. You were slightly too slow though as her hand hit you hard enough to push you onto your back. Before you could recover, Satanica had you pinned with her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I win\" She said smugly smiling down at you. You couldn't disagree, and yet you weren't complaining, this was definitely one of the more pleasurable places you could have faced your defeat from. The heavenly smell made you smile \"I'll get you next time\" you tell her confidently, even though you had no idea how you would do it. From here, you could tell that you were just slightly bigger than her big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour love began to lift her foot to let you up, when you removed your helmet and gave her foot a gentle kiss between the big and second toe. Hesitantly she stopped as you climbed atop her foot and began to kiss along it moving your way up closer to her ankle. You've had experience with her feet before, but you've never been this close, never so involved. Removing one of your suit's gloves you begin to rub your hand along the soft skin of her foot. Satanica lets a small moan of appreciation escape from her lips. Knowing that you have her appreciation you use your matter manipulation to begin to massage her feet as you jump down. Satanica raises the tip of her foot resting her weight on the ball of her foot, so that her foot is at a forty-five degree angle. Walking underneath her foot, you begin to rub your hands against the soft sensitive underside of her feet. You can tell she's enjoying it as you can see her curl her toes as you do. Kissing the underside of her foot, you can taste the salty sweat on her foot from your battle, part of what gave her foot such a wonderful aroma.  Almost too soon, she lifts her foot, and picks you up in her hands. \"Why don't we continue this in my room\" she asks you giving you a wink.</span></div></div>",

June waves her hand and makes your armor disappear and uses her toes to trace circles on various parts of your body. What look like demonic tattoos appear on your flesh. As if I needed more cursed runes from you... Relax. These are only temporary... So what are they for? They prevent you from using your powers until I say so. And they upped your size by just a bit. You feel yourself grow to be just smaller than June's foot. Ok so what no- Ooof! You're cut off as June pins you to her floor with her foot... Not that that's a bad thing... You know what... Actually... June scoops you up and sandwiches you between her feet. Comfy? Yes... You say blushing slightly. No need to be embarrassed, I am your wife you know. I know... Plus you love being dominated by me... She says as she begins to massage your body with her toes. I could really screw with you you know... How so? Well you've seen that I can change your size... Um... I did that... It hit myself with my own attack... Knew I should've done engulfing style rather than projectile... True... But I made you bigger after that... You know just for doubting my power I think I will screw with you...<br>\r\n<u>And Then</u><br>\r\nJune lets you go and again pins you with her foot. Because I do like you I'll use my foot to do this. But it's still a punishment. Junes uses her toes to draw more runes on your body... But also uses them to pull and stretch various parts of your body... While pushing at others... She finishes by pointing at you with her index finger and literally zapping you. Ouch! Why did... You... Do... That... Why do I sound like a bimbo?! You look down and realize that June has turned into a girl... She materializes a mirror for you. And another thing... Why do I look like some airheaded blonde?! Well... I basically turned you into a living Barbie doll as punishment. Not cool! June points her finger at you again and burns off your clothes. Annnnd... You're naked now... Instinctively you cover yourself as you blush. Please stop this June... You say as you look up at her pleadingly... I wont... Because deep down you enjoy it... Cause you're a Masochist... She says as she pulls your arms aside with her toes and begins to rub your body with them. You like the humiliation and degradation that I give to you... I mean... It's the only logical reason why you'd let me continue to do this to you... Just playing with you like a doll... She says as she focuses on your nether regions... Making you moan and breathe more heavily... Well that and I can see into your soul... You know there's no hiding anything from me honey...<br>\r\n<u>The Revelation</u><br>\r\nF-fine... I like it when when you tease me... And degrade me... You say as your blush increases... I know. June says with a smile. So how about I keep you like this? June! Kidding... Learn to take a joke will ya? I'll turn you completely back to normal in a couple of hours. Fair enough? Ok... Deal... Shake on it? June... You are very dense you know that? Oh... You were... Joking again... Ha ha... You know... I'm surprised you're not hornier... Seeing as you're this close to my feet... She says as she wiggles her toes in your face... Well I... You shove her big toe into your mouth. Impressive... You sure you haven't practice will this sort of thing before? You glare at your wife. Again. Kidding. It doesn't surprise that you can fit it though. You tend inhale your food... Maybe your mouth just stretched out from having feet shoved into it on a regular basis... He he he. She takes her toe from you... Now then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

WW: That's Weeping Willow. BD: And Black Death to you. Whatever, I'll just touch your man friend here and rot him from the inside out... slowly... he he he... WW: Hey! I want to burn him with my black acid tears! BD: Let's face it little sister. Your powers suck. Ooh. Look at me! I cry and it burns! I'm a 14 year old zombie girl. I'm so scary! WW: I'll show you! She vomits a black liquid onto the floor and disappears into the hole that forms. A hole appears behind you and she pulls you in. June: DJ!<br>\r\n<u>Uh, Zombie HQ?</u><br>\r\nBlack Death: Hello human knight. I am Vendetta. And that disgusting useless waste of reanimated flesh over there is my little sister Pandora. Weeping Willow starts crying. Stop doing that! You're burning holes in the floor! You: Why are you so mean to her? Vendetta: You hang out with Satan's daughter yet you judge me. Wow. You: She knocked me out and kidnapped me! I did kinda like it though... Why? None of your business... Tell me. No, you're dead... it wouldn't be fun... Racist! Since when are Zombies a race? Since I said so. Childish. Am not! Go bother your sister or something. She crosses her legs and starts rubbing one of her pale blue feet. D-do your feet hurt? Why do you care? Because I um... uh... You like feet dont you? That's why the demoness was barefoot... I... Pandora! I have a surprise for you! She says in a singsong voice. What? Foot lover, she says as she points to you. By looking at them, Padora was probably 14 or 15 when she died, and Vendetta 19 or 20. Wow, random thought. Hmm, they look Goth, albiet light blue skinned. You bet the modern Goths got the look from these two. More random thoughts. Footboy! Wha? Pay attention... Now we're dead, well, undead anyway. That aside, our bodies are fresh as daisies, so you should no problem worshiping our feet.</span></div></div>",

Pandora puts her bare little blue feet in your lap and flexes her toes. Ok. You can do something now or whatever... You begin to rub Pandora's feet, which seems to bring her spirits up exponentially. She soon starts sighing happily. Vendetta: Time's up! My turn. Pandora: Buzz off wench. Vendetta seems extraordinarily pissed now, she tackles Pandora and the two start pummeling each other. This wrestling goes on for 15 minutes, and you wish popcorn was invented right about now... Suddenly the building starts shaking. Vendetta and Pandora stop fighting for a second and try to figure out what's going on. The wall finally caves and you see Shanna standing next to an automated battering ram. Shanna: DJ! You: Shanna! I'm so glad to see you! Pandora: I'll take the girl, you take care of him. Before you can react Vendetta knocks you out cold with a tree branch. You awaken to find yourself chained up and see Shanna, gagged and chained up dangling over a pit of black goop. Vendetta: You're awake. That's good, we need you to see this. Panora pulls a lever and you watch a struggling Shanna get slowly lowered into the mysterious goop. She is swallowed up by it and you cant even make a sound because of the shock. What feels like an eternity later Pandora pulls the switch and Vendetta lets you go. Shanna emerges from the pit, but what you see shocks you further. She's dead... that is until her eyes shoot open and she takes her first breath. Shanna looks over herself and then breaks the chains as if they were noodles. She immediately attacks Vendetta and Pandora and easily beats them. Shanna walks over and rips the chains off you. You: Shanna... Shanna: I know, I'm undead now. You: I think blue is a nice look for you. Shanna: You always know the right thing to say to me DJ, but... You: We'll make it work. I have a feeling June can help you. Shanna: We have plenty of time, I'm not showing any signs of decay or Rigor Mortis. Cmon then, let's go find Devil girl. After what feels like hours of walking, you see an ornately decorated evil looking castle. You: Think that's it Shanna? Shanna: Only one way to find out... Shanna prepares her battering ram until you stop her. You: Why dont you let me handle this one, June and I... bonded earlier... You walk over to the front gates of the castle and knock on the large wooden door. A few seconds later a slave looking demon girl answers the door. Demon girl: I assume you're here to see my mistress? Follow me. <br>\r\n<u>Casa de Hija del Diablo</u><br>\r\nShanna: Doesn't that collar hurt your neck? Demon girl: I quite enjoy the pain actually. You: Why do you, well, actually look like a demon and June doesn't? Demon girl: Mistress June is the Dark Master's daughter, she is by far more powerful and skilled than the likes of me and can hide her true appearance, you know, the horns, the wings, the tail, the forked tongue, all that stuff. Shanna: But you look kinda human in a way. My father was human, I'm a hybrid. Shanna: Oh... So that's why your horns and things are managable looking. Demon girl: Correct. If you ever saw Mistress June's <i>True</i> form, you'd see what a real demon looks like... I messed myself the first time I saw it... You get used to it after a few years... You: Funny, in the future she never showed me what she really looked like, and we're good friends there. Shanna: Maybe she's self conscious about it? Demon girl: We're here...<br>\r\n<u>Casa de Hija del Diablo, The Throne Room</u><br>\r\nThe demon girl enters the throne room and kisses June's hand then kneels before her. June: That will be all Cynthia, you are dismissed. Cynthia: Of course Mistress June. She scurries off. June: DJ, and friend. What brings you here? You: Shanna here is kinda... June: I'm no idiot. I can see she's been turned undead. I can help her... for a price... Shanna: Truly the Devil's own daughter... You: Name it. June: I want... your soul DJ... You: I kind of need that... June: No you dont, not while you're alive anyway. In exchange, I will restore Shanna, and you may live happily together until you die. But then you will be mine forever and never see Shanna again, unless you want her to come with us instead... You: I accept... June: Excellent. You: Ok, so what do I sign- June: I'm not my father. She gets up from her throne and kisses you on the lips. A few seconds later a strange mark appears on your chest over your heart. June: When that stops beating... You're mine for all eternity. You: What about- June: My father wont bother us, your deal is with me not him. As for you Shanna. June walks up and kisses Shanna on the lips and the blue drains from her skin and flows into June's lips. Shanna looks dumbfounded... but alive. Shanna: I hate to say this, she's a better kisser than you DJ... June: Do you want the bad news now? You: What bad news? I'm already condemned now. June: Condemned to forever be the property of a sexy demon, must be horrible. Now as I was saying, since you made a pact with me here in 1066 A.D., you will not be allowed to return to the future. You are speechless. Shanna: I'll stay here with you till the end. But I think the rest of the team should go home. You: Agreed. June, send everyone save for me and Shanna home. June: As you wish. You: Wait! Let me say goodbye to them first. June: As you wish. Everyone teleports into June's throneroom. Catie: DJ! You: Hey Catie. I hate to tell you this, but do to circumstances and Pacts... I'm kinda stuck here forever... Catie: Pact? DJ! You didn't! You: Of course not! I made it with her. Catie: Who's she? June: She, is Satan's daughter. Catie glares at you. You: It was the only way to restore Shanna's... aliveness... Catie: How- Shanna: Dipped in Zombie goo... Catie: Oh... In that case you need all the support you can get. Addy: Well I'm outta this rathole time period. See ya Deej! Addy and the others step through the portal while yourself, Shanna and Catie stay behind. Catie: I still dont trust <i>Her</i>... June: DJ trusts me. She says as she smiles evilly. Catie: I need to have a talk with you later DJ... June: By all means do it now. He's mine no matter which way you slice it. And I'm sure he'll enjoy it. Oh, and you're all free to stay and live here if you so choose. Catie: I'd rather not stay at Casa de Hell. June: Suit yourself, but do mind what year it is, I'm sure you've read history books... Catie: Fine... June: DJ can bunk with me. You and Shanna may bunk with Cynthia. Shanna: Hold up. You said that- June: Do you know who I am? I lied. DJ is mine not just after he dies, but before then as well. Catie: I wanna see this contract. June: It's right here. June says as she points to her lips...</span></div></div>",

Shanna: What's so funny? We've fought you and won before. June: Yes you have. In the future, where apparently I'm a happy-go-lucky pushover. I probably have a soul too, dont I DJ? You: You dont now? June: Of course not! Souls make you weak. I'd sooner feed my eyes to Cerberus before I claim my soul. Catie: Huh? June: Idiots. Demons must accept their souls willingly. Every Demon has one waiting for them in the Great Soul Vault, it's their choice whether they accept it or not. However, our souls are lost with our virginity, and save for the Succubi and Incubi, we Demons are generally celibate. DJ: Umm. June... June: Yes? You: In the future we have a kid... And you still have your soul... June's expression changes from confident to mortal terror. June? June: Impossible... To allow myself to be impregnated by a lowly human... I must prevent this here and now... Catie dives in front you to act as sheild. You look down and see that she has June's sword imbedded in her body. Catie: I thought you'd try and be sneaky and kill DJ. Lucky for for me that I am indestructable! June only growls and puts her sword back in its sheath. You: This is getting out of hand. Genie! Genie appears in June's throne room in a puff of smoke. Genie: You rang master? You: Please show June the future. June watches and says nothing the whole time. After seeing her own daughter, June finally speaks. June: Fine, we'll do this your way. DJ, you and Cynthia will watch. Shanna: Bring it! Shanna takes a mace off the wall and gets in attack stance. Catie turn her arms into slime-swords. June only blinks and a massive wall of fire heads toward Catie and Shanna. Catie turns into a giant goo bubble and engulfs Shanna. After the smoke clears, Shanna is standing in a puddle of Catie, but is unharmed. Shanna smacks June in the face with the mace, and the mace shatters like glass. June doesn't even flinch. June: Give up yet? Shanna: Not even a scratch! June yawns. You turn to Cynthia. You: Does this mean- Cynthia: Yes, you still belong to her. Although, I do believe things will be a little different since she knows about her future daughter now. Now I'm feeling a little alone. Care to... keep me company? You: But then Shanna, June, Genie, and Catie would all be pissed at me. Cynthia: Dont worry, I can talk my way out of anything with Mistress June. You: I suppose I can talk to the other three as well. Let's go. Cynthia grabs your hand and skips to her room giggling.<br>\r\n<u>Cynthia's Room</u><br>\r\nCan I tell you a secret? Sure. I told you that my mother was a demon... Yes. Your point? June is my mother... What?! But she told me... Mom lies... Alot... Why does she treat you like her slave then? It's customary of Demon culture. You should see the way my grandfather treats June. Now I'm dripping now, so come on... She says as she grabs you and starts kissing you... Your future daughter's half sister, and future wive's daughter is making out with you right now... This is so wrong, but you cant make yourself pull away...</span></div></div>",

Oh goodness June... Hey. I need my relief. Which reminds me. Two red portals open up, the dates appear in fire above the portals. 25 AD, and 2141 AD. Two girls that look alot like June walk out.

Russian Woman: Why would you assume that every Russian female is named Natasha! You: Beacuase you look exactly like your granddaughter, who is named Natasha. Russian Woman: Capitalist dog! Did you say granddaughter? You: Yeah, I'm from the future. Russian Woman: Oh, excuse my earlier rudeness, Natalya Greggorovovich. Pleased to meet you. The room starts shaking. You: You dont happen to know Shellshock's grandma do you? May-Lin: Faultline is visiting family in England, there's no way she's close enough cause this. A giant metal tentacle claw grabs you and whisks you away from the Nazi camp. You: PLEASE be Shanna... <br>\r\n<u>The Mothership</u><br>\r\nA few moments later you arrive at the source of the robo-tentacles, the mothership... Your life officially cannot get any weirder... You arrive into the interior of the mothership where the tentacle promptly drops you, you could swear it's laughing at you. Alien Girl: Hello Earthling, I am Alienne. My people are called the Verdesians. Verde, spanish for green, ironic considering that you have green skin and hair. Do you not find me attractive? I didn't say that. It's just... Well we aren't even the same species. One year from now, prepare for the shock of your life when you meet Samantha, then come talk to me about who's the alien. How can you possibly know that? This vessel travels faster than the speed of light, which is theoretically impossible, weird things happen when you're going that fast, and time is occasionally distorted, sometimes you end up in the past, sometimes the future. What's so bad about this Samantha? She's Atlantean, literally part fish. And as for you... Well, just wait... Tell me, I can handle it. Well... you're are going to become a genderless, mood ring skinned, squishy little jello ball alien looking squidlike creature. Your jaw hits the floor. Back up, genderless? That's the only part of that sentence that bothers you? You will have no genitals of any kind. I cant live knowing that for an entire year, is there some kind of wierd alien gadget onboard that will make it happen? You'd do it willingly? As it is written, so shall it be. You do realize that I have to keep as a pet for one year so that a paradox is not created right? No earth for DJ for an entire year, only this spaceship. I understand. Dont you wanna say goodbye to Shanna first, or at least explain what happened? It's better she not know. Plus I wanna see the look on everyone's faces when I stroll off this thing and say \"I come in peace, just kidding, I'm going to destroy your planet now. Nah, kidding again, I really do come in peace.\" You wont have legs. Just get it over with. As you wish. Alienne walks out and comes back a few minutes later with a small energy pistol looking thing and blasts you with it. That's it? Look at your hand, then my feet, then your hand again. You look at your hand and aren't surprised to see a relatively thin green tentacle, I sorta looks like Jello in a way. You look at Alienne's bare feet, they're light green, but other than that look just like a human woman's feet. You look at your tentacle and find that it's now pink. That doesn't bother you at all? Not at all. You stare at Alienne, Except for her light green skin and dark green hair, she looks surprisingly human, but then there's her eyes, they're huge, totally black and almond shaped, you know, the stereotypical \"generic\" alien eyes. In your opinion she's still super cute. You're freakin me out, you have no eyes, I cant tell if you're staring at me or not... Then how am I seeing you right now? I dont know! Now just can it! Alienne lightly kicks you in the face. You immediately go over to her foot and start sucking on her toes. Hey! If you're gonna do that then at least rub my other foot. You honor her request and start rubbing her other foot...</span></div></div>",

But the odds of intelligent life existing beyond earth are- Catie: Please dont bore us with the statistics. Losing DJ is hard enough already... They all watch as the U.F.O. touches down and the door opens. Alienne steps out holding you like a small dog or cat. Alienne: Computer. What part of earth are we on and what is the date? Alienne's Computer: Berlin, Germany. April, 1945. Alienne: Well they dont look like Nazis... Except the short one. I'm unsure about her... Addy: Hey! Shanna: Why'd you decide to come to earth? Alienne: My home planet is boring. I wanna live here. I brought a gift. Wake up Sparky! You: Meep. Mai: That is so cute! Can I hold it? Alienne: Sure. Go ahead. Go on. You float over to Mai and begin touching her face all over. Addy: Look out it's attacking! Mai just giggles. Mai: Tee hee. Yes. I have a face. Ha ha.

I've had this one for about 60 of your earth years and he's never given me any problems. Addy: How old are you?! Alienne: 105. On my planet that's barely considered a young adult. Addy: So not fair... Shanna: What does he eat? Alienne: Pretty much anything... try not to drop too much food... cause when he eats too much he starts to burp... alot... Shanna: You keep calling it a he. It has no visible genitalia... Your friend will find out in a second... Mai: Ohhh... He's a frisky one... Everyone watches in shock as your tentacles slip down Mai's suit and begin to massage her boobs. Mai only stands there with a blissful look on her face. Alienne: Does that answer your question? Shanna: Fine. So do you wanna just stay with us... You float over to Shanna and give her a peck on the lips. Shanna: You can stay too Sparky. Tee hee.</span></div></div>",

Mood ring huh? So you like feet huh? Alex says as she begins to remove her boots and socks, setting you down in front of her. Have at it! You focus and exhale deeply. Your tentacles split, giving you 6 limbs to work with. Alex smiles. It better be good. Of course my Queen. You say as grab one of her feet and kiss her purple painted toes. Tee hee. You're cute.

The two of you sit on her couch across from each other and she places her feet in your lap. Retracting your gloves and mask, you unzip her boots and take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing part of a largely female team with all of them aware of your foot fetish, you\u2019ve actually done this quite a lot before so you more or less know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start with you open a bottle of lotion from the pedicure case and pour some into your hands. The lotion is strawberry scented and feels very cool to the touch. Wrapping your hands around the superheroine\u2019s right foot, you begin to rub the lotion into every part of it. You rub it into her heel, sole, followed by each of her toes. After that you switch feet and repeat the process. Julia\u2019s feet feel really nice. They are a little warm and sweaty from being in her boot but they also feel soft and smooth. You enjoy touching them a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick Change for her part smirks a little as she feels you rubbing the lotion into her feet \u201cMmm that feels great.\u201d She tells you wiggling her toes slightly as she feels your massage. The cool lotion feels really refreshing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes maybe 5 minutes to rub to get the lotion on every area of her feet but you keep rubbing them longer because you really like doing it. Julia knows that you are probably dragging this out because you enjoy it but she doesn\u2019t say anything because she really likes the massage as well. You spend a total of 20 minutes just giving her feet a rubdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter applying the lotion and massaging your teammate\u2019s feet, you focus on her toenails. You notice that her toenails are a little bit long so you clip them for her being very careful not to hurt her and keep them nicely shaped. Julia completely trusts you and doesn\u2019t even flinch as you this. You know that the girls on your team like to gossip and you can\u2019t help but suspect that your reputation as a good pedicurist is growing among them. When you are done clipping her nails you smooth them out using her nail file. Once you finish filing them, you work on polishing them for her. Julia actually already has her nails painted red (she seems to keep her feet well taken care and probably gets pedicures pretty regularly) but you notice a couple of chips in the polish and apply a fresh coat for them. You go very slowly working on her right foot first making sure that you don\u2019t get any polish on any other part of her foot besides her toenails. Once you done applying polish to each of the nails, you place her foot down on the couch next to your leg to dry while you work on her other foot but your friend has a more playful idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh uh DJ.\u201d She tells you bringing her newly painted toes to your lips and giving you a dominant smile. \u201cYou can dry them quicker than that can\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in sync with her, you smile slightly knowing what she wants you to do. Holding her foot gently, you blow on each of her toenails to dry them out. Once they are dry you place her foot down gently and begin painting the nails of her other foot. As you finish painting them, Julia brings that foot to your lips and makes you blow dry on her left foot the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally when you are done she inspects your work and nods approvingly. \u201cMmm Nice job!\u201d She says pleased. \u201cThanks DJ.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. All the activity involving her feet is really causing your foot fetish to go into overdrive and you\u2019re definitely longing to take Julia\u2019s feet and start worshiping them to your heart\u2019s content. As for Quick Change, she feeling really playful and is enjoying dominating you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I see... she says while a smile slowly forms on her lips. She sticks her foot in front of your face and points her toes down. Genie: Master... Would you be a dear and kiss my toes? You: I- I'd love too... You grab her foot and passionately kiss her toes... Genie: This is the best! Alex: Have fun you two.

You dont even need to ask! You begin passionately making out with Genie's foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternate World...<br>\r\nAlex: DJ! Hide! You: Hmm? What? All of the sudden a wave of green slime rolls in and reforms itself into Catie. Catie: Hi \"cuzz\". You: You aren't still mad at me about earlier? Catie: Of course not! I love you like a brother! Alex motions with her hands the \"death\" sign of a hand across the throat. But you ignore it and follow Catie to her room. You: So what was this big- You are interrupted by Catie tackling you and smooshing your face with her feet. It's not bad at all. Catie: My cousin is gonna be in for a rude awakening when he gets back here. But for now I'll just play with you. Sound good? You nod yes. I freakin love you! She morphs her body and reconfigures it so she can hug you and grind you face with her feet at the same time...</span></div></div>",

What does it do Emily? Emily: Anti-dimensional portal! You: Whatever. Your dumb ass cant even get the thing to work. Emily telekinetically forces you to your knees. Emily: If I didnt need your powers for world domination and the destruction of certain people groups that I hate I would've killed you when I was 5. She lets you go and finishes up what she was doing before. You: Harsh much? She simply ignores you and continues her work. The machine unexpectedly flares up and an energy tendril grabs you and pulls you in. The machine breaks. You look up and see Emily smiling blissfully? WTF is going on? Emily: Lexi! She runs up and hugs you. You: WTF is going on! Stacy: I believe I can explain that. You: WTF! Stacy: I believe that your dimension's resident genius simultaneously created an inter-dimensional portal as I did. Resulting in the Lexi's being swapped. You: Mindfuck much? Leah: You are nothing like my sister, she's all sweet and nice. It makes me gag. You: That's you in my dimension. Leah: Excuse me, I need to go blow my brains out now... and then come back to life like I always do... damned Reaper powers... Leah walks out to kill herself, which she apparently does alot... Scarlet only stares at you and licks her lips. You: Uh... Stacy... What's up with Scarlet? Stacy: She's probably just hungry again... Scarlet runs over to you at super speed, grabs you, and whisks you to her room... You: Scarlet... I've never told anyone this before, but you are really starting to scare me... Scarlet: Just relax and enjoy child. She says as her eyes glow slightly... You: Mind control doesn't wor- What are your orders mistress? You say in a zombielike fashion. Scarlet: Take your top off and unhook your bra. You: Of course mistress. You robotically take your top and bra off, and are now sitting topless in front of a bi-sexual vampire... Scarlet lunges forward and clamps down on your left breast and begins sucking the blood from it. You just sit there as if nothing is wrong with this picture. After 3 minutes Scarlet finishes and snaps her fingers. You look down, then at Scarlet. You: Scarlet! WTF! You say quickly covering up with your arms. Scarlet: You are a lesbian, correct? You: Well yeah, but I'm also a... Scarlet: Virgin. I can smell it on you from a mile away. You blush madly. You: You're the first person to ever see my boobs... Scarlet: Isn't that sweet. Like your blood. Sorry about that, it's been about a decade since I last partook of Virgin blood. You: And you didnt ask the lesbian if you could suck on her boob because? Scarlet: I hadn't fed in a while, I was irrational... You: It's fine, my boob only hurts a little now. You put your bra and shirt back on and head back to Emil- Stacy's Lab. You: Ok, I'm bac- Ally: Sweet dreams! Ally shoots you with a tranquilizer dart and you fall almost instantaneously. You wake up tied up and with Ally sitting in front of you with her white non-slip nurse shoes off. Ally: Took you long enough. Kiss. You: Excuse me? Last time I checked <u>I</u> was in charge. Not you. Ally: You lesbian bitch! I told you to kiss my feet! She backhands you across the face. Your eyes set ablaze and the ropes start to burn. Ally: Oh no you dont! Ally stabs you in the neck with a syringe. And your powers quit on you. You: Hey- Ally: Meta-gene inhibitor. No powers for you for the next 3 hours! Now kiss! You: Well played Nurse Naughty, well played. You begrudgingly start kissing her white stockinged feet. Loving it. But not showing it. Good girl! She pats you on the head. Unknown to Ally you have a double Meta-gene, one for matter manipulation and your original... body transformation... You turn your teeth into shark teeth and bite Ally's foot, not hard enough to sever any digits, but hard enough to give yourself a nice distraction. You: I work on my own terms bitch! You turn yourself into a snake and slither out. Back in Stacy's Lab, you turn back to normal. You: Ok! No more funny business! Elana: I got your back sis. You: This is so messed up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in your world...<br>\r\nYou2: My head. Stacy... Stacy: Go Lexi Go! You2: Huh? Did you and Emily switch to mess with me? This isn't funny. Emily: I beg your pardon? I am no cheerleader, I'm an evil genius! You2: Ha ha. Funny. Elana! How's my favorite sister? Elana: I hate your guts. Leah: I still love you sis. She says teleporting over and hugging you. You2: Ahh! Leah! Dont rip my arm off again! I had to beg Ally for a week and be her bitch for two just to get her to heal it for me. Ally: Lexi, I always heal you. No strings attached. Leah: And I would never hurt you Lexi! Though you could stand to be a little nicer to me once in a while... You2: Leah, such accusations hurt me deeply. You can feel Emily's signature touch inside your head. Emily: She's oblivious to the fact she's in a alternate universe from her own, and a hellish one apparently... And she's... sweet and fun loving... Excuse me, I need to go and vomit now, this niceness of her brain is making me very ill... Stacy: OMG! We can be besties now Lexi! At least until Ms. Sourpuss gets back to yell at me some more... You2: OMG! Wanna go give each other mani-pedis? Stacy: Eeep! You know it! The two of you run off to Stacy's room... Elana: Someone gag me now, I think I'm gonna be sick. Leah: I like her! Leah smiles and teleports, presumably to Lexi and Stacy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the alternate world...<br>\r\nElana: Lexi! You're soooo awesome at giving foot massages. You're so assertive now. I kinda like it! You: Thanks. I kinda have to be, you know, being leader and all. Elana: Well our Lexi is basically the slave-girl to nearly all of the team, save for me and a great few others. You: Well our Elana is just... Well I cant say with you being her double and all. Catch my drift? Elana: Oh... So she's like our Leah? You: Pretty much. Elana: Oh... You: Hey. Cheer up, you're the only friend I've got here, and my sister at that. Elana: Thanks Alexis. Kiss? She says as she puts her foot in front of your face and points her toes down. You: Sure sis. You plant a sloppy wet kiss on her toes and start licking her feet from there. Elana: Tee hee. You stop dead in your tracks in shock. Elana: Huh? Oh right. I dont giggle in your world do I? You: Never. I almost wish I could swap you for our Elana. Elana: Me too, but then you might create an imbalance that would destroy both our worlds. You: Right. And your Emily <u>doesn't</u> wanna kill me 24/7, but she doesnt seem all that bright... Elana: She isn't, she's our little cheerleader, just like how Nicolette is our wonderful maid. But she's visiting family in France right now. You: Ha ha, so is our Nicolette. You: Shelby. Elana: Plays well with others. You: Abrasive. You both smile and giggle. Elana: Rose. You: Emo. Elana: Happy. You: Tori. Elana: Preppie. You: Goth. Elana: Edy. You: Trigger happy. Elana: Decisive and calculating. You: Nessa? Elana: Our other slave girl. You: Dominatrix! Elana: Dez? You: Cruel... Elana: She's like the team's mom! You: Jackie? Elana: Loves everything to death! You: Hates the world and curses her existance. Elana: Petra? You/Elana: Twisted! You: Ha ha, this was fun! Elana: Oh. What about Jane? You: She's ok. I just tell her that I cant stand brats. She stalks me. Elana: Hmm... She stalks Leah here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the real world...<br>\r\nYou2: Stacy... mmm... I love your new pedicure! Leah: So do I! Mmmm... Stacy: Awww! You two! You're the ones that gave it to me remember? You2: Tee hee. Right! Stacy: It's so awesome to have you two worshiping my feet...</span></div></div>",

You: I've got the isometrics perfect this time, I'm sure of it! DJ over the holocomm: You're so hot when you talk nerdy to me. You: I know. So I'll talk to you later, I have some last minute tweaking to do on the anti-dimensional portal. Arrivederci! DJ over the holocomm: Cute. Later! To your surprise the portal spontaneously activates and sucks you in. You: Uggh. My head. CeCe. Hannah. When'd you get here? Hannah: I love you! Hannah runs up and hugs you. You: Nice to see you too Hannah. Are you feelin alright? That's CeCe's thing... CeCe: Like I'd ever hug you. Bitch. You: Something is not right here... Amanda can you- Holy! Why are you in your underwear? Amanda: What? You dont like seeing me in my bra and panties? Plus I even put on my sexy heels, just for you! You: Ok. Wait. Where's Madeline? Amanda: Probably getting herself off somewhere. Your jaw hits the floor. Madeline. OUR Madeline? The same Madeline who constantly hits me over the head with her freakin scepter all the time for \"sinning\"? Amanda: Yes. Only she hits when dont wanna play with her. You: I must be hallucinating. CeCe pinches you. You: Oww! CeCe: Nope, not a hallucination. He he. All of the sudden you feel your boobs being groped, but no one's there- Hoodie... You: Hoodie! Hoodie uncloaks and is doing exactly what you thought. Hoodie: You rang Shanna? You: Oiy vey... Suddenly you see a red blur speeding towards you and you end up on the floor, Liz now stratling your chest. You: Hey Liz. Liz: Ello love. And I mean LOVE. She winks at you seductively. You: No way! Liz? Liz: Hoodie. Status? Hoodie: Firm and perky with just a tad of squish. Liz: Good girl. Here's $20. Hoodie: Awesome! Hoodie snatches the bill from Liz's hand and literally vanishes. Bianca: I'm surprised you didnt fall because of my powers. Liz: Oh. I fell alright. Shanna here caught me. She smiles at you. Carolina: Elizabeth! Are you really going to do that to my daughter while I'm in the room? Liz: Took ya long enough to realize granny. Is it time for your tea and crumpets yet? You: Is that another bizarre British thing? Liz: Yes. Now hold on. I have a feeling that your mum wants to pummel me right about now. Liz grabs you and whisks you to her room at super speed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the real world...<br>\r\nYou2: A little pain never hurt anyone. CeCe: Oh my! Are you ok Shanna?! You2: Since when do you care CeCe? CeCe starts crying a little. CeCe: Since always! You2: I dont recall giving you a whiny little bitch program. I did put one in Hannah though... Hannah: Excuse me! You2: Unit 17, manual shutdown, authorization code 5. Hannah shuts down and falls on her side. That'll teach her to mind her tongue. CeCe: Shanna! You told us that you'd never do that to us! You2: Unit 18... CeCe: Gah! I'm sorry! CeCe gets on her knees and hugs your legs. You2: Fine... Anyone else have questions? Madeline: Tisk tisk. First lust. Now rage. Will the disappointments ever cease? You2: Oh cut the holier than thou crap. You're more of a shameless slut then I'll ever be. Madeline: I beg your pardon! I will have you know that I have been celibate my entire life! Amanda: Shanna, are you sure that you're feeling ok? You seem a little snappy today... You2: Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Amanda winks at Liz. Before you know it Liz is behind you and has you in a vice grip. Amanda: Tell us who or what you really are! You2: I'm Shanna. Your best friend since the 6th grade. Amanda: What is my favorite color? You2: Lavender. Hoodie: What is my mom's middle name! You2: You're a runaway we picked up in New York, how should I know that? Liz: Where am I from. You2: You were a foreign exchange student in my 9th grade year from London, England. Your house is on the street the Prime Meridian runs through. Madeline: What church am I from? You2: Our Lady of Perpetual Hope, 1206 Baker Street, Provo Utah. The largest Catholic Church in an otherwise Mormon dominated area. Can I go now. Bianca: What about me? You2: What about you? You still haven't told us anything about yourself. Bianca: She's Shanna. CeCe: Then why is she so mean to me? CeCe starts crying again. You2: Aww CeCe. Give Mamma a hug. CeCe: Shanna! CeCe runs up and hugs you as Liz lets you go. <i>Suckers.</i> You: Unit 17, manual override, reboot, authorization code 3. Hannah gets back up and gives you her signature cold stare. Hannah: How decent of you. She walks off to... do whatever it is Androids with anger issues do... You: So, now that that's cleared up, what do you guys wanna do? Amanda: You answered correctly, but you still didnt tell why you were all pyscho earlier. You point to your head. You2: Experiment, you were there correct? Amanda: Yes. Why? You2: I was not like I am now back then correct? Amanda: Yes. What are you trying to say? You walk over to Amanda. You2: What I'm saying is I'm... You kiss her on the lips. ...unpredictable. Got it? Amanda: Yeah. She says blissfully. I mean Shanna! I told you no a thousand times! She slaps you on the cheek. She wont admit it, but she liked it. You2: Amanda. Amanda: What? You2: You're still blushing. Amanda: Eeep! Amanda runs off to her room. You2: Any other questions? No? Ok then, if you need me I'll be in my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the alternate world...<br>\r\nLiz: Cmon now Shanna, you know you liked it! You: Well yes. But not quite so rough with the teeth next time ok? My nether region is gonna be sore for a week... Liz: You'll get used to it, I know I have. She winks at you. You: What did I get myself into? Liz quickly gets dressed and buzzes off somewhere. Leaving you naked on her bed, with only the blankets to cover yourself. Well, I better get dressed... CeCe: Aww. But then I cant have my fun. She says as she steps out of the shadows. You: Yes CeCe? CeCe: Why dont you lay back down, and I'll comfort you. You: Cmon CeCe, you and I both know that I didnt design your genitals to be functional for you or Hannah. You were originally created as playthings for DJ remember? CeCe: Yes, and it still doesn't make sense to me why you didnt finish us! You: Because DJ only has a thing for feet remember? CeCe: Huh? Since when? That douchebag is a sex addict. I always thought you made us to help you taunt and degrade him for that specific reason. You: I would never! And he isn't even... He's a virgin and he's had a foot fetish since he was like 8 years old. He's a sweet guy! CeCe: Oh, I thought he only recently reformed himself last year after that portal incident. Or did you forget already? It suddenly dawns on you that you really are in this crazy alternate world DJ was talking about... So that means... You: CeCe... You say with lust heavy in your voice. CeCe: S-shanna. You just had sex less than 5 minutes ago! You: I cant help it. You're just so yummy looking right now CeCe... You grab her bare foot and start madly licking it, slowly working your way up her leg. CeCe: S-shanna! You're at her thigh now... CeCe: Mom! You stop. You: I never thought I'd see the day when you called me mom. You really are my favorite Android. You say hugging her and petting her hair. CeCe: Shanna I... You: I know CeCe. I know... CeCe: But I know you're not the Shanna from my dimension. Our Shanna would've deactivated me the minute I talked to her like I just did to you. That's why I'm always so cold to her. Hannah thinks so too, but she's just a kiss-ass. I wanna go home with you! She says hugging you and crying. You: It's ok CeCe. I'll figure out a way to get around the whole paradox destruction of the universe thing, just for you. CeCe: I love you mommy. You sigh. You: If only my Hannah would realize I feel the same for her as I do for CeCe. And you too CeCe2... CeCe only hugs you tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the real world again...<br>\r\nYou peek into Hannah's room. Hannah: Aggh! Why do I feel like this! I cant tell Shanna! I do love her. But she wont love me back, I've already gone too far with the bitch thing. If I acted like who I really am then she'd probably think I was broken and just reprogram me again and again till she get's it right... I have to ask CeCe what she thinks... You: Oh my... Not even my CeCe is <i>this</i> broken... This world is boring, there's no point in trying to take it over, mine's more fun anyway...</span></div></div>",

You sigh. You win Catie... for the third time in a row... Luna: Hey guys! Whatcha doin? You: Losing at chess... Catie: Whipping my cousin's butt at chess! Luna: Hmm... Cousin... whipping... butt... Oooooh! You: Dont you dare Luna! Luna's irises turn pink. Luna: Lust. She says as she looks at Catie. Catie looks at you and licks her lips before diving across the table and sitting on your chest. Luna: Ooh hoo hoo! Fun! You: Catie! Snap out of it! We're cousins! Catie: I dont think of you as a cousin, I think of you as a little brother... And no one can love you... like a sister can... Catie says as she grabs your arms and forces you to grope her boobs. <i>Oh... they're nice... No! Bad!</i> Catie: You like bro? You: Gnnnah... urrgg... Yes! Luna: He he he... perfect... Luna says as she slips her hand down her pants... Luna: So hot... mmmm... Catie: Oooooh! Luna. You're so perverted. Tee hee! Luna: Dont judge me. We all have our likes. Isn't that right footboy? Catie: Oh! DJ likes feet! I totally forgot! Catie uses her powers to force open your armor and begins stripping you of your pants and boxers. Catie: Foot-job time bro! <i>So wrong... but so hot... Catie loves to cater to your fetish, but has yet to offer you a foot-job... This is awesome!</i> Catie's feet make contact with your guy parts. They're sooooooo soft and silky. She begins to slowly work her majic. You moan in pleasure. Luna briefly opens her eyes. Luna: Hey Catie, mind if I work his face? Catie: Not at all. She says smiling. Go for it! Luna stops fingering herself long enough to walk over to you and sit down next to you. Luna: Alright footboy, off with my boots. You know, you dont think you've ever actually seen Luna's feet yet, she's still \"the new girl\", joining shortly after Stacie did. You eagerly pull off Luna's boots. Luna: Wow, I didn't even need to use my powers on you. A quick scan with your eyes reveals that Luna has very nice feet, complemented nicely by her her shiny black polish. Cmon! Do something so that I can finish masturbating already. Catie: Luna is a very dirty girl. Luna: Quiet you! Mind still numb with pleasure from Catie's seemingly majic feet, you begin wildly sucking on Luna's toes. Luna: YES! Luna begins furiously fingering herself. Her sexual moans are enough to speed up your own rise to climax. You: Mmmm... Catie... Catie: Tee hee. You're very composed. You must masturbate A LOT. We never even hear you because you're so quiet about it... You are thoroughly embarrassed now. Catie: Hey bro. You like my French Tips? A quick glance at Catie's feet puts you over the edge, almost simultaneously with Luna, who is now panting heavily. Luna: Oooh... Thanks you two... That was best I've had in a while... Catie removes her feet from you and begins licking your cum off of them, meanwhile, Luna pulls hers out of your mouth. You quickly put your clothes back on. Thoughts of Luna's feet enter your mind. You: Luna... Luna: But you just... you still want more? You greedy little... Oooooh! Greed. Luna looks at you and your need for her feet increases exponentially. You: Luna... feet... I need them! Luna: You have to catch me first! Luna hops up and begins running around the room, albeit kinda slowly because she's still exhausted from her orgasm, but then again so are you. Eventually you catch up to her and tackle her to the ground, quickly making your way to her feet and licking them from heel to toe. Luna: If you're gonna do that at least let me get a little more comfortable. You: Huh? Sure? You scoot back until your butt is on her upper back. Luna bends her knees and points her toes at you. Luna: Go ahead. You resume licking Luna's soles as she just lays on her stomach and relaxes. Catie is sitting in the middle of the room looking a bit sad. Luna: Get on over here Catie! Catie: Why? He obviously likes you better... Luna: Ooops... I forgot that the vices partially work themselves out on their own... Luna whispers to herself. Luna: But Catie, you're like a sister to him, you're family. I'll never have that with him. Luna: <i>I sense great jealousy buried deep in this one. Perhaps I should of inflicted envy on her instead of lust. Work with her natural vice...</i> Hmmm... Envy. Luna's irises flash green as she points one of her feet at Catie, who immediately gets up and starts walking towards Luna and yourself, turning her arms into slime blades on the way... Catie: Luna... Luna: Hoo hoo hoo! The fun continues! Luna weasels her way out from under you. She picks up your chestplate to use a shield. Catie starts slashing at Luna like a maniac. Luna: <i>Jealousy and wrath at the same time? Oh my. This is getting interesting...</i> Eventually the vice Luna inflicted on you subsides. You: Huh? Ahhh! You teleport behind Catie and pin her arms to her sides. Catie: Oh DJ... Did you forget who I am? Catie starts turning into slime. You jab her in the arm with the emergency needle Shanna gave to you. Catie resolidifies and her blades turn back into her normal hands. Catie: Hey! You: Relax. It's only for an hour. Catie lets out a pissed off sigh. Catie: You're grabbing my boobs... You: Ahhh! Sorry! They're just so nice you know? Catie: You perverted... Catie easily escapes your hold and flips you onto the floor before sitting on your chest. You: Please dont beat me up like when we were little... Catie: Hey! I never beat you up! I was just playing with you. You were and still are just weak. Hit the gym once in while or something... You: Ok mom. Catie: Ha ha! I love you cuzz! Catie pulls you in and hugs you. She whispers in your ear. I'm gonna get you back later, rest assured. You: But but... Luna... powers... Catie: Dont worry. I'll get her too.</span></div></div>",

That hurt Halo... Sorry... I lash out sometimes... Anyway, my real name is... Pandora... Cool. So you're named after the chick from the myth? Oh heavens no. I'm not named after her... I am her. Your jaw drops. Oh, that's the reason why I wear all of this jewelry. All of the world's evils didn't go out into the world... they went into me. Are you dangerous? No. I control them, not the other way around. I can show you if you want. Cool. Let me see! Ok, but you asked for it... Halo begins removing her jewelry. She takes off her necklace. That's the last of it... Except for... my toe ring. DJ, I want you to pull it off for me. She says winking at you. Ok. You say getting slightly horny. Halo sits down and you do the same. She lifts up her robe slightly and puts her heavenly bare feet on your lap. They just look so tempting... You lean in to kiss them only for Halo to shove the sole of one of her feet into your face, stopping you in your tracks. Her feet are soooooo soft and perfect... Ah ah ah, not until I say so. Actually, while you're down there why dont you pull my ring off with your teeth? Your remove your face from her sole and bring her foot up to your face. A very ornate gold ring stares back at you. It's very pretty Halo. Yeah yeah whatever. Cmon... I'm itching to get out... Huh? My real personality I mean. This being an Angel thing sucks... Alright, calm down. You grasp the ring in your teeth and slowly slide it off of her toe. <br>\r\n<u>Pandora's Free!</u><br>\r\nYou look at her toes and see the pearly white nail polish turn a shiny black color. You look back up an see a dominant smile on Halo's face. Her platinum blonde hair turns jet black, her azure eyes turn crimson, and tribal tattoos form on her body. Her flowing white gown turns into a short black toga, her wings retract and a necklace with a small cube on the end forms around her neck. Halo breathes a sigh of relief. It's been ages... DJ honey, I know you're not content just holding my perfect foot, go ahead and worship to your heart's content. Really? None of that divine judgement crap this time? Hey. The longer I wear that damned jewelry, the more... Angelic... I get. It's a curse for... Well you know the story. She says as she pats the cube on her necklace. That your box? You got it. For being such a smartypants I think you deserve a foot-job from yours truly. I love you Pandora... Pandora smiles at you. Wow. And I didn't even need to tell you to stop calling me Halo until I put all that crap back on. Aww. Do you have to? I like you better like this. I do too honey, but it's awfully hard to hold back all this power. If I got all fired up during a fight then I could possibly destroy half the planet. June keeps her power under control just fine... You mumble to yourself. Pandora grabs you, digging her fingers into your armor and pulling you to within a few inches of her face... Listen here... Dont compare me to her ever again... or else... You are so freaking hot right now... You both look into each other's eyes briefly and then begin passionately making out. Pandora finally breaks away. Mmmm... I forgive you DJ. Now then... Massage my feet please. Sure thing Pandora. You grab her feet and begin rubbing them. No no no. Not with your hands... with your tongue! You happily oblige her request and begin licking her feet like crazy for a few minutes before slowing down and sucking on her perfect toes one by one. Maybe I'll take your advice and just screw all that jewelry... I got kicked out of Heaven a long time ago anyway, not like I have a reason to stay an Angel... DJ! Hmm? Yes Pandora? Take all that jewelry and... I dunno. Hide it, give it a girl, whatever. Would it have any weird effects on humans that aren't you? Hmm... Never really thought about it... It might turn them into an Angel... and if they're weak willed... an Angel slave... Hmm... Deliciously evil idea brewing... I thought you said that you weren't evil? I'm not. I'm just naughty. It wouldn't be all that bad to make a few slaves... I'm sure there's some weak willed church girl that wants nothing more than to help people. Why not trick her into wearing one item of that jewelry? I dunno Pandora... Cmon, if she truly doesn't like it then I'll let her go. Deal? Hmm... Fine. How many are we talking here? Seven. That's how many pieces of cursed jewelry I have. The earrings have to be used as a pair to even work right. Now come here! Pandora French's you for about five seconds then pulls away... I see... Then let's find our first victim... (Note: Prolonged contact with Pandora can... sway the will and morals of whoever it is she's with. Especially through physical contact.)</span></div></div>",

Consider being my slave? I know you'll love it. Pandora I... I dont know about tha- tha- tha- oh that feels so good! While you were talking Pandora somehow ripped off your armor without you noticing... her foot is currently... You get the idea. P-p-pandora! That's so cheating! No it isn't. Now be my slave. Be my slave. Be my slave... Pandora twists the cube on her necklace slightly. Pandora only looks at you. Her black lipstick covered lips slowly curl into a smile. So... What is your answer? Of course I'll be your slave Pandora. Good. Then you'll have a new playmate very soon. Pandora snaps her fingers and her appearance changes back to it's original form. Halo? Nope, still Pandora, this is merely a glamour charm. I'm sure looking like this will ease my newest slave enough that she'll put on the jewelry willingly. Let's use the bracelet first. Now for you DJ... Pandora snaps her fingers again and chains appear and wrap themselves around you. Huh? What the heck Pandora! Relax, you'll like it and you'll forgive me... eventually. Pandora picks up the cross necklace and then looks at you. She walks over and places it around your neck. To your surprise it tightens into more of a choker than a necklace and then begins to glow. Pandora snaps her fingers again and the chains disappear. You tug and pull at the necklace but it doesn't budge. What the? DJ DJ DJ... What part of cursed jewelry dont you understand? Right... But it's just a bit too feminine for me. That wont matter in about... now. You feel pain and stretching all over your body as wings erupt from your back and things move and change. Finally your clothes change into a gown similar to Halo's. Pandora this is for girls... You didn't... Yes. I didn't, the necklace did. You nervously put both of your hands on your chest only to be greeted by two nice fleshy lumps. You move your hands lower and feel nothing, you push a little more and your hand sinks in slightly. You fall to your hands and knees, only staring at the floor. A few minutes pass and you still are in great shock, that is... until Halo's perfect feet come into your view... You lift one of your arms to touch her foot but fall flat on your face, partly because of the extra weight on your chest, and partly because now that you're a girl, you're physically weaker than before, and you couldn't even do one push up as a guy... Awwwww... Aren't you precious? Such a little weakling... I know... You say twiddling your thumbs... Your thumbs... Looking at your hands you notice that your hands are much... Paler than before... You dont mind the pearly nail polish too much... Pandora... Why did my race change? Well you are MY slave. It was MY jewelry that you're now wearing... So obviously you're made in MY image. Just kill me now... Oh... About that... You're immortal and unkillable now. It's part of the curse. And your old powers um... are gone too... WHAT?! You rise up to your knees and try something... anything... Nothing happens. You focus with everything that you have and a small ball of white light appears in your palm. What's this Pandora? Hmm... Looks like you have healing powers. Standard Angel stuff. I wonder... A smirk appears on your face as an idea comes to mind. You toss the ball at Pandora and will for it to explode. It worked! Oh shit... She's gonna kill you now... You... little... BITCH! At the speed of light Pandora is behind you holding you by your hair. I was nice enough to make you my eternal slave and this is the thanks I get?! I... I'm sorry mistress! Punish me as you see fit. Pandora lets go of your hair and again you fall onto your face. Get up Angie. What? Angie, it's your new name, it's short for Arch-Angie, like Arch-Angel? Yeah, I get it... Let's go get the next one, I know a girl...<br>\r\n<u>Sunday afternoon, outside of Trinity Baptist Church</u><br>\r\nOk Angie. Focus and will your wings to retract. Can do Halo. What did I tell you? Aren't you undercover Pandora? Right... Pandora sighs. Ooooh! That's her. Kayla Smithfield, she was in my class when I was in highschool. The two of you walk up to Kayla and say hi. Kayla: Hmm? I've never seen you two before. Are you going to join our church? Halo: Umm... Not exactly... Follow us. We have a gift for you. Kayla: Hmm? Ok, sure. Halo leads you all to the graveyard behind the church. Halo: Kayla Smithfield, would you accept this bracelet and become one of us? Angie, show her now. You take a deep breath and exhale loudly. After that your wings pop out. Halo doesn't even flinch as she extends her wings. Kayla: Oh... my... God... Kayla covers her mouth. I cant use the Lord's name in vain like that... I'm being visited by actual Angels... Halo: So. Will you accept this bracelet? Kayla: Yes! Yes! Kayla extends her arm and Halo places the bracelet on her wrist. The bracelet tightens. Huh? Halo: Oh... It's kind of a permanent thing... You: Yeah... I was a guy just this morning. You say as you point to your necklace. Kayla: What? You tricked me? Halo smiles a wicked smile as she reverts to her true form. Pandora: Hey Angie. Let's introduce her to June! You cant help but feel evil and you agree with Pandora. Pandora teleports you all back to the base. Kayla curls up into a ball. Kayla: I've been tricked by Demons... You: Hey Pandora. Let me go get her! Pandora: Go for it Angie.<br>\r\n<u>June's Room</u><br>\r\nYou: Knock knock Junie! June opens her door and looks at you puzzled. June: I'm in a good mood today so I wont destroy you on site. What do you want? You aren't Halo, so who are you? You: I am deeply hurt honey. What would Tessa and Cynthia think of their mother acting this way? June puts her hand around your throat and partially transforms. She's in her form that looks like a Succubus. June: Who are you and how do you know about my children?! You: Ok! Ok! Let me go and I'll tell you! June releases her grip and returns to human form. June: Well? You: Promise me you wont laugh at me? June: What? Sure. Whatever. You: Ok... I'm DJ... June: Yeah... I'm sure you are... June looks into your eyes and sees your soul. June: DJ?! How?! You point to the necklace. Ouch... That's a pretty powerful Divine artifact you got there, not even I can remove it... You: Eh... I got over it... June looks into your eyes again. June: You little traitor! How dare you whore yourself to a mistress other than me! You: Eeeep! Please dont hurt me! You say as you cling to June's legs. June: Ha ha! Ha ha ha! You're so gullible sometimes! I was only screwing with you hun. June ruffles your hair with her hands. You: Oh. Pandora wanted you to meet someone. June: Pandora? Pandora's your new mistress huh? She's an old friend of mine. Ha ha. I gave her the idea to open that box way back when. Let's go.<br>\r\n<u>The Training Room</u><br>\r\nYou: I got her Pandora! Pandora: Good. Good... You: Oh. Kayla transformed? Pandora: Yep. Now she should be able to sense... Kayla screams at the top of her lungs. Kayla: This... What is this dark presence... Kayla slowly turns around... No... Noooooo! Stay back! June: Now I am offended! My best friend and the father of my children are both Angels. Kayla: I... I dont care! Stay back you evil fiend! June: Do you know who you're speaking to! I am Satanica Lucifer II! Second born of the one and only Satan! Kayla's eyes widen in horror. Kayla scrambles into a corner. Pandora: Wings! Be nice to our guest! Kayla slowly scoots towards June. A few minutes later she's at June's booted feet. Kayla: I'm s-sorry miss... I'm K-kayla, I mean Wings... Kayla extends her hand. June: Sorry. I dont shake unless I'm making a deal with someone. Would you like to make a deal? Say... Your old life back for your soul? Kayla: Ahhh! No no no no no! I'll keep my soul thank you very much! June: Damn, thought she'd go for it... Oh well. We done here? You: Wanna hang out with us? Pandora still has 5 cursed jewelry items left... Hey... Pandora... Give me the toe ring... Pandora: Huh? The jewelry doesn't work on Demons... You: Didn't you know? Junie has a soul now... He he he... Pandora: Oh... then here you go... I'll speak fondly of you at your funeral... Pandora tosses you the toe ring. You stare at June with your crazed eyes... June: DJ? You: I'm not DJ. I'm Arch-Angie, number one slave of mistress Pandora... You slowly walk towards June. June creates a throne of bones and sits on it, one leg crossed over the other. You: Oh come on! Cant I at least chase you? June: Shut up and put the ring on my toe. I'll play your little game. You: Huh? June: Are you stupid? I'm already an Angel dumbass! Fallen Angels are Angels too, our philosophies are the only thing different about us. You sigh. You kneel in front of June and pull one of her boots off. Her toes are painted an alternating blood red/sunny orange pattern. You: So hot... You lean in and begin kissing her foot. June: As nice as this is... Put the damned ring on me! You: Alright! Fine! Meanie... You put the ring on June's second toe. You look up at her and her clothes change to only a black gown. Large black bird wings sprout from her back. June moans in ecstasy. June: Mmmm... It's been so long since I've been in my true form... You: Hey! You said that I'd shit myself if I saw your true form! You lied! You true form is fuckin sexy! You cover your mouth with your hands. June: He he he he he... So you do still want to be my slave... You: I... Pandora... June... June: Awwww! You're so cute when you're confused! Pandora: Well I still have the earrings, the ring, the anklet, and the headband. I guess I'll manage with only five slaves... You: Wait! June, I will be you slave, but I wanna help Pandora with her last four. May I? June: Sure. And I'll help too!</span></div></div>",

You subtly hide behind June. Shanna: By the way June. What's up with the new look? June: True form. Fallen Angel. Remember? Shanna: Right. Have you seen DJ anywhere? June: Not recently... Have you asked Pandora? Shanna: Who? June: Sorry. I meant Halo. She's next door with her Harem. Pandora and her slaves teleport in in a flurry of blue light orbs. Pandora: You rang? Sylvia: Where's my nephew Pandora... Pandora points at you. You're still hiding behind June. June gently nudges you out. You: H-hi everyone... Sylvia: DJ? Who did this to you?! You: Well... Pandora: It was me. What're you gonna do about it? Sylvia grits her teeth and forms shadow blades around her forearms. Sylvia: When you mess with my family... Someone ends up dead... Sylvia gets that crazed look in her eyes, a look you haven't seen since she was leader of Alpha, Beta, and Zeta (Z) teams... You: You've done it now Pandora... Pandora: Slaves! Defend your mistress with your lives! Kayla: Not gonna happen. Beezly: I still hate Angels... Dio: Same. Gwen: What's going on? Stefani: Cmon idiot... Pandora's slaves light teleport out. Shanna busts out laughing. Pandora: Whatever. I'm perfectly capable on my own. Pandora and Sylvia charge at each other and begin fighting. Shanna stops laughing and scans you. Shanna: Hmm... This might actually be advantageous to you and the team as a whole. Plus we need a healer since Halo went batshit on us... You: I unsealed her... I'm sorry... Shanna: It's not your fault. She probably tricked you. Am I right? You: Yes... Shanna: Hey. Cheer up. Shanna hugs you. June pulls both of you in for a group hug. Shanna: I guess this means we gotta break up huh? You: Seems that way. Shanna: It's ok. I did cheat on you a lot with my lab. I'm surprised you didn't dump me for how much I neglected you. You: With your lab. Ha ha! That made me smile. It's fine Shanna. Really. I'm sure you'll find a good guy soon. Shanna: Thanks. You: Well. Auntie should've whipped Pandora's ass by... now. You turn around and see Pandora unconscious on the floor and hog tied with vines. Sylvia runs over and hugs you. Sylvia: Oh little nephy! Are you ok? Did she hurt you? You: Only my pride... Sylvia: Oh nephy... You: Technically it's niecey now. You say as push your boobs into hers. Sylvia: T-that wasn't a costume she made you wear? You: Nope. I'm kinda stuck as a girl now. Lost all my powers too... Are you feeling ok Auntie? You look a bit pale. Sylvia: You poor thing... You: Jeez Auntie... It's only my body... My thought patterns are still the same... Sylvia: I know... It's just that now you're a 21 year old girl... You: And? Sylvia: You do know about that thing that happens to girls right? You: Is it really <i>that</i> bad? The girls all give you a solemn look. You gulp. You: B-but I'm Angel too so... June: It's at least twice as bad for Angels, and since you're immortal, it'll happen every month, forever... Reality hits you like a freight train, bringing you to your knees. Sylvia gently strokes your head. Sylvia: It's ok honey. We're all here for you. June: Since that little blood exchange earlier, we should be synched, so... You've got about 3 days to prepare, give or take... You: I'm gonna be sick... Can I sleep in your room tonight Auntie? Sylvia: You dont even have to ask honey. You get up and rest your head on Sylvia's shoulder. June: Wha? But... Shanna: June. She needs her family now more than anything. June: You're right... I guess I can be rather selfish at times...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Sleepover at Aunt Sylvia's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: June can prevent \"it\" from happening... For a price... (Your memory of being male, and of all the girls except for her. You will think that you born a female angel and seduced by June to live on Earth with her)</span></div></div>",

What do you mean Auntie? Your my late mom's only sister. You're the closest thing I've ever had to a mom. You say as you walk up to her and hug her. I... Thanks honey, I needed that... Your mom would be proud of you... Hey Auntie. Did you ever meet my dad? A few times. Your mom was the first one to break tradition in our family when she married a black guy. Our mom wasn't too happy about it at first, but she grew to accept it in time. She always was the rebel of the two of us. Wait. Mom was the rebel? But you're the one who became a supervillain! Oh that. That wasn't out of rebellion, that was for fun. She was the rebel and I was the bad girl. Our poor mother... Now back to your dad. You're a lot like him in many ways. Granted he didn't have a foot fetish but every other aspect of your personality is almost spot on. You do have quite a bit of your mom in you too, no doubt about it. I never knew that. I mean, I never knew them... And I didn't even know you existed until recently, not counting the whole Nightshade thing. That's because your mom wouldn't have wanted me to raise you as a supervillain. They can be pretty bad influences you know. I know... Hey! Dont you cry on me. I'm here for you now aren't I? Right... I'm sorry Auntie... It's fine honey. It's fine. Sylvia says as she wraps her arms around you. A few minutes pass and you both sit on her bed. You know... I forgot that I only have the one bed... Oh! No problem! You concentrate and transform into a chibi form of yourself. Since when can you do that? Since I become an Angel. You look so adorable! I just wanna hug you! Auntie? Sylvia grabs you and hugs you like a teddy bear before heading off to bed... At least her boobs make good pillows...<br>\r\n<u>The next morning...</u><br>\r\nSylvia finally loosens her grip on you and you return to normal, stretching your wings as you do the morning stretch thing. Man... I still gotta get used to these things... Sylvia is still fast asleep. Her automatic door opens and those two demon chicks that June captured are standing there. The one with long red hair speaks first, her irises are a crimson red color, and her hair is styled in a way that it covers her right eye. Demon girl: You probably forgot our names. I am Beezly Devilia. And this is my sister Dio. Dio waves at you. Beezly: She's shy. Dio has neck length dark blue hair, her bangs cover all of her forehead. She also has crimson eyes like Beezly and June. You: U-um... H-hi... Beezly: Hey! We may be Demons, but we're Angels now. Same as you. So why dont you come play with us little Angel? Dio: Um... I'm sure you'll find it pleasurable... Beezly smiles at you seductively and sashays towards you. She begins to run her hands along your body, focusing on your... girl parts... Dammit Pandora... Why didn't she give you underwear? Only this gown... You: I- I- Beezly: What? You dont like me? You: It's not that it's... Beezly: Dont worry. June may act like she hates us. But in reality we're her only friends. Understand? You: I get it... Beezly: Hmm... I may be too much for you right now. Dio. Warm her up would you? Dio: A-alright... Beezly escorts you out of Sylvia's room and into one of the spare rooms.<br>\r\n<u>Room 104c (This is actually Sarah's old room from before she defected to supervillainy)</u><br>\r\nBeezly: I'll just watch you guys. 6,000 years and Dio's still a softy. Dio: I- You: I think it's cute... I mean... Dio: G-gee... Um... Thank you... You notice both of them are barefoot. Beezly's toes are painted blood red, while Dio's are like a navy blue color. They're really cute... both of them have really cute feet... Pervert mode taking over... Beezly: Um... What's up with your eyes? You look crazed or something... You: Hey Dio... Dio: Um. Yes? You: Run. Dio: What?! Beezly: Well this is gonna get interesting... You begin to walk towards Dio. Dio gets up and starts running around the room in circles. Dio: Beezly help! Beezly: Nah. This is too entertaining. After about 5 minutes of chasing Dio you finally tackle her to the ground. Now lying on top of her, you begin to squeeze her boobs. Dio: Beezly! Help me! Beezly: Nope. You need to learn abut this stuff by experience. You continue to grope her soft sqeezable boobies. After a while Dio starts to enjoy it as well. Dio gets up, with you still clinging to her by her boobs. Beezly: Hey Dio. You got a little something on your back. Dio: Very funny Beezly. Hey sweetie? Could you let go for just a minute? You: Aww... Ok... You let go of her boobs. Dropping to the floor, which isn't very far, Dio is only a couple inches taller than you. Dio turns around. Dio: So. Anything else you like about me besides my boobs? You: Well I... Um... kinda... have a thing for feet... Beezly: Oh? Dio: Back off... this one's mine... He he he... Dio continues to laugh as her irises start to glow red... Beezly: Oh... It's seems you've turned her on... You snap out of pervert mode and go back into slave mode. You: W-what? Beezly: She has a really bad erm... let's call it a queen complex... Dio: On your knees slave... Bow to your queen... You: O-ok... You kneel in front of Dio, who presents her foot to you. You grab it and begin to softly kiss it. Dio pets you on the head. Dio: Good girl...</span></div></div>",

They just haven't come to fruition until just now. If you want her back you'll have to fight me for her... I wont give her up so easily... Dio says as she begins to look more crazed. June: I'm merely here to observe. By all means keep her as long as you like. You: June! June: Quiet you. I'll play with you later. We have all eternity you know. You: Fine... I'll be back... Dio: Where do you think you're going?! You: To the bathroom. Screw off Dio. As you walk to the bathroom you feel the heat of Dio's anger from all the way across the hall. Once in the bathroom you focus your energy and your clothes change to a cosplay french maid's outfit. You retract your wings and walk back over to Dio. You then kneel in front of her. You: Terribly sorry about that. You may now punish me as you see fit. June: What's with the British accent? You: The thing about that... I used my powers to do this but it seems I cant undo it. Looks like I'll be stuck with it for a while. Dio's expression changes. Dio: That is so cute! You're adorable! Dio says as she vice hugs you. You: Please let go of me now... At this point your Aunt Sylvia walks in. Sylvia: Ok... I guess the Demons have her... I checked every other room... Sylvia says to herself before looking up. Ummm... Niecey... You: Hmm... Oh. Hello Auntie. I'm kind of busy at the moment... Sylvia: What's the outfit and the accent? You: I just felt like it ok? Since I'm a cute girl now I figured that I'd dress the part. Dio: Well I think she's adorable! Sylvia: Oh niecey... You have a serious Anime watching problem... You look just like the second form of Virgo in Fairy Tail... Well sort of... Minus the shackles and the purple hair... Dio lets you go and you turn around. You: Auntie. And how exactly would you know that? Sylvia: Well I... You see... A smile continues to grow on your face. You: Aunt Sylvia... You're an Otaku! You say as your eyes light up. Sylvia: I dont know what you're talking about... Sylvia says as she blushes. You: I'll join you! You say as you start running toward her. But you dont seem to be going anywhere. It seems that Dio has grabbed your Ponytail. You: Cmon Dio! Dio: My time is precious. You go when I say you can... What the?! An aura forms around you. June: Oh? You slowly turn around. You: I dont care how powerful you are... Never get between me and my hobbies... You grab Dio's arm. June: Her geek fire may just be stronger than her pervert fire... Oh hubby... Dio: How is this power possible? You: Because I still have  at least 190 episodes to watch... And now I have someone to watch them with... Dio: Let go of me! Beezly: I've seen enough. Let her go Dio. This is a fight you'll lose for sure... Dio: I'll show you... I'll show you all the power of Dio Devilia! A dark aura appears around Dio. June: Oh my... That's... This will get interesting... You form a white fireball in each hand. Dio: That's... Hey Angie... I was just kidding about that whole making you my slave thing... He he... You're free to go... Dio's Aura disappears and she reverts to her normal shy state. Beezly: Holy flames huh? That takes centuries to master... And you did it in 5 seconds... Honestly, your power kinda scares me. You: He he he. Dont get between me and my hobbies... Hey June. How do I get rid of these? You say as you wave the fireballs around carelessly. June bonks you on the head. June: Dont be so careless with those you idiot! You could kill every demon in this room with just one of those! The fireballs disappear as you rub your head. You: I'm sorry... You didn't have to hit me so hard you know... you say as you begin to cry. June: Really? After all that now you want to be a blubbering mess just because I bonked you on the noggin? June rolls her eyes. Pathetic... You: Hey June. You say as you create another white fireball and pretend to throw it at her. June doesn't even flinch. June: Wont work on me. I have a soul. It'll pass right through me. This on the other hand... June says as she creates a black fireball. Beezly and Dio, and even Sylvia back up. You: What? It's just a fireball... June: Oh... You dont know what Hellfire does to Angels do you... Wanna see a picture of what it can do to humans and demons? Oh... But I dont want you to barf... June extinguishes her fireball and everyone breathes a sigh of relief. June grabs you by your blouse. Dont cross me hubby... Cause I <i>will</i> hurt you if you do. Got it? June says as her eyes glow red. You gulp. You: Yep. I understand... Sorry wifey... June: Aww honey! June hugs you tightly. Sylvia: Those two are so weird... But I guess they're pretty much my daughter and daughter-in-law at this point. Rest In Peace Chrissy... Your son is doing just fine now... I hope you're looking down on us now...<br>\r\n<u>And Then</u><br>\r\nA beam of light blasts a hole through the ceiling. Another Angel stands in the middle of the blast zone. June turns around. June: Do you damned Angels always have to make such a grand entrance! You: Aunt Sylvia. What's with the look? Sylvia: It's... Your mother... You: WHAT?! You turn around and see a vaguely familiar face. You: M-mom? June: That's your mother?! Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry Mrs. Thompson! Your mom only smiles. Sylvia: Chrissy... Are you not talking because of me? June: Visitor class Angels are forbidden to speak to humans... Only very rarely are exceptions made... Your mom looks sad and points to what looks like an ornate gold collar. Sylvia: I see... Your mom looks at June, then at Sylvia, then at you with a glare. Sylvia: I know that look... She does not approve of your wife... You: But mom... You begin to strip of your upper articles of clothing. Sylvia: What are you doing? You turn around and show Sylvia the curse mark on your left breast. Sylvia: A tattoo? June: A curse mark actually. A nasty side effect of being the father of our children. It signifies that her soul is mine, but it also means that she'll be protected by me for all eternity. You turn around and show your mom. She covers her mouth in shock. She then draws sigils in the air made of light and armor appears on her. Chrissy: Callsign Seraphim. Restrictors deactivated. June does the same with dark sigils and equips herself with armor. June: Callsign Leviathan. Restrictors disabled. You put your clothes back on. Sylvia: Uhhh... June: She's just challenged me for Angie's soul. Seraphim: So. You're the second born right? June: That is correct. And I'm also your daughter-in-law! June summons a sword of darkness and lunges at your mom with it. She easily blocks with a sword of light. Seraphim: So you're married huh? Mind explaining to me why my son is a girl now? June: You've been dead long enough that you should know Pandora. Why dont you fight her. I've done nothing wrong. Seraphim: Wait. Pandora? Chrissy sheathes her sword. June does the same. Seraphim: Sorry about that... It's just that who your father is makes me instantly distrust you... You seem nice enough... June: You know now that I think about it... Since Angie's an Angel now... Our kids would be Angel/Fallen Hybrids instead of human/Fallen Hybrids... If you wait a few years you can meet them. Seraphim: I've got time. I get 50 years temporary banishment to earth for breaking code and challenging you without the okay from the big guy... Sylvia: Told you Niecey. She's a rebel... June: Wow... The Angel system is kinda douchey compared to ours... You: Anyone seen Beezly and Dio? June grabs you and begins giving you a noogie. June: You are mine! Stop thinking about other girls! Seraphim: I knew that you'd end up with a domineering girl... Sylvia: So... You: Well I think you and mom should catch up. June, wanna watch anime with me? June: Sure hubby. How about something with Demons? You: We did that with the last three... I wanna finish up Fairy Tail... June: Fine... Seraphim: Uhh... Sylvia: I'll join you two later! Seraphim: You are such a child little sister. Sylvia: The term is Otaku... You: You admitted it! Sylvia: I'll get you for that later. Sylvia says as she winks at you.</span></div></div>",

You just cant believe that this is all real... Just hoping that you'll awake from crazy dream... It's not all bad... But... You weren't born a girl. Can you really adjust to all this? Honey? Are you ok? You've been staring at that wall for hours... Come on up here and let me comfort you... You nod as you crawl into bed and cuddle next to your Aunt Sylvia. She wraps her arms around you. Her warmth is comforting but you still feel that sense of uneasiness...<br>\r\n<u>That Morning</u><br>\r\nEven though Angels have no need whatsoever for sleep... Your eyes are bloodshot and have dark bags under them. June notices as soon as she comes in to greet you. Holy crap you look like Death hubby! We'll actually Death is a close friend of mine and she's very pretty... That would hurt her feelings... Anyway your body shouldn't be reacting like this... It has to be all in your head hun... June says as she hugs you a pets your head... You know... There <i>is</i> a way that you can avoid erm... Monthly issues... Well... Aside from taking birth control. Anyway, there is a <i>supernatural</i> way to do it... But I need your consent cause... You might not like it... What do you mean June? Well... I could wipe your mind. Erase every memory you ever had of being male. Just synchronizing your body's gender with your mind's will solve 90% of your problems immediately. Cause as you stand now you're very imbalanced. Having a male mind and a female body... Just watching you walk is... Painful... By erase every memory you mean... Sadly yes... It'll be new game + for you honey. You'll have all of your equipment and skills but you'll be starting back at level one unfortunately. Because your soul is bound to me, you'll remember me perfectly. And any you truly feel a strong attachment to you'll most likely at least recognize... But... Your information might not be up to date or may be fabricated by your subconscious. A side effect of putting in the base female thought patterns.<br>\r\n<u>Deal? Or no Deal?</u><br>\r\nClear the board June... As you wish hubby... I mean this from my heart... It hurts me to have to do this to you. June grabs your cheeks as she makes out with you, shedding a tear as your mind is reset. Feeling woozy you black out...<br>\r\n<u>Later in the Medical Ward</u><br>\r\nYou slowly open your eyes as your vison begins to clear up. June: Hubby! You're awake! June says as she jumps onto the bed and hugs you. You: I'm fine June... Jeez... But why do you call me hubby? I mean it is a really cute pet name... But I'm not a boy... And... Also I'd be the wife... Cause I'm the submissive one... You say with a slight blush. June: It's a... Habit... She says with just a hint of sadness in her voice. Shanna: Medically... You're fine... You're cleared to leave my lab at any time. You: Roger that Shannon! You say as you salute her. Shanna: Dude... You're still team leader... And my name is Shanna... Not Shannon... Maybe you should stay here so I can run a few more tests... June: Oh she'll be fine... She's just being a doofus. Right? June says as she stares into your soul as fire literally burns in her eyes... You: Y-yeah! I'm a doofus! He he... You laugh nervously... Shanna: Oh whatever... June... Did she hit her head? And... Did you have anything to do with it? I understand if it's consensual... But maybe you should...Tone it down a bit? June: Uhhch. I am offended that you think I abuse my cute wifey-poo! She says as she hugs you tightly. Making you blush. Shanna's expression remains unchanged. June: Ok... It was my fault... But it was an accident! Shanna sighs. Shanna: Alright. I'll act as team leader until her amnesia clears up... Just... Get out of here. Shanna shakes her head as she walks off...<br>\r\n<u>Shortly after, in the Lounge</u><br>\r\nYou're relaxing on one of the couches with June. Her feet in your lap. You: So June I've been thinking... June: Yes? You: Since we're so intimate with each other why dont you let me call you by your real name? June: I never said you couldn't... I just chose a human name because I thought it would help ease you a little bit... I can be kind of intimidating when you first meet me... But you've even seen my true form... So go ahead... Talk dirty to me baby. June says as she jumps on you and pins your arms to the couch. June: Well... Say my name then. You: Satanica... You're so damned sexy right now... Kiss me! June smiles as she locks lips with you for a few seconds. Catie: Someone is certainly feeling better... Though she should get a room! You: Cuzz?! I uh... Well... I'm a lesbian ok! You say as you start to bawl... June hugs you as she strokes your hair. Catie: Uh... It's never bothered me that you like women... Are you feeling okay? June: She... Hit her head... Uh... Catie: I gotcha... But seriously... Go to your room if you're gonna do that. June: Fair enough... You: Catie are you... Jealous? You say turning to her. Catie: No... I have a fiancee... Where have you been? You: You're getting married?! Catie: Yeah... I've only been engaged... 6 months... That hurts my feelings a little... You: June. Could you... June: Oh. Sorry. June gets up off of you as you grab Catie's hand and stare at her ring... The Diamond is enormous... You slowly give Catie her hand back... You: HOLY BANANAS HE IS LOADED! Congrats cuzz I'm so happy for you! You say as you squeeze her. Catie: He he. Thanks. He's really not rich or anything... He just really saved up for this. You: Still. Now I've never met him but he seems like a great guy. Rachael teleports in and grabs your gown. Rachael: Why are you yelling about fucking bananas in the middle of the day! Some of us are nocturnal... I need my beauty sleep you fucking dipshit! She says as she shakes you. You turn to June and Catie and loudly whisper. You: Is she a vampire? Why is she shaking me? Rachael: Dont act like you dont know me you dumbfuck! She says as she shakes you harder. You: Well I do like attractive Goths... Rachael drops you and blushes. Rachael: A-attractive? M-me?! Rachael slowly regains her composure. Rachael: W-well you are a girl now... I do so happen to swing that way sometimes... I mean you're cute... Um... June? June: Hmm? Oh by all means... Show her some really nice domination. June says as she winks at Rachael. Rachael: Really? You sure she wont... Break in her current form? June: Oh she heals like Wolverine. She'll be fine.

Rachael grabs you and teleports you to the other side of her room, before teleporting back to her original position. Rachael clears her throat and gives you a warm smile. Could you just walk over to me please? S-sure... You take a breath and walk over to Rachael, unconsciously swaying your hips as you walk. Holy... Shit... What is it Rachael? Nothing...

Mmhmm. You nod as you will your wings to retract into your body. Rachael grabs your gown and... Gently lifts it off of you... You lift your arms as she strips you. Rachael looks at you and blushes slightly. Y-you're not wearing any underwear... Of course. Is there something wrong with that? No! No... Not at all... Rachael teleports over to her drawer and produces a black lacy pair of pair of panties and bra. Put these on... You nod as you put easily put on the panties but struggle with the bra. Rachael... Can you help me? That's adorable... Rachael says with a slight blush. Rachael? Yeah yeah, dont get your panties in a bunch... Rachael puts the bra on you as she hands you a pair of stockings.

They're for you to wear! I'm sorry... Here... Rachael takes the stockings from you as she teleports the both of you to her bed. She puts the stocking on your foot and pulls it up your leg and repeats. There. She puts the rest of your outfit on and admires her handiwork... Oh... But it's missing something... She fishes around her room some more and produces a matching headpiece gently placing it in your hair. She finishes by raiding her shoe closet for a pair of high heels, which she slides onto your feet... Ok! Now we're ready. Rachael teleports to the other side of the room. Now... Come to momma. You get up from her bed, a little uneasy in your footing. You take a step and- *CRASH* You end up getting familiar with her carpet... Owwie... Wow... Well... I didn't expect you to get that far... Rachael teleports back to her bed and spins you so that you're on your back with your head towards her bed...<br>\r\n<u>Change of Pace!</u><br>\r\nRachael slowly lowers her feet onto your face, toes resting on your lips. You know... I think I'll be nice to you... Rachael says as she gently rubs her feet on your face... You're just so... Meek now... You're like a cute little sheep... You nod as Rachael shoves her toes into your mouth... I kinda miss your assertive side a bit though... Oh well... Rachael says as she grabs you and begins to make out with you...</span></div></div>",

But I need to have a chat with my wife urgently!</span> June grabs you and flames back to her room... Ok... Why are you so freaked out June? <span class=\"cborange\">My sister... I sensed her...</span> Ok... <span class=\"cborange\">Look... She loves to fuck with me... Dont let her seduce you... Erm... Be weary... Erm... Stand your ground... You know what, I'll pick you up later... You're easily whipped into submission anyway, which is part of the problem... Anyway, your soul is bound to mine, so it'll be easy to fix after she corrupts you...</span> What makes you thin- <span class=\"cred\">Hey sis!</span> June gets a very flat look on her face... <span class=\"cborange\">Hey Demonica...</span> <span class=\"cred\">I'm gonna borrow your wife a while. Thanks!</span> With that Demonica grabs you and pulls you into a portal...<br>\r\n<u>Demonica's Domain</u><br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is... Nothing... There is nothing here, except for you... Demonica... And an endless expanse of red haze... Demonica looks you over... <span class=\"cred\">The maid outfit is cute... But...</span> She snaps her fingers and shadowy hands strip you naked, probably breaking a few laws of physics in the process... As your maid outfit is now hanging on a rack that seemingly appeared from nowhere... You blush intensely... At least it's not cold... Hey... What are you... <span class=\"cred\">You know what my favorite thing to do is? Stealing and breaking my sister's things.</span> She snaps her fingers again and a giant metal cross rises from the ground, links of chain appear in her hands as she chains you to the cross, you are unable to move as she does this... She probably makes the rules in this dimension... As you are chained by your wrists and ankles suddenly the cross is inverted, and you're now upside down. <span class=\"cred\">Much more fitting dont you think? What's this?</span> Demonica notes your long blonde hair lying limply on the ground. <span class=\"cred\">Oh that wont do...</span> The cross levitates until your hair is dangling, as Demonica creates a sword. <span class=\"cred\">You'd look cuter with a bob anyway.</span> The signature sound of a sword being drawn is heard, followed by your head feeling a little less heavy... There is no way... She flips the cross and creates a mirror in front of you. Well I'll be damned... It's perfect... <span class=\"cred\">I've had practice... And you were damned the moment you became my sister's lover. He he he.</span> Oh ha ha... Waaa! The cross is inverted once more and now back on the ground. She creates a few thin needles and walks over to you, casually sticking one into your nipple. Eeeep! I dont think I like this very much... <span class=\"cred\">Oh... I'll make a true Masochist out of you yet... But in the meantime let me make it more enjoyable for you.</span> She creates a throne and takes off her boots, beginning to rub her feet all over your face... For some reason this is way hotter than usual... Perhaps it's because you're naked... Perhaps it's because you're naked and upside down... Perhaps it's because you're naked, upside down, and chained to cross at the mercy of a sexy Sadistic demon... Or perhaps... You really are a Masochist in all senses of the word... You begin to feel pussy juices run down your leg and onto your chest, creating a sizzle as they drip to the floor...<br>\r\n<u>Phase 2</u><br>\r\nAnother pin... This one in your other nipple... But it doesn't hurt as much as the first... You almost... Enjoy it... At this moment Demonica summons two demons, both of whom look like they are subservient to her. <span class=\"cred\">Meet Riley and Isabelle. They will be assisting me for a while.</span> They both nod as Demonica conjures a whip with thorns, it has a rose motif. She hands it to one of the girls. She then conjures a flaming riding crop. <span class=\"cred\">Rock paper scissors or something...</span> She says as she hands it to the other girl. The two girls walk behind you and.. *WHIP!* *SMACK!* The pain is intense... But your wounds heal instantly. Demonica ramps up her intensity on your face with her feet... Sliding them slowly and using her toes to play with your nose and lips... *WHIP!* SMACK!* This time it doesn't hurt as much... Well it hurts... But it hurts good...<br>\r\n<u>A few hours later...</u><br>\r\nYou are panting heavily... *WHIP!* SMACK!* You moan is ecstasy as the instruments of abuse contact you skin. <span class=\"cred\">Enough!</span> The two demon girls stop and stand next to their master. Throughout the past few hours Demonica placed several hundred pins into your flesh as well. At this point you're drenched in your own  blood, sweat, tears and pussy juices. Demonica snaps her fingers and in a second the cross and chains vanish, you smell fresh as a daisy, are pin free and you're re-clothed in your maid outfit. You get on your hands and knees in front of Demonica and wiggle your ass. Please abuse me more mistress! You plead with her as you continue to kneel and wiggle. <span class=\"cred\">Like a bitch in heat... My little bitch in heat, he he he.</span> Demonica simply places a sexy foot on your face. You sniff it with intensity before planting soft kisses on it... She snaps her fingers again, and you're back at HQ.<br>\r\n<u>Super X HQ</u><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Here's your toy back... I broke it... Ha ha... Ahahahaha!</span> <span class=\"cborange\">What do you mean broke? She regenerates. And she's not my toy she's my wife!</span> June takes one look at your eyes and looks mortified. <span class=\"cred\">Didn't touch her soul. She's all yours now.</span> You're leaving me?! <span class=\"cred\">Eh... I'm bored with you.</span> You begin to tear up as June hugs you. I dont want a hug... I want to have my face stepped on more... And to be chained and whipped... <span class=\"cborange\">So help me if you weren't immortal Demonica I would kill you...</span> June takes the darkest tone you've heard her use. <span class=\"cred\">I'll be back to play with her from time to time. Toodles!</span> With that Demonica flames out, leaving behind her two servants. <span class=\"cborange\">She's taunting me... Oooh I fucking hate her! And you... You will take my hugs and love them!</span> She says as she squeezes you tightly... <span class=\"cborange\">So you're a true Masochist now huh? Guess you dont need my feet to get off now then-</span> That is sooooo cruel... You know I love your feet... You say as you drool a bit...</span></div></div>",

That cursed necklace of yours... I wonder...</span> June wraps her fingers around your necklace, choking you slightly. Not that you need to breathe. In fact you rather enjoy it... June tugs on it and it begins to electrify both of you, perhaps some kind of cursed defense system? June simply smirks as she pulls with one quick motion. A tiny clink is heard as the chain snaps. <span class=\"cborange\">That was pretty weak for a godly artifact... Perhaps your recent corruption weakened the seal? Ah whatever... What's this?</span> June watches as your hair turns jet black and your eyes turn red, while the feathers on your wings follow suit, turning like those of a Raven. <span class=\"cborange\">Seems your defiance of the system... Or rather mine has made you fall from grace.</span> Can you zap me again? That was fun... Oooh yes... <span class=\"cborange\">Really?

Not for several more years if I recall correctly.</span> <span class=\"cborange\">Why you!</span> You cough \"discreetly\". <span class=\"cborange\">Fine... I'll just ignore her. Oh. What's your safeword honey? I'm sure she didn't give you a choice am I right?</span> Uh... Pineapple? <span class=\"cborange\">Pineapple it is then. And I take your silence as confirmation.</span><br>\r\n<u>The Weary Traveller</u><br>\r\nJune snaps her fingers and the room changes to what looks like a snow covered mountain top. It appears you're on a church doorstep. Her outfit changes to that of a nun. Demonica does the same... And changes her persona completely. <span class=\"cred\">Hello little darling. I'm Sister Monica. What ails you this fine day?</span> <span class=\"cborange\">And I'm Sister June. If you need counsel I'm here as well.</span> How did I get here? <span class=\"cred\">Are you not a weary traveler?</span> Well yes but... Monica grabs you and pulls you inside. <span class=\"cborange\">Something troubling you?</span> June says as she comes up behind you and hugs you, pressing her boobs into your back. Well I was gonna say I was cold but... <span class=\"cred\">So then something <i>else</i> is bothering you?</span> Well I uh... You're interrupted by black stocking clad feet affectionately stroking one of your breasts... S-sister Monica? <span class=\"cred\">We dont get many visitors here... And we get lonely here...</span> Then it's really ok if I... <span class=\"cred\">Go for it.</span> You begin to kiss her stocking clad foot... Quickly wanting more and beginning to lick and suck on it through the stocking. June again hugs you from behind and pets you affectionately... You feel really turned on... You feel some things change and you end up looking like a Succubus... In a maid's outfit... <span class=\"cborange\">Demon!</span> Huh? Oh... That's new- Ahhhhh! Ooooooh... <span class=\"cborange\">And a perverted one at that...</span> June says as she cleans the blood off of a dagger with a cross shaped handle. Yep... Your wife literally just stabbed you in the back for roleplaying... She's the best! You realize that you cant move... And Sister Monica drags you into a hidden room in the church and... You get tied up... Sensing a pattern... At least you're not tied to cross and naked like the last time...<br>\r\n<u>The Secret Room</u><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">So a perverted demon wanders onto our doorstep. What should we do with her?</span> <span class=\"cborange\">Hmm...</span> Sister June walks over to you and strokes your cheek... Before slapping you. Of course you love it and moan a little. <span class=\"cborange\">Gross... So... What should we do with you you disgusting pig?</span> You begin to pant loving the verbal abuse as well. <span class=\"cborange\">Can I stab her again? She's making me uncomfortable... I feel like I might catch her perverseness...</span> <span class=\"cred\">Stabbing wont be necessary sister dearest... Maybe I'll dump hot oil on her though...</span> P-p-p-pi- June pinches your lips shut. <span class=\"cborange\">She's just kidding, so that wont be necessary. We dont torture demons, just rehabilitate them.</span> <span class=\"cred\">Aww... I though my joke was pretty funny...</span> Now to start...

Courtney, Brittany and Catie all wink at you and walk off to Shanna's lab where the others are being tested. You pull off both of her red knee high boots and begin to rub Jenny's feet. About and hour later Jenny has thrown her head back and is moaning in pleasure. You're really good at this dude... Do you get alot of practice? Well uhh... yeah. My teammates practically expect it after missions now. Ha ha. If you had a foot fetish you'd tell me right? After all... I am your best friend... She says giving you that look that only Jake gives you when he feels cheated out of something. Jake? You are to tell no one of this got it? She says as she grabs you by the chest and pulls your face close to hers, digging her fingers into your armor like it's made of dough or something. But Ja- Jenny... How? I'm sure you're quite familiar with masturbation right? Uhh... Of course... You say blushing. You also know that I've always been kinda perverted right? Right. Well... Two years ago I groped the wrong girl's boobs... Who? I dont know her real name... Her codename is Angel Witch. She put a curse on me. So every time I masturbate or otherwise get off, this happens. Do you know how hard it is to masturbate when you're a girl? Do you! Why are you mad at me... What? What makes you think I'm mad? Look at your hand... Oh. Sorry. She releases her vice grip on you. So why dont you just pick one or the other? I dont like being a girl... It changes my mind... My whole thought process... The longer I stay a girl, the girlier my thoughts get... the more... deviated... my thoughts get. I get a little bisexual... Like earlier when I was flirting with you... Jenny says as she blushes wildly. You were flirting? Men are so oblivious... Ahhhh! See what I mean! My girl side is trying to take over! Did you ask Genie to try and fix you? Of course. She couldn't help me... Apparently only Angel Witch can reverse it... And she's kinda you know... a supervillain that just so happens to hate me and thinks I'm a pervert... Oh... Well I know someone who can help... Really? Who? The Grim Reaper... What?! Why would you even suggest that!? Not like that. I know her personally. Her? Her name is Leah, she's Angel Witch's older sister... and she kinda has a crush on me... What are we waiting for then? Let's go!</span></div></div>",

So Shanna thinks it would be an awesome idea for me to go on individual training missions with one teammate at a time for bonding or something... The next on the list is... Alex... I dont get it Shanna, Alex and I are like best friends. Shanna: Observe. Shanna pushes a button on her wrist and a projector displays a montage of you and Alex bickering, often with super powers. You: Fine. Alex. Suit up or whatever. We roll out in 5. Alex: Gotcha.<br>\r\n<u>Mission Site, Super X Advanced Environment Generator</u><br>\r\nAlright Alex, activate stealth mode and communicate only by telepathy from this point on. Right. Alex pushes a button and her suit changes from the standard green and gold to all dark blue, she then pulls up a ninja mask thing. Dark blue? Shouldn't we be wearing black? Only if you want to stick out like a sore black silhouette in the background. Do some research on actual historical ninjas sometime, they're nothing like Hollywood says they are. You push a button on your armor and it changes from green and gold to dark blue. You use your powers to silently take off. Cmon Alex, I know you can fly. Use your powers and levitate yourself. You can fly? Then why do you use those jet boots? I'm lazy. Next question. What's up with that armor? I have enough power to destroy the universe if I wanted to, Shanna built this to keep my powers in check. Next. Oh, I just always thought you were insecure or something... So why do we all have to wear these spandex outfits? Hmm pervy leader? First of all, Shanna designed all of your outfits with functionality and protection in mind. Although my armor is bulkier than your suit, your suit provides better mobility and protection. You all just happen to um... have a nice enough figure to make the suits look good... Also, your eye masks have all of the same features as my helmet, night vision, thermal, etc. Oh, so you dont wear spandex cause you're a skinny wimp? Hey! Uncalled for. So what if even the really short girls on this team can physically outmuscle me... You feel Alex probing around in your brain. Hmm... So you have a thing for domineering women, that explains a lot. Hey! You're supposed to ask first... Dont act like you dont love it. So how far away are we from the objective? Well, we're about two miles from Shann- uhh... Dr. Brain's lab. We have to break in, steal her doomsday device, and break out, without tripping any alarms. Easy enough... she says as she continues feeling around inside your brain. Alex! I can feel you in there! I'll stop as soon as I find something juicy. It seems that your metaphorical secrets vault is locked up pretty tight... I have ways to make you loosen up your mental guard a bit... Alex flies closer to you and latches onto your arm. Alex... Personal space please... Nope. I'm not letting go until we land. Fine... A few minutes later you touch down and land. Alex lets go of your arm and lands, but trips over her own feet. Owwwie... I think I twisted my ankle a bit... <i>Cmon. Take the bait...</i> Alex! Are you ok? I'm fine. Could you maybe check out my ankle? But I'm not trained. Shanna is the only one on the team with any medical knowledge, and it's her turn to play the villain so... DJ... Fine. Gimme your foot. Alex puts her booted foot in your lap. It looks fine... DJ... You unzip her boot and begin to pull it off. <i>Whoa! His mental guard is rapidly deteriorating... Either he's really worried, or... Ooooh. I really hope it's the second one...</i> With her boot completely off, her pale bare foot is revealed, her shiny dark purple polish glistening in the moonlight. She wiggles her toes teasingly. You grab her ankle and begin to rotate it around. Alex. It doesn't feel messed up in the slightest... Her toes come to mind again... <i>Hook, line, and sinker. I knew it!</i> You can quit pretending now DJ. Alex says as she puts her foot up to your face and curls her toes downward. Kiss. Cmon, we got a mission to do. You retract your mask and plant a quick peck on her toes. Your mouth slowly engulfs Alex's toes. Ooooh... that feels nice... 5 more minutes... Eventually Alex pulls her foot away and puts her boot back on. Alright footboy, suit up. She says as she winks at you. You quickly engage your helmet. Distraction aside, we still have to look for... A laser dot appears on your head, then one on Alex's, then about one hundred everywhere on both of your bodies. ...traps... You are soon surrounded by robots with guns. And Dr. Brain steps out from the shadows. Dr. Brain: Excellent fumbling heroes. Do send your stealth elephants next time, they'll probably be quieter. It causes one to wonder what that unzipping and slurping was though. Doesn't it? Shanna says as she winks at you. Alex goes red in the face, realizing that she just cost you the mission with her teasing. Alex: So. Wanna try and fight em off? You: Ha ha, I never run from a fight. Shanna flies up in the air with a jet pack and starts firing lasers. You turn your arms into blades and start slicing up robots while Alex picks up groups of them with her mind and tears them to pieces. After 5 minutes of fighting both of you are overwhelmed by robots and captured. Shanna: DJ. You get a... B- for performance, that little distraction cost you the mission. Alex, you get an F. Alex: What? Shanna: Your provoking DJ caused him to completely lose focus and cost him the mission. Shanna claps and the environment turns back into the normal techy looking training room. Alex leaves the room stomping out and quietly cursing herself under her breath. I'm amazed that you restrained yourself for so long. Your self control has improved 33% since we partnered up last time. Thanks. You say as you smile at Shanna...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Hey Shanna? Yeah? Can we continue where we left off? It's been a long time since did the hero/villain roleplay... Ok. But dont beg me for mercy when I dominate your mind into oblivion... What? Kidding. Jeesh. I will be a little more agressive than normal though. Fair heads up. I'm cool with that. Fire the machine up and let's do this thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Go to Alex's room to comfort her</span></div></div>",

Clos-ser to the second o-one, but i-it's n-not that bad... Excellent, she says in a slightly evil tone. She has you kinda scared now. She takes off her other shoe and sock and flexes her toes a bit.

Then this should be easy for you. But mom it just feels... dirty... And it only shows up in random bursts, I'm not evil all of the time, and quite frankly I dont like it! I knew this would happen... I only blame your father... Dont drag dad into this! Sarah, all I ask is that you continue the Kasegawa family business. If you catch my drift. No! I will absolutely not be a supervillian! What use does a superhero have with the ability to manipulate people and toy with their emotions anyway? I... I'll find a way to make it work... Very well then. That is all. It's at about this time that you come back up from the kitchen with snacks. Is it ok if I bring food upstairs Mrs. Kasegawa? It's fine dear. I'll clean it up later. Thanks. Your mom is really nice Sarah. Yeah... Nice... You look distressed... You walk behind Sarah and begin to massage her shoulders. Sarah sighs in relief. Thanks DJ... No problem Sarah.

She smiles at you and you know what she wants you to do. Reaching up you help her take them off holding onto the heel and ankles of each boot as she pulls her feet out of them. She grins as her toes slid free of her boots and she moves her feet back towards you covering your face with her soles and rubbing them against it. You moan with pleasure as you cousin does this. Her feet feel warm and soft against you. They are nice and smooth too. You start to sniff and kiss them much to the amusement of the women in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Catie teases you with her feet. The other girls surround you taking off their footwear as well. Shanna, Addy and Alexandra sit down near your head while Julia, Ashley, Mai and her clones circle your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatie slids her feet down making room on your face for the other girls. She begins prodding your mouth with her toes and you instinctively stick out your tongue and start licking them. These girls have you well trained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Shanna and Alexandra each bring their feet towards your face and start massaging your cheeks with their soles. Shanna is on your right side while Alexandra is on your left. It is an incredibly soothing sensation. You can also feel Addy\u2019s small feet start playing with your hair and forehead. Occasionally she would intentionally give you a light kick and laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Julia slide their feet underneath Catie\u2019s legs rubbing their feet against your chest. <i>Mmm...that feels really good too</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that wasn\u2019t pleasurable enough, Mai and her copies also begin using their feet to tickle your ribs. You body is covered with female feet now and you really love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cgrape\">Aw he looks so happy like this.</span>\u201d Alexandra comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clred\">You\u2019re such a foot perv D.J.</span>\u201d Julia laughs before she affectionately adds. \u201c<span class=\"clred\">But we like you that way.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clgrey\">You girls really mean that?</span>\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cgreen\">Of course</span>\u201d Ashley tells you rubbing your chest gently with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls nod in agreement even Addy who sticks her tongue out at you as she sees you smile and teasingly smushes her foot into your face afterward. You can tell there is affection behind it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cpink\">The truth is D.J. that we wouldn\u2019t change you for the world.</span>\u201d Shanna tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the others agree with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the night like that. Catie, Addy, Shanna and Alexandra each take turns rubbing their feet in your face and getting you to kiss their feet, smell their feet, lick their feet and suck each one of their toes. Every now and then one of the girls would use their toes to teasingly pinch your nose or play with your face and giggle about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours the girl switch positions and Ashley, Julia, Mai, Ami, Flo and Rita take there turns using face as their footstool while the other girls tease and play with your body with using their feet. Once again you get to work worshipping the other half of your team smelling, kissing, and licking their feet as they rub them against your face. You suck all of their toes too noticing that each girls feet have their own scent and flavor to them but all of them are great in their own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the girls finish the night by watching a movie. All of them sit on the couch while using you as their footrest. Worn out from the day\u2019s activities you snuggle under the feet of all your friends and shut your eyes. It\u2019s good to be home, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div></span></div></div>",

Trouble! Mission! Shanna: Slow down sparky. It's just a riot in a minor city. You: Oh, then you're all ready to teleport? Addy: Uh no! We're all still barefoot you tard! Catie: Be nice Addy. Addy: Fine. Alex: We'll be ready in a minute. You can watch us put our boots on if you want. Mai: Better idea, how about we make him put them on our feet? Julia: Genius! Ashley: Agreed. You: Sure.

But to answer your question X, we've got it under control. You: It's DJ. Officer Smith: Jane. Hey Tom, why dont you go show our other friends around town. Tom: Sure Jane. If all of you lovely ladies would follow me. You: What about me? Jane: You'll be... She pauses to look around the corner and make everyone is out of earshot. Ok they're gone. You'll be my slave... She says taking a much darker tone. Isn't that illeg- Ooof! She tackles you and handcuffs your hands behind your back. You are under... a breast... She says as she unbuttons her shirt and rubs her bra covered boobs on your helmet. The view from the optics in your helmet is totally obscured. Well this just wont do. Jane pulls out a PDA and starts typing something, all of the sudden your helmet retracts. Much better. She resumes, only this time her boobs are getting familiar with your face. All of the sudden the rest of your armor retracts, leaving you in your undersuit. Still not the desired reaction... I wonder... She begins taking her shoes and socks off, revealing her sexy metallic pink polish. W-why are you doing that? Because it's the only logical conclusion, plus I can feel your boner poking me in the butt. Her feet soon replace her boobs' place on your face. They're really soft and a tad sweaty, but a little sweat only enhances their awesome natural smell in your opinion. Her toes tap on your forehead. You stick your tongue out and run it along her soles. Oooh, that's nice. I like that footboy. She moves her feet and her toes rest on your lips, thumping up and down awaiting for you to open them. You almost involuntarily open your mouth and slurp in 5 of her toes. You suck on them happily. You know, I bet by now you've figured out that I'm not an actual cop? You nod yes. I like your suit, it's kinda like mine. Only mine is better, and of course more stylish. That's right, I'm the one and only Iron Maiden! She removes her feet from your mouth. I'm sorry. Who are you? The chick in the metal suit! I'm the only one on the Z Team that wears one. Oh. That girl. Ok. She pouts a little bit. Nobody takes me seriously. I'm such a loser supervillain. Well you got me.
