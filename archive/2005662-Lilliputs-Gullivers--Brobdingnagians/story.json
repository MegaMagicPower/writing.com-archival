The stadium of 60,000 parents and parental guardians stood to their feet and cheered on their sons and daughters. The 15,000 high school graduates stood up and tossed their caps into the air. The enormous Lilliputian stadium filled with celebratory jubilation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cheers and applause started to die down, the announcer came over the loud speaker once again. 'If I can have your attention?' The stadium calmed down a bit more. 'We will now announce the winner of the Brobdingnagian Lottery.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I hope I win,' Connie said. 'I deserve to be a huge Brobdingnagian and not some small Lilliput.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope you win too, Connie,' Abbie said in her mousy voice. Abbie was a naturally quiet and shy teenage girl. 'I can picture you as a Brobdingnagian.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'As you all know,' the announcer interrupted the girl's chat, 'in an effort to mix our three civilizations and spread diversity, the Brobdingnag government allows one graduating student from each graduating class to become a Brobdingnagian. All students who wanted to be a part of the lottery, have entered their name into the computer. We will be randomly selecting a graduate, right now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie held onto Abbie's hand as she trembled in anticipation. 'Wish me luck.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I do.' Abbie said softly. She too, put her name in the lottery. She hasn't told her best friend Connie that she was putting her name because she knew how much Connie wanted to be a Brobby. Secretly, Abbie didn't mind seeing herself as a huge Brobby instead of a speck-sized Lilliputian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge stadium screens started flashing all the names of those who put themselves in the lottery. Thousands of names flashed in a second. 'Please, please, please,' Connie muttered. Everyone held their breaths in anticipation. Someone in the graduating class was going to be grown six miles tall and join the Brobdingnagian class that very night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe names started to flash slower. Abbie gripped her friend's hand tighter. Maybe she had a chance of being picked. She could already picture the looks of everybody in school, surprised that the shy timid girl was going to become bigger than their entire city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashing names went slower. She heard other students groan as they saw their name display on the screen, only to be replaced by another name. Abbie's heart fluttered. She hasn't seen her name displayed; that meant it was coming up. So what if the odds were 15,000 to one. There was still a chance for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Abbie felt Connie squeeze her hand, she was holding her breath. \"I've won,\" she whispered as her mouth feel open.<br>\r\nAs Connie's excitement grew Abbie's heart dropped, it looked like Connie would get her wish after all. A smile was starting to appear across Connie's bewildered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as their classmate's attention started to turn towards Connie the name on the screen clicked over one final time...<br>\r\nConnie's smile dropped...<br>\r\nA small gasp escape her lips...<br>\r\nAbbie's name was lit up on the board, the winner of the Brobdingnagian lottery was decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie's heart skipped a beat. She had done it. She had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie's hand fell out of Abbie's, she turned to look at her friend and saw the look of horror on her face.<br>\r\n\"How could you?\" Connie demanded to know. \"I was going to be the Brobby, we always said I was going to be the Brobby not some little speck like you!\" Connie was almost screaming now, Abbie looked at her friend guilt and sympathy running across her face. <br>\r\n\"Connie I'm sorry I just wanted to...\" Abbie didn't get a chance to finish her sentence when Connie's hand flashed up and slapped Abbie across the face. Tears streaming down her face Connie ran off into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie was in shock. Clutching the side of her face she tried to call out after her friend but she dashed off into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Abbie heard her name called, remembering where she was and what had happened she looked up towards the stage where her picture was now displayed across the screen. She was going to be a Brobdingnagian, taking a deep breath she moved towards the stage and her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ceremony things happened very quickly. Abbie was given a short time to say goodbye to her parents. The pride in their face was unmistakable, a child becoming a Brobdingnagian was an incredible achievement. After saying goodbye she was quickly ushered by an Officer of the intersized relationship bureau to be to flown to Brobdingnagian where she would receive her prize and leave her life as a speck behind. She was briefed for several days by the Officers on how her new life in Brobdingnagian would work. As part of the exchange program she would be provided with a house and ongoing financial assistance to establish her new life. Once the procedure was completed she would be handed over the Brobdingnagian Officer who would help with her adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing the sea to Brobdingnagian Island was an easy matter these days travelling via Lilly Hover Transport. Abbie enjoyed the view trying to let her head catch up with what was going on, in less than 5 hours her life as a speck sized Lilly was going to end and she would begin her new life as being almost too big for a tiny Lilly to imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour on the transport an elderly man in a suit came and sat by her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Abigail, I'm Dr Phillips. I'm Enlargement Physician who will be handling your procedure today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hello,\" Abbie responded, her voice almost a squeak of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling? Are you ready for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm I think so,\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more time for think my dear, in a few hours it will be time for living. Let me explain the procedure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie was no longer listening her eyes wondered until she was looking down at her sandaled feet. She pictured Dr Phillips as nothing more than a small black dot on her big toe, his dark hair standing out against her pink nail. Been a Lilly had always made her feel small, even around people her own size. She already knew her new life was going to be all her dreams come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at the Transformation centre Abbie was taken to the preparation facility where the initial steps in her transformation would be prepared. Several nurses prodded and poked her taken their measurements. Abbie sat patiently, although excited she was trying to enjoy every moment. Once the initial tests were complete Dr Phillips came to see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Abbie everything looks good here, I'm going to need you to get changed now and we can carry on with the procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie looked around confused, \"I'm sorry Dr? You just want me to strip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Phillip's looked up from Abbie's notes, \"Of course my dear. In a few minutes those clothes aren't going to fit your little toe.\" The Doctor said with a smirk. \"I'm sure the Officials in Lilliput explained that we were going to have taken you out in the transformation field completely naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie bit her lip, her face was quickly blushing over. Dr Phillips looked back down at her notes, he wasn't leaving. Abbie took a deep breath. Reaching back she undid her hair tie allowing her deep red hair to fall down over her shoulders. Reaching down to her waist she lifted her t-shirt over her head, revealing her skin toned bra. She kicked her sandals off next, her jeans followed to reveal her matching panties. Despite her introvert personality Abbie had a body to be proud of, slender and athletic. Her bra and panties quickly followed revealing a pair of C cup breasts that perfectly completed her athletic build. She tried not to be embarrassed but her hands instinctively covered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Abbie if you want to cover yourself with a towel we can take you to the transformation facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the preparation building Abby was driven with Dr Phillips to the centre of a large open field twenty kilometres away. In the far distance Abby could see what at first she thought was an enormous mountain range. As she drove closer she came to the realisation that it was in fact the Brobdingnagian Preparation facility where she would be taken after the procedures was complete. Eventually the car came to a large asphalt lot in the centre of the road. Reaching the middle Abbie and Dr Phillips exited the car. Dr Phillips reached into to his bag and produced a syringe with one of the rarest drugs on Earth, The Lilliput Enhancement Serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Abigail, this is the moment. I am required to ask you one final time, are you sure you wish to proceed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Abbie responded with a confidence that almost shocked her. She dropped the towel revealing her nudity to Dr Phillips once again, this time she was certain the Doctor took more notice of her body. Her confidence was contagious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Phillips expertly inserted the syringe into Abbie's arm and completed the injection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck Abigail,\" said Doctor Phillips as he returned to the car. She heard the engine start and Abbie was left alone. Several minutes passed with nothing happening. Spotlights shone on Abbie from both the Bobby and Lilly sides of the facility. She knew there were dozens of people watching her standing there naked. Unsure of what was to happen next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her heart starting racing. She felt the breath race out of her lungs. After all her waiting the transformation came suddenly as tingling sensation spread from eyelids down towards her toes. Suddenly a small sinking feeling entered her stomach and for the first time she felt her feet begin to spread across the ground. She was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was slow at first. Abbie took in the sensation of her feet expanding over the ground, she felt her perspective on the distant Lilly Medical facility slowly change. Her heart flutter with the excitement of the change. Suddenly the tingling sensation through her body exploded. Her nipples hardened under the sensation, the jolts flared through her clit causing her to sharply inhale and her growth exploded. Her perspective of the Lilly facility rapidly change as she looking down upon it, it slowly became smaller and smaller towards the ground. Her head began to spin and Abbie lost balance falling to her hands and knees, sending a shockwave into the Lilly facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie closed her eyes trying to stop the vertigo. She took breaths trying to make the sensation pass.<br>\r\nAnd suddenly it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie opened her eyes. The Lilly facility was gone, but no it wasn't. She looked closer the facility was there just in front of her. It was tiny, insignificantly so, like a pebble on the ground. \"Oh my god,\" she mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" A female voice said from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie spun around towards the mountainous Brobby facility, except it wasn't mountainous, it was just a two storey building 100 metres in front of her. Standing at a large entrance was a petite Asian woman. \"Are you OK? The Transformation can be a bit disorientating.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMy name is Grace by the way,\u201d the Asian woman said. \u201cHere\u2019s a robe and a pair of flip flops. Now then, follow me.\u201d Grace spun around and walked towards the Brobdingnag preparation facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie dropped the flip flops and slid her toes under the black thongs. She slipped on the white cotton robe which extended just past her mid-thigh. Before following Grace into the building, she looked down at the pebble on the ground which she knew was the Lilliputian Medical Facility. She couldn\u2019t spot Dr. Phillips car anywhere as he was just far too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore we let you out in the wild, we\u2019ll have to go through a bit of an orientation and training,\u201d Grace directed Abbie to sit at a desk that was piled high with paperwork. \u201cNow that you are a Brobdingnagian, there are few important rules you must learn that you probably weren\u2019t aware of. First off, going to Gulliveria and Lilliput Island is strictly prohibited. You are not allowed to pick up a Gulliverian or a Lilliputian without expressed consent. And lastly, do not use your size to intimidate our smaller cousins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace scribbled some notes on some documents while Abbie looked around the nondescript office. It didn\u2019t really feel like she grew at all. Everything was at her scale and seemed normal. She wondered about her parents and few friends from High School. Was she ever going to see them again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to show you this 15 minute video about Brobdingnag before we head out for training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie sat through the cheesy fifteen minute video. It went over the geography and size scales that the Brobdingnagians are used to. Abbie didn\u2019t learn much and was actually fighting to stay awake. At the end of the video, Grace brought in a silver tray with various objects on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Abbie, anytime you want to communicate with our smaller cousins, you\u2019ll have to use a specialized headset. It turns your booming voice into something gentle that the Gulliverians and Lilliputians can understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie took a long breath as she saw a Gulliverian scaled house on the tray. The other half of the tray seemed empty. Grace placed the tray on the desk in front of Abbie and then took a seat. Abbie lowered her face to the tray as her eyes widened in bewilderment. She whispered <i>wow</i> as she looked over the small house and empty part of the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst lesson, your breath can kill.\u201d Grace said as she pulled out a magnifying glass. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you just inhaled a Lilliputian neighborhood Abbie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her mouth dropped open. \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t know\u2026I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax honey, no one was on there, but take a look for yourself.\u201d Grace handed the magnifying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie looked through the expensive glass at the seemingly empty part of the tray. It was a neighborhood alright\u2014at least what was left of it after Abbie\u2019s breath overcame it like a hurricane. It appeared to be a suburb like where she grew up, except the rows and rows of houses were ripped up from their foundation where she took her breath. Abbie started to get goose bumps as the realization of how small she was started to creep in. Not only that, but her family and friends were still that small. She would have to take extreme care around her former kind if they were going to survive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe training commenced with Grace showing her how to pick up Gulliverians and Lilliputians. They practiced on robots scaled to the two races. Abbie learned how to use her fingernails to pick up Lilliputians by having it upturned and absolutely still. Abbie then received training on communication through the headset. It didn\u2019t take much time and Abbie picked up all facets of a living like Brobdingnagian quite quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just because you got the training,\u201d Grace said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you should go around picking up little people. You should always let your smaller cousins travel on their own and only pick them up in emergencies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie had her upturned index finger held up to her eyes, trying to focus on a Lilly robot. \u201cThat makes sense. I promise not to pick them up unless I absolutely have to.\u201d Abbie looked back down at her index finger. The Lilly robot was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace held back a giggle, \u201cyou still need to work on your breathing around the Lilliputians; otherwise you\u2019ll suck them all up in your nose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the training was over, Abbie was given shorts and a t-shirt to wear. She kept her flip flops on picked up a backpack loaded with bare essentials, such as hygiene products, underwear, and smartphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where we say goodbye.\u201d Grace gave Abbie an amorous hug. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to pick a place to live and a member of staff will give you a ride to your new home. Remember, if you ever need a refresher or want to learn more, you can always stop on by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Grace.\u201d Abbie gave her another hug. \u201cThank you for making this transition a little bit easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie logged onto one of the computers in the lab and looked for her new home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Abbie went with a girl named Heather close to her age. Her newfound roommate accepted her application and in less than 20 minutes, Abbie was in a car headed for her new home. She exited the vehicle and looked at the small home located in a quaint Brobby neighborhood. Her flip flops smacked against the soles of her feet as she walked up to the front door. Before she could knock, the door swung open and an excited tall blonde appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you Abbie?\u201d The blonde asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Abbie squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi roomie!\u201d Heather leaned down and gave the petite Abbie a hug. \u201cI\u2019m so excited you chose to live with me.\u201d Heather was nearly screaming. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you were a Lilliputian. Oh my god, you have to tell me everything. I mean, I have Lilliputian friends who have visited me, but I never met one that had grown! Oh, you have to come inside, let me take your bag. Do you want some tea; I got the kettle going already.\u201d Heather spoke a mile a minute and Abbie almost had a hard time keeping up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTea will be fine.\u201d She said through a shy smile. Abbie felt small around Heather. Abbie reckoned she was close to six feet tall, about eight inches taller than herself. Abbie listened to Heather\u2019s bare feet slap against the tiled floor as she walked to the kitchen. Abbie stood in the hallway unsure where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey come over here and talk to me.\u201d Heather almost sounded like a little kid who just met her hero. \u201cWe need to get to know each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather brought a tray with two cups of tea and biscuits to the living room. Abbie sat on the couch and so did Heather\u2014almost a bit too close for Abbie\u2019s comfort. They talked and got to know each other. Heather mostly steered the conversation and talked all about herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Heather usually hosted Lilliputians in her home for parties and whatnot. She also had a fling with a Gulliverian male which eventually fizzled. Heather gave a tour of her house (which her parents bought her) and showed Abbie to her room which was fully furnished. It was a small house almost like a bed and breakfast. It felt warm and was pleasantly decorated. It still hadn\u2019t dawned on Abbie that she was now six miles tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tour of the home, the girls made it back to the living room where they sat lazily on the couch. It was getting dark outside and Abbie was feeling worn out from such a packed day. But Heather continued talking and not leaving Abbie\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you have a Lilly boyfriend that you left behind?\u201d Heather asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Abbie asked coyly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a boyfriend, so no.\u201d Her cheeks turned red in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? A girl like you? Why not?\u201d Heather sipped on her bed time tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess no one wanted to date me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Heather giggled. \u201cA girl as pretty as you, I bet you were fighting guys off of you on a daily basis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie smiled warmly at the compliment. She hardly ever got any compliments, especially from her best friend Connie. Abbie wondered if Connie still considered her a friend after she won the Brobby Lottery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got any friends who want to visit you out here?\u201d Heather asked. Abbie wondered for a second if Heather was reading her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s usually exciting for a Lilly to visit Brobdingnag; I bet your friends would love to come out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll ask.\u201d Abbie said thinking about who she should invite.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This ended up meaning that Heather's breasts were resting on Abby's head! She gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry Abbie,\" laughed Heather as she allowed the ex-Lily to escape, \"I wanted a hug with my new friend. I like hugs. Okay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm.. y..\" Abby was encircled by long athletic arms and legs and crushed into Heathers toned stomach, as the world tipped and she fell onto the rug, the bigger girl falling from above... Abbie almost screamed! Heather was a Brob! A huge Brob, an over 6 mile high nightmare with feet the size of neighbourhoods coming to crush her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet. Abbie risked opening her eyes. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">She was staring at a huge dirty sole falling towards her!</font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie stopped after a while. Heather stood over her and Abbie shivered as she followed those long muscular legs up to.. Abbie quickly glanced past her underwear and saw her body stretching up and looking down.... An wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Race memory,\" said Heather, Matter of factly. It was the first time she's actually heard her be serious about anything. She was still shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can y-you ppp-p\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down? No. Sorry. It's race memory. Do you know what that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-r-r\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather shifted her leg and Abbie almost lost it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I got some training to, you know. They don't let just anyone take on a new convert! What's happening is this....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather sounded so sure and smart. Not the impossible to read mass of jolliness from earlier..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather rummaged through a load of papers with coffee stains and rips in. \"Er... No.... Damnit, not page 3! Ah. YES! Oh, no. Okay I'm going to have to do this from memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" squeaked Abbie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember me crushing you and your whole family and all your friends under my foot without even noticing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrgh! What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no, missed a bit. You are going through psychological rejection. Yes. They said it was normal. You are used to being.... \" Heather sighed \"I can't believe you were smaller than the sugar ants in my kitchen yesterday! Anyway, you have lived your whole life being a tiny teeny little bug, smaller than a small ant and your mind can't handle being like me, because of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather looked at another page. \"...me. I scare you instinctively because of race memory. Remember when I asked if you remembered me treading on everyone you knew? Not an accident. That's what your subconscious is doing now. Our people have a history stretching back hundreds of thousands of years. And although we've all got on fine for our lifetimes, most of that time consisted of any meeting between us and your former people stuck to the soles of our feet in their hundreds or thousands. Your ex-people, who you used to be were just dirt beneath our feet and we were... gods? Natural disasters. Your ancestors evolved instincts that when you see one of us acting a certain way you will be terrified. It's dormant now in nearly all of the Lilliputions but the stress of suddenly changing and the resulting identity crisis can lead to paranoia *cough* believing it all to be a trick followed by this. The subconscious mind plunges back into the most primal parts of the brain trying to cling onto what it considers the core of who. You. Are. And do you know what that is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was a mountain in sillouhette, the light haloed behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tiny insect, terrified of being crushed by me,\" Heather concluded. <br>\r\nAbbie simply stared at this tall suddenly quite different Brob...She began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rubbish!\" yelled Heather reaching down and pulling Abbie up into almost a mad drunken waltz. \"You are <i>not</i> a Lillipution now! That's gone! You are reborn as one of us. You are a Brobdingnagian! What are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brobby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a Brobdingnagian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather pulled back releasing Abbie to stand on her own two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a Brobdingnagian. I'm a BROBDINGNAGIAN!\" she yelled, and it was full of joy. Heather smiled and hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proud of you. Speck of dirt no more. My fellow Brobdingnagian I welcome you to humanity!\" Heather kissed her on the forehead and they embraced. Abbie felt less scared than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still feel a bit..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather shushed her with her finger. \"Hush. You'll still struggle for a bit. We need to get you to shed your old midset and accept your new identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Heather smiled , \"You said Polly or someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend to come and visit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Connie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay,\" Heather was back to her old self, grinning from ear to ear and bouncing on the balls of her feet, \"And she's really just a third of a millimeter high?\" She seemed quite breathless at the very thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. suppose yes... she is now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat just happened? It was like Heather had just turned into someone else talking about psychology and scaring the life out of her and now it was like that had never happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why bring just one liitle friend? I want to meet everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have many friends..\" said Abbie sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's face sagged a bit. \"Well it would be more fun with lots of Lillys. Well you've got... Connie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who else, all of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's Fae.\" Heather smiled and nodded encouragingly. \" and Caroline, but that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no you must get on with more people. No boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Heather looked sad. \"I quite liked Emily, Leyla and Shana. There were nice sometimes and never horrible to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie sat on the sofa and didn't flinch when Heather bounded on as well and cuddled her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you were a bit of a millimeter tall this morning! Imagine if you were like that now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie stared at Heather's foot and nearly lost it, but instead clung tighter and let the bigger girl smother her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make a list... I can't wait till they get here!\" Heather was almost purring with anticipation as she pressed her new little housemate close to her and felt her racing heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t worry; I will take good care of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie felt the ground underneath her shake as she tried to pinpoint the source of the voice. A land mass collapsed a hundred feet to her right where she stood. She saw a tan mountain range with a deep gap running dead center of it. But this wasn\u2019t a mountain range, for it had a tan pillar rising high above the dark sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDowngrade?\u201d Abbie started backing up while trying to discern what the object was in front of her. \u201cLilliputian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, silly.\u201d Abbie knew it was Heather now speaking to her. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take care of you and everyone you know and love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Abbie\u2019s breathing became erratic as she now noticed she wasn\u2019t alone. All her friends were standing around her including her parents. They were bewildered and staring up into the sky. \u201cHeather, why did I downgrade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you wanted to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Abbie heard herself say. \u201cI want to be a Brobby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you sure haven\u2019t been acting like your want to be a Brobby. Oh, you all are so tiny and cute. Well, I mean, I can\u2019t see you, but I bet you all are so cute. How big do I look?\u201d Heather brought her foot over the 20 Lilliputians; even her pinky toe was large enough to decimate a Lilliputian neighborhood, let alone 20 Lillies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt us!\u201d Abbie cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather giggled as she brought her foot down on Abbie and everyone she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, oh my god!\u201d Abbie awoke on the couch screaming. It was morning the next day, yet her mind hadn\u2019t processed that yet thanks to her nightmare. \u201cHeather don\u2019t!\u201d Abbie\u2019s eyes opened wide, filled with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather came storming into the living room wearing only her black boy shorts and bra. \u201cAbbie, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Her bare feet thudded across the carpet, standing over Abbie who was acting like an escape mental patient. \u201cAre you okay, honey?\u201d Heather lowered herself onto the couch and embraced Abbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie accepted the hug but felt frozen in fear of Heather nevertheless. Her head sunk into Heather\u2019s breasts and her arms squeezed her warm toned body. Her breathing return to normal as she felt safe, yet terrified of Heather at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dreamed I got shrunk back to a Lilliputian. I dreamed you stepped on me, my friends, and my family.\u201d Abbie\u2019s throat felt sore as she spoke between her cries. \u201cWhy would you crush me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather tried not to giggle. \u201cHoney, I would never do such a thing. And you\u2019re a Brobby, not a Lilly. Don\u2019t forget that. Remember what I said, it\u2019s just ex-race memories coming to haunt you. You know how people who have had amputations, like their arms being chopped off, well, there is a condition where they feel like their arm is still there, attached to them still. I think it\u2019s called phantom limb or something like that. Anyway, that\u2019s just like what you are experiencing now. You\u2019re mind hasn\u2019t accepted its new life as a Brobby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease promise me you will never crush me under your feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd promise you\u2019ll never hurt any of my Lilliputian friends. Or my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to downgrade into a Lilliputian. I don\u2019t like being weak and tiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got an idea.\u201d Heather pushed Abbie up on the couch. \u201cLet\u2019s have them come over right away. That way you can see with your own eyes that you\u2019re a Brobby and not a speck. Come on, I promise it will make you feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! I can\u2019t wait to see them!\u201d Heather hugged Abbie. \u201cOh, and one last thing,\u201d Heather adjusted herself on the couch and brought her feet up on Abbie\u2019s lap. Abbie recoiled as images of her nightmare raced into her mind. \u201cSee, they\u2019re not big scary, stomping machines.\u201d Heather giggled referring to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was right, Abbie admitted to herself. Heather had a pair of really cute feet, albeit bigger than hers, but that was due to Heather being a much taller girl than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who\u2019s coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, like I said before, there\u2019s Fae, Caroline, Emily,\u201d Abbie had to pause and think a little harder, \u201cLeyla, Shana, Lucy, and maybe Connie if she\u2019s still talking to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd boys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t know any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea right.\u201d Heather wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cCome on, I want to hear at least one boy you\u2019ll invite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you, and I\u2019m not going to stop bothering you until you give me a name.\u201d Heather jammed her toes into Abbie\u2019s sides causing her to twitch from the ticklish feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Abbie did know a boy. A casual acquaintance and a boy she admired in school but was too shy to speak to. \u201cJoel. I\u2019ll invite Joel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, now was that so hard?\u201d Heather rose up from the couch and started heading out the room, \u201cI\u2019m going to get ready for them. I can have a private Lilliputian pick them up as soon as they agree to come over.\u201d Heather turned, but stopped herself. \u201cOr we can meet them at the border. What do you think we should do?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heather held her hand in front of Abby \u201cLook at my nails last week they would have towered over you. They could crush your parents house with no effort at all she said laughing slightly. Abby stared at Heathers nails and imagined them towering over her old home, the image was terrifying, then she looked at her own and had the same thought only them it was her as a giantess and the thought sent a tingle down her spine it made her feel powerful, Heather then pointed to their toes, \u201cEveryone you went to school with can now fit on your big toe nail with plenty of room to spare, our pinkie toes can crush your old school, can you imagine being a speck on my toenail still? Can you imagine all the people who were ever mean to you standing on yours? Abby immediately thought of Trish, Trish can no longer hurt her, she Trish would now me crushed under the weight of her nail clippings, even just a small strand of her hair, Abby smiled at this thought. She looked down at her toes imagining spec sized people on them, she can\u2019t believe she\u2019s a Brobby now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the boarder Abby began too look towards the ground and she started to see the the border town, it was just a small town, no tall buildings at all, it just looked like dirt as she approached she got to see how small it really was, not much bigger than her both her feet put together, being out in the open and no one watching over her and Heather she placed her foot right next the town having it pinkie toe side, it made her feel so huge, her pinkie toe could crush 100s of houses and people, her high heels dominated the town, she could not believe how small she used to be, she looked down at the town between her legs and thought none of them could stop her just place her feet right no top of the town, could not wait for her friends to arrive. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Abbie slept like a rock that night. Her dreams of becoming a Brobdingnagian had come true, but the thing was, it still felt like a dream. For all she knew it could have been an elaborate prank masterminded by that bitch Shannon from school. The thought alone made Abbie wake up in a cold sweat. Was she really a Brobby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, she hasn't seen any actual evidence of her growth. Was she really six miles tall in comparison to a Lilliputian? Back at the training facility, she never actually saw a living, breathing Lilliputian or Gulliverian. Just little models which could have easily been artificial (i.e. Lilliputian made). If this was an elaborate prank, then that meant Heather was an actor, a part of the prank. This whole situation was practically the Truman Show starring Abbie: the gullible Lilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie's wondering mind eventually tired her and transitioned to sleep. She awoke the next morning to the yellow sun rays on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine sleepy head,\" Heather announced, bursting into Abbie's room. \"I want to get an early start today and show you off around town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" Abbie shielded her eyes as Heather opened the blinds as wide as they could go. \"Can we go to a clothing store while we are out? I only own a shirt and skirt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yea, we'll go all over town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie felt pretty gross putting on the same clothes from yesterday, but she didn't really have a choice. Her new flip flops were already conforming to her soles nicely and she wasn\u2019t really keen on replacing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's car looked familiar but Abbie didn't immediately recognize it as a Lilliputian model. As Heather drove from the quaint neighborhood to the town center, Abbie studied the architecture of the homes and commercial buildings. Like Heather's car, they seemed familiar, yet different. Abbie figured it was a 50/50 shot whether she was in Lilliput or Brobdingnag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First stop, coffee!\" Heather skidded the car into an empty parking spot in front of the coffee shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather ordered the coffee while Abbie sat alone with her new smartphone. She logged into her bank account that her father created and got the payment system to work with her phone. Next, she sent a few texts to her father and mother. She hesitated for a minute and then wrote a short text to her older sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like caramel macchiato.\" Heather said bringing the two drinks to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've actually never had it,\" Abbie curiously lifted the hot drink to her nose and gave it a sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You don't have coffee shops in Lilliput?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do, but they only sell, well, coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather giggled, and then took a sip. \"Did you get your phone working?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works.\" Abbie wore a half smile. \"I sent a few messages to my family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You should invite them over! I'll make dinner and get the house all clean for your teeny tiny family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That--that sounds wonderful.\" Abbie forced a smile this time. She braced herself for a prank or trick. She tried to read Heather's body language but nothing about the blonde seemed suspicious. \"I'll ask them if they want to stop by.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to meet them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes shopping went by quick for Abbie even though she was starting with an empty wardrobe. Heather on the other hand took forever in browsing, fitting, and finally buying large quantities of clothes. Heather's car quickly filled with loot from the shopping spree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie started warming up to Heather and secretly hoping she was the real deal and not pulling her leg. But as the day went on, she was starting to forget about the notions that she was being played. Still--to seal the deal, she would need to the other races in the flesh. Maybe hold a Gulliverian in the palm of her hand, or look at a fellow Lilliputian through a magnifying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie received a text from her father that stated he was happy to come over to see his 'little' girl. He also mentioned it took some convincing to get Lucy, her older sister, to come along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents are coming tonight for sure now,\" Abbie told Heather as she drove erratically through the Brobdingnagian neighborhood. \"My sister is also coming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather could hear the change in tone as Abbie mentioned her sister. \"Do you get along with your sister?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do.\" Abbie clenched the inside door bar as Heather to a sharp turn without slowing. \"But I kinda ruined our future plans when I won the Brobby lottery.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she jealous?\" Heather smiled as she pictured all Lilliputians dreaming of becoming a Brobdingnagian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was conservative enough for her parents but still looked sexy, although that wasn\u2019t her intention; she just wanted to look cute. Heather on the other hand went with her super short shorts that showed off her impossibly long legs. Her skinny shirt barely came down past her belly button. Anytime she lifted or moved her arms, her midriff was exposed for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the menu tonight, we have spaghetti and meatballs,\" Heather said while bringing two cups of tea into Abbie's room. She set the drinks down on the desk and fell back into Abbie's bed where she was sitting, playing with her new smartphone. \"Do your parents like spaghetti and wine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, yea they do, but how are they going to eat if they are Lilliputians?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh. I realize they are Lilliputians. You need to have more faith in me. I have my Gulliverian friend making their food. Don't worry, he's a great cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie's ears perked up. \"Is he coming by? Can I meet him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can. He's already downstairs in the kitchen. I didn't introduce you to him earlier because he's kinda busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it for Abbie. An opportunity to prove to herself that she'd grown to a Brobby by seeing a fellow human from the smaller race. \"What's his name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mentioned him before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've been paying attention to my stories.\u201d Heather joked. \u201cHe's my ex-boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're ex agreed to cook dinner for my parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is that strange to you?\" Heather grinned. \"That little sleaze-ball wants to get back together so bad, he'll practically do anything I ask.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's okay with cooking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that what I said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just sounds odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you come downstairs and ask him why he's fucking weird.\" Heather jumped out of the bed and headed out the door, \"come on, I'll introduce you to the pig.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie followed Heather closely. This was the first time she was going to see a Gulliverian. Even when she was a Lilliputian she never saw a (400ft.) Gulliverian, now she was going to see one from the perspective of a Brobdingnagian. But that's if she was a Brobdingnagian. Only if. She really hoped Brian was an inch tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you, ya little shit.\u201d Heather said in a funny tone upon walking into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right where you left me, ya ditzy blonde bitch.\u201d A squeaky voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather and Abbie set their headsets to listen in on the Gulliverian frequency. They walked over to the kitchen counter nearest the stove. There was Brian, a hunk of a man at one inch in height. He was tending to a spaghetti meal scaled to his size, working at an oven...scaled to his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho you calling a blonde bitch?\u201d Heather said with a fake angered tone. \u201cI oughta squish you under my foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see ya try.\u201d Brian looked over behind Heather and saw a girl, about the same age as her, but much shorter and cuter. \u201cWell, who do we have here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Abbie,\u201d Heather told Brian. \u201cPig, meet Abbie. Abbie, pig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d Abbie said in her mousy voice. She was flabberghasted. Right before her, was a real life Gulliverian. Only an inch tall in her perspective. Abbie walked past Heather in almost a zombie like state. Her crotch was about level with the counter and Brian. New feelings were coursed through Abbie as she looked down at the one inch figure. It was the first time she didn't feel small in comparison to another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, Abbie,\u201d Brian said in his deep masculine voice. \u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you. May I ask, how did you get mixed up with this sorry excuse for a Brobby?\u201d He was referring to Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Hah, hah.\u201d Heather mocked. \u201cTell me, why haven\u2019t I squashed you yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you love me.\u201d He was dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, be still my quivering loins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on Heather, you know you want me. Why else would you have asked me here tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want you to freaking cook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, okay.\u201d Brian laughed. \u201cYou want me to cook for Abbie\u2019s parents who are Lilliputians. She doesn\u2019t look like a Lilliputian to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is!\u201d Heather objected. \u201cI mean, she was. She won the Brobby Lottery and now she\u2019s a Brobdingnagian. But she really was a Lilliputian. Tell him, Abbie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea,\u201d Brian said turning to Abbie who still had her mouth opened. \u201cTell me how you were a Lilliputian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Words escaped Abbie. The whole scene in front of her just seemed so out of place. \u201cI am a Lilliputian. I mean, I was a Lilly, but I won the Brobby Lottery from school and now I\u2019m a--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo shit?\u201d Brian cut her off. \u201cAre you guys fucking with me? Don\u2019t fuck with me, I\u2019m not in the mood for that shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not joking Brian.\u201d Heather said. \u201cAnd watch your fucking language. Anyway, if you want proof that she was a Lilly, just stick around when her little parents show up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I get it.\u201d Brian said. \u201cThis is just some trick to keep me here tonight. Come on Heather, just admit it, you want me to spend the night over. Just come out and say it! You want your little sugar bear tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking disgusting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha--?\u201d Abbie heard herself say. Her phone vibrated in her hand as she received a text from her mother stating they were set to arrive in half an hour. \u201cMy parents are on their way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I must return to cooking.\u201d Brian gave a smug grin to Heather before showing her his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then,\u201d Heather mocked his voice. \u201cCome on Abbie, let\u2019s get the tables ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls proceeded to set the table, including a section in the middle where Brian and her parents would sit. In Brobdingnag, most homes were equipped Lilliputian and/or Gulliverian tube transports. These tubes were a hybrid of rail and suction that transported little train cars at incredible speeds from a central station. The tubes were equipped with sorters and routers that worked efficiently to transport all the cars heading to their unique destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather\u2019s home was equipped with both the Lilly and Gulliverian tube receptacles at her kitchen counter. She cleaned and wiped the area with care because even the smallest speck of dirt would show up as boulders to Abbie\u2019s Lilliputian parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get so excited every time I meet a Lilliputian.\u201d Heather said as she finished cleaning the kitchen. \u201cYou guys are just so tiny.\u201d She said looking down to Abbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not tiny anymore.\u201d Abbie squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo me you are,\u201d Heather giggled as she patted Abbie on the head. Heather then grabbed a small basket of bread and delivered them to the dining room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her,\u201d Brian said. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking huge to me anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile formed on Abbie\u2019s lips. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red light and alarm sounded at the arrival of Abbie\u2019s parents at the tube exit on the kitchen counter. Abbie\u2019s heart fluttered. She was about to see her parents for the first time after she grew. It was also the first time she was going to see a Lilliputian as they are to Brobdingnagians. Any doubts that she\u2019d grown had already receded from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie changed her headset to the general frequency and said, \u201chello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbigail, is that you?\u201d It was her father. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of the tube right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie\u2019s heart raced even faster. She looked intently at the little red LED light above the tube entrance. At her size, she couldn\u2019t actually see the entrance doorway, but she knew it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this place is amazing,\u201d Abbie\u2019s mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Her sister asked in a disgruntled tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here, where are you guys?\u201d Abbie took a step forward. Her parents and sister looked up into the sky and saw their \u2018little\u2019 Abbie all grown up. Even the gentle footsteps from Abbie were like earth shattering quakes. \u201cDid you guys come out of the tube?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm breeze overcame the three Lilliputians as they stood in awe. Abbie\u2019s older sister shielded behind her mother as Abbie\u2019s skirt filled up their entire view. Heather walked in just in time to see Abbie leaning over on the counter and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Straight ahead of the Lilliputian family, right past the horizon of the counter, were Abbie\u2019s cylindrical legs, clad in black leggings that ended right below her purple skirt. Nothing in their senses allowed them to comprehend just how gigantic their \u2018little\u2019 Abbie was. Just the gap between Abbie\u2019s thighs was large enough to fit a couple of luxury cruise liners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should go home mom.\u201d Lucy said. \u201cI knew this was a bad idea. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit pulling my arm honey. Look at you, you\u2019re shaking, why are you shaking? Are you scared of your little sister?\u201d Anna asked her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d Lucy gritted her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbigail, can you hear me?\u201d Garrett, Abbie\u2019s father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes daddy, you don\u2019t have to yell. I can hear you fine through my earpiece.\u201d Abbie said in her trademark shy tone. \u201cI want you guys to meet my roommate Hea\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Heather,\u201d Heather almost shouted in excitement. She jumped out from behind Abbie. Her thunderous jump reverberated through the kitchen counter that Abbie\u2019s family was on, causing them to lose their balance. \u201cI\u2019m Abbie\u2019s awesome roommate and best friend in the whole wide world. I\u2019m a little loud and bit clumsy, hopefully no accidents will happen around you tiny ones.\u201d Heather let out a maniacal laugh. \u201cAbbie told me all about you guys. Did she say anything about me? Probably not, she\u2019s such an introvert. Did you even know she had a roommate? Oh, welcome to my house! It\u2019s a small cottage built about 70 years ago during the dark Lilliputian times. I\u2019m <i>so</i> sorry what my people did to your people. Oh, but now Abbie\u2019s my people, and she started as your people! Isn\u2019t that crazy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you shut up already,\u201d it was Brian. He was walking up on the counter in front of the Brobdingnagian roommates with oven mitts still on his hands. He wore a pink apron with a white frilly lace outline. Brian stood a few hundred feet (in Lilliputian scale) away from Abbie\u2019s parents and sister. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Brian. That ditzy blonde who\u2019s wearing inappropriate clothing for a dinner party, is my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Heather said, \u201cI am not your girlfriend. Second of all, never tell me to \u2018shut up\u2019 or else I\u2019ll squish you under\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, yea, yea, you\u2019ll squish me under your yeti feet. Honey, must we fight in front of company?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me honey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, you\u2019re shouting again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you call me honey one more time...\u201d Heather waved her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about this folks.\u201d Brian turned on the charm for Abbie\u2019s parents who stood still watching the giant argue with the giga-sized giantess. \u201cShe\u2019s really not as bad as she\u2019s making herself out to be right now. She can be quite sweet and friendly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sweet and friendly, asshole.\u201d Heather shouted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry guys,\u201d Heather redirected herself to the three dots on her counter. \u201cI really am sweet and friendly; just ask Abbie here.\u201d Heather wrapped an arm over Abbie\u2019s shoulders and pulled her head close to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s nice.\u201d Abbie blurted out. Heather\u2019s strength surprised Abbie for a second, but it did make sense that the tall Brobby could overpower her smaller stature. Heather released Abbie, letting her cough and wheeze. \u201cSo,\u201d Abbie said, \u201cwho\u2019s ready to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen years back, Brian used to entertain his younger sister with her Lilliputian-sized dollhouse. He would help her set up the little furniture, play make-believe, and hold miniature tea parties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that time, Brian has always had a skill for handling little things to include preparing meals for Lilliputians. The dinner party with Abbie\u2019s parents was no different to other Lilliputian parties that Heather hosted in the past. Brian served the meals on the Lilliputian table that was set up on Heather\u2019s dining table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever eaten a dish prepared from a giant before,\u201d Abbie\u2019s father said. \u201cBut now I can. And I must say this is amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you sir.\u201d Brian spoke as he sat next to Heather\u2019s plate. \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear you enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it is good.\u201d Anna said. \u201cThe noodles are so big, like my wrist. But it\u2019s so yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Brian smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s so refreshing to hear a compliment from time to time. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ve never received a compliment from Heather for my cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I can\u2019t taste the little dishes you make,\u201d Heather said. \u201cYou make everything too small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo shit, here\u2019s a news flash: I\u2019m small compared to you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you enjoying the food, Lucy?\u201d Abbie asked, trying to quell the impending argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good\u2014I guess.\u201d Lucy hushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can get you more meat sauce if you\u2019d like Lucy.\u201d Brian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d Lucy said. Abbie knew her sister well\u2014especially when she was uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, Heather took me around town today.\u201d Abbie said. \u201cIt was like being back at home. Not much seems different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds amazing,\u201d Lucy said in monotone. \u201cMom, dad, ready to go home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo home?\u201d Heather complained. \u201cBut you all just got here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you calm down?\u201d Brian said. \u201cIf they want to go home, let them go home. Don\u2019t intimidate them into staying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not intimidating anyone.\u201d Heather stood up, her chair sliding back. \u201cI\u2019m a gentle person and you know it.\u201d Heather leaned over Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian almost seemed unfazed. \u201cOh I get it.\u201d Brian then turned to the Lilliputian family. \u201cIt must be that time of the month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse us.\u201d Heather squinted her eyes, pissed off at Brian, and used her thumb and index finger to pluck him from the table. \u201cI think it is Brian\u2019s bedtime.\u201d Before Brian could interject, Heather knocked off his headset with a flick of the finger. Heather walked away, her bare feet creating a thunderous thud as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to hurt him?\u201d Garett asked. \u201cIs she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Heather is not that kind of Brobby.\u201d Abbie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s weird.\u201d Lucy said. \u201cMom, I really want to leave before she gets back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Anna said. \u201cWhat do you think honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Garett had finished his giant meal. \u201cI reckon we can head back soon. We got a chance to see our little girl. We know she\u2019s doing well. Her roommate seems fun\u2014I reckon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere were we?\u201d Heather returned to her seat. She had a slight glow and was smiling. \u201cSorry about Brian. He knows how to push my buttons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt him, did you?\u201d Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, of course not.\u201d Heather said. \u201cI\u2019m really a nice person. I dated Brian a while back and we had a mutual breakup. Heather winced and repressed a sound deep within her throat. \u201cAnyway, we still hang out with each other from time to time. But enough about me, how are you liking Brobby land?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d Lucy said. \u201cYou are too big and I don\u2019t feel comfortable around either of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, relax.\u201d Anna told her daughter. \u201cThey\u2019re not strangers. That\u2019s your sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sister was shorter than me. <i>That</i> is not my sister,\u201d Lucy pointed at Abbie. \u201cWhy did you do it? Why would you leave me?\u201d Lucy asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out. Heather fidgeted in her seat and it seemed like she moaned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy, what has gotten into you?\u201d Garett asked. \u201cThat\u2019s your sister! We\u2019re still a family goddamnit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather moaned. There was no doubt about it this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Abbie\u2019s eyes were turning glassy. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be picked. Please don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather smirked and moaned. All eyes turned to her. Heather\u2019s cheeks turned red as she noticed she was in the center of attention. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think this is a uh, uh. Oh gooood. I think this is a family matter and I should excu\u2014escussse myself. Oh fuck yea.\u201d Heather tried to hold it together, but her insistent moans kept interrupting. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you Abb\u2014oh\u2014Abbie. I\u2019ll see you in a sec.\u201d Heather rose from her seat. Her legs were jelly as she walked away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to go home.\u201d Lucy said. \u201cI\u2019ll go by myself if I have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should go home, dear.\u201d Anna told Garett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say Abigail?\u201d Garett asked his \u2018little\u2019 daughter. \u201cWould you mind if we head home now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Abbie didn't make any sudden movies, the last thing she wanted to do was scare the little guy. The last thing Abbie was expecting to be in her bag was a tiny Lilliputian. Abbie gets on her knees so that she was eye level with the kitchen counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid I\u2019m getting on my knees.\u201d Abbie said softly, unaware of the damage she was causing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn\u2019t like this, he didn\u2019t even know where he was. One moment Kyle was grabbed by a Brobdingnagian kid and then thrown into something soft, the next he was on a hard surface, looking up at the face of another Brobdingnagian, a face that was 1000s of times bigger than he was. Then the unspeakable happened, she talked, with a voice that was like thunder, and raging winds that knocked him back a few feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie looking at the little speck, which was Kyle, saw how he seem to stumble backwards and fall. Abbie instantly knew that it was her fault, Abbie still was not use to her knew found might just yet, and therefore still was not a expert in controlling her voice. Abbie puts her right hand over her mouth and lets out a little gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, little guy. Are you ok?\u201d Abbie asked with great concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle still on his butt, did nothing but look at the planet size face that belonged to the Brobdingnagian women. Kyle was afraid and yet couldn\u2019t help but feel attracted to this giant girl. Kyle came to Brobdingnagia to have a good time with his friends, Kyle and his friends never expected to ever meet a Brobdingnagian, interactions between a Brobdingnagian and a Lilliputian were rare, but now Kyle was face to face with one and to make matters worse he was separated from his friends. Kyle startled by the sound of a loud boom, sees Abbie\u2019s right hand rise to her mouth. Kyle soon came to the conclusion that the loud boom that he heard a second ago was a sonic boom caused by Abbie moving her hand. Kyle once again heard the sound of thunder echo in the distance, Kyle knew that this so called thunder was the caused by the Brobdingnagian, trying to speak to him. Kyle could help but think, how could anything be so powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie felt like a idiot for trying to speak to the little guy, what was the point when she couldn\u2019t hear him. She remembered what she was told during her training, Abbie was told that a Brobdingnagians voice was deadly to a Lilliputian and how special head wear was needed to communicate with them, headwear that she had. Abbie movies toward one of her bags and gets out a small plastic container that held a big and small head set. On the top of the plastic container red the words \u201cEntertain Lilliputians.\u201d Abbie cuts open the plastic container with a couple of scissors and gently places the nano sized Lilliputian headset on the kitchen counter right next to the Lilliputian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle began to panic as he saw Abbie\u2019s giant sized hand come towards him, a hand capable of wiping out cities with ease. Kyle closed his eyes and put his hands over his hands hoping to stop the Abbie\u2019s hand from making contact with him, deep down Kyle knew that his meager strength could do nothing to stop even one of Abbie\u2019s hairs, let alone one of her fingers but he was desperate. A few minutes passed and Kyle noticed that he was still alive, opening his eyes Kyle noticed that Abbie had set something on the ground, looking closer Kyle noticed that it was a headset. Looking up at Abbie\u2019s giant face Kyle noticed that Abbie had put a headset on her head just like the one on the ground in front of him, the only difference was Abbie\u2019s was a hundred times bigger. Kyle puts on the headset with great unease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm hello\u201d Kyle says into the microphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I can hear you.\u201d Abbie said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing these things worked, or we would be in trouble.\u201d Abbie said with a little giggle, as she looked down at the speck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea\u201d Kyle said feeling awkward, as he starred up at Abbie\u2019s gigantic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn\u2019t hear the thunder in Abbie\u2019s voice anymore. Abbie\u2019s headset adjusted her voice to a safe level so that Kyle could understand her with out being hurt. Kyle felt the ground rumble as Abbie giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my names Abbie, what\u2019s yours?\u201d  Abbie asked as she leaned in a little closer to Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle, you\u2019re?\u201d Kyle asked trying not to sound scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbbie.\u201d Abbie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie with great care stuck her finger out towards Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Kyle felt fear, as he let out a little yelp that echoed in Abbie\u2019s headset. Kyle saw a Abbie\u2019s massive finger come towards him slowly. Kyle didn\u2019t close his eyes, instead he watched as Abbie\u2019s finger came towards him and stopped just a few inches away from his face. Kyle soon realized that Abbie wasn\u2019t trying to kill him but give him a handshake. It was strange but Kyle reached out and grabbed Abbie\u2019s finger unable to shake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle could feel every nook and cranny that made up Abbie\u2019s finger, the curves that formed Abbie\u2019s finger prints. He was amazed, if he was not careful he would be stuck in between Abbie\u2019s ridges and Abbie wouldn\u2019t even noticed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie couldn\u2019t feel anything as Kyle grasped her finger. Abbie was excited, when was he was in High school she didn\u2019t really talk to boys, she was always to shy, now not only was she talking to a boy, but a boy that was so itty bitty compared to her. As Abbie looked at Kyle she couldn\u2019t believe how small he was, she couldn\u2019t believe that she use to be as small as Kyle, it turned her on just thinking how weak Kyle was compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Kyle how did you get in my bag?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle told Abbie everything that had happened to him over the past few days as he sat on the kitchen counter that came up to Abbie\u2019s titanic breast. Kyle told Abbie, how he had came to Brobdingnagian with his friends, and how a evil Brobdingnagian child had kidnapped him and threw him inside of Abbie\u2019s bag against his will. Kyle deep down wanted reunite with his friends, who were probably worried sick about him. But the question that plagued his mind was how? Kyle had lost his phone when he was picked up by that Brobdingnagian kid, therefor he had no way of contacting his friends. Kyle looked up at Abbie, whose face was right above him and was  bigger than a whole mountain \u26f0 and a thousand Lilliputian buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie sat down in a black stool chair leaning in to get a better look at the tiny speck that was Kyle, who rested on the kitchen counter. Abbie felt bad for Kyle, she couldn\u2019t help but remember the time when she was a Lilliputian, how helpless would she have been if this had been her? Abbie had gotten a good look at Kyle, granted  she had to use a magnifying glass to see him clearly, but she had to say Kyle was a little hottie. Abbie started to feel shy, which was a little ridiculous seeing as how Kyle was so small compared to Abbie\u2019s massive form. Abbie wanted to help Kyle as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK KYLE DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER THAT I CAN CALL, IF YOU DO THAN MAYBE WE CAN GET YOU HELP.\u201d Abbie says into her headset, as she takes out her smartphone \ud83d\udcf2 from her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was gradually getting used to Abbie\u2019s BOOMING voice as it radiated all around him, vibrating the ground beneath him. Kyle was also getting used to Abbie as she towered over him, casting him in her shadow. Kyle could tell that Abbie was a kind person, and her humongous size did nothing but make her more beautiful. As time past Kyle was getting used to Abbie, and soon was able to speak with her like she was a old friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I have one number.\u201d Kyle says into his headset as he stood before the 300 foot eye in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe number belongs to my friend Dexter. Dexter is one of my friends that came with me to Brobdingnagian.\u201d Kyle says looking up at Abbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie dialing the number Kyle gave her, on her phone gets up from her chair and walks away from the kitchen counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Kyles eye Abbie moving her body  was like looking at a moving Mountain range. Kyle could feel and hear Abbie\u2019s BOOMING footsteps as she walks miles away from him, in only a few seconds. It completely amazed him how much distance Abbie was able to obtain in only a few minutes. Kyle could also hear Abbie\u2019s bare feet peel against the hard wood floor as she walked, it filled his ears like a nail on a chock board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle waits on Abbie\u2019s Kitchen counter for a few minutes, he soon hears the familiar sound of booming footsteps as the colossal form of Abbie walks closer to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie once again sits down on her black stool chair that rest besides the counter, and after a few minutes of looking, finally spots Kyle on the white counter, which looked like a small dot amount a ocean of white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYLE, I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT YOUR FRIENDS ARE BACK IN LILLIPUT.\u201d Abbie says with a sad \ud83d\ude14 tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard. Did his friends really leave him in Brobdingnagian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be true.\u201d Kyle says in denial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t leave me!\u201d Kyle yelled as he stood on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was getting angry \ud83d\ude21. So angry that he forgot who he was yelling at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo any other Brobdingnagian this sight would have been laughable. A person smaller than a speck of dust was yelling at a person bigger than a mountain, any other Brobdingnagian wouldn\u2019t have stood for this kind of disrespect, but Abbie was in some ways different. Abbie had used to be a Lilliputian, therefor she was  sympathetic to Kyles problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYLE YOU NEED TO CLAM DOWN, GETTING WORKED UP WILL DO NOTHING BUT MAKE THINGS WORSE.\u201d Abbie says looking at the minuscule Lilliputian in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClam down! Clam down! How can I calm down when I\u2019m all alone!\u201d Kyle yells looking up at The skin colored sky that was Abbie\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend they abandoned me!\u201d Tears started fall from Kyles eyes, the truth was finally sinking into his very soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBANG!!!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie slams her hands on the Kitchen counter as she looks at Kyle who was in the middle of both her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive earthquake shakes the whole landscape that was Abbie\u2019s Kitchen Counter. The force of the earthquake makes Kyle rise around 10 feet in the air and with great force Kyle falls to the ground.  A huge gust of Wind attacks Kyles face, and its speed whistles in his ears, and ruffles Kyles brown hair. Everything soon returns to normal, and Kyle sat on his butt with his legs spread out. Kyle looks up at Abbie and sees her eyes filled with tears \ud83d\ude2d. Tears big enough to feel a whole Lilliputian lake with ease. Kyle didn\u2019t want to admit it, but he was starting to get scared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYLE.\u201d Abbie says with a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u2019 Kyle say with a obedience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU ARE NOT ALONE.\u201d Abbie says looking at Kyle with a small smile, tears running down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU HAVE ME, AND I PROMISE YOU, I WILL NOT ABANDON YOU.\u201d Abbie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looks at Abbie\u2019s gigantic face that stood miles and miles away from him. He could see the gigantic tears fall from her face and land on top of the kitchen counter with a small earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOUR FRIENDS MIGHT HAVE HAD A GOOD REASON FOR LEAVING YOU, AND UNTIL WE FIND OUT THE REASON, YOU SHOULDN'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle knew that Abbie was right, his friends did have a good reason for leaving him behind. Lilliputians got lost in Brobdingnagian all the time, and most times the Lilliputian was dead. Kyle knew that as soon a he got separated from his friends, that he was on his own, that was simply one of the many dangers that Lilliputians had to face when they came to Brobdingnagian. But he wasn\u2019t a lone, he had found a very kind person Abbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Abbie.\u201d Kyle says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cITS ALRIGHT KYLE, I KNOW THAT THIS IS A LOT TO GET USED TO.\u201d Abbie says whipping her tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOOOO.\u201d Abbie says feeling a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A ROOMMATE FOR THE APARTMENT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE MY ROOMMATE?\u201d Abbie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Abbie, I mean I should probably get back home.\u201d Kyle says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO HOME KYLE THAN I WILL HELP YOU, BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT, I PROMISE YOU I WILL PROTECT YOU WHILE YOU LIVE HEAR WITH ME.\u201d Abbie says bending down until she was eye level with the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle hearing Abbie\u2019s proposal didn\u2019t know if that was a good idea. A Lilliputian in Brobdingnagian territory rarely ever ended well, but he didn't really have a choice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Abbie I would love to be your roommate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got too excited when she saw her name, that she really thought she won the lottery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie turned to her petite friend and gave her a bear hug. Connie\u2019s large breast squished against her diminutive frame. She then shook the hands of other graduates that were seated around her, but it was just time freezing in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParty at my new Brobdingnag house next weekend,\u201d Connie shouted at the top of her lungs. \u201cEverybody is invited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie faked a smile and congratulated her best friend. \u201cYou\u2019ll be great as a Brobdingnagian.\u201d Abbie tried to mask her disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you hun.\u201d Connie was nothing but smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord quickly spread about Connie\u2019s graduation party. It was a party to celebrate her winning the Brobby Lottery. All the high school graduates talked about the party and were really inclined in going. None of them have been to Brobdingnag, or even seen a Brobdingnagian. Now they had a chance to do both, party, and get together as friends before they split for college. And what better Brobdingnagian to be hosting a party than a former Lilliputian?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after the graduation, Abbie received a text from Connie asking her if she wanted to meet her at her new place. Already? Abbie wondered. Was Connie already a Brobby? And already got a place? It seemed like things were moving too quick. Not only that, but Abbie wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready to see her busty friend as a Brobby so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie received the directions on how to make it to Connie\u2019s new place. She reluctantly agreed to meet Connie that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransporting to Brobdingnag was fairly easy; like taking the subway. She took the train to a Brobdingnag train station where she then booked a private train ride straight into Connie\u2019s new Brobdingnag home. Most Brobdingnag homes had a Lilliputian transport system installed in their home, Connie\u2019s home being one of them. Upon arrival, an audible ding let Connie know her friend arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie stepped out from the transport and found herself in a huge new world. She was unsure where exactly she was in the huge house. In front of her was a shelf with thousands of Lilliputian headsets. She got the hint and grabbed one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Abbie said, making sure the headset was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey honey, I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d Connie\u2019s voice came through the headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie explored her surroundings a little further. The ground was porcelain white and shiny smooth. As she looked off in the distance, details started to make more sense. It appeared as if she was on a kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began to shake in rhythmic booms. Connie appeared over the corner. Her six mile mass took Abbie off-guard. She stepped back and fell on her ass as her gigantic friend walked towards her. Connie had just finished taking a shower and stepped into the kitchen with damp hair. She only wore her black boy shorts and black bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Connie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201c Abbie didn\u2019t know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie bent over the kitchen counter near the Lilliputian entrance. Abbie screamed as she saw her best friend\u2019s tits barely being contained in her bra. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Connie asked worriedly, \u201cwhy are you screaming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got\u2014I\u2019m scared Connie.\u201d Abbie kicked her legs out and tried to back away from her six mile friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you scared?\u201d Connie asked. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. Oh, wait I think I see you. Don\u2019t move.\u201d Connie grabbed a little clear box that was on the other side of the counter and placed it next to the dot that was her Lilliputian friend. \u201cHere, get in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie looked at the four story structure in front of her. It appeared to have been made of a clear plastic; inside she could see several levels outfitted with stadium seating sized for Lilliputians. She looked at the familiar face of her friend that occupied the entire sky above her. Abbie quaked in the shadow of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d Connie\u2019s thunderous voice made Abbie jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk so loud, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill?\u201d Connie wasn\u2019t empathetic to her friend. \u201cI want you to get in the Lilly carrier so that I can show you my place. It\u2019s the safest way for me to carry you. And stop being scared. I might be a little big now, but I\u2019m still your friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie got to her feet and hunched over like she was avoiding the blades of a helicopter as she boarded the Lilly carrier. In actuality she was cowering from her six mile friend. Abbie sat at the first seat she found. She found that each plush seat was equipped with seatbelts and a safety harness. Abbie\u2019s fingers fumbled around with the buckles and once she got it on she said, \u201cI\u2019m strapped in.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Connie lifted the carrier, the double door entrance sealed shut. It was like an IMAX experience for Abbie. She had a terrific view of everything around her. She felt like she was an extreme carnival ride as she felt the various GeForces overcome her petite body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this is the living room,\u201d Connie acted tour guide for her little friend. She held the Lilly carrier out in front of her as if she was holding a lantern. \u201cThis is the guest bedroom\u2014it\u2019s empty right now. And here\u2019s my bedroom. It\u2019s a small house, I know, but it\u2019s just me living here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou moved in pretty quick.\u201d Abbie was beginning to feel a little at ease. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, how can you afford all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about stuff like that honey.\u201d Connie set the carrier down on her bed. \u201cBut I think I was always meant to be a Brobby. Hey, how big do I look?\u201d Connie ran her hands down her hips and then raised them up past her tummy where she then grabbed handfuls of her big tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie shifted in her seat. She\u2019s been friends with Connie since they were freshmen in High School. Abbie had visited Connie at her home many times in the past and has seen Connie in various states of clothing to include her in her underwear. But the way Connie appeared to her now seemed almost\u2014lude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re scary big.\u201d Abbie couldn\u2019t hide the shake in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d Connie lowered herself so that her tits were right in front of the dime-sized carrier. The carrier was capable of holding exactly 5,000 Lilliputians, but was smaller than Connie\u2019s nipple when hard. \u201cDo you think Jake will pay attention to these at my party this weekend?\u201d To emphasize, she squeezed more of her tits right in front of her Lilliputian friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Abbie stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound so cute when you are scared honey.\u201d Connie grabbed the carrier and lifted it in front of her eyes. She looked inside the container and could see the little floors, but not the individual seats. She just saw a blur of blue\u2014the color of the seat cushions\u2014but also she thought she saw a dark dot in the sea of blue seats. \u201cYou\u2019re so small. I can\u2019t believe I was as small as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie pressed her head back into the seat cushions. Connie\u2019s eyeball was as big as the stadium where she had her graduation. Things were moving way too quickly for Abbie. Only a day ago Connie was hugging her. Now she was bigger than a city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry honey,\u201d Connie told her friend. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget my roots. I\u2019m a Brobby that use to be a speck. I\u2019m humble and caring towards the Lilliputians.\u201d She almost sounded like she was rehearsing lines for a play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie wanted to go home. Connie was too much for her. Actually, she was pretty sure Brobdingnagians were too much for her. She wanted to be with people her own size, not with Connie. \u201cDid you have anything planned tonight Connie? Because I kinda have to head home and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead home? You just got here.\u201d Connie walked to the bathroom which was still full of steam from her earlier shower. She pulled down her boy shorts and sat on the toilet. \u201cI thought we can have fun together. I know I\u2019m the first Brobby you\u2019ve ever seen. Wouldn\u2019t you want to\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014explore me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie could hear a massive waterfall being echoed in the toilet bowl as her friend took a piss right there in front of her. \u201cSounds\u2014\u201c Abbie had to speak over the sound of the torrential piss. \u201cSounds dangerous don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Connie dabbed her wet pussy with a few sheets of toilet paper. She got off the toilet and pulled her boy shorts back up. She flushed the toilet and headed back to her bedroom. \u201cI promise to be very gently honey.\u201d Abbie felt her stomach rise up to her throat as Connie lowered the carrier in the middle of her bed. \u201cOkay, come on out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie, I don\u2019t think this is a good idea. I want to go home.\u201d Abbie whined.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could see a purple floor as far as her eyes could see. The bed sheet under her seemed smooth and soft, even at her size. She walked out away from the carrier taking in the view. She looked back and could see her friend\u2019s boobs hanging dangerously close to her. Connie\u2019s long, light brown hair hung down the left side of her head. Connie\u2019s eyes were squinted, trying desperately to focus on her dot-sized friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m on your bed now. Are you sure about this?\u201d Abbie said over the headset. The Lilly carrier disappeared in a flash as Connie lifted it away and placed it on her nightstand. \u201cConnie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie placed her hands on her hip and looked down arrogantly at her best friend: a tiny speck on her vast king sized bed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I lived all my life as small as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie was getting nervous again. She knew Connie could be pushy and demanding when she was a Lilliputian. In the past, Connie had manipulated and made Abbie do things she never wanted to do. It probably had something to do with Connie being 5\u201911\u201d and Abbie being 5\u20191\u201d. Now Connie was 31,496\u20194\u201d tall\u2014a bit of a size difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy party is going to be so much fun,\u201d Connie wasn\u2019t smiling. She looked like she was lost in thought as she stared down at her friend. \u201cI really hope everyone shows up. Like Heather. Oh, I really hope that bitch comes to my party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie\u2019s teeth chattered as she backed up away from Connie. \u201cI thought you hated Heather. Why would you want her to come?\u201d Abbie feared the answer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNothing. I just want to show off my new size.\u201d Connie got on her bed slowly so that she way lying on her side. Her titanic breasts were right in front of Abbie. \u201cI really hope she and her stupid friends come over. Come on honey, you remember how much shit they use to give us in school. Wouldn\u2019t you want me to put her in her place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH\u2014How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could squish them all.\u201d Connie hovered her index finger over Abbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie let out a blood-curdling scream as she saw the neighborhood-sized digit hover above her head. The scream was so loud, that Connie\u2019s jumped back from hearing the shriek coming through the headset. \u201cHoly fuck, I wasn\u2019t going to squish you, calm down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill me! I\u2019m sorry Connie, I\u2019m sorry please don\u2019t kill me.\u201d Abbie fell to her knees and cried her little head off. Her cheeks were wet with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie giggled. \u201cWhat are you sorry about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Connie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you calm down?\u201d Connie giggled again. \u201cYou are so adorable, but honey, you\u2019re safe with me. I would never lay a finger on you.\u201d Connie laughed this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to hurt me?\u201d Abbie sniffed up her running nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo silly.\u201d Connie was smiling from ear to ear. \u201cHeather and her friends on the other hand,\u201d Connie made the same move as before by placing her finger over Abbie. Abbie, once again, cried out bloody murder. Connie laughed at the predictability of her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie and Abbie talked for another hour on her bed. Abbie was still skittish around Connie and worried that her giant friend might do something malevolent. Connie on the other hand tried to be as gentle as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow it\u2019s getting late,\u201d Connie said as she looked at the clock on her wall. \u201cI got another carrier you can stay in. It\u2019s sorta like a house. It comes with many beds, a kitchen, and other shit I\u2019m not sure about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie got up from the bed, a little sore from lying on her side. Abbie watched her gigantic friend\u2019s ass jiggled as she walked out the bedroom. Connie returned with another clear carrier that looked similar to the other one she was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could just go home.\u201d Abbie said over the headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s too late for that. Besides, it\u2019s dangerous for you to travel alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine Connie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t. Get in.\u201d Connie lowered the carrier right in front of the dot on her bed. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie sighed. She knew she wasn\u2019t going to win the argument with Connie. She got on the carrier and was amazed by what she saw. It looked like she was in a huge mansion with clear (see-through) walls. All the furniture was nailed down to the ground, because, after all, the carrier was meant to be carried around by a Brobby. Abbie found a vast living room and jumped on the couch. She strapped herself in and told Connie she was secured. Connie simply moved the carrier from the bed to the nightstand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight honey.\u201d Connie told her friend. She pulled off the annoying headset from her ears and set them down next to the carrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie explored the new carrier she was in and found the bedroom. Well, it wasn\u2019t really a bedroom. It was more like large gymnasium with rows and rows of twin sized beds. There were probably enough beds to fit several hundred Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie picked the nearest bed to sleep in. She stripped down to her underwear, leaving her clothes in a pile next to the bed, and then slipped under the covers. She was a lot more tired than she realized. The bedroom had a long wall that was made out of a clear plastic that allowed Abbie to look outside. From her bed, she could see Connie taking all her clothes off before getting into her own huge bed. But, Connie didn\u2019t go under the covers. She just laid in the nude on her bed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Connie was running rampant with her new found power, and she loved it. She no longer was the pathetic speck called a Lilliputian, no now she was a force of nature, a goddess to be feared and worshiped, and Abby, this person was not her friend, if something that small, that microscopic could be called a person at all, no Abby was her slave, to do with as she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby felt like she was on a unstable roller coaster, as she felt the whole carrier shake ferociously. Abby had looked out side the windows the carrier had provided when she was still hundreds of feet in the air, so she knew where she was, and deep down she was terrified, right now at this very moment she was on her friends planet sized ass. Abby couldn\u2019t believe it, she couldn\u2019t perceive the very idea of of being on her friends ass. She couldn\u2019t help but think why, why was her best friend in the whole world doing this to her. To the best of Abby\u2019s memory, Connie was always a little bit pushy but she was never sadistic. Abby was completely powerless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of the carrier.\u201d Connie\u2019s voice echos, rocking the carrier back and forth. To Abby this voice was the voice of god and just like any god, this voice wasn\u2019t a request but a command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby slowly makes her way outside the carrier. Connie\u2019s ass to Abby looked like a uninhabited world, that she had seen many times in one of those Syfy movies she loved to watch with her sister. Abby taking a couple steps on Connie\u2019s right butt cheek, couldn\u2019t help but notice how hard the ground is. Abby knew for a fact that butt cheeks where not that hard, she finally came to the conclusion that it wasn\u2019t that Connie\u2019s ass was hard, it was that Abby was just to small to indent Connie\u2019s skin. Abby knew that their was no Lilliputian force in the whole world that could ever damage Connie\u2019s skin, it was harder than steel. Abby could also feel something vibrating underneath her feet. The vibrations where fast and frequent, Abby soon realized that this vibration was actually Connie\u2019s pulse, and judging by how fast her heart was beating she was very excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie was very enthusiastic on the situation that she had placed Abby in against her will. Connie couldn\u2019t even feel Abby on her ass, nor could she even guess what Abby was thinking in this situation. She had total and absolute power over Abby and it excited her to no end. She still couldn\u2019t believe that their was a time that she was just as insignificant and pathetic as Abby was now. Connie turned her head towards her right butt cheek to catch a glimpse of Abby and the itty bitty carrier resting on her ass and to her enjoyment she could see the speck sized carrier and the even smaller specked size Abby resting on her right  butt cheek. Connie smiled as she thought of all the things she could do to Abby. She could wiggle her ass, Connie thought, knowing that the smallest wiggle to her would be the biggest earthquake Abby had ever experienced. Abby would be sent flying so far in the air that she would die before reaching the ground, or she would fall in between Connie\u2019s butt cheeks, never to be found again. Connie smiled as she realized that even her smallest fart could destroy Abby a thousand times over, reducing her to nothing but cosmic dust. Connie started to giggle ever so slightly at the endless possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter where Abby looked (north, south, east) she only saw miles and miles of skin. Abby always knew that Connie had a big ass but this was just ridiculous. Abby in her disbelief couldn't help but think back to before Connie became a Brobdingnagian, when she could still look Connie straight in the eyes, back then Abby wouldn\u2019t have believed that in the future she would be traversing the ass cheek of her best friend. Abby breaking out of her trance hears laughter that causes a earthquake strong enough to knock her off her feet. Abby knew that the laughter came from the booming voice of Connie. Abby looking towards the west could see a huge landscape that stretched on almost infinitely this landscape was Connie\u2019s back and in the far off distant Abby could see Connie\u2019s smiling moon sized face looking right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel down their?\u201d Connie asks with her booming almighty voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts really scary, please Connie get me out of here please.\u201d  Abbie begs hoping that her friend would listen to reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie loved to hear Abby beg, but she realized that it was getting late and that Abby might have had just as much as she could take, after all she didn\u2019t want to break her little toy just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh alright you little cry baby get in the carrier I\u2019ll carry you some where safe.\u201d Connie said feeling a little bummed out that the fun had to end so soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby didn\u2019t have to be told twice. She ran towards the carrier and braced herself as Connie had picked her up and carried her towards her accommodations for the night. Abby was happy that this day was over but what would tomorrow bring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a midsummers day in the small city of Beinhurst. The city folk who were called Lilliputians were going about their day with every sense of normalcy. Little did any of these minuscule being know, what was coming, Who was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoom!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole city with great intensity begins to shake. Powerful vibrations run throughout the city streets, shaking and collapsing buildings of every size and shape, and making it almost impossible for a person to stand on their two feet. Everyone soon stops what they are doing, the earthquake becoming to powerful to be ignored, leaving everyone with a single questions. What in the world was coming in their direction, and of course was it friend or foe. The Lilliputians who stood outside on the street would be the first to receive a answer to that questions, as they bore witness to a massive object that stood outside of the city limits, a object that took up their entire view with ease. The titanic object wore a tannish color and towered over every building and skyscraper that stood in the city for miles and miles. What ever it was did not smell good, a cheesy and yet feminine Oder fell over the entire city causeing many Lilliputians to cough and wheeze from the overpowering smell. No body knew what this object was, but everyone wished it would just go away. It reminded a lot of people of human skin, but why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Abbie, Connie point of view) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie stood before her old city of Beinhurst with a cocky smile on her face. Connie wore nothing but a pink swimsuit as she put her right foot right in front of the city limits. Connie loved how her right foot towered over every building with ease. She truly was massive, and yet again Connie found it hard to believe that she had ever lived in something so small and minuscule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbby honey guess where we are right now?\u201d Connie says to Abbie who rested in a Dimond shaped pink  pendant  that hung around her neck<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie brought the small pendant up to her right eye. In side the pendant she could barley make out Abby who looked like a small speck in the middle of a ocean of pink. Connie couldn\u2019t get over how small Abby was while she looked at her inside the pendant. The pendant must have been the size of a football stadium \ud83c\udfdf to Abby yet it was only a few inches tall to Connie. This made Connie let out a little giggle, a giggle that, little to Connie\u2019s knowledge, knocked Abby off her feet. Connie with her ear piece on could hear Abby let out a little yelp of pain as Abby fell to the hard ground of the pendant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaahhhhh, what\u2019s wrong Abby did you get hurt?\u201d Connie asked sarcastically as she stared at the little speck inside of the pendant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie.\u201d Abby says in side her headset with fear in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this please.\u201d Abbie begged as she looked at the planet sized blue eye that stood in front of her, overwhelming her with its powerful gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie knew what Connie was planning and never before had she ever been so appalled \ud83d\ude26 by her friend. Connie was about to destroy their entire city. Everyone they both knew, everyone they both loved was about to be crushed under Connie\u2019s Brobdingnagian body, and Connie seemed not to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Abby you don\u2019t have to be scared, It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to crush you.\u201d Connie says with her soothing voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut my parents, your parents?!\u201d Abby\u2019s yells trying to make Connie see reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre of no importance. My so called parents are not my real parents, I\u2019m adopted Abby.\u201d Connie says with a little irritation in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby let out a little gasp, she never knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents never cared about me, EVER! So their is no reason for me to care about those little germs.\u201d Connie yells hurting Abby\u2019s ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie please.\u201d Abby says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you keep on being annoying I\u2019ll crush you right here.\u201d Connie says looking at the pendant with anger in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby immediately fell silent, the last thing she wanted to do was get on Connie\u2019s bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie lowered her eyes down to the small city of Beinhurst, feeling more angry than she did before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents didn\u2019t give a damn about me.\u201d Connie begins to lift her right foot over a small portion of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I have the power, all of the power to do what I want!\u201d Connie yells smashing her foot into the ground crushing everything under, and around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom on high Connie could see black smoke rise up from beneath her foot. She could see the minuscule buildings that were close to her foot tumble and fall over from the force she demonstrated. Connie couldn't imagine the horror, she was putting the small Lilliputians through, even though she tried with all of her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Lilliputian Point of view)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the Lilliputians in the city of Beinhurst to realize what exactly they where staring at. Every person soon understood that what they where looking at was a foot, that belonged to a Brobdingnagian women, a person that completely dwarfed them when it came to size. Men women and even children looked up towards the sky to catch a glimpse of the titanic women that towered over the whole entire city. None could make out her face, none could even see her face. As they looked at the giantess their gaze first fell on her towering toes, which were so high that they were amongst the clouds themselves. Then came her long towering beautiful legs, that were so thick, and so powerful that no Lilliputian weapon or craft could even come close to compare. Further up was her beautiful breast that dwarfed mountain ranges all on their own, and completely covered her face. The only thing that the Lilliputians knew for sure was that this women was wearing nothing but a gigantic pink swimsuit, a pink bra and a pink bikini, also whoever this person was she was up to trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky soon grew dark as a shadow fell on a portion of the city. The Lilliputians cast in shadow look skyward to see a tannish sky filled with dirt and grime. They soon fell into panic, for they knew what was to come, Their end. Screams echoed through the air, screams that Connie herself would never here, nor would she care if she ever did hear them. The giantesses foot came closer and closer to the city, making the city streets even more dark than it was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople started to run down the sidewalk, cars started to drive down the roads in a major panic that gave new meaning to the term road rage, running over anyone that got in their way, all in hope that they would be able to escape the coming calamity, but deep down they knew it was useless. The more sensible Lilliputians who knew that they were doomed didn\u2019t even bother running and simply stared at the bottom of the foot that came closer and closer with every passing second. Buildings soon began to crumble as they made contact with the ruff foot skin, creating even more panic throughout the streets of  Beinhurst, and taking many lives from the falling Debris. With this act ever Lilliputian soon understood that their was no hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA major earthquake rocks the whole city. The giantess foot had finally made its way to the ground and the shock wave alone destroyed whole entire buildings and sent many people flying through the air, paralyzing many people for life and killing others. Deadly smoke filled the streets burning people\u2019s eyes and filling their lungs with heat and anything but fresh air. This truly was hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Abby, Connie point of view)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie looked down at her handy work and smiled. She thought about all of the Lilliputian lives that were lost all because of her simplest actions. She was just getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady or not hear I come <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Many a breath would be held in anticipation for the events which unfolded. The monitor high above which seemed to be running through the lists of names at a quickened pace. Each name up there for just long enough to be seen before kicking away and being lost to the scramble. As they would fall off and the numbers would dwindle down, so would the speed in which they left the screen. For Abigail and Connie, both of them couldn't contain their excitement knowing neither name had been displayed yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would practically become slow motion, each slight tick resonating into Abbie's core as she would notice Connie's name pop up onto the screen. She feeling her friend squeeze her hand to the point that if she weren't so distracted, Abbie would have pulled her hand away. For what felt like an eternity her name would hang there, and for a moment Abbie would lose hope for her dream. Though in that moment she would practically hear the echo that was the monitor switching over to a name, her own. She couldn't help but feel her stomach drop from the excitement, it was as if she had won already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when she turned to look to her friend, Connie would not be showing the same excitement that Abbie currently displayed. Connie would pull her hand away as she glared in the direction of her friend, a look of pure betrayal on her face. \"Connie, I....I...\" Abbie would begin to stammer, trying to do her best to think of how to explain this to her friend. Though a loud gasp from the rest of the student body and even some of the faculty members would immediately bring on a sudden and eery silence. One of which would cause Abigail confusion until she turned to look back at the monitor and immediately her face would flush of it's color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen, her name had disappeared and in it's place remained another, the winner of this contest and whom would become the Brobby, Trish Pierce. \"N-no!\" Abbie couldn't help but scream out as she considered what this meant. This was perhaps the last person that she and just about anyone else wanted to see become near six miles tall in comparison to her. This was after all the biggest bully of the school and now she would literally become that, able to crush so many Lili lives under just a single foot step. As Abbie would look to find Connie as a way to comfort herself, she would find that she was all but alone in this crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is too fuckin' perfect\" A familiar voice would call out from behind Abigail, an ominous chuckle following it as she would feel the owner of the voice's hand coming to rest on her shoulder. Lowering her head and whimpering a bit, Abbie could do nothing but dare not look her in the eye. \"H-hey Trish.\" She would meekly say as she continued to look away from someone who had tormented her the entirety of her life and just stole her dream. She would try anyways, it would be but a second before she would feel herself spun around to look Trish in the face, the sudden motion causing the timid girl to have a clumsy spell and fall to a seated position on the ground. As overactive as her imagination was, as she weakly turned her gaze upward, she was already picturing Trish as one of the Brobby's, already towering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if she shrank right there on the floor, and was already between these woman's shoes, both of them of which she would be a easily dismissible speck upon. A single lace bigger than any tree she had ever known, the minute treads underneath able to house hundreds of her kind. She nearly shrieked at the idea, and a slight sneer from Trish would follow. The bully able to pick up on the little one's fear in an instant. \"Feelin' real tiny aren't you? Well you should you little speck.\" Trish's voice was low, husky even as it was clear she was enjoying this news very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think, I'm about to become so gigantic you worthless little shits could actually LIVE on me. Like some sort of pests, and I could easily extinguish yours, and the entire schools lives under my thumb. Who knows, maybe a few of you would get lucky and just become lost in the print of my finger.\" She would laugh, and it would only cause the timid girl's stomach to turn as she shrank further into the ground in fear. Right now, she was the same size of Trish, and even that didn't help her against the delinquent. Trish was known to be violent with very few who could stand up to her. Though who could wouldn't be able to even shift on of the hairs on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning from ear to ear, Trish would only continue to look down upon Abbie who had yet to move. Almost in a mocking fashion she would look around, as if looking for something. \"Where is Ms. Connie, did she storm off when she thought you took her dream? Pity, wasn't she your only friend?\" Her words were cutting a bit deeper than Abbie would like to admit. Then again it was a specialty of hers to know some of the facts regarding her targets. Abigail in particular, too shy to have much of a social circle around her. Her type of personality being a prime target for someone like Connie who liked to be bossy at times since Abbie lacked a backbone to say otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what runt, why don't you come visit me after I become, well, not a worthless little speck like the rest of you.\" Abbie would be a bit caught off guard by this, especially coming from Trish. Quite understandably, she was quick to believe that it was just Trish wanting to torment her more, though on a much bigger scale. Terrifying ti would be to see this punk that size, and she unable to do anything about it. \"I....I don't...\" Abbie would begin to retort, though she would immediately be cut off by Trish who raised a hand to stop her. Immediately she would stop talking as a frightened squeak escaped her. \"I'd hate to see you refuse, who knows how much fun we'll have. Considering Connie just left you too, maybe I can become your <i>biggest</i> friend.\" It was undeniable, with the way Trish spoke, there was more to it. With that, the punk girl would simply turn on her heels and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a week later, life would go on for Abbie after the events of that night, and she was waking up much like her usual routine. Life after school was as one would expect, worse for her though as Connie still wasn't speaking to her at the moment. Upon getting dressed, she would hear the doorbell ring, a man waiting for her package in hand. After the traditional game of \"sign here\" was played, she would be given the box. A bit confused by what it could be, she would slowly open it, only to find a letter and a headset resting inside it. Opening the letter she would find it was from Trish with an invitation to Brobdingnag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she felt the blood in her veins run cold as she stared down at the letter, soon looking at the headset and knowing what it meant. Trish had been serious about inviting her over, but why? It wasn't as if Abbie liked her anymore than Trish liked Abbie. In fact, the Punk girl's pet name for her was always \"My favorite little punching bag.\" Which come to think about it, was all that she was to Trish. Biting her lip however, she couldn't help but think of Connie, her friend which believed she betrayed her. Abbie didn't have many friends, and none of them were going to become Brobdingnag's like Trish. Perhaps it was a part of her who still wanted to live her dream, even if it was through this bully. Though she had to make a decision now, would she go?</span></div></div>",

Abby was making her way to her local transport unit thinking of turning back having flashbacks to times in school Trish made her life miserable. She kept thinking to herself that there are laws to protect her so she should be fine she got on the transport unit and it sent off to Brobdingnag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravelling through the land of Gulliver\u2019s fear started to hit her again, she saw the giants and thought how they were only an inch tall to Trish now, Trish is massive, Trish is a mountain now, If she ever visited her home town she would tower over everything her shoes alone would tower over everything, as the transport got closer and closer to Brodbingnag she hoped that Trish didn\u2019t have evil intentions, but it\u2019s Trish\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the unit entered Brodbingnag she saw a few walking around they were huge, their toes alone could crush 100s of her, the unit came to a stop, she now needed to head to another unit to take her to Trish\u2019s, she entered it and tried not to think about anything that would make her want to turn back, it was too late now. The Unit arrived at Trish\u2019s new home, and right outside Trish was waiting, ready with a head set Abby put it on and in a fear filled tone, She said Hi\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish smiled with glee and thought to herself \u201cShe has no idea what she\u2019s in for\u201d Trish then said with excitement \u201cI can\u2019t believe you actually came! Don\u2019t you love how MASSIVE I am? I used to tower over you in school but now, even my little toe towers over you, All you are now is a dot to me, for your safety you need to enter this\u201d Trish placed a 3 millimetre tall box which was 51 feet to Abby. Abby entered the box and was starting to regret coming<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo show of her size, Trish placed the box on her big toe and smirked thinking of what she can do to show how insignificant Abby now is to her, Trish was so happy that she was no longer a speck like her old classmates, she hated them all and was hoping more will come\u2026 Meanwhile in the box was Abby looking out the windows of the box at Trish\u2019s fast black painted toe nail. Stretching out over 100ft in each direction. She really regretted it now, she was frightened her former bully was now a Goddess to her and now she\u2019s stuck where she has full control over her to break the silence she said \u201cWow Trish\u2026 You are so lucky to have won the lottery, I wish I did!\u201d Looking out wishing the roles were swapped, she would love to have Trish in this position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bet you are, I\u2019m like a God to you now, can you imagine how much havoc a single toe of mine could cause to YOUR town? I\u2019ve had fun thinking about it, and many of us Brobdingnags are looking forward to see if they repeal those protection laws, they\u2019re not that well enforced anyway\u201d Trish pricked up the box with her finger nails and placed it on her breasts. \u201cDo you like the view specky\u2026 I mean Abby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish looked at the dot like box and thought where on my body could I torture her the most? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a way with words...her insults always cut through the soul. Her bullying was so bad, it was rumored a boy committed suicide because of it, but it was never proven, and Trish never experienced punishment as a result. Not like she cared. Her bullying only intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosh, you got my homework done?\u201d She stopped the teen in the hall. Her two girlfriends standing behind her as her entourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Trish. Here you go.\u201d Josh gave her a 10-page, handwritten, essay to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish took a total of 3-seconds to look over the assignment, before throwing homework at his face. Papers fluttered all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t in my handwriting, dumbass. Do it again. But in my handwriting. God, you\u2019re fucking useless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I did it in your handwriting, I even used the same purple pen--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wasn\u2019t able to finish his sentence, as a jolt of pain sparked from within his crotch. Trish had kneed him in the dick. He fell to floor, his face landing on top of Trish\u2019s Doc Martin boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just talk back at me?\u201d Trish asked, like a little innocent girl. She even placed a hand on her chest as if the accusation panged her. \u201cListen, asshole,\u201d her normal tone returned, \u201cI need to turn in that essay in one hour, have it done, or else I\u2019ll stomp on your little pecker until it pops like a grape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish stepped on the boys back and continued walking down the school hall. He grunted as he felt the thick treads of the boot imprint on his soft back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish didn\u2019t look like a typical bully. Yes, she looked like a punk at first glance. Always wearing black clothing, boots, chains, and so on. But she also looked like a poser. Like, those clothes didn\u2019t belong to her. She was a tall, skinny blonde, and extremely attractive. Some kids called her a Barbie in goth clothes. Those same kids ended up with black eyes and bruises all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faculty always ignored Trish. Trish had powerful parents in government. It just so happened, that any faculty that tried to punish or correct Trish, disappeared. Not as in getting fired. They disappeared. Trish would make threats to any teacher, principal, or counselor, that they too--would disappear if they tried anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie was still in the Lilly carried. It was a transport specifically made for Lilliputians to be carried by Brobbies. The carrier contained stadium seating, capable of carrying 250 Lilliputians in luxury. The seats pointed towards a large plexiglass wall, which let the Lilliputians see out into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Abigail was looking out at a large pink mountain. Her stomach felt like a blender. Why in the world did she agree to visit Trish? Trish was absolutely the worst person she\u2019s ever met. Of all the people chosen to become a Brobby, why was it Trish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome out Abby. I want to compare the speck you are to my tit.\u201d There was a pause in the intercom. \u201cI\u2019m only asking once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby unbuckled herself from her seat and headed for the exit. As she did so, she adjusted her headset and flipped it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m exiting right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby jumped out and landed on the tanned flesh. It was smooth, even at this scale. Under her feet, Abby could feel heat radiating from Trish\u2019s body. She even felt the a rapid heartbeat, thundering and causing a tremor that was really noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can see you.\u201d Trish\u2019s voice came over the headset clearly to Abigail. But, she also felt the voice coming out of Trish. So much air bellowing from Trish\u2019s lungs and out of her mouth. Like a hurricane for each word spoken. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was as tiny as you. How fucking pathetic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish removed the Lilly carrier, leaving Abigail alone at the base of her mountain-sized nipple. Abbie continued inhaling short breaths. Her legs felt weak and her heart thumped erratically in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feared for her life and was convinced this was the end. She felt the ground beneath her feet vibrate violently. Again, she felt hurricanes worth of air traveling deep within Trish\u2019s body and escaping out her mouth. The giantess was sighing. Abby could feel the environment around her heating up. Stretching sounds caused her to turn around. The massive nipple, already the size of an apartment complex, was swelling into the sky. Was Trish getting aroused?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait until the government downgrades the status of you Lilly-shits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby wondered if Trish had already forgotten her roots -- that she too, was a Lilliputian. How could she turn against her own kind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll visit your town. I\u2019ll wipe out the school. Crush everyone\u2019s house under my breasts. What do you think about that, Abby?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw her on my kitchen counter, but then she disappeared. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not used to having Lilliputian friends over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby\u2019s heart raced. \u201cTrish, I\u2019m sorry. Please, I\u2019m sorry. I want to go home now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn about a week or so, it\u2019ll read in the newspaper, probably a tiny little snippet of an article, that Brobby visited your town. Thousands dead. But sadly, you won\u2019t be around to see any of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrish stop! I don\u2019t like how you joke around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Abby, but you\u2019re such a foolish little thing. What makes you think you can make demands to a Brobby? I can\u2019t have Lilly\u2019s thinking they can talk to a Brobby like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail was full of tears. She looked around and saw no escape. She was still trapped on top of Trish\u2019s tit, overshadowed by the erect nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be honored I\u2019m giving you this much attention, Abby. I guess I\u2019m doing it because you\u2019ll be my first victim...of many.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish grabbed hold of her breast and tilted it towards her chin. She opened her mouth, a let a cloud of humid air overcome the speck on her boob. Before Abigail had a chance to regain her footing, Trish moved her huge tit into her mouth, engulfing the speck with ease. When she retreated her mouth from her tit, she could no longer see Abby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she heard her. With the headset still on, Trish sloshed around the saliva in her mouth and swallowed. All the while, she heard Abby choking and screaming in the translucent goo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish laid back in her bed and listened to the horrific sounds coming from within her body. She could hear her massive heartbeat. She could hear her lungs inhaling and exhaling copious amounts of air even though they were normal breaths to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear Abigail in agony. Trish absentmindedly played with her sex, as she digested her speck-sized friend in an instance. If one Lilly gave her this much pleasure, what could hundreds do? Thousands? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wait until their red patches, under all over my clothes and body\u201d, Terrifying, right?\u201d<br>\r\nAbby was silent, she was imagining the horror, of the destruction Trish will cause, every Liliputian was screwed, why is the government even thinking of getting rid of protection laws? &amp; right after the worse person becomes a Brody?

Abby began to cry, it was almost her who became a Brobby, and why did Trish invite her 1st? why did she suggest she could get her grown to but then decide not to? Why did she accept the invite?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish spent years bullying many of the people who are now smaller than specks of dust to her right between her fingertips. She is pretty much a goddess to them now, and there is nothing they can do about it and soon millions of other lillies will know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish \u201cSo first things first, tiny fucks I want you to give me a pedicure, I want to truly show how insignificant you are to me now and how big I\u2019ve become, it will take 100s maybe 1000s of you ages just to do 1 toe\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish picks up the container filled with 1000 of her former peers, Trish holds it up to her face and brings it in to give it a kiss and then shows a toothy grin to show the size of her perfectly straight and pure white teeth then rolling the container between her long black painted finger nails. She looked at the tiny container filled with 100s of \u2018people\u2019 she couldn\u2019t believe she used to be so small and pathetic, she started to imagine what It was like for the people between her finger nails, looking out at her and her colossal towering finger nails. They must be about 120ft too them, blocking out most of their light, all their lives are at her finger tips, literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish remembered she had Abby in her other hand and thought, it\u2019ll be perfect if Abby worked her pinkie toes alone, while the rest can work on her other toes, she then sat down and brought both containers to her left foot, she dropped Abby on the floor by her pinkie toe and the rest by her big toe, along with another container filled with all the supplies they\u2019d need to give her toes a nice clean, paint and polish, they\u2019re now her slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish\u2019s former peers were petrified they were not sure how they got into this situation but they feared it would happen when they saw Trish\u2019s name appear on the screen, it couldn\u2019t have happened to anyone less deserving they all thought, the only people who seemed to not be in this situation is Trish\u2019s friends. The friends who used to bully them with Trish back in school. Looking out they saw most of their light was blocked by Trish\u2019s fingernails they truly  were massive, it just showed them how massive Trish now is and how they\u2019re under her control and they have no way to stop her, her finger nails towered above the container, they alone could crush them all, They then felt a massive drop to the floor and heard Trish\u2019s command, they all looked up at her towering toes which they\u2019ll have to climb, clean, paint and polish it\u2019s an impossible task, it\u2019ll take all of them days working together non-stop hours or even days just to do 1 of her big toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby was standing at the base of Trish\u2019s left pinkie toe, it absolutely towered over her. Abby gulped in fear, one tiny twitch and she\u2019ll be crushed, this will take her forever, after getting supplies she began the attempt to climb the toe. Meanwhile around 1500ft away by Trish\u2019s big toe about 1000 people with supplies where climbing Trish\u2019s big toe, which is taller than a 20 story building, some of them have already fallen and gotten seriously injured a few have managed to get to the top once they looked down and saw how high up they were and knowing this was just the top of her toes, they began worshipping Trish like a goddess and began their hard work of what Trish demanded, all of them wishing they won the lottery. Working away chipping away the old paint, which was takin a lot of digging, as the layer of paint was at least 20ft thick they began to truly realise they have no chance of doing a good job, they were as good as dead, they were getting nowhere, none of them had even made a dent more than 1ft deep, and its been 2 hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish was watching them through special glasses, she was laughing she knew they had no chance of any progress, she had even seen some give up and jump to their deaths, she decided to put the container down on her toe, her large nails crushing many in the way, she announced they have 15 seconds to get in before she lifts it away, she watched in delight as all of them began tramping each other to get in, seeing their fear gave her a rush of power and pleasure, and she started thinking about more body exploration or even visiting her old town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts away the container looking inside and grinning and puts it in her mouth while she fetches Abby. For the people inside it was truly scary being inside the mouth of the biggest bully in school who was once their size in a container smaller than her lip piecing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby seeing this began to cry as she saw Trish\u2019s colossal fingers place her container nearby, fearing she had limited time she began to run towards the container to get in, once in she felt a huge rush up wards to Trish\u2019s face <br>\r\nTrish removing the other container from her mouth \u201cAww are you guys scared, you\u2019re all so pathetic and adorable\u201d Now what shall I do with you next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t fucking disappoint me.\u201d With that, Trish slammed Abigail\u2019s locker closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trish walked off to the nearest lady\u2019s room, the school bells rang marking the start of the next period. Abigail felt compelled to run off to class, but her inner survival instincts told her not to upset Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby dumped her things in her locker, and with her head held low, she walked towards the bathroom. Her heart fluttered as she wondered what Trish was going to do her. All things considered, Abby hasn\u2019t been bullied by Trish that roughly, compared to other students. Shit, even the seniors weren\u2019t immune to Trish\u2019s bad attitude and bullying. Abby had escaped relatively unharmed. She\u2019s probably only done about two or three homework assignments for Trish. And there was one time Trish said she forgot her money, so she took Abby\u2019s for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Abby was on Trish\u2019s good side. Best to keep it that way, and go to the bathroom and figure out what she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom was empty except for Abby. The punk girl stood in the middle of the room with her arms crossed. She looked pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to see me, Trish?\u201d She moused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet closer to me.\u201d Trish said in an authoritative tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby obeyed. \u201cDid you need me to help with an assignment or someth--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the hell up already. Listen. I want to do something to see if I like it. If you tell anyone what happens here, I will break your fucking jaw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby nodded. Her eyes wide, looking up like a little lost child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish ran a hand through Abby\u2019s hair and then grabbed hold of the back of her head. Trish leaned in close and started giving Abby a wet kiss. Abigail was as still as stone. This came out of nowhere. She didn\u2019t know what to do, but let her lips go limp and let Trish have her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish stuck out her tongue and entered Abby\u2019s mouth. She began exploring her mouth and sucking on Abby\u2019s lips and tongue. The little mouse girl tasted good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments, Trish broke the kiss and let out a moan. Abigail looked up wide-eyed and saw a human side in Trish she\u2019s never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish regained her composure, looked and Abby, and then slapped her lightly. \u201cHey idiot, close your mouth.\u201d Trish then proceeded to go through Abby\u2019s pant\u2019s pockets and found money -- Abby\u2019s lunch money for the week. Trish took it and looked Abby in the eye. \u201cI liked it. Don\u2019t say anything, whore. I won\u2019t warn you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish left Abby alone. Abby wasn\u2019t sure what to feel. She liked boys, not girls. But that kiss\u2026.it was electric. Maybe the excitement came, because it was Trish -- the almighty school bully. The one everyone feared, decided to experiment her first girl-on-girl kiss with the little mousy Abby. Whatever the reason, Abby couldn\u2019t help but feel honored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t last long, however. Abby started getting picked on by Trish like the rest of students. If not, more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I become a Brobby?\u201d Abby heard herself say. \u201cI thought the school lottery was the only way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Trish sighed. \u201cSo naive. Another way to become a Brobby, is to find a current Brobby willing to swap sizes with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s right, Abby thought. The energy required to grow someone, could be taken from the energy expelled as someone\u2019s mass shrunk. It would be a one-for-one mass swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was Abby thinking? Was she really considering joining forces with the most evil person she\u2019s ever met?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut....there was a chance to become a Brobby. Her dream. She could bring equality to the Lilliputians if she was a Brobby. Explain to the Brobdingnagians that Lilliputians are human too. Maybe she could stop the repeal of the protection laws currently granted over Lilliputians. Maybe she could stop Trish. And steal another kiss from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby shook her head. Where did that last thought come from? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, if there was a chance to become a Brobby, Abby felt that she should take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know someone who is willing to swap sizes with me?\u201d Abby finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish smiled. \u201cSo, you do want to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby hesitated. \u201cI do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a Brobby by tomorrow.\u201d Trish was glowing. \u201cI just need to call me dad, and tell him to proceed with the Lilly protection law repeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we can\u2019t have fun with that pesky law.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, right.\u201d Abby thought that maybe she had a chance to keep those protective laws...but now. \u201cYour dad has the power to repeal that law? As a Lilliputian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought I won the Brobby lottery at school, fair-and-square?\u201d Trish laughed. Abby thought her ear drums were going to pop. \u201cMy dad has connections in government and my mom is a lawyer. Together they found a loophole that will make the protection law go away. All they ask, is for me to protect them as Lilliputians. They wanted me to become a Brobby because of that. Anyway, my parents don\u2019t give a fuck about Lilliputians. Only money and power. I love them so much. But for whatever reason, they want to stay as Lilliputians.

Just looking at Trish\u2019s boots, and how massive they\u2019re and the shoes of the other two giants, they\u2019re so godlike, and how soon she will be that size, and people here current size will look up at her and feel so tiny under her giant form, how she\u2019ll look godlike to them.<br>\r\nAbby smirked, she couldn\u2019t wait. She thought of how many people could be crushed under her heels, heck even her pinky toe, how she would soon tower over her former town, &amp; the 1000s of people looking up at her with fear. She was starting to see Trish\u2019s side, the protection law? Well that was great for when she was tiny, but when she\u2019s big? That\u2019s no fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enters the room, and is given a medical and the drugs to grow, she walks out of the room &amp; begins growing &amp; growing until she\u2019s at full Brobby size in front of Trish &amp; the Scientist, the 3rd giant was gone, Abby asked \u201cso where is the other person?\u201d Trish pointed at a super tiny small black speck on the ground. \u201cTheir they\u2019re, just look at how small you were\u201d<br>\r\nBeing naked and bare foot Abby looked at her pinkie toe, and saw how huge it was compared to the speck. Abby felt a bit of a rush, now she\u2019s the one of the ones to fear, no more fears of giants crushing her, aware or unaware because now, she is on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby still had required to take the orientation, and she maybe the last, as this was the last week of the protection laws, &amp; under those laws included the lottery, &amp; the size swap deal, which allowed both Trish &amp; Abby to become Brobbys. Trish handed Abby keys to her apartment, well theirs now, and headed off while Abby had her orientation. Abby was being shown the size differences, she was shown a scale robot of a Lilly under a magnifier, &amp; scale robot of a Gully, and scale models of their neighbourhoods/houses, she was shown how delicate they\u2019re and how even her breath can cause a lot of damage, she was shown how much of a hassle even her nail clippings can be for Lillys, her town actually experienced this, they were huge, and took so long to remove, and caused so much damage. She was shown what it looks like from a Brobby perspective on a video &amp; amazingly it was footage of the incident she remembers from her home town, now it looked amusing to her. Now even her nails were these ginormous objects causing damage to these micro fucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby couldn\u2019t help think to herself, how fun it would be to crush her old home town, have all the specks she once knew becoming a tiny red dot on her shoes, feet, ass, breasts or hands, she thought back to that Kiss 2 years ago, and thought, *Is that why she picked me?* she didn\u2019t want to dwell on it too much, she could have been a red spot on Trish right now, or neck week when she can crush their old town, she could have been crushed by someone else\u2026. Like Connie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her orientation she headed back to her new place, she walked in &amp; Trish grabbed her \u201cI have a surprise for you\u201d, she showed her other hand, with a tiny box between her thumb &amp; index finger,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish - \u201cThis is the box you were in, yesterday, remember how big it was to you yesterday, now look at it, it\u2019s only 3mil it could get stuck under our nails\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby - \u201cWait, Trish it looks like it has people in it, or is that dirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish -  \u201cDirt is normally a lot bigger\u201d * she said laughing a little* \u201cYeah this is filled with a few people\u2026 do you remember that stuck up bitch Harriet? She\u2019s in their along with 50 others, I got this as a surprise, now let\u2019s place the box on your big toe now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to get some out including Harriet, they all fell on the hard sky blue painted surface. Trish &amp; Abby put on their head set only connected to Harriet, they listened to her cry, scream &amp; beg and many of the others around her. Abby looked down, and saw the tiny mass of black on her toe,<br>\r\nAbby (with her mic turned off) \u201cI kinda want to flick them off, but I want to crush Heather with maybe my breasts or ass.\u201d<br>\r\nTrish \u201cOk, I\u2019ll order her to go into this empty box\u201d Placing the box onto Abby\u2019s toe, crushing some of the Lil\u2019s who split off from the main group, Trish ordered Harriet back into the box<br>\r\nHarriet was petrified, she though she ought to listen, plus getting off a toe nail was a positive thing for her, after entering &amp; being lifted only to Abby &amp; Trish\u2019s ankle height she saw Abby\u2019s toe flick up and saw the black dots she was just with disappear, 1 even flew and hit the box, she watched him fall to his death and she began crying \u201cWhy are you doing this to me? What did I do to deserve this? And what did you two do to deserve becoming Brobby\u2019s? how can you be so cruel to Lily\u2019s you two were lily\u2019s only a few days ago so you should know how it feels\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby turned her mic on quickly and said \u201cThat actually makes it more fun, because we\u2019ve had both sides now, we know the fear, and knowing that as a Brobby is so much fun, knowing you\u2019re the one causing that fear\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish- \u201cWow Abby, you\u2019ve really come along to the Dark side quick, looks like next week will be fun!, show how are you going to deal with Harriet &amp; the rest of the specks?\u201d<br>\r\nAbby whispers in Trish\u2019s ear what she wanted to do, which put the biggest smile on Trish\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby laid down on the bed completely naked, and place the lillys on top of her breasts excluding Harriet, she and Trish had a quick and worse way of killing her, Trish with her arms either side of Abby also, with her breasts out, began to lower and position herself so their breasts collide crushing the lily\u2019s between them, and between the Valley of Abby\u2019s breasts was Harriet in her box, The sight of what just happened scared her so much she actually puked. Now being lifted, and give to Abby, a she sat up, Trish rolled over on the bed so her ass was facing the ceiling. Abby shock the box over Trish\u2019s asshole, where Harriet fell 100s of feet into the dark mountainous cave to fall to her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that day of fun, Trish &amp; Abby began getting new things for their life\u2019s as Brobby\u2019s like clothes and things for the apartment, each day they were getting more excited for the laws to be revoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew Days later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s now the 1st morning of the removal of the protection laws, and both Trish &amp; Abby were getting ready to crush their old home town, with shoes, that help add and show of their new height clothes that really help show of their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish went with her classic goth look, with her boots and their 5 inch heels, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby went with a nice white top, skirt, bare legs and open toed high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head to their home town, as they got closer they saw the woodlands that used to be vast, now looking like moss, a large lake looking like a super tiny puddle, villages, Trish accident crushed one<br>\r\n\u201cOh she, I didn\u2019t even see it, ha ha, I\u2019m going to see how it feels on purpose, Abby try it too\u201d Leaving the rest of that first village to stand, as a personal landmark, Both Trish and Abby crushed a village each, and they loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting closer to their town not looking out for villages to crush or avoid them, only crushing ones built in their way. They finally got to their town, it was a very large town, with not any really tall buildings nothing more than 2 inches high. Trish seductively took her first step into the city.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw all these dots running away from her foot and she laughed, she felt no guilt, no remorse those \u201cpeople\u201d were so tiny she couldn\u2019t accept their peril as something bad. They couldn\u2019t step them and they both loved it. They saw the tallest building in the town standing at 2 inches, it towered over all other buildings by more than double they both hated it, Trisha walked to wards it killing 1000s under her shoes, and using her index finger and thumb plucked It from its foundations, the debris causing more havoc for the poor Lllies. She brought it up to her face and held it in the palm of her hand.

She had her foot right next to the school, her pinkie toe dwarfed it, it was nothing, she looked down at the tiny set of buildings she spent years at &amp; and the schools stadium where she was just over a week ago, hoping she would win the lotto, remembering the disappointment &amp; fear when Trisha\u2019s name popped up on the screen, she thought how she could still be down their at risk of being a unnoticeable stain on Trisha, but she wasn\u2019t she was also big so big she could crush that stadium and the school just under her pinkie toe alone. She lifted her foot slightly and brought he pinkie toe down on top of the school and stadium, no resistance just instant destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby laughed and looked at Trisha, \u201cThank you so much for also making me a Brobby, I feel like a Goddess, just look at our town, it used to seem so big, remember how long it would take to get across town when we were specks?

Those who survived looked up, at the 5 inch heel which stood a massive  2,160ft to them, they felt insignificant, under the arch of a boot, their neighbours crushed &amp; dead bodies around them, they knew their life was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice &amp; Michael who went to school with Trisha and also suffered through Trisha's bullying looked up it awe, fear &amp; disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice \"I can't believe Trisha won &amp; became a Brobby, her name should have been removed, surely they knew this was coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael \"Yeah, it should have been one of us, wait..... is that Abby with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice \"OMG it is!

So he just sat there feeling the earthquakes, and seeing Trisha lean down with her hand heading towards him, with a massive grin on her giant face, The impact of her touch, sent the roof above him to partly fall, and he felt his own floor buckle, &amp; that's just from her touch. That's when she ripped up the building, she quickly pulled up the building and that's when him and everyone and everything in the building, went flying all round, he was hurt, his arms where broken, he was bleeding, he looked toward where he was flying, it was a already smashed window, her breasts were just in view at this point where he then fell, right into her breasts hitting them and bouncing off to fall 22,000ft towards to the ground, along with many others and a lot of office furniture, way to tiny and insignificant for Trisha to even notice, Tom could only spend his last few minutes trying to steady himself and watch his life flash before his eyes, every time he faced up, he looked up at Tisha, falling down past her stomach, past her hips and down her legs, she was truly huge, he noticed he began falling towards her leg, he saw there was a space between her leg and the top of her boot, and he was heading towards it. he closed his eyes, he didn't want to see anything anymore, he suddenly felt a rush of heat, and everything went darker, he had fallen into her boot, and he's landed on a crease of her sock. He survived. He opened his eyes and saw the light of where he fell in, 1000s of feet above him, but with broken bones and motion sickness, he couldn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much everyone in the building was dead or fallen out after Abby handled it, those still alive, felt the heat, moisture and breath overcome them, when they were put into Trisha and Abby's mouths their kissing killed them all, apart from Donna, she used to teach at Trisha &amp; Abby's school, she quit because of Trisha, she couldn't take it anymore, her parents were had too much influence and she could never punish Trisha like she deserved, &amp; Abby, she hated Abby &amp; Abby hated her, it was just a clash of personalities, and Donna was trapped under rubble, with a view of the window, seeing Trisha's mouth and tongue come towards her, he last second of life she let out a tear,as the Trisha's tongue crush her and the building into Abby's tongue. All those in the building were gone, like they were nothing  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school was empty, but it was still surrounded by many homes and buildings &amp; 1 of those homes was home of Stephanie (Steph) &amp; Peter, a couple who used to be Brobby's they stood in their garden watching, they were too scared to leave<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph \"WHY THE HELL Did we become Lilles?, WE surely had better options\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam \"Yeah but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph cut in. \"Look at how massive they're, that's how big we used to be, I wish I still was\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the 1st time they saw people of Brobby size since they become Lillies, They watched as Trisha's Boots and &amp; Abby's now bare feet come towards them feeling every impact they made, hearing all the alarms &amp; screaming and loud booms of Trish and Abby's movements cause. Steph looked out to the now empty heels, thinking to herself *That's what my shoes would have once looked to what are now her neighbours, she saw how they towered over everything with ease, she felt massive regret for shrinking, &amp; she started to think that if she was in their position still, what would she do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam: \"STEPH, STEPH\"  snapping his fingers in front of her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha and Abby's steps have already caused their house to collapse, they both just kept their eyes on the giantess's as they were pointing towards the high school behind their house, they were so close to them now, and with Abby being barefoot, and having her foot right next to the school, Abby's toes is now all they could see, they saw Abby lift just her pinkie toe, and watched it crush to school with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe debris and dust come flying towards them, the impact of just Abby's pinkie toe sent Steph and Liam flying backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph \"We should have never done this, we should have asked for help more, I wish I was still a Brobby, I don't even like our neighbours, we should still be giant gods to them, look at what we could do back then with just our pinkie toe.. we're so insignificant now, if we somehow live through this, I'm going to find anyway to become a Brobby again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile despite all the movement, Jack was some how still handing onto Abby's big toe, he managed to just climb on and up high enough before Abby took her shoes off, he was determined to reach the top or \"The summit\" he felt truly insignificant, and he loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at the tiny streets she once walked, which now were only 4mil wide, thinner than her Pinkie toe, seeing her boots crushing many blocks of streets it gave her a great sense of power, the feeling was buzzing in her body, the people she went to school with thought she was scary when she was a speck like them?

She pulled out her phone and text a hot Brobby she met, Hugh, she\u2019s already had sex with him and now she wanted to fuck him on top of her former town, wanted to see his dick dwarf the towns tallest buildings by many times. Hugh was a 6ft 4 (31,968ft) athletic build 20-year-old man with a 10 inch when erect dick, and she was going to fuck him, suck him while killing 1000s of people may of which she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer dust mites, guys what? You\u2019re in for a MASSIVE show, I think you\u2019re going to like it\u201d she laughed, she then pulled her lipstick and mascara out of her bag and stared dolling her self up for her new man. Not caring were they landed she then just dropped them, her lipstick crushed the local University in its entirety and her mascara flattened a forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they felt more rumbles, just like when Trish approached, it was Hugh, already in his boxers with a clear erection showing, Trisha looked at it and her horniest exploded, she couldn\u2019t wait to start sucking off Liiles and their buildings of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Babe\u201d Trish said giving him a big kiss. \u201cReady for some Fun\u201d he replied  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha then removed her panties and dropped them on more housing, the almost weightless delicate fabric to her came crushing down onto the houses below, flattening them on impact under the sheer weight of it. She then slowly laid down placing her bare butt in the middle of the town weighting for Hugh to pleasure her while killing 1000s on their naked body\u2019s getting hornier thinking of all the people that have become unnoticeable stains on her ass, and the more people who will be during her and Hugh\u2019s love making, Hugh removed his boxers and mounted Trish and began to pound her causing a rhythmic series of Earthquakes for the tiny people below, for those trapped between Trish\u2019s legs the site of the humongous almost mile long dick going in and out of her chasm, the musky air around them, the heat was unbearable the air pressure around them was like a devastating storm. To the sides of them people looking up high at their bodies were in awe and panic, the streets were pandemonium people were climbing over themselves to get away those in cars running people down just so they could survive themselves, in the some what distance on both sides of the giants, people were in panic as they saw Trish\u2019s massive hands come right for them as she gripped the earth for stability on her and Hugh\u2019s love making, the orgasmic sounds echoed for miles, until they both came Hugh pulled out in plenty of time to flood part of the town in his cum. Killing 100s in the process, some who were already trapped by Trish\u2019s come, clearing themselves off, and kissing, Trisha whispered in  Hugh\u2019s ear \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready I\u2019ll like to give you a blowjob, after grabbing buildings and people to sprinkle on your dick of course\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after they were both ready for some more. Trisha began grabbing people and buildings and began sprinkling them on Hugh\u2019s dick and one of those specks was Abby, she survived the earthquakes of Trisha and Hugh\u2019s destructive sex, and now she was clinging onto a humongous dick, with her former bully Trish looking at her and all those others standing, clinging onto it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby couldn\u2019t believe it, why did Trish get to become big? It should have been her, this dick she was on should be one she could be having inside her, not clinging on to dear life, just looking at her surroundings and how ridiculously big the dick she was on was, she never felt small, she never really thought of her big the Brobs were, after looking around she looked up and saw Trsiha\u2019s red lips head being licked ready to crush her into the dick she was on.<br>\r\nTrish \u201cI can\u2019t believe how small I was, just look at them, they\u2019re nothing compared to your dick, your dick alone is a God to them. Millions could fit on it, imagine having millions of them being slaves that you force to wash your dick, I\u2019m imagine having millions on my vagina washing it, millions on my boobs washing them on my toes washing and painting them. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m a Brobby now and not a worthless speck, I deserve this power, I was above all of these worthless fucks when I was their size\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh \u201cYeah being born a Brobby is pretty great, I hated those protection laws, it\u2019s our rightful place to kill these tiny things, have them as slaves, we\u2019re the god race. We weren\u2019t made so much bigger for no reason, we\u2019re top of the food chain by miles\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish opened her mouth moving onto Hugh\u2019s dick and began sucking and licking all the Lillies and buildings off, Abby wasn\u2019t crushed, she was sucked right into Trish\u2019s mouth and was swallowed, she fell what felt like forever down deep all the way into Trish's stomach the heat of Trish's body and the fall was already painful enough but the stomach acid burning her skin was 1000 times worse, she couldn't believe she was swallowed by her former bully she was inside Trish didn't even know it, to Trish was was just another barely visible dot, that was nothing to her, Now Abby's last moments were seeing her former bully as a Evil Goddess that didn't even notice her existence and she was now dying inside of her. Why didn't she accept her invitation? maybe she could have lived? or died in a less painful away, seeing her town crushed under two 6 mile people having sex, being sprinkled onto a dick then sucked off and swallowed has to be the worst way to go in this situation.with her dying moments screaming in pain, she imagined what if it was her fucking a man on top of a town, what if this was Trish dying inside of her, that's the way it should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish was sucking Hugh's cock clean, and fast, it was orgasmic to both of them, and then Hugh came in Trish's mouth, she held it, turned and spout it out in a random direction over the town, the weight of it alone crushing buildings and killing even more people who were to stupid or were unable to flee yet.</span></div></div>",

Trisha \u201cnot sure how many people inside, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s  lot or not, they\u2019re just all so tiny\u201d Trisha hands Connie the carrier to which Connie placed in Bikini Bottoms,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha \u201cAh great minds think alike ah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a great feeling power having 500 people being specks right next to your Vagina, imagine all those men in their who once could have fit their dick perfectly inside, but now see it as the biggest cave they have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby inside to the carrier in Trisha's panties was crying, she was looking up in the mostly darkness at Trish's genitals, knowing that she had a chance to be her size, and she blew it, and now Connie was enjoying what she could have, and now she's going to be a slave to Connie and Trish, two former school peers who's toes are now vast fields to her, who's breasts are mountains, who's clits are large hills, who's teeth she could fit between, two people she knew, could crush her, and 100s of others just under their pinkie toes, who's toe nails and finger nails now weigh 100s of tons, mouths that open winder than the tallest building Trish crushed between her fingers, tongues too, Nipples taller than 25 floor buildings, Vagina's deeper than the tallest building is tall. This could have been her, but she was too paranoid about Trish, and now she's going to have to watch Trish and Connie having fun being Brobby's before one of them kills her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie looked down at the former town, she couldn't believe it. She was a Brobby, and there was no longer any laws to protect Lills, she could do anything she wanted, she was imaging the tiny specks looking up at her tanned body like a Goddess, she was in thing out a 2 peace swimsuit and high heels, she wanted to show of her sun kissed, goddess like skin, she saw a crowed of people trying to escape down a road which was thinned out by rubble, she pent down, scooped some up with their finger nail and placed them on her big toe, some who fell the tiny distance to Connie, but huge to them onto Connie's big toe, died on impact on the hard cold surface of her white painted toe nails, Connie looked down at the specks on the toes. and imagined what it was like for them, and she used to be so small, how if Abby didn't reject her invite, this could have been her on Trish or Abby's toe nail right now, or she could be in a tiny room next to Trish or Abby's Vagina right now, but she wasn't, she wasn't the speck, she was the giant goddess now, and all these tiny fucks like she used to be have no way to stop her, She flicked up her toes, to get the specks of, they all went flying 100s of feet i to the air and 100s of feet away from Connie's all died from their fall to the ground, some landed back down between Connies toes and become stains on her shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nduring this. Trisha was watching her, smiling at Connie use of power, and how they were both once the size of those specks, and that this was permanent they were going to be Brobby's forever, they're going to be the nightmares of Lilly's forever, to them they were unstoppable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha, so shall we start crushing this specky town, or take these people home for some fun and come back later?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hello Abby\u201d she said with a grin on her face. Connie also held up the carrier she had \u201cHa look how fucking tiny we once were, can you imagine still being one? And looking up at two beautiful giantesses that plan to use you as entertainment? I can, thinking it from their perspective makes it so much better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the carrier, Abby was crying, looking out to the giant world around the carrier, she watched out the window as Trish began lowering it to her toes they were huge, they could crush and kill so much, she looked out at the vast black surface and just kept feeling worse and worse how she missed her chance, she then heard someone speak over the VA system inside. It was Trish. \u201cNow 1st, I want to speak to a certain little speck, Abby! Put on an ear piece and microphone\u201d out of fear Abby did what she was told \u201cHello? Trish? PLEASE let me go, I\u2019m sorry for rejecting your invite, please don\u2019t hurt me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha ignored Abby\u2019s pleas and just gave her instructions \u201cAbby, I want you to get out of the carrier and onto my toenail, if you don\u2019t I will crush you and all of those with you\u201d This was also said over the PA, Abby began to cry \u201cBut why? I don\u2019t want to, please don\u2019t make me\u201d Trish began counting \u201c1,2,3\u2026.\u201d The others began dragging Abby towards the door, Abby struggled out of their grip and agreed to do what Trisha said. Abby was about to leave when Trish said \u201cAh before you go, grab some paint and a brush, I want you do paint white dots on my toe. Abby sighed \u201cok\u201d she grabbed the pain which would not be enough to do what Trish wanted, but she didn\u2019t want to anger her by arguing. So, she just stepped out onto the hard-black surface. It was huge, it was the size of a field, she began painting her 1st dot making it as large as she could, as the others watched. Inside the carrier the people heard instructions other people from Trish, Connie and Abby\u2019s old school, Harriet, Alice, Olivia, Heather &amp; Hannah were told to take all the paint out and join Abby in painting dots on Trish\u2019s toe. Of course, out of fear they did. Once they told Trish they were all out they watched as she lifted to carrier all they way up and attached to one of Trish\u2019s rings.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOn Trisha\u2019s toe Abby and the girls began painting dots, as Trish looked down at them like a goddess<br>\r\nTrish \u201cAh micro slave labour the best way to show power, they\u2019ll be working for quite some time, Connie what are you going to do with yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie \u2013 \u201cWell I\u2019m going to go out and sun bathe with these specks on my mountainous boobs\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish \u201cHave fun\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Trish was still looking down at her toes, waiting to be able to see white dots appear, she was looking very carefully but couldn\u2019t see any, so she pulled out a magnifying glass, to get a better look, she saw the 6 girls painting away, clearly not making the dots big enough \u201cI want those dots bigger girls I can\u2019t really see them\u201d The girls sighed Abby \u201cWhy the hell does Trish get to be a Brobby? And why is she getting away with crushing our town and kidnapping us? It\u2019s not fair it should have been me becoming a brobby\u201d all the girls said \u201cNo it should have been me\u201d they all looked at each other and back up, because it wasn\u2019t them it was Trish and Connie some how got to join her. They looked up at the girl who was the meanest and most vicious bully. With her black clothes and blonde hair, she always stood out, she was always someone people tried to get out of the way off. But if Trish wanted to be mean to you, she would go out of her way to, and now this girl could crush 100s of them under her pinkie toe. Even a strand of her hair now weighs tons. They worked away trying to paint as big of dots as they could, Trish sat there watching Tv with her feet flat on the floor, an hour went by and she looked down, they haven\u2019t even done 1/4 her big toe yet, all they were doing was painting dots, she laughed, this is how tiny and perfect the Lilly\u2019s were to her now. \u201cWell looks like I need a lot more than 6 people for this job, heck more than 40, If I want to get this job done properly\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish lowered an empty carrier to her toe and demanded only Abby to get in, the girls knowing how much more Abby was a target of Trish back in school were happy to stay on Trish\u2019s toenail, they thought it would be safer, but it wasn\u2019t. Abby went into the carrier and Trish lifted back up, Miles into the air, she looked down at the poor job Abby and the girls did, and then flicked her big toe, sending Harriet, Alice, Olivia, Heather &amp; Hannah flying 100s of feet into the air and 1000s of feet away from Trish, they all landed on the rug, with thick fibres, much thicker and taller than any tree. They were not dead, but they were hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Abby, looks like you need to work harder, I can barely see those dots, I know you think they were big, but I can only just make them out, I need to be able to see them or what\u2019s the point? All I want is dots a bout 1-2mil wide that\u2019s all! That\u2019s nothing, how hard can it be? Looks like it need a team of well over 100 people just for 1 of my big toes alone haha, that won\u2019t be hard to get\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile on the balcony Connie was sunbathing bra-less</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie had taken her captures outside, she laid on the sunbed with her breasts out, and the carrier in-between them. She demanded that the specks should scale her boobs like a mountain, that they need to climb to the top, or they\u2019ll face death. Connie hoped soon she\u2019ll get to toy with Abby, she wanted Abby to scale her nipple to show off what she missed out on, to show off the new size difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n100s of Lills poured out of the carrier, some stayed inside, feeling like Connie wouldn\u2019t notice. Connie watched as these tiny barely visible back dots began climbing her breasts she smiled seeing how her boobs dwarfed them like a mountain, Connie was now a landscape to her former race and she loved it, she wished she was even bigger, she also wished she could see it from one of their perspectives, fortunately she never saw a Brobby until she went to become one. She only had her imagination and being a former Lilly helped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her breasts were 2 couples both former Brobby\u2019s who had to downsize due to financial reasons, Britney and Kevin, and Nick and Felecia. If only Nick and Felecia knew about the change of the law, they may have put off their decision to downsize and grinded away while still being massive Brobby\u2019s but they didn\u2019t they became lilly\u2019s they already had Britney and Kevin who they knew back when they were all massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelecia \u201cOMG look at how high those boobs are? Is this how you felt on mine Britney?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney \u201cYes\u2026 and no\u2026 I knew you weren\u2019t going to hurt me\u2026 but this massive bitch? I don\u2019t know\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThis is crazy, I can\u2019t believe this perspective, to think of all those we killed with your breasts Felicia this is what they were seeing\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to climb one of the tanned breasts, but Connie\u2019s sweet was making it slippery, one man who already made it near the top, had slipped and every saw him fall, he hit part of the breast on the way down and bounced away, crushing down into the valley of Connie\u2019s cleavage dying on impact. Many of the people began to scream, they knew they were doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie was enjoying her rest in the sun when Trish came over with the carrier carrying Abby.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Abby took a step out and over the mic told Trish and Connie she was on Connie, and then Trish pulled away the carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie \u201cKneel down and kiss the ground that is my skin, worship me like the Goddess I am to you, and everyone we knew, well apart from me and Trish of course, now imagine how many of you specks could fit on my abs. 1000s upon 1000s, I\u2019m a landscape to you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby \u201cPlease stop, I thought we were friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie \u201cYeah were, that all changed when I became so big, that you could walk along a single eyelash of mine, climb my breasts like mountains, take you hours just to clean under 1 just one of my toe nails hmm that sounds like a good task for you later\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby fell to her knees and sobbed and began kissing Connie\u2019s Abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should have been me\u201d she whispered &amp; whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Trish was looking over Connie, seeing the tiny dot on Connie\u2019s tanned skin and laughed<br>\r\n\u201cTo think we were once that size, I\u2019m going to love being this big, I can barely see poor Abby down there, she\u2019s going to make a fun little slave for us, a long with the 1000s of others we can get\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie \u201cI know right, she\u2019s so pathetic to me now, I remember how much of a little ass kisser she was towards me, now I can literally make her kiss my ass, I think I will do that in a bit, but first.

Look at my nipples they could crush your whole family and many more, look at my lips, I could crush our old school and your neighbourhood with a kiss, you should have accepted Trish\u2019s invite, thinking about it, it would have been me standing on your breasts like they were mountains right now, look at you like a Goddess, but your silly little bitch chucked that away and now here you are just a speck on my gorgeous body\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish \u201cI can still make her become our size, but I think keeping her as a speck would be more fun, but maybe....\u201d she thought of couple of fun ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie \u201cIndeed it would, but hey if we\u2019re bored of her and she does a good job with our demands, she has a chance\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish \u201cOh yeah, but we have so much and she\u2019s so small It could take forever\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie \u201cFirst, I want her to kiss my ass, can you pass the carrier, you go have fun with other specks\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTrish hands Connie the carrier, with s smirk on her face, seriously thinking of screwing Connie over and tricking her to switch roles with Abby.<br>\r\nConnie proceeds to get Abby in the carrier, she leans up and stairs inside, she then puts the carrier between her lips covering it completely, while doing so she removes her bikini bottoms and turns over so she can tan her butt more and so Abby can kiss her bare butt, after all that she stretches back and puts the carrier at on her butt. \u201cYou know what to do\u201d Abby gets out and begins walking on the warm surface of Connie\u2019s Butt. She had the ass most girls want, tanned, and toned it was Goddess like when she was a Lilly, but now it truly was.

So, she prepared her favourite outfit, and a small bag to take with her to become a Brobby, she put on her favourite knee length boots, black shirt, black underwear, black bra and black top, and a bag with her make-up which included red lipstick &amp; black eyeliner, amongst other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the transport to see Dr Phillips she felt a tingling of nerves all over her body, she was so excited, she will no longer be a speck, but a Brobby and no one was bigger, she was about to join the race that would have once towered over her like a mountain a race she would struggle to climb their pinkie toes, and now her former peers would now be specks that would struggle to climb her pinkie toe. She could crush them and not even notice they will soon be nothing to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived and met up with Dr Phillips who explained what will happen, as he drove her to the facility, as it arrived to the hilled drive away, she looked a head and saw the Brobby building,  it was huge, she couldn\u2019t believe it, it was crazy to her, as the car drove down the hill  to the front of the building which was basically built into a paving slab with crevasses to allow access as the building needed to not stand in the Brobbys  way in case it got crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dr Phillips went through information, Trisha was looking down at her feet imaging him and everyone she knew as specks in front of her boots, the streets demolished under her boots, having speck sized slaves paint her nails for her like she was their goddess and there was nothing they could do to stop her. she was getting more and more excited about becoming 6 miles tall, her former class mates thought she was scary and caused pain before?

It\u2019s faster and it allows you to grow things with you, that you can take to your new life as a Brobby, previous winners of the lotto needing to buy everything new was quite the annoyance, and some the drugs either didn\u2019t work, or they become sick, we\u2019ve tested this new ray before on objects and another winner. And it works better, and faster, do you have any questions?<br>\r\nTrisha \u201cNo, at all\u201d saying while she thought *How would you liked to be crushed*<br>\r\nShe and her parents were the only ones how knew about the protection laws being repelled soon, it was kept a secret for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Phillips \u201cOk, if you just head through that door and prepare yourself the ray should be ready in a couple of minutes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading through the door Trisha took a deep breath this was the beginning of her new life, a new life as a ginormous Brobby all her former peers will cower from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ready and it was fired Trisha closed her eyes as she felt the incredible rush of the growing process, she opened her eyes expecting to see the Brobby building which she is now the right size for, but it wasn\u2019t there, in the distance she saw what looked like a model city, she recognised it from pictures it was a Brobby city, she looked down and saw the facility she was expecting to see, but it was only 3 inches tall, and was right between her boots, the pavement under her feet was cracked, she had crushed the Lilly facility, and the ray with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, at the 3-inch structure, she realised it was the ginormous building from before it was the Brobby facility. Lifting up her foot and crushing it, she felt a massive rush of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap that ray method has made me so large, I am now a giant to Brobbies too, this is fantastic, now nothing is bigger than me, now everyone is either a bug, a speck or a microbe to me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha started to imagine her now 424-mile former loaming over her former town which would now only be 2inchs by 2 inches to her, practically crush able with two toes, the world is truly screwed now, who needs the protection laws repealed when there is no one large enough to stop her? Brobby\u2019s had now need for strong weapons due to their size, so there was nothing they had to stop her and the Gullies and Lillys? They were too small to do anything to her, especially the lilys. Her nipples are now mountains to them, her areolas are so large, they can cover a large now, her toes were miles tall too. Feeling the rush of power, she started to walk forward to the Brobby city, to show them what it\u2019s like to be small. She walked down the two wide avenues with buildings between her legs, stepping and crushing cars, she loved it, but what she really wanted to see was her former town, her former homeland, so that\u2019s where she headed, it didn\u2019t take long at her size, at all, she even didn\u2019t have much trouble crossing the water, with her boots having a 2-inch plat from and the see being quite shallow, barely an inch deep, she had no issues getting to Lilliput.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth was so much weaker here, the hills were instantly flattened with no give at all, she was destroying the land scape, her foot prints moving earth to create ginormous mountains, she had already crushed smaller towns and villages and she hadn\u2019t even noticed, but show she arrived right in front of her boots was her former home town, it was so tiny, she couldn\u2019t make anything out apart from its shape, she couldn\u2019t have much fun with it, but her immigration of the microbes, entire site was just her boots towering over it was fun enough, for her. Now how should she crush it? Trisha thought<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The vibrations were getting stronger and rattling everything in his apartment. It felt as if the entire building was shaking. Jack had no idea what was going on but the rhythmic booming was getting louder and the shaking was getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and AJ were a couple of Brobdingnagians who were out for a jog on this beautiful day. They were boyfriend and girlfriend and were a very active and athletic couple. It definitely showed as their bodies were toned and both loved to run and workout. They were both 23 years old and had been dating for a year as they had met their senior year of college. Jenna was a beautiful blonde, had richly tan skin and blue eyes. She had a toned body and stood at 5'7. AJ was a well built man with brown hair and had brown eyes. He was athletic just like his girlfriend and had muscle in all the right places. He stood at 6'1 and was an attractive man. AJ was wearing a pair of black shorts and a dark red t shirt. He was wearing a pair of black, white and gray nikes. Jenna was wearing a neon yellow dri fit contour tank top with a bit of black on the shoulder areas and a pair of black running shorts with white trim that showed off her tan, toned legs and her perfect butt. She had her flowing blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail for the run. She was wearing a pair of black and white nike frees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobby couple had been jogging through Lilliput as they loved how quiet it was. For the unfortunate Lillis who happened to be in the Brobbys way, the last thing they saw was the tread of one of the giant couples running shoes. One such small lilli town had completely disappeared under Jenna's running shoe, the last thing the people saw the white and back tread of her shoe before she crushed it. Jenna had seen the town too, she just didn't care enough to go around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and AJ had been running a while now and were quite sweaty from their workout and run. Jenna and AJ came to a stop to take a rest and that's when Jenna saw it. A large Lilliputian city, no doubt very crowded on this beautiful day. \"Hey AJ, look what I found.\" Jenna sang as she walked towards the city, stopping right at the outskirts. \"What is it babe?\" AJ said as he walked over to stand next to her. \"Oh wow, this city's huge.\" He said as he gazed over it. \"Yeah, you know what would be a great way to unwind after that long run?\" Jenna said smirking devilishly. \"What babe?\" AJ said smirking back. He already knew what his girlfriend was about to suggest. \"Crushing these little Lillis and their little city.\" She grinned. \"You're so evil.\" AJ teased. \"Don't act like you weren't thinking the same thing.\" Jenna said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lillis in the city had felt the shaking and heard the loud pounding as it got nearer, the sound and shaking increasing. Many thought it was an earthquake, before the gargantuan black and white nikes had slammed down on the city's edge. It was a Brobdingnagian. 5'7 Jenna appeared miles tall to these Lillis. They could make out the shoes and had to crane their necks up her toned, tan legs to her neon highlighter yellow top and couldn't even really see her face. The smooth, tanned legs seemed o almost be glistening from her sweat. The Lillis heard a thunder like sound as the giantess talked and soon she was joined by another pair of huge shoes, these black, white, and gray and bigger than the first pair. These shoes led up to what appeared to be massive legs, the hair on them showed it to be a man, up to a pair of black shorts and a t shirt. The Lillis heard the thunder like sound of voices and booming laughter as the Brobbys towered over the city. The Lillis watched as the massive Brobbys bent over, the huge fingers working the laces of the shoes. The tan fingers untying the black and white nikes had manicured fingernails painted a pale pink while the fingers working the laces on the black gray and white shoes looked more manly. The Lillis watched as the huge shoes shifted as the Brobbys removed their gym shoes by using the toe of the opposite foot on the heel and slipping out their feet out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna and AJ wasted no time in bending over and untying their shoes. Prying the shoes off by the heel using their the toes of the opposite foot, they were towering over the city with their shoes off and their socked feet out. With their socked feet out, Jenna wiggled her toes. \"Ahhh that feels good.\" She said. Jenna was wearing short socks that came up to the bottom of her ankle. They were neon yellow like her tank top in the toe and heel area the sole and bottom part of the gray and the upper half was white. AJ was wearing black ankle socks as well. The couple's socks were soaked with sweat and the socks damp. \"Ready or not, here comes my foot!\" Jenna giggled as she lifted her right foot up and brought it down on the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lillis watched as the giant Brobbys placed their massive socked feet down. It only took a few seconds for the strong smell of sweaty feet to wash over the city. They watched as the giantess wiggled her massive toes, the neon yellow material of her sock moved as her gargantuan toes wiggled beneath the sock. The smell of sweaty feet was overwhelming. Lillis near the mans feet could smell a strong sour scent along with the sweaty feet smell. It was absolutely overwhelming to the senses for the people close to the massive feet. Lillis near the woman's  feet could smell a strong cheesy odor along with a musky feminine scent accompanying the sweaty feet smell. The Lillis heard a loud thunder like sound and watched as the huge socked of foot of the woman lifted up. She moved it over the city casting a large swath in shadow. The bottom of the sock was a bit dingy, grayed a bit were her toes were and the dark gray sole of the sock even looked a bit more gray than the rest of the dark gray part. The neon colored heel was dingy and grayed as well. The cheesy, sweaty smell coming down from the gargantuan foot as it hovered over the city was even stronger. People began to scream and run, it was pandemonium specifically anywhere in her shadow. People screamed as the massive foot came down, crushing people, vehicles, and buildings like it was nothing. The stomp created a loud boom as her foot landed and shook the earth. The sole of damp, sweat soaked sock of the Brobby giantess, the last thing many Lillis ever saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna giggled as she took the first stomp into the city. \"Come on babe! You have to try it!\" AJ just grinned at his girlfriend and lifted his massive foot up and slammed it done on the city. \"That is pretty great. Wonder what it's like for them?\" Jenna raised her other foot up and stomped it into another part of the city. \"Who cares.\" she said with a grin as she twisted her socked foot back and forth. AJ just laughed and took another step into the city, crushing thousands of helpless Lillis and buildings under his massive socked foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the giantess had taken an earth shaking step into the city, her socked foot crushing everything and anything beneath it, all hell broke loose. People were running and screaming and then the giant had raised his huge foot, clad in a black ankle sock, over the city. The bottom of his sock was a bit dingy as well and turning a lighter color in some areas due to his sweat. The smell of his sour sweaty feet washed over the city as it hovered over. The giant then slammed his foot down just like the giantess, although his foot was larger and crushed more. The panicked Lillis could hear the thunder like sounds the Brobbys laughing as they trampled the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna laughed as she raised up her socked foot and held it over the downtown of the tiny city. All of the hard work the Lillis put into building the skyscrapers, about to undone by a single step of her size 9 foot. She grinned as brought her foot down, crushing the buildings with ease. AJ had been stomping around the city and in a few steps he had leveled much of it. The smell from their feet was overwhelming to the Lillis. What had started off as an uncomfortable odor was now a powerful mind-numbing stink. The smell of sweaty feet could be smelled through out the city. Those unlucky enough to be smashed beneath their feet, had to deal with the damp sweat soaked socks that smushed them into nothing. As Jenna walked towards her boyfriend, careful not to step where he already had so she could cause even more destruction, she smirked. It had only been a few minutes, but already most of the tiny city had been trampled under the smelly socked feet of the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downtown had disappeared under the sweaty, cheesy socked foot of the giantess, her socked foot resting where the tallest buildings had been and her tan, toned legs stretching high up. Jack had escaped his building and had joined the crowd of people in the street running. The stomping of Giants had caused some buildings to collapse from the earth quake like steps of the Brobbys and the smell was ripe. Jack couldn't believe had bad the smell was. It was like being being in locker room but the locker room was filled to the brim with the sweaty socks of marathoners. It made him even more angry that the Brobbys were laughing and enjoying the torment they were inflicting. He could see the sweaty sock clad feet of the giant man stomp a large part of the city outskirts, causing the entire city to shake. Jack was suddenly cast in shadow and looked up. He was greeted by the sole of the giantess, dingy and darkened gray, no doubt with debris and countless remains mashed into the sock. The strong smell of sweaty cheesy feet was all around him. There was also a strong musky feminine odor and he looked up at the neon yellow and dark gray sky. People around him screamed and ran while others dropped to their knees. The gargantuan foot began to descend and Jack closed his eyes and seconds later felt nothing as the damp sock and the massive foot with in obliterated him.</span></div></div>",

They didn't care about the thousands they were crushing and all the buildings they were destroying. Jenna and AJ were walking around the tiny city making sure everything was crushed beneath them. They laughed and joked as they stomped around, stepping on Lillis by the thousands. They were also flooding the city with their foot stink. AJ's sour sweaty foot smell, his black socks damp with sweat and soles dingy. Jenna's cheesy sweaty foot smell with a musky feminine odor and her damp sweaty socks with dingy soles. AJ's feet were bigger than Jenna's size 9 feet and his smelled stronger but hers definitely gave a run for its money. The were pretty much oblivious to the strength of their smelly feet. Although they could catch whiffs of their feet every now and again, to Lilliputians, it was all they could smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the Lillis desperately trying to escape, it was hell. The strong smell of sweaty feet was ingrained at this point. The Brobbys gargantuan feet were causing earthquakes and leaving people trapped in collapsed buildings. The giant had bigger feet than the giantess which meant every time he took a step, more of the city was crushed. The thunderous laughter of the Brobbys taunted the helpless Lillis as they knew they couldn't stop these giants from having their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna walked along, trampling the city under her socked feet, followed closely by AJ. The couple was having so much fun decimating the tiny city. \"There's like, nothing even left!\" Jenna exclaimed. Anyone still alive in the city was being forced to inhale the cheesy sweaty smell of Jenna's feet or the sweaty sour smell of AJ's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" AJ said as he stepped on a large crowd and numerous buildings, his huge foot engulfing a large part of the city, \"But I still see some areas we missed.\" Jenna giggled and stepped into an area that hadn't been stepped on. \"This is so much fun! Imagine being a dumb little Lilliputian,\" As she said this she lifted her foot up held it over a part of the city, \"and the next thing you know,\" *BOOM* \"You're crushed under my massive foot!\" She had brought her foot down and laughed as she wiggled her socked toes. \"If they weren't so helpless, they wouldn't wind up underfoot!\" AJ laughed as he stepped on another part of the city. \"Hey, look at that.\" Jenna said pointing to a small part of the city that remained uncrushed. \"I'll get it babe.\" AJ said turning towards it. \"Wait! We should crush it together.\" Jenna grinned as AJ laughed. They each took a step over to the part left standing. Jenna placed on hand on AJ's shoulder to study herald and raised her right foot. AJ wrapped his arm around her waist to study himself and raised up his right foot and held it right next to Jenna's. \"On 3,\" Jenna giggled while she wiggled her toes, \"1..2..3!\" They laughed as they slammed their feet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lillis in the lower business district were still panicking as they tried to flee the city. The district was jam packed with cars and people but thankfully the Brobbys hadn't crushed it yet. The stench of sweaty feet had reached the district but it wasn't as bad as the rest of the city. The ground had shook as the Brobbys had suddenly walked over to the district, the ground shaking as they did. The people were greeted by the sock covered toes taller than buildings. The neon yellow toe of the sock covering the giantess's wiggling toes, the strong cheesy stink wafting from them and her glistening toned tan legs stretching up to her black athletic running shorts with white trim that were quite short. The giant mans feet in black socks were next to her feet, his toes larger and his foot wider than the giantess and his hairy legs went up to black shorts that came down to his knees. The smell wafting from these massive socked feet, sweaty and sour and cheesy was now overwhelming. The people heard the thunderous laughter watched as the sun was blocked out by the gargantuan feet of the Brobbys. There was the black sock sole of the giant, dingy and damp with sweat, bigger than the giantess's foot raised next to his which was clad in her sock, neon yellow toes and heel with a dark gray sole, damp with sweat and dingy. The giantess had wiggled her toes high above as the thunderous laughter and a booming voice rang out. The Lillis couldn't make out what was being said but the gargantuan feet began to descend, the sweaty feet smell increasing, and the Brobbys feet obliterated everything beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so much fun!\" Jenna giggled as she stood on her tip toes a bit to kiss AJ. \"Agreed babe.\" AJ said as they broke the kiss and Jenna's heels slammed back down. Jenna turned and began to walk, trampling the outskirts of the city and the surrounding neighborhoods under her feet. AJ followed suit, careful not to step were she already had. The people in the neighborhoods first had to contend with the sweaty cheesy smell of Jenna's feet followed up by the smell of AJ's sweaty sour smelling feet. They made sure to trample the rest of the city as well, everything crushed under their sweaty socked feet. \"What a bunch of losers! It took us what? Like 10 minutes to level this place?\" Jenna scoffed as she surveyed the destroyed city. \"Give or take a few minutes, yeah. They're nothing to us.\" AJ chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna wiggled her toes and grinned. \"You know, I think we should jog through Lilliput more often.\" \"I'm definitely not opposed to that.\" AJ chuckled. Jenna walked across the city in a few steps, her toned tan legs still glistening in the sun as she crushed any unfortunate survivors under her sweaty socks.</span></div></div>",

In total Jenna and AJ had destroyed around 10 cities, and killed and injured countless more. If the Lilliputians had anything they had numbers, countless numbers that seemed to grow endlessly. So to Jenna and AJ there really was no harm done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that fun honey?\u201d Jenna asked walking side by side with her man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea that was amazing babe, we have to do it more often.\u201d AJ puts his left hand around Jenna\u2019s shoulder and kisses her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if it cost the lives of thousands of Lilliputians?\u201d Jenna asked with a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspecially if it cost the lives of thousands of Lilliputians, those specks only exist for our entertainment, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet your hot ass, I love when you talk like that.\u201d Jenna stands on her tippy toes and gives AJ a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna and AJ walked back to Brobdingnagia, Jenna was not aware of her little passenger stuck in the fabric of her right sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn\u2019t know how he got into this mess, the last thing he remembered before he passed out was staring at a yellow sky that was Jenna\u2019s sock (he did not know that at the time), and a pungent smell that smelled like sweat and moldy cheese but also a little feminine, now he was on this women\u2019s sock and the smell that he smelled before was even stronger minus the feministic aspect. Jack couldn\u2019t think of any reason, to why these bastards would do this. Jack thought about all of those people who he once called friend, those people who were in panic, the people who he simply passed on the street, some random day in the past, all of those people were gone, smushed at the bottom of the foot of these psychopaths. Jack promised himself if he lived through this he would devote his life to making a difference for Lilliputians everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt like he was on a roller coaster. Jenna walking shook jacks very world in ways that seemed to threaten to tear his punny body to shreds. Jack was located In between Jenna\u2019s big and second toe and jack seemed to be pushed further and further into the fabrics of Jenna\u2019s socks. Jack struggled to get lose, from the fabrics that kept him prisoner, but the fabric was just to strong for his meager strength. All he could do was wait in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon making it back to Brobdingnagia Jenna and AJ went their separate ways. Jenna and AJ decided to make plans for dinner tonight, after they cleaned up, and washed all of the sweat off their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna walked into her apartment, she untied her bow tie and let\u2019s her long blond hair fall past her shoulders. Jenna took off her shoes and walked into the bathroom, preparing to take a shower. Jenna walking into the bathroom and starts to slowly strip first her shirt drenched in sweat then her shorts. Jenna wore nothing but her socks, Jenna stares into the mirror looking at her ample E cup breast. She thought about the Lilliputians she killed with the greatest ease. She towered over there whole entire city, she truly was a goddess to them. She started to become turned on by the power she held over them, she truly didn\u2019t want it to end. Jenna starts to bend down to take off her socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight came without warning, to jack as it insulted his eyes. He could see, so he came to the conclusion that the girl he was stuck on had taken off her shoes (doesn\u2019t know her name yet). It was good to have a little bit of fresh air. Many things had changed, jacks surroundings, the smell of Jenna\u2019s foot Oder, and the moving speed seemed to get worse as it attacked jacks body. Jack realized that Jenna was wearing her shoes when she was walking, it was her shoes that protected him from the raging winds and now that Jenna wasn\u2019t wearing shoes he was complete exposed. Jack couldn't make since of his surroundings he was just moving to fast. After what seemed like forever the massive women had finally stopped. It seemed like he was in a bathroom. Then something started to happen. Gigantic object started to fall from the sky and hit the ground with a great BOOM that generated the biggest windstorm jack had ever felt. Upon taking a closer look jack realized that these objects were close, close that smelled horrible. Then something else caught jacks eye the fabrics began to vibrate and before he new it jack was rising with a tone of g-force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw shit.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack had moved faster than any rollercoaster, faster than any airplane, the only thing he thought he could compare his ascension to, was a launched rocket ship. Heck for all he knew, he was probably going faster. It was a miracle that he was still alive, and that didn\u2019t make jack comfortable because throughout jacks long experience, miracles would only last so long. jack still stuck on Jenny\u2019s sock is lifted all the way to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like looking into the face of god. Jack did not have any word to compare Jenny\u2019s hight, nor did he have the will to make a sound. This could not be a human being, jack thought as he looked up at the titanic like face that belonged to Jenny. Surely no human could be this big, could be this almighty. Jenny didn\u2019t just have the size of a goddess but the looks of one as well. Her long blond hair came down past her shoulders and a few strands where draped all around her face, strands that where more mighty than any Lilliputian weapon, strands harder than steel. Jenny\u2019s face was tanned from being out in the sun all day, and her skin was smooth, but being so close to her face jack could see a few of Jenny pores that were big enough to swallow him whole, but even these slight imperfections where not enough to damage her beauty. Jack is soon lowered until he sees a humongous hole 100s of feet wide right above him. The hole was dark, and seemed to have black pillars that decorated its insides, pillars much larger than jack himself. Wind starts to pick up around jack, jacks hair starts to fly around wildly and even jacks clothes were no execution asthey seemed to come alive, blowing in the wind. The wind kept getting faster and faster, not to mention more wild, until it was comparable to a class five hurricane. Jack once again felt luck, if he wasn\u2019t stuck to Jenny\u2019s sock he would of been sucked in to the gigantic hole. But he was also unlucky because the wind pressure made it hard to breath. Well at least he knew what the hole actually was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny has taken off both of her socks and brought her right sock up to her face. Jenny could see very tiny red dots on the soles of her socks and smiled knowing that these red dots were the remains of the Lilliputians that she killed. Jenny brought the sock down to her nose, and gave the nasty piece of fabric a long sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWheeeeeew, now that is a nasty ass smell, almost feel bad for the Lilliputians for having to smell that during their last moment on this planet.\u201d Jenny said with a little giggle, Which symbolized how meaningless her words words were.Jenny was about to put both her sock down on the counter of the bathroom sink but something caught her eye, something moving on her right sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Jenny asked with a little surprise, bring the sock up to her eyes to get a closer look at this mysterious speck that seem to be stuck on her sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny\u2019s voice hurt jack to no end, I swear to god if it\u2019s not one thing it\u2019s the other, jack thought. The wind pressure had returned to normal now that Jenny had stopped smelling her sock but now her voice was hurting jacks ears. Jack knew that Lilliputians could never be able to understand a Brobdingnagian, but he never knew it could be this bad, so bad that Jenny\u2019s voice sounded like thunder and shook him to his very soul, threatening to destroy his ear drums. Soon the world started to shift once again and jack found himself in a familiar situation, being risen up 100 of feet into the air. Soon jack came before a 300 foot light blue eye that stared at him with great entrust. Jack did not make a movie, nor did he say a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny couldn\u2019t believe it, was this a Lilliputian stuck on her sock. No it couldn\u2019t be Jenny thought, her eyes never leaving the little speck that was jack. Lilliputians where hard to see for a Brobdingnagian, specially when their was just one, but the more Jenny looked at the little dot on her foot the more she gre certain that what she was looking at was a Lilliputian. A smile creeps across Jenny\u2019s face, maybe just maybe the fun didn\u2019t have to end after all. Yes she could easily kill this Lilliputian any number of ways but where was the fun in that, no she wanted to make this last as long as possible and thank god she had the tools to do exactly that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny ran outside of the bathroom totally necked, carrying the sock with jack in her right hand. Jenny runs to the nightstand that stood right next her bed and opened the top drawer. Jenny takes out a small packet with words printed on it, words that said Entertaining Lilliputians. Inside this packet where two headsets, one head set was Lilliputian size, the other was Brobdingnagian size. Jenny takes both headset out, taking great care not to damage the Lilliputian one, and she sets the sock on top of the night stand, and the Lilliputian headset right next to the sock. First things first she would have to free the Lilliputian from his prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn\u2019t know how many times he was going to be expose to change in air pressure, or be lifted up hundred of feet in the air, or movie at super sonic speeds, but in one day, yea he had enough. It was  obvious to jack that Jenny had left the bathroom, he still couldn\u2019t make out much of his surrounding moving so fast but he could make out enough to relive that he was back where he started the first Time in some kind of gigantic bedroom. Jack was leveled to Jenny\u2019s bare chest so he bore witness to boobs that could easily crush whole entire cities, maybe two with little effort. Jenny nipples alone where powerful weapons that put many of Lilliputians missiles to shame. Was this really a human being. Jack soon found himself on a hard surface, the figure of Jenny looming over him, putting him  in her shadow. She seemed to be opening something but jack didn\u2019t know what it was. Jack sees Jenny put something down a few 100 feet away from him, but he still could not tell what it was. What did this women have planned for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Jenny a few. Minute to get jack unstuck off her sock, as soon as she did she made sure that jack got the headphone that she had put on top of the nightstand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello can you hear me?\u201d Jack asked a little scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes I can. How surprising.\u201d  Jenny said her smiling wising as she leaned closer to the speck that was jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising?\u201d Jack asked sweat running down his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising how human you sound, I guess There really is a man behind that minuscule and fragile form is their?\u201d She said lightly tapping the speck with her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went tumbling as the meteor sized finger slammed into him. Jack could do nothing but gasp for air as he looked up at the towering  giantess.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny saw how the little speck had fallen so hard, from the littlest tap of her finger, she swore she had tapped him as gently as she could but still this mite couldn\u2019t stand up to her meager display of power. Jenny smile grew wider until a little bit of her teeth were showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright little one?\u201d Jenny asks not really caring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m alright.\u201d Jack said know that Jenny didn\u2019t really care. This was a women who killed thousands of his people, she would care about his wellbeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo little one my names Jenny, what\u2019s yours?\u201d  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even just standing on the sidewalk, watching the enormous cars rumble by, was a reminder of how small they were. They stayed by the bus stop for awhile, hesitant to move. Gulliverians walked by from time to time, their colossal footsteps causing the ground to vibrate beneath them. For the most part, the giants didn\u2019t seem to notice the two Lilliputians and Luke and Jessica quickly realized that they could be flattened by accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, there was a library near the bus stop and they scurried inside.

I thought that he went inside me by now.....Wait.\".Jessica leant her head down toward his messy cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman engulfed  the giant's dirty cock in her mouth  and sucked it off clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's cries doubled when she saw the giant young woman sucking her lover's remains deep down into her throat,not even giving him a decent funeral in this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~ That was like,really delicious!\".Chirsty exclaimed as she wiped off their cum off her lips with her fingers.\"Alright,baby.I'll go to the gym now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica could see Chirsty dressing up in a white,blank tank that showed off her amazing cleavage,Black legging that accentuated her lower body's width to her upper body's and a pair of colorful shoes.<br>\r\nJessica's focus on the beautiful goddess dressing herself was abruptly cut when Alvino's voice passed through her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chirsty,Go get me the tiny woman,will you? I don't think I am as satisfied as you,yet.\" Alvino commanded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh~ You don't wanna keep her around for later? Alright!\".Christy abode as she headed toward the plastic container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,Don't! Please!\".Jessica mindlessly begged the giant,feminine hand as it completely ignored her pleas, wrapped its long,slender fingers around her fragile body and plucked her out from the container.<br>\r\nJessica kept on begging and struggling in Christy's hand as she walked toward her playful boyfriend on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\".Chirsty didn't even bother to hand her to her boyfriend properly .She just dangled her from her legs and let go off her  in the sky with an evil grin on her face as the tiny woman's screamed for her life  before hitting the soft,bouncy  ground that was  quarantined  by Alvino's massive thighs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvino just sneered at Chirsty's minor jealously of his female victim.<br>\r\n\"Your number is still in there?\".He asked the pretty girl.<br>\r\n\"Yea,Don't worry.I won't ever take it off from the board.\".She assured him.\"Besides, I am sure that this bitch won't be alive when I come back later on.So I'll try to seduce Lilliputians  in my gym in coming here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is also a good plan, babe!\". The man leant in a bit toward his girl to give her a kiss of appreciation on her soft lips.\"If we only had special connections to the black market...We wouldn't be struggling this much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,There might be something that we could do about this...\".Christy told him in a low tone,contemplating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\".Alvino demanded an answer from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,There is this lady called Tara in my gym that I just befriended not a while ago.I think she isn't comfortable to mention it to me yet.But Everytime that I'd speak with her,I'd notice  Lilliputians  trapped,struggling  in her bra or pants.I'd even hear her moaning from all the actions that  they'd give her while she is doing some cardio! .\".Chirsty  told the attentive boyfriend. \"So,I'd reckon she might help us if I became close with her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvino's dark face lit a bit at her hopeful idea.\"That is not a bad idea,Babe! Try to mention it today If you managed to catch  up with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChirsty just nodded at her god  and walked out from their love temple ,leaving him and the tiny woman alone at his mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for you,you little cunt...\".Alvino looked down with hunger at the tiny woman corned between his naked,massive legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,mister! please! I don't wanna die!\".Jessica kneed down and worshiped him like the god that he was to her.<br>\r\nBut alas,Alvino was nowhere as kind as she thought he would be,He carelessly just plucked her up from the soft ground and brought her to his dirty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really sexy,you know..\". Alvino's smoke filled breath washed  over her struggling body in his dry palm.\"You look way hotter then my bitch.Fuck, I could consider replacing you with that cunt if I could.that bitch has been getting on my nerves lately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing his words,Jessica was filled with a bit of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!I'll be yours! Fuck my husband!  I want to belong to you! You're much more of man then he could ever be!\".Jessica tried to bargain with her giant captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence took over their atmosphere for seconds  before it was shattered down  by the giant's,manic like laughter.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! My friend, you and me,We are the biggest scums, you know? Degenerates  like us deserve to leave this world in the sickest manner ever imaginable! \".<br>\r\nHe explained to the confused yet terrorized tiny woman in his hand.\"You never know.I might even meet my end at a Brobdingnag  man's hands or a woman's.But for now...You will end at mine....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being said from the giant's mouth,He opened his mouth wide and threw the tiny woman screaming into the dark chasm of his watery cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's screams were silenced when her body fell on the giant's tongue  and bounced off to his molars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,no! No!!!!!!!\".Jessica pleaded at the giant,saliva dripping roof atop of her  as it  dropped  down abruptly on her fragile body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crunch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alvino kept on  savoring the tiny woman in his chewing before sending her down into his stomach, where she will become a part of him forever until he himself becomes a part of someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After some deliberation, Luke and Jessica decided to go with Tara. She listed her occupation as an artist and she had even posted a link to her online gallery, which mostly consisted of breathtaking landscape paintings. Luke sent her an email and they arranged to meet at the library, which seemed like a safe location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Lilliputians were seated near the Reference section when they saw their new roommate stroll in. They immediately recognized her from her photo, a willowy woman with thick, glossy-black hair that came down to the middle of her back. She was wearing a Persian red wrap dress and gold gladiator sandals that showed off her long legs, a slouch handbag slung over one narrow shoulder. Grinning broadly, Jessica stood up on the Gulliverian-sized bench and waved to Tara. The giantess saw her and headed over in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you guys must be Luke and Jessica,\u201d she said, kneeling down in front of the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe sure are,\u201d Luke replied. Tara extended the index finger on her right hand, the wooden bracelets around her slender wrist clacking together loudly. Both of the Lilliputians shook the mammoth digit, which was still splattered with dried paint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d the Gulliverian woman told them. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for new roommates for awhile. So you guys aren\u2019t from around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shook his head and Tara smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my apartment is only a mile or two from here. I can carry you there,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re okay with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica exchanged a brief glance with her husband and then agreed. The Gulliverian opened her purse and then lowered it onto the bench, so that they could climb inside. The idea of actually riding in a house-sized purse was incredible and as they crawled inside, they marveled at the size of Tara\u2019s various items. Her tube of lipstick alone was the size of a torpedo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara\u2019s face filled the opening of the purse, her enormous riverstone-colored eyes peering down at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two alright in there?\u201d She asked. Luke had sat down on her wallet, while Jessica remained standing, still looking around at her surroundings in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. Just getting used to everything,\u201d Luke answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir new roommate laughed. \u201cIt\u2019ll take some getting used to, I\u2019d imagine. Anyway, hang on tight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tara delicately picked up the handbag. Despite her care, the two Lilliputians were still jostled around as she began to walk. They couldn\u2019t see much, since the opening to the purse was high above them, but they could hear street noises as Tara stepped outside. She was right; her apartment was relatively close to the library. Through the opening in the purse, the bright blue sky changed to a dull grayish-white ceiling. Tara\u2019s footsteps echoed loudly as she begin to climb several sets of stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think of her?\u201d Jessica whispered to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe seems pretty nice.\u201d They could hear the Gulliverian inserting a key into a lock; a second later, a door creaked open and the handbag quaked as Tara put it down. The giantess\u2019s hand slipped down into the purse and picked up Jessica first, then Luke. They couldn\u2019t help but notice that she was a bit rough with them, her massive fingers constricting too tightly around their bodies as she took them out and placed them on a small kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is it,\u201d Tara said, indicating the apartment around them. It was tiny and cluttered with all sorts of art supplies. Even the ancient tan couch was piled high with blank canvases and unopened tubes of paint. There were several completed paintings decorating the walls and Jessica began to look at them as Tara announced that she would make some Earl Grey tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be awesome being an artist,\u201d Luke said, trying to make conversation as Tara filled a tea kettle with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it has its pros and cons. It doesn\u2019t always pay well, so I have to supplement my income in other ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike having roommates?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara paused on her way to the stove and then made a weirdly high-pitched giggle. \u201cYeah, like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wasn\u2019t paying much attention to their idle chitchat. Her gaze had moved from a painting of a park in autumn to a more unusual piece. The subject of the painting was a nude woman reclining upon what looked like a gigantic hand. That in itself wasn\u2019t disturbing; the anguished expression on the woman\u2019s pale face was what raised goosebumps on Jessica\u2019s arms. As she continued to study the painting, she saw a black ring around the subject\u2019s neck, with what looked like a belt leading from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d swear that the woman was wearing a collar and leash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuke!\u201d Jessica hissed, elbowing her husband. He stopped chatting and looked over at her, noticing how her face had blanched considerably. She rolled her eyes toward the strange painting, trying to point it out to him. At first, Luke didn\u2019t understand what she was trying to show him. Then, when he noticed the artwork, he swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara saw where they were both looking and she moved closer to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d She asked just as the tea kettle began to whistle, the shrill sound startling the two Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. It\u2019s really well done,\u201d Luke said lamely. The tea kettle continued to whistle but Tara didn\u2019t take it off of the burner. Instead, she leaned down very close to them, an enigmatic grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to see the subject of that painting?\u201d The giantess\u2019 voice was soft and held a hint of malice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica felt her heart thundering in her chest. She started to say no, they didn\u2019t want to see her, but Tara\u2019s hand had already swooped down and closed around them. This time, she squeezed them so hard that she probably left bruises. The world moved violently around them as Tara carried the Lilliputians over to what looked like a closet. But when the giantess opened the door, they saw that it wasn\u2019t a normal closet, filled with things like coats and umbrellas. Instead, shelves had been constructed inside and there were several plastic cages, each containing Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, God,\u201d Jessica whimpered as realization dawned upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeet your new roommates,\u201d Tara said, reaching for one of the cages. Jessica and Luke struggled desperately in her hand. They\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just one glance into Tara\u2019s gray eyes was enough to make Luke and Jessica stop struggling. There was such unfathomable cruelty in those enormous eyes that the two Lilliputians instinctively froze, petrified. Still glaring down at them, the giantess pried the lid off of the cage and dropped them inside. They bounced on the hard plastic floor, Luke crying out in pain when he landed on his shoulder. Tara didn\u2019t seem to notice that he was hurt as she addressed them in a cool, almost detached, voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m sure you guys are wondering what the hell is going on, right? Well, remember when I mentioned the whole supplementing my income thing? I\u2019m a trainer, of sorts. I train you little insects to behave well and then sell you as pets. Believe it or not, but the market is pretty large, especially amongst certain members of Gulliverian society,\u201d she explained, setting the lid beside the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke groaned, rubbing at his shoulder, as Jessica walked up to the clear wall of the cage toward the giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s in your best interest to behave. See, I also have a few clients who enjoy more\u2026extreme\u2026forms of artwork. They commission me to paint the sort of things that you saw hanging on my wall. And the insects that don\u2019t behave are the subjects of those paintings. There was one really rich CEO named Seth who bought a whole series of paintings that depicted Lilliputians being devoured alive. He paid extra for the photographs that proved that the subjects actually were eaten,\u201d Tara continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica felt nauseous listening to this. She pressed her hands up against the cage wall, looking up at their gargantuan captor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTara, you have to let us go. Please,\u201d she begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this straight. You won\u2019t refer to me as \u2018Tara\u2019 again. I am \u2018Mistress\u2019 to you,\u201d the giantess informed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Tara\u2026\u201d Jessica started to argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did I just say?\u201d Tara snapped. Lightning-fast, her colossal hand struck the cage with incredible force, rattling around the Lilliputians like peas in a can. Jessica collided with her husband, their limbs tangling together. It took a moment for them to regain their bearings and when they looked up, they saw the Gulliverian\u2019s huge face contorted with irritation and contempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry\u2026Mistress,\u201d Jessica managed to whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time I\u2019ll crush your head, bug.\u201d Whatever remained of the mask of kindness that Tara had worn earlier was long gone. The true face behind it was terrifying to behold, cruel and calculating. When Jessica didn\u2019t say anything else, the giantess reached down, hiking up her dress to expose white satin panties. She wondered what the Gulliverian was doing as she pulled down her underwear around her thighs; then she saw it. Or rather, him. There was a Lilliputian man strapped to the lining of Tara\u2019s panties, his face florid and his dark hair matted with sweat and other fluids, including his captor\u2019s vaginal secretions. He began to gibber as the giantess untied him, his voice strained and overly eager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you, Mistress. I don\u2019t deserve your kindness.\u201d He sounded completely insane and Jessica cringed as Tara dumped him into the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, insect,\u201d the Gulliverian woman sneered, placing the lid back on the cage. Her eyes met Jessica\u2019s one more time, the promise of violence still present in them, and then she left without another word. As Jessica rushed over to Luke to see if he was injured, she saw the other Lilliputians out of the corner of her eye, looking lost and hopeless. She felt particularly sorry for the insane man. Being strapped to the inside of someone\u2019s underwear, pressed up against their genitals for God knows how long\u2026her mind didn\u2019t want to go there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get out of here before she comes back,\u201d Jessica told the other captives but they just stared back silently. She may as well been trying to tell a flock of chickens that they needed to run before the farmer came back with the ax. That didn\u2019t stop her from trying on her own, though. She ran around the perimeter of the cage, inspected every corner, studied the distance to the top of the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way out,\u201d the man who had been imprisoned in the giantess\u2019 panties said. He now sounded oddly flat, emotionless. A few more glances around the cage confirmed the other prisoner\u2019s words. Defeated, Jessica sat down beside her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, if you listen to what she says,\u201d their fellow prisoner said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t\u2026well, I\u2019ve seen some of her other paintings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica couldn\u2019t help but shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jessica and Luke must have fallen asleep because they were jolted awake by Tara\u2019s presence. The Gulliverian had changed out of her dress and was now wearing a black silk nightgown, the outlines of her nipples apparent through the fabric. One by one, she looked into the cages, inspecting them. Then she came to their cage, her breath fogging the plastic wall as she gazed inside. Jessica shook in terror as the giantess removed the top and reached down, picking up the crazy man from earlier. He didn\u2019t resist as the oak-sized fingers wrapped around him and lifted him from the cage. If anything, he seemed strangely pleased as she held him in one hand, kissing at her colossal fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need one more,\u201d Tara said, hovering over the cage. She reached down for\u2026</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure how long injured \"insects\" lasted with Tara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura screamed. The shriek filling the who cage. \"Noooo. Don't take him away from me.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Jessica asked her husband. They were walking down a lonely road with their backpacks loaded with all their belongings. \u201cMy feet hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost there honey,\u201d Luke said, \u201cthe guy we are rooming with said he\u2019ll pick us up at the edge of town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho did we go with again?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome guy named Derrick Durham. He\u2019s willing to give us a month free rent, which should be enough time for me to find a job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Luke whined, \u201cand what if he is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you always said you wanted to try a threesome.\u201d Jessica smiled wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026a threesome with another girl, not with a dude. Especially not with a dude that\u2019s the size of a skyscraper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neighborhood started to get sparse and barren the further the couple walked. They reached the last leg of the trip which was a road with many warning signs, warning Lilliputians that a Gulliverian road was not too far away. The desert all around them was nondescript: just endless sand, rock, and nothingness. The couple sweat through their clothes as the low lying sun burned their exposed arms and legs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJessica drank the last of her water, and tossed the empty bottle behind her back. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the first Gulliverian we will be meeting will be the same person we are going to be living with.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope he\u2019s cool and nice.\u201d Luke wiped the sweat from his brow. \u201cThe people that post to the roommate finder website have to have a background check, so he\u2019s not like a criminal or anything like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat just means he hasn\u2019t been caught.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope for the best.\u201d Luke stopped when he reached the very edge of the town. The road ceased and there was nothing left but desert. \u201cIf anything, we can look for another roommate to bunk with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked around and saw nothing. \u201cWhen is he going to meet us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe actually got here just in time.\u201d Luke placed a hand in front of his forehead to shield his eyes from the relentless sun. He looked left and right but saw nothing but open land. \u201cWait, I think that\u2019s him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar off in the horizon, a rectangular object contrasted itself from the tan desert. A large mass emerged from the rectangle and began moving faster than an object that size should be moving. The sand in front of the couple started trembling and vibrating. Luke was the first to feel the rumble under his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke motioned to Jessica to put on their headset so that they could talk to Derrick. Jessica was more excited than Luke as she gazed upon the approaching giant. Jessica secretly admired Derrick\u2019s body. He was only wearing shorts and a dirty pair of sneakers. His bronze skin glistened with a thin sheet of sweat as it tanned under the burning sun. His pecs looked like they were sculpted; his abs had faint lines outlining his six-pack. His traps were like soft hills rolling from his neck to his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick stopped in front of the couple. A plum of sand billowed from out under his sneakers as he took his final step. Even Derrick\u2019s calves were sculpted and bulging as he stood in front of the one inch couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou Luke?\u201d Derrick\u2019s deep voice was heard through the headset and felt throughout the Lilliputian\u2019s bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, that\u2019s me. This is my wife, Jessica.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice was shaky as he stood in Derrick\u2019s shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello to the both of you,\u201d Derrick was monotone and almost uninterested. \u201cMy car is over there. You two don\u2019t mind me carrying you over there, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jessica said excitingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick lowered his hands with his palm facing up. Jessica hopped on and with slight hesitation, so did Luke. This wasn\u2019t the first time Derrick interacted with Lilliputians. He felt their almost weightless body in his rough hands. He walked back to his car and let the couple down on the passenger seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk. He simply went through the motions of driving his car home. There were other things on his mind. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The plastic floor underneath Luke and Jessica didn\u2019t offer much grip, so the couple went tumbling backwards when the gigantic car started to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry not to stand up.\u201d A friendly voice said beside them. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to lose your balance when you stand up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the tip,\u201d Jessica said genuinely. She and Luke looked around and noticed they weren\u2019t alone. There were many Lilliputians just like them all around the container. They all had bags on their back and looked as if they were travelling. Moving to Derrick\u2019s home as roommates no doubt. \u201cI thought we were the only roommates Derrick signed on for,\u201d she said to Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess having many Lilly roommates makes sense for Derrick.

I\u2019ve never really seen a Gulliverian until now. It\u2019s going to be interesting being roommates with one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoommates?\u201d Josh asked. \u201cI meant the challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat challenge?\u201d Luke asked a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, the <i>challenge</i>.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosh, what the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Luke asked. \u201cWe signed up to be roommates with Derrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you guys must be the blind volunteers.\u201d Josh said, as if he made some sort of revelation. \u201cGuys like Derrick like to get willing volunteers and not-so-willing <i>volunteers</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke felt his heart thump in his chest. He wasn\u2019t exactly sure what Josh was talking about, but he didn\u2019t like it. \u201cVolunteer for what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe challenge.\u201d Josh said in a matter-of-fact kind of tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica could see Luke about to lose his temper, so she decided to interject before her husband blew up on Josh. \u201cJosh, you need to explain to us what this challenge is, and why we don\u2019t know anything about it. See, my husband and I signed up to be roommates with Derrick, and that\u2019s it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, the challenge is like a cat and mouse game. We are the mouse and Derrick is the cat. If you survive for a week, Derrick will give us the option to <i>be</i> free or continue being the mouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurvive?\u201d Jessica asked. \u201cWhat do you mean survive?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurvive. Live. Not die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill us?\u201d Luke nearly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yea, if he catches you. Try not to get caught.\u201d None of this bothered Josh, but the Lilly couple was visibly trembling. \u201cDon\u2019t look so worried, I survived one of these a couple of months ago. It was super easy. I hope to survive this one too, or at least last a long time. Derrick seems like an alright guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trunk of the car popped open, breaking the Lilly conversation going on in the plastic container. They could hear Derrick unloading something and then shutting the trunk. He jumped back in the driver seat and took off without putting his seatbelt on around his bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, excuse me?\u201d Jessica said over her headset, hoping that Derrick would hear her. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Josh grabbed her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instance Luke shoved Josh with enough force to send him to the ground. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking lay a finger on my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, sorry.\u201d Josh didn\u2019t bother getting up. \u201cI was just going to tell her not to bother talking to Derrick. If you guys thought you were going to be roommates, well that means he tricked you. Remember what I said earlier? He gets both volunteers and non-volunteers for this challenge. More excitement, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was still steaming and getting aggravated over Josh instead of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust stick with me,\u201d Josh grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve survived this thing before with no problem. There are just a few tips and tricks to keep in mind of, and you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d Josh got up to his feet, carefully balancing himself as the gigantic car moved. \u201cWho knows? You might even have fu\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh\u2019s speech was cutoff when three pillars of flesh came down from the sky like a massive crane. He was plucked and pulled towards the sky like a rocket. Derrick didn\u2019t even bother to look at the little Lilliputian he captured. His eyes were on the road in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Josh was screaming. \u201cI was supposed to survive longer. Not now! Put me down! I want to have fun befo\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh\u2019s pleas were muffled from inside Derrick\u2019s mouth. His tiny body was kneaded and lathered in thick saliva. The backpack he had on his back came detached and spilled around the giant\u2019s mouth. Derrick wasn\u2019t gentle with the Lilliputian\u2019s body. He slammed the tiny thing against his molars, inside of his cheek, and the roof of his mouth. If he listened carefully, he could hear the tiny Lilliputian whimpering and crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick swallowed without effort. A tiny bulge appeared to travel downwards inside his muscular throat, before it vanished. Derrick spat out the Lilliputian\u2019s backpack. Little T-shirts and pants rained down from his mouth and some article of clothing landed on his muscular pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica kept repeating \u201coh my god\u201d over and over as she witnessed her acquaintance being eaten so casually. Luke had enough common sense to grab his wife and pull her down towards the plastic floor. Derrick\u2019s hand already invaded the tiny prison and was looking for more to eat. He grabbed a female Lilliputian this time, and just like Josh, popped her screaming form into his mouth. He toyed with the woman more than he did with Josh before swallowing her whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuke, what have we gotten ourselves into?\u201d Jessica was nearly hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour past before Derrick arrived home. During the car ride, Luke and Jessica kept looking at Derrick\u2019s chiseled midsection. They wondered about the fate of Josh and the other woman. They wondered if they were already digested or still struggling to stay alive within the giant\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick grabbed the plastic container and kept it under his arm. He walked around to the trunk of his car and pulled out a yellow school bus, packed with seniors from a Lilliputian high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Luke said as he looked through the clear plastic walls of his prison. \u201cAre those more non-volunteers? What the fuck is wrong with this guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick took his prize to his house and set the bus and plastic container on the ground. He made sure the front door was shut before he acknowledged the Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome all to the Giant Hunger Games.\u201d Derrick raised his hands in the air, giving the Lilliputians a view of traps which gave his body a perfect V shape. \u201cWe are going to have fun this week. By the way, my home is your home. It\u2019s only one floor and completely sealed to keep you Lilly twerps from escaping. If you hide from me well enough, I won\u2019t find you and eat you. IF you suck at hiding, well\u2026\u201d He patted his six-pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teens from the bus started coming out and looking around the new world they were in. It was difficult to process what Derrick was saying because although they\u2019ve heard of this supposed challenge or game, or whatever you want to call it, they always thought it was urban legend. Nobody really believed that Gulliverians went out kidnapping Lilliputians for these sick games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love eating Lilliputians,\u201d Derrick began flexing his arms, showing off his bulging biceps. \u201cThey are jam packed with protein and have made me huge over the last year. I\u2019ve eaten so many of you little fucks to make me huge.\u201d He flexed his pecs and broad back muscles, terrifying the tiny Lilliputians. \u201cSo many of your kind has made me this big. But I want to be bigger. Which means I need to lift more, and eat more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive tent was pitched underneath Derrick\u2019s basketball shorts. He stroked his cock as he looked down at the fifty or so Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going jog for a bit. That should give you all enough time to hide and get settled in. When I come back, I\u2019m going to be hungry. So say goodbye to your friends now because five of you will be here in no time.\u201d He pointed to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick lightly kicked over the plastic container so that the Lilliputians inside spilled out. The deep thuds of his footsteps receded as Derrick headed out the front door for his jog. Luke and Jessica held onto each other and looked at the other frightened Lilliputians. Some were actually excited and maintained a cool head as they ventured deep into Derrick\u2019s house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica had to decide what to do next\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She worked in retail and took some college classes at night when she could afford it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer lived in a studio apartment which consisted of one room and a bathroom. She had a mattress on the floor and one rickety desk she bought from the thrift store. Her room was typically messy with clothes scattered all around. A mini fridge that stood in the corner had expired food and empty wine bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA notification alerted Jennifer of an email. She propped herself up on her mattress with her laptop on her lap. The laptop warmed her bare legs as she clicked open the email. It was a message from the Roommate Finder website. She placed advertisements asking for either Gulliverian or Lilliputian roommates. She didn\u2019t think anyone would actually take up on the offer, especially not a Lilliputian. But there it was: a Lilliputian couple was willing to room with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was unsure how to feel. She did want roommate after all, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have placed the ad. The extra income for hardly doing anything at all was enticing. But a Lilliputian? Would she even be able to see them? As a matter of fact, Jennifer had never seen or talked to a Lilliputian before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians would be so tiny, that Jennifer could keep them in a bottle cap and it would be like a gigantic stadium for the couple. They wouldn\u2019t take up any space in her tiny studio apartment at all. The more she thought of it, the more she liked the idea of having Lilliputian roommates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer wrote an email to Luke, telling him that she was going to pick them up in half an hour from the multi-size coffee shop located in her town. She then closed her ad on the Roommate Finder website. If things worked out with Luke and Jessica, then Jennifer might take in more Lilliputian roommates. Maybe even a Gulliverian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant a coffee while we wait?\u201d Luke asked his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have enough money?\u201d Jessica asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen get me a Caramel Frappuccino.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple ordered and collected their drinks and sat on the plush couches located at the patio. The Lilliputian coffee shop was located in a Gulliverian coffee shop, which was inside a Brobdingnagian coffee shop. This was all in the Brobdingnagian town that was very liberal and catered to expats of different sizes. The smaller coffee shops were on tables and well protected. They had wonderful views looking down and up and the different sized worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransportation consisted of a series of subways and bullet trains that were connected between shops and some people\u2019s houses. For those who could afford it, hover cars were used for transportation\u2014technology originally developed by the Lilliputians. Hover cars existed for Lilliputians and Gulliverians. The tech has yet to come to Brobdingnagian size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the patio, Luke and Jessica could see the interior of the Gulliverian coffee shop clearly. Everyone acted civil and even placed great distance between themselves and the one-inch scaled Lilliputian coffee shop. Outside the Gulliverian windows, Luke could only see blurry movements from the Brobby world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sipping the last bit of his drink, a dark-haired Gulliverian woman came walking up to the Lilly shop. She looked like a Goth-girl and was dressed up in the coffee shop\u2019s uniform. The Gulliverian employee stopped in front of the tiny shop and stood tall above the dozens of Lilliputians enjoying their hot beverages. The coffee shop came up the girl\u2019s hip. She bent slightly, causing her breast to get pulled down by gravity and putting strain on her uniform\u2019s buttons as it barely contained her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone here name Luke and Jessica?\u201d She asked softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the huge Goth girl with huge boobs. She appeared to be just over 400 feet tall. Her black hair swayed like thick steel cables. Just one of her boobs was large enough to cover the entire Lilliputian coffee shop and destroy it with nothing more than its weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica flipped on her headset and spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d She said, standing to her feet and waving. \u201cRight here! Do you see us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see you.\u201d The Goth girl said. The coffee shop\u2019s logo was a cartoony coffee bean with a happy face on it. The logo was stamped on the employee\u2019s blouse right over the chest area. Luke watched as the logo was stretched and contorted thanks to the goth girl\u2019s huge boobs. \u201cSome Brobby chick says she\u2019s meeting you guys here?\u201d The girl sounded really confused, and with good reason. Brobdingnagians hardly ever talked to Lilliputians, let alone meet them in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas her name Jennifer by any chance?\u201d Jessica asked. She was completely comfortable speaking with a 400 foot tall girl who could crush her with hardly any effort. Luke swallowed the drool that was accumulating in his mouth as he looked up at the pretty giantess. Maybe they should have gone with a Gulliverian roommate? But then he thought what Jennifer might look like. She would make the Goth girl look like she was one inch tall, but what would that make him look like to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, that\u2019s her name.\u201d The Goth girl interrupted Luke\u2019s train of thoughts. \u201cWant me to take you guys to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you?\u201d Jessica asked with a smile. \u201cThat would be so kind of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Lilliputians in the coffee shop looked at the curios scene as the Goth girl lowered a hand in front of the exposed patio. Luke and Jessica grabbed their bags and climbed aboard the pale hand. Luke was amazed at the feeling of the giantess\u2019s hand. It was like stepping on a gym mat. Her thumb was just as big as he was tall. He could also smell the faint smell of grinded coffee beans on the girl\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goth girl walked across the Gulliverian coffee shop and out to a patio, similar the Lilliputian one. She had her headset on and transmitting. The world expanded again for Luke and Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found them, ma\u2019am.\u201d The Goth girl said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica looked out trying to take a look at Jennifer, but some honey-colored wall was blocking their view. They looked back at the Goth girl and saw that she was looking straight up. They looked in the direction the Goth girl was looking and finally figured out where Jennifer was. The honey-colored wall was actually Jennifer\u2019s exposed midriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Her voice came over the headset as angelic and soft. Jennifer lowered her body so that her eyes were level with the patio. It was a dizzying movement for Luke and Jessica. More details in the Brobby world were coming into focus for them. They could see Jennifer\u2019s gigantic blue eyes come into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke thought the Goth girl was too big and that even her breasts were intimidating. At 400 feet tall, the Goth girl seemed like an unstoppable force. But here was Jennifer. Just one of her eyes was as big as the Goth girl. Jennifer didn\u2019t look like a six mile tall giantess. She seemed otherworldly like a demi goddess\u2014or just plain out goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had sandy blonde hair cut short to about shoulder length. She wore an athletic tank top that barely reached her belly button. She also wore short shorts and running shoes. She looked sweet, youthful, and just like an overall nice person. But that was just how she looked. The couple would eventually get to know her and see what she\u2019s really like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here, on my hand.\u201d The Goth girl answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jennifer, we can see you.\u201d Jessica laughed to herself. \u201cCan\u2019t you see us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer squinted her eyes and moved her face closer to the Goth girl. \u201cI think I see you guys.\u201d Jennifer could see two little dots on the one-inch Goth girl\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you two. I bought this Lilly carrier before coming here. This will make it safe for me to carry you two.\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gulliverians in the coffee shop were looking at the peculiar scene. What could a Brobby possibly have anything to do with a Lilly? The carrier looked like it was a necklace with a small box connected to the end of a chain. It was about the size of an eraser at the end of a pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer held the carrier close to the one-inch Goth girl. The Gulliverian opened the box with a free hand and gently let the Lilly couple inside. Luke and Jessica felt like they were inside a mansion; a very plain mansion with several floors of stadium style seating. They tossed their bags between the rows of seating and sat in one of the seats before strapping themselves in. The Lilly carrier had many windows all around, so Luke and Jessica had a good view of the outside. The Goth girl closed the Lilly carrier and stood back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re strapped in Jennifer.\u201d Jessica said excitingly like she was about to go on a rollercoaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer lifted the carrier to her eyes. It was like a rollercoaster for the Lilly couple. \u201cDon\u2019t worry little ones.\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cYou\u2019re in good hands.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She let her purse slide off her arm and let it drop to her feet. She went over to her small desk and gently lowered the Lilly Carrier a couple of inches from the ledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you guys still there?\u201d Jennifer asked. \u201cWant to come out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes. Uhm, we\u2019re still here Jennifer.\u201d Luke said with hesitation. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s alright for us to come out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is.\u201d Both Jessica and Jennifer said at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was the first to unbuckle from her seat. She grabbed Luke\u2019s hand and yanked on it while he fumbled with his own seat restraints. Stepping out of the Lilly Carrier was like stepping through a portal into a new world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grain wood pattern on the desk was indistinguishable to the Lilly couple; the ground appeared flat in the distance, yet bumpy and full of potholes under their tiny feet. The deep brown colors changed hues every 50 feet in long swaths of thick lines. The air was thick and smelled of old wood and girly perfume. The temperature and humidity was similar to that of a bathroom after a steamy shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Jessica said breathlessly as she took in the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you guys come out?\u201d Jennifer asked. As she did, gale force winds washed over the Lilly couple and pushed them back a few steps. Jennifer\u2019s feminine voice came over clearly to the headsets the Lilly couple was wearing. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to come out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are out,\u201d Luke managed to say. He was still uneasy about his surroundings\u2014and Jennifer. \u201cCan you see us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer\u2019s 300 feet wide blue eyes came down from the sky. Luke let out a startled gasp as he witnessed the 6 mile tall Jennifer lowering her pretty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wait. I think I see you guys.\u201d Jennifer smiled. \u201cDamn that\u2019s tiny.\u201d She placed her right hand a few inches away from the Lilly Carrier and the couple. She then lowered her face even more, taking care not to breathe on top of the micro couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke wiped sweat from his forehead. Just one of Jennifer\u2019s fingers was as long as the tallest Lilliputian skyscrapers. \u201cWe\u2019re not tiny.\u201d Luke heard himself say. \u201cYou\u2019re just\u2026big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019re both right,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cOkay guys,\u201d Jennifer got up from the desk and stood up straight. A defined camel toe formed in her black short shorts and was directly in front of the Lilly couple. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to live in the Lilly carrier until I buy proper accommodations for you two. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will work Jen,\u201d Jessica shouted into the earpiece happily. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room for us to stretch around and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it, Jessie. It\u2019s Jessie, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessica or just Jess.\u201d Jessica maintained a warm tone and was speaking with Jennifer as if they\u2019ve been friends for years already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry Jess. Well anyway, I finished a run before picking you guys up, so I\u2019m going to hop in a bath. Feel free to roam around and explore. I\u2019ll be out in a few.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer spun around as soon as she was finished speaking, giving the Lilly couple an epic view of her round ass. Luke\u2019s mouth was open and salivating as he watched Jennifer\u2019s graceful six mile tall body move. Jessica saw all this and had ideas running in her head. Her kinkiness trait was kicking in and craving for some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s join her,\u201d Jessica told Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Are you kidding me? She\u2019s way too big. She\u2019ll crush us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on honey, are you telling me you don\u2019t want to take a bath with a beautiful giant girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke didn\u2019t need much time to think about it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luke was a little afraid, Luke looked at Jessica and saw no sign of fear on her face, Instead she was smiling, Luke didn\u2019t know how Jessica could be so fearless especially towards a brobdingnagian who was powerful enough to kill them with nothing but her breath, powerful enough to destroy a Lilliputian city with nothing but her pinky finger or toe, powerful enough to drown them with nothing but the smallest drop of  saliva, From her planet size mouth, but Luke hoped that bravery wouldn\u2019t get them both killed. <br>\r\nJennifer turned around and looked at the small specks that where Luke and Jessica and smiled  awkwardly. <br>\r\n\u201cI guess I have no problem with taking a bath with the two of you, but are you sure Jess, it could be  dangerous.\u201d Jennifer asked walking towards her small desk and bent down so she could get a better look at Luke and Jessica. <br>\r\nLuke and Jessica could feel and hear the loud booms that Jennifer\u2019s foot created as she walked towards them with a body that was beyond both of their compression, and before they both new it they where staring up at a 300 ft eye that was staring right back at them.<br>\r\n\u201cAw don\u2019t worry girl, we totally trust you\u201d Jessica said with a  energetic voice <br>\r\nJennifer at that moment was touched by the trust that Jessica and Luke had in her, and had a great deal of respect for both Luke and Jessica, they where barley visible to her and yet here they where wanting to take a bath with her, even though they could both die. \u201cOk, how about the both of you get into the Lilly carrier, and I\u2019ll carry you both to the bathroom\u201d Jennifer said.<br>\r\nJessica pulling Luke by the arm ran into the Lilly carrier, Jessica couldn\u2019t wait for the fun and pleasure that both her and Luke where about  to have. Pleasure that not many Lilliputians had ever experienced in their lives.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you guys in the Carrier? Jennifer asked. <br>\r\n\u201c yes we are both in\u201d Jessica said into her headset. <br>\r\nhearing Jessica, Jennifer lifted the tiny speck sized carrier and walked into the bathrooms. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to place you guys on the sink, you can both can take your close off their.\u201d Jennifer said. <br>\r\nJennifer carefully placed the Lilly carrier on the sink and watched as two smaller specs  walked outside the bigger specked sized carrier. <br>\r\nJessica and Luke exited the carrier and they both found themselves on a white plain, they knew that they where on Jennifer\u2019s sink but that sink was big enough to hold a entire Lilliputian city maybe even a country. Both Jessica and Luke could barley see the edge of the sink and yet it barley came up to Jennifer\u2019s fine toned belly. Luke looked at Jessica and saw her start to strip off her close and followed suit, Luke glanced at Jennifer and saw that she was also taking off her close. Jennifer started with her top, taking it off and throwing it on the floor, revealing meteor sized Breasts that could easily destroy cities and permantly change the landscape of lilliput forever, then she took of her long pants revealing her white underwear, which dwarfed mountains and skyscrapers. Then Jennifer took of her white pantys to reveal her moon size bare butt and a pussy that could swallow thousands of cities and still be hungry for more. Luke could feel a huge gust of air that would  constantly make him take a step back, and he realized that, that gust of air came from Jennifer taking off her close and throwing them of the floor, a simple and normal act to Jennifer was able to produce hurricane force winds for Luke. Luke then saw Jennifer\u2019s pubic hair that surrounded her pussy and new that a single  Strand could easily kill thousands of Lilliputians, and their where thousands of these pubic hair that where surrounding her pussy, pubic hair that was stronger than steal and could tear apart skyscrapers. Jennifer was a goddess to Luke and Jessica. <br>\r\nJennifer still couldn\u2019t believe that she was doing this, she didn\u2019t know why she was so nervous, especially towards Lilliputians she could barley see. As she took off her close she couldn\u2019t help but think that she was giving Jessica and Luke that biggest show of their lives,she looked at her breast and imagined Luke and Jessica on her nipple, a nipple that dwarfed their tallest skyscraper, a nipple that could support a whole Lilliputian city, two Lilliputian standing on her nipple would have a lot of room, this thought alone gave her shivers. Jennifer looked at her pussy and imagines Luke and Jessica on her clitoris that dwarfed them both. Jennifer shook her head why was she thinking these things, she couldn\u2019t be turned on by Jessica and Luke, could she, never once in her life did she ever think about doing anything sexual to any of the tiny races especially to a Lilliputian that where so small that they would drawn in the smallest ounce of her pussy juices. Jennifer decided to put such thoughts out of her mind, and walked over to the bath tub to turn on the Faucet<br>\r\nLuck and Jessica where completely naked and watched Jennifer walk over to the tub with seismic foot falling quakes and turned on the faucet. Luke and Jessica could hear gallons of water start to fill up the bathtub, neither of them could imagine how much water was being used in the bathtub, more water than any lake or even ocean in Iillput. Jennifer field up the bathtub with warm soupy water and walked back toward the sink to check on Jessica and Luke. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you both ready\u201d Jennifer asked with the same soft tone ( but Luke thought he heard a little excitement in jennifers voice). <br>\r\n\u201cOh we were born ready!\u201d Jennifer yelles into the head set that cause Jennifer to giggle a little bit. <br>\r\n\u201c how about you Luke?\u201d Jennifer asked looking at the speck she knew to me Luke <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready too\u201d Luke said with a smile.<br>\r\n\u201cOk how about you guys get on my nail.\u201d Jennifer said  extending  Her nail to both of the Lilliputians. Jennifer\u2019s nail dwarfed both Luke and Jessica, and with much difficulty, Luke and Jessica were able to climb her nail. Luke was on all fours breathing hard.<br>\r\n\u201cOk we\u2019re on\u201d. Jessica said tired as well  <br>\r\nJennifer hearing Jessica stood up strait and walked towards the bathtub. To the two Lilliputians on the nail of a brondingnagian it was like they where in a car going 100 miles per hour. Luke and Jessica couldn\u2019t believe how fast they where going, their lives where in the hand of Jennifer, if Jennifer wasn\u2019t careful then with just a twitch of her finger both Luke and Jessica would go flying to their deaths. Soon the bath tub came into view, Luke and Jessica where surprised, this bathtub, bigger than anything built by a lilliputaian was field with gallons of water, deeper than any ocean, and it was nothing but a bath to a giant like Jennifer.<br>\r\n\u201c hey whats that\u201d. Jessica asks pointing to something floating in the middle of the bathtub.<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be for you two.\u201d jennifer said into the headset, bending down slowly so that both Luke and Jessica could get a better look. <br>\r\n\u201cIt is a boat for the both of you, what do you both think.\u201d Jennifer asked<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful you bought this for us.\u201d Luke said into his head set. <br>\r\n\u201cYep now you guys will be pretty safe\u201d Jennifer said putting them on the boat. <br>\r\n\u201cHang on im coming in.\u201d Jennifer said. Luke and Jessica saw jennifer stand up straight, and couldn\u2019t even see her face anymore, it was blocked off by her gigantic boobs. Jennifer stood straight up and kept her eyes on the two speck sized people on the small boat. What did she look like to Jessica and Luke. She put her right leg in the water, she saw the tiny boat violently rock back and forth by the tiny (to her) waves she was creating, she saw the two specks that where Luke and Jessica tumble and fall. She couldn\u2019t help but giggle. She continued to get in, putting her left leg in as well, the waves kept on getting more violent, Jennifer could hear the screams of Luke and Jessica coming from her headset, she smiled. Jennifer slowly sat down in the warm soupy water and watched as tiny (to her) drops of water fell off her body and headed toward the boat threatening to sink it.<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica saw jennifer put her right leg in and waves big enough to destroy whole entire cities crashed in to the boat. Luke and Jessica went flying,falling on top of each other and running into things, and this was only one foot. Then came the other foot.Waves bigger than 100 ft threatened to destroy the boat. Luke and jessica would have drowned if they didn\u2019t hold on to the side of the boat. Luke saw that both of Jennifer\u2019s legs where in the bath, he looked up and still couldn\u2019t see her face (the steam of the bath hiding it from view).Then it happened Jennifer started to sit down, slowly but surely her apocalyptic rear started to descend  as soon as it hit the water meteor size drops of water and raging waves started to target the ship. To Luke and Jessica it seemed like the end of the world. A loud \u201cBOOM!\u201d Shook the boat more violently than any wave had before and the shock wave made both Luke and Jessica rise off the boat a couple feet in the air and slammed them back on the deck. Luke getting up noticed that the boat had gotten dark, Luke and Jessica looked up and saw Jennifer\u2019s moon size hand covering the boat. <br>\r\nJennifer seeing huge drops of water heading toward the boat, put her hand over it in a protective way to protect it from sinking <br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that are you guys ok\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unreal, this whole situation was totally unreal to people like Luke and Jessica, especially Luke. In this one situation they had almost died, and by what you may ask, by gigantic rain drops that had enough power to put Noah\u2019s flood to shame. Rain drops that where nothing to Jennifer, just little drops of water. If Jennifer hadn\u2019t protected both Luke and Jessica with her left hand, that completely covered the whole sky with a her skin, then they both would have met their ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that are you guys ok?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer retracts her left hand and carefully leans in towards the microscopic boat floating in her foamy bath water. She could barley make out two little dots that she knew to be both Luke and Jessica. \u201cI hope they are ok.\u201d Jennifer thought, worried for a little campions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica could feel the vibrations in the water as Jennifer spoke to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Jennifer we are alright.\u201d Jessica said waving her right hand up at her titanic friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god they where alright.\u201d Jessica thought taking a deep breath of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke could feel the wind, from Jennifer\u2019s breath. Looking out into the distance of bath water , beyond the deep and powerful steam and the soap covered hills that looked like drifting islands to ones as small as Luke and Jessica, Luke saw something surrounding the boat. What ever it was, was miles away and huge. It towered over the whole entire boat easily. Squinting his eyes Luke could have sworn that what he was looking at was a cliff face 100s of miles tall but upon further examination, Luke knew that he was wrong, oh so wrong. What he was looking at was Jennifer\u2019s left leg, or at least the half that was above the water. Jennifer\u2019s legs being bent meant that neither Luke or Jessica could see the top of her knee. Luke looked to the right of the boat and to the left of the boat, Jennifer\u2019s legs surrounded them in all directions. So in other words the boat rested  in-between Jennifer\u2019s mighty legs. What a women. Luke thought getting a little turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you guys want to do.\u201d Jennifer said looking down at Luke and Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c we don\u2019t know, what did you have in mind?\u201d Luke said into his headphones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica thought for a little while, and then suddenly she had a idea that she believed would be fun for Luke, Jessica and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about as a apology for scaring you two, you guys can explore my boobs. Jennifer said with a sexy smile, looking down at her little friends <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer knew that Jessica and Luke wouldn\u2019t turn this offer down. Why would they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh girl you took the words right at of my mouth! Jessica yelled into her headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wanted this more than anything, and what made it better was that she was going to be climbing these mountains with the man she loved, who by the way had a huge boner and had drool falling from his mouth. Jessica looked North of their current location and she saw boobs bigger than any island in Lilliput. Boobs that could not be contained or hidden by the all encompassing bath water. The bath water only came up to half of Jennifer\u2019s nipple, leaving the other half completely exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer  carefully puts her right hand under the water, and moves it under the teeny tiny boat that floated a few inches away from her. She gently picks up the boat, that held both Luke and Jessica and puts the boat right in front of her right nipple, that complete toward over it with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and like didn\u2019t expect Jennifer to lift the boat so suddenly. Jennifer moved the boat as slowly as she could but that still didn\u2019t stop luke and Jessica from experiencing G-force as the where moved towards Jennifer\u2019s nipple. Jessica and luke where in their knees clinging to the side of the boat, and as soon as it came the all consuming pressure had vanished from both of their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that I just wanted to move you guys closer to me.\u201d Jennifer said from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica get on their feet and see something massive and pink in front of them. Jessica could tell what it was with a first glance, she made that abundantly clear as she let out a little excited squeal, and began to clap her hands. Luke looked at her a little confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think this is?\u201d Jessica said walking over to humongous pink monolith, putting her right hand on it and rubbing it counter clock wise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d Luke said looking at the pink wall with his right hand stroking his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on think about it, it\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d Jessica said with a mischievous smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer could hear everything going on as she looked down at the little specks close to her nipple. She was curious as well, when it came to what Jessica was referring to. (She didn\u2019t know Jessica was talking about her nipple, nor could she feel Jessica stroking it.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke put on his thinking face as he looked at the giant pink wall. Then it came to him, Luke began to blush, which told Jessica that he had finally figured it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this Jennifer\u2019s nipple!!!!\u201d Luke yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDing, ding, ding we have a winner.\u201d Jessica said laughing at Luke\u2019s reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike looked at the pink wall that was Jennifer\u2019s nipple, Luke glanced up and was amazed, amazed that he could barley see the top. (Remember that Jennifer\u2019s nipple his half way underwater.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stopped stroking Jennifer\u2019s nipple as she felt the whole thing shake violently. If both Jessica and Luke could see Jennifer\u2019s face they would see her blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he just say my nipple?\u201d Jennifer thought getting more and more excited as she thought about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are looking at my nipple.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer takes a close look at Jessica  and Luke and the boat that they were standing on. Her right nipple completely dwarfed everything. How powerful was she when it came to these finite creatures, these Lilliputians. She was a force of nature to them, what could they do to one such as her. Jennifer starts to finger her self with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Luke fill vibrations in the water that keep getting stronger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jennifer are you ok, everything is shaking.\u201d Jessica asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer hears Jessica\u2019s voice in her headset and stops master bating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ok, you guys ready to go exploring?\u201d Jennifer\u2019s asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yea we are.\u201d Jessica said grabbing Luke\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer could help but let out a little giggle. Their whole world was shaking just from her master bating, and Jennifer wasn\u2019t even going all out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you guys want to do this? You guys want me to carry you to the top?\u201d Jennifer asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you kidding we\u2019re going to climb.\u201d Like said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was shaking from excitement, two Lilliputians where going to clip me her nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica use Jennifer\u2019s pores to aid them in Their climb. Their hands fit perfectly in he nipple pores with room to spare. Jennifer\u2019s nipple was as hard as steel, so if it wasn\u2019t for her pores Luke and Jessica would never be able to climb Jennifer\u2019s enormous body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Luke and Jessica about a hour to reach the top of Jessica\u2019s nipple. If her nipple was half submerged in water, and if Luke and Jessica weren\u2019t in such good shape, their climb would have taken longer. Even though it took a long time Jennifer was patient p. She was actually having fun, but still did everything in her power not to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the top Luke and Jessica were out of breath, and had their hands on their knees in exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are amazing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica feel the ground beneath their feet rumble, and they both fall on their butts. Luke looks up and sees a huge hill of titty flesh that completely surrounded his and Jessica surroundings like a tan dessert, and right above that desert was a humongous blue eye staring right at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what should we do next?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthors notes <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope you like the story so far. Plz add on to it, it has a lot of  potential. Thank you.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDon't you think that would be a bit weird?\u201d Luke asked his wife. \u201cWe barely met her and you already want to take a bath with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on...why did we come to Brobdingnag if we aren't going to have fun?\u201d Jessica whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm all for fun! Don't get me wrong, I would love to jump in the bath with Jennifer and play with her hot, miles-long body, but I think we need to make friends with her first, make sure she's cool, and then test the waters and see if she's the kind of person that would like to have fun with helpless Lilliputians such as ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArgh, I don't want to wait!\u201d Jessica looked over to the closed bathroom door. She could hear torrential water filling Jennifer's bath. Luke walked behind his wife and placed his hands on her hip. He leaned his face over to his wife's neck and gave her a sensual kiss. \u201cI'm horny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d He said. \u201cWe should fuck before Jennifer's finished. That way we don't make any rash decision, fueled by our lust, that could get us killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's so big...\u201d Jessica trailed off. \u201cShe could probably stick an entire skyscraper into her pussy with thousands of Lilliputians inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be so awesome to be in her while we make love.\u201d Luke undid his pants and let his erection spring free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's legs were getting weak as she pictured Jennifer's power over her and her husband. She took off her shorts and soaking wet panties in one go. She got on her knees and presented her backside to her husband. Luke didn't hesitate, he got down behind his wife and let his throbbing erection enter her oven hot pussy. They proceeded to make love with loud moans and groans. It was incredibly surreal to be making love on a desk that was the size of city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't wait to this with Jennifer,\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would we do it with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn her breasts. I want you to fuck me on her nipple.\u201d Jessica moaned as Luke's thrusts increased in speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputian couple swapped through various positions as they continued to make passionate love. They fantasized about the different things they wanted to do with Jennifer. They eventually climaxed together with ear-piercing orgasms that seemed to last several breaths. Luke collapsed on top of his wife and embraced her. Their legs were soaked with love juice, their skins glistened with sweat, and their breaths were strained. It was possibly the best love making session they ever had together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jennifer was lying back in her bath \u2013 with her earpiece still on. Luke and Jessica never shut off their headset. Everything they said was transmitted to Jennifer's earpiece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had one hand playing with her clit and the other hand groping her breast. She was startled at first when she heard her new Lilliputian roommates talking about her when she left them alone. She was going to turn off the headset to give the couple their privacy, but the conversation was so intriguing to Jennifer that she decided to listen in on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever had she thought about interacting with Lilliputians in a sexual way...until she heard Luke and Jessica talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking a Lilliputian skyscraper inside her? With little people still inside? Jennifer held back a moan. She didn't want her roommates to hear her. Jennifer's legs twitched as she came to a powerful orgasm. She almost felt ashamed that two Lilliputian specks could give her so much pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's ended her bath and got out of the bath slowly, careful not to fall over due to her weak legs. She reached over to grab her towel but discovered her towel was missing. Her clean towel was in her main room, probably on the floor underneath her desk. A thought popped into Jennifer's head. Maybe there was a way to give her new roommates a thrill and show off how easy-going she could be at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer exited her bathroom in the nude, dripping water everywhere. Luke and Jessica felt the tremors caused by Jennifer's footfalls before they saw her. When they did see her, both their jaws dropped. Like a mythical goddess, they witnessed Jennifer's six-mile curvaceous body strut right towards them. Drops of water that could fill a water tower cascaded across her attractive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica quickly clothed themselves, although it was highly unlikely that Jennifer could see their nude bodies with the unaided eye. Luke's erection returned and for a moment he considered letting it hang out in the open; he eventually tucked his engorged member within the confines of his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wasn't sure if she was feeling lust or envy. She adored what she saw in Jennifer. Aside from her smoking body, their was a cool, confident attitude exuding from Jennifer as she took heavy steps towards them. More water droplets bounced off her curves and soaked the bedroom floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputian couple looked up stupefied as two orbs larger than moon descended upon them. What they saw defied all reasoning. An incredible amount of mass made up Jennifer's breasts. It amazed the Lilliputian couple that so much mass could make up...anything \u2013 let alone gigantic tits. The area around them got dark as the Brobdingnagian flesh got closer. Luke and Jessica threw up their hands reflexively as if they could possibly stop the boobs from crushing them. Luke was speechless, unable to tell his mouth to speak words of distress as his life flashed in front of his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLakes formed around them as water fell from Jennifer's tits. Jessica was staring at the moon-sized orbs like a fat kid stares at cake. She saw a drop of water fall from Jennifer's left nipple and land about a football field distance away from them. It was enough to break Jessica from her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJennifer! Careful, we're down here!\u201d She screamed without first checking whether her earpiece was on or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiled to herself. She knew exactly what she was doing and she was being careful first and foremost. She was bent over with her breast over the dot (that was the Lilliputian couple) and reached a hand underneath the desk to grab her towel. Once the towel was in her hand, she straightened back up while looking at her roommates. She changed her expression to one that was concerned with a tiny hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, did I scare you guys?\u201d Jennifer let out a natural smile. \u201cI knew you were down there, I was just reaching for my towel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke swallowed. He wasn't looking up at Jennifer. He was looking straight ahead at the giantess\u2019s pussy. Jennifer wasn't completely natural with her pubic hair; Luke could tell that she did manicure herself down there, even so, she had a literal forest of hair above her slit. He wanted nothing more but to explore that forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was soaking in Jennifer as much as she could. Her eyes could not get enough of the exotic and delicious body in front of her. Thousands of possibilities ran through her head. She really hoped that Jennifer was the type of person that would be open to Lilliputian play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot, sorry about this guys,\u201d Jennifer wrapped the towel around her body, hiding her breasts and pussy. \u201cI usually walk around my room naked and it slipped my mind that maybe you didn't want to see me in my birthday suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don't mind,\u201d both the Lilliputian couple said like robots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Jennifer feigned. \u201cYou really don't mind if I walk around naked. It must be weird for you guys though, I mean, I am little bigger than you two.\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you don't mind me walking around naked,\u201d Luke heard himself say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame with me,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI totally get it Jen. I like to walk around naked too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI go nude in my room only before and after a shower.\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cFor the most part at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer got dressed in a super short cotton shorts and loose t-shirt which barely made it to her naval. Her hair remained damp from her bath, as she decided to let it air dry. She knelt by her desk to address her roommates. She felt her heart flutter as the realization of just how much power she had over her roommates. She could easily let out a little blow of air and that would be the end of Luke and Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't have anything planned for today.\u201d Jennifer said softly. \u201cI usually get on my laptop to read before I go to bed. If you get hungry or need anything let me know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica had some ideas on what to do next.</span></div></div>",

She felt a pang of regret that she hadn't gotten Gulliverarians. They would still be in thrall to her but they would feel more real. The tiny dots she had required a lot of imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she said, coldly. Her hair moved and Luke and Jessica felt the wind blow over them even from this distance. Her voice was immence and hard to even understand, and her face was so high up it was hard to see but the change in tone was hard to miss. The couple suddenly felt very afraid.

It was her daily ritual before heading to bed to give it a quick peek through for any big news that might of leaked onto someones wall. However, it would seem that today wasn't' going to be that kind of day. In fact it seemed like nothing much at all was going on. She closed out of her MyFace account hitting her bookmarks and checking out a little ad she had put out looking for roommates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor had never been the most popular girl in the world, she was simply to shy to ever put herself out in the lime light like that. However, a small part of her always wanted to feel that, to feel respected, important, wanted. While she was shy around other people he size she found that this was less of a problem when it came to those smaller then herself. It was hard to find that in her day to day life of course being all of 5'5 she wasn't looking down on to many of her classmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had, had a amazing idea though. She would just offer up her room free of charge to Lills! It seemed simple enough for her. She'd get some tiny new friends that she could feel confident around and they would get to live the easy life. Taylor wasn't worried about her parents finding out they would be so small after all it would be like taking care of a flea. She'd be able to keep them a secret no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was getting someone who was actually willing to do this. After all She was a Brob and a Lill was so small most would be scared away at the though of living with one. Even so she would check back in on her ad to see if anyone responded though no one ever did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat changed today though as she spotted a single email in her inbox. A smile spread across her face as she opened it up and read it over and over again. Someone was interested in her offer and not just one someone, but two! An adorable little couple just added a little cherry on top of it all. A part of her couldn't help, but wounder why a Lill coup would want to basically become the property of a fifteen year old girl, but she quickly put it out of her mind as she started to type a response back.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily accepted them saying they could move in first thing tomorrow. The only thing she had to do was decide where they were going to meet. Should she try someone where casual? A coffee shop maybe? Or something a bit more fun and show them a good time at the beach? </span></div></div>",

Even if said roommate wasn't even old enough to drive on her own yet. It took a fair bit of convincing for Jessica to convince Luke that this wasn't in fact a bad idea. He had more then a few worries about living with a titanic teen, but she as always was her confident self. In fact she pushed for Taylor over a few other possible Brobs that were also offering up some space. She felt even though this girl was miles tall she was still a kid and she would be able to control her since she was only 15. Luck wasn't so sure about that sighting that Jessica wasn't the most well behaved girl when they were teens, but she brushed this off. In the end she sighted the biggest benefit which was that it was rent free. They wouldn't have to pay this girl a cent to live with her and she was offering food as well. All in all it would mean Luke and Jessica wouldn't have to work at all and instead could treat this as a very long vacation, one that would take place completely in a girls bedroom, but a vacation none the less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jessica enjoyed the Lill sized beach which was in fact not a real beach at all. It was simply a large sandbox with a small body of water acting as the ocean. This small sandbox beach of course sat in the larger beach area of the Gull's beach. This beach was built the same as their Lill counterparts with their beach sitting on the true Brob beach. While there was little difference between the beaches due to their own beach being massive to the Lills there was one draw back. It could be hard at times to get a tan due to the towering Gulls that would walk by blocking out the sun for countless Lills or even worse a Brob utterly blotting out the light for the entire beach. While this bothered some for Luke at least it was a fine trade off to see some of the heavily bodies that blocked his view of the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Luke found himself utterly distracted by massive women moving around the beach and the distance bodies laying out to tan, Jessica wasn't. She was paying attention to the time and she was finding herself slightly annoyed that Taylor was running late. In fact she was running very late which got on her nerves a bit, it didn't matter if this girl was 5 miles tall or 5 thousand she was older then her and so should be a bit more respectful and do things like show up when she said. Jessica looked down at the time once more and then over to Luke. Maybe it was time to be a bit more active with this. Taylor was just a kid she probably got distracted or something so they would need to go out and find her. The two had a picture of her from her profile so with a bit of searching she was sure they would be able to spot her. The only problem with that plan was they would have to move out of the safety of the Lill's beach to the Gulls and finally crossing over into the Brob beach. This would be beyond dangerous, but Jessica was tried of waiting.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

The wait to be picked up is around thirty minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAwesome\u201d an excited Jessica says, \u201cInstead of having sex in public for free, and risking jail time, we will be getting paid for it. I have to admit, having sex before giant things is arousing as hell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI know, it is one of our many fantasies that we talk about, as we make love to each other,\u201d Luke says with a horny voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They sent the required information to that email address, and four minutes later, they are accepted. The email with the letter of acceptance reads, \u201cCongratulations, you both are now in the program. In about thirty minutes, several large wooden crates will arrive on the back of a large 18-wheeler truck to pick you both up. Please enter the create, and be seated. There will be other couples and singles inside as well. Families are located in another crate; please do not enter those crates. When the truck arrives, please remove all of your clothing, and enter the couples, and singles crate. Be seated, your fellow crate mates will be naked as the day they were born too. Please do not bring anything with you. Before the truck arrives, please take a good shower. Unpleasant body odors will lead to you both being removed from the program. Again, congratulations, and we hope you both have some kinky fun.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They follow the letters instructions, and take a nice shower. After they dry themselves off, they do not bother to get dressed again. However, the couple does comb their hair in preparation of the event. The 18-wheeler truck finally arrives, and the tiny nude couple bravely enters the couple\u2019s wooden crate together, while holding hands. They both look around to see several dozen other attractive couples, and even a few single people sitting around naked. The truck takes off, and drives down to a local harbor, where a Lilliputian cargo ship is waiting. After all the crates are loaded on the ship, it sails off to meet an even bigger Gulliverain boat waiting near the Lilliputian/Gulliverain sea boarder. All of the crates are now transferred, and the Gulliverain boat heads for its homeland. At this point, what happens when they finally arrive at their destination?     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eighteen-year-old Luke has a nice, well-toned body. He has short, well trimmed, lit-brown hair, blue eyes, and he is clean-shaven, with a young looking face. He is well hung, with a nice ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eighteen-year-old Jessica has a lovely, well-defined body. She has long, strawberry blond hair, sexy, greenish, cat like eyes, and she too has a young looking face. She has perky, natural, cantaloupe size breasts, a well-trimmed pussy, and a fantastic ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both have smooth, lightly tanned skin.</span></div></div>",

Luke asks Jessica, \u201cYou know, we could save ourselves a lot of walking, and just mail ourselves to some random person from the Gulliverian homeland. The mail usually takes less than a day to reach there, and the trip would be fun. The both of us would be completely naked, making love most of the time, and sooner or later some horny giant will open their mail, and find two naked horny people inside, humping away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jessica smiles, liking his idea, but worries about the basics, keeping clean, going to the bathroom, food, water, etc. She knows that the last thing a giant will want is two smelly pets. She brings up her concerns, and she discovers that Luke has already thought of these problems. Luke already created a legal, Gulliverian size box to be mailed off, complete with proper postage. Inside this large box are a temporary water storage unit, a bathing area, a bed, and some dried food. There are even large holes drilled into the box, so light can easily come in, and they can see out. Loving the idea, they both strip down, leaving their clothes behind, and enter the box naked together. The nude couple securely closes the box door behind them, and waits. Before they did that, they placed some random Gulliverian address on the box, and called their mail delivery service to have the box picked up for delivery. The mail delivery person gets the large box, places it on a flat bed truck, and sends it off to an unknown Gulliverian destination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Who opens their special mail?</span></div></div>",

With his black-rimmed glasses and slacks and his gray sweaters, he resembled a professor at a university or some other sort of academic. Whenever he said that he was a bounty hunter, people would just look at him incredulously and chuckle. Bounty hunters were supposed to be huge manly men, the sort of men with horrific scars and eyepatches and stubble on their square jaws. Not someone who looked like he belonged in a library poring through Greek plays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a bounty hunter was what he was and he prided himself on always bringing back his quarry, dead or alive. Nor was he limited to just other Gulliverians. He would take down Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians as well. Size didn\u2019t matter to him. A bounty was a bounty, as long as he was paid. And secretly, he enjoyed the challenge of bringing down giants and giantesses. It never failed to please him when he saw the shock in their enormous eyes as the titans tumbled to the ground, incapacitated in one way one or another. The best had been a towering bruiser who had been massive even for a Brobdingnagian and who was wanted on a dozen different charges, from assault to homicide. After an utterly terrifying chase through several Gulliverian towns, Jacob had managed to outsmart the giant by leading him straight to the authorities. The next thing that the thug had known, he was in shackles and on his way to a Brobdingnagian jail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t just his intelligence that made him a match for practically any quarry. He was also a skilled engineer, mostly self-taught, although he had learned a great deal in college before he dropped out. Most of his weapons he designed himself and he was proud of each one. That was what he doing the day that his phone rang\u2026sketching out the schematics for new prototype weapons. Jacob was trying to decide the specific neurotoxin that he should include in a modified tranquilizer gun when he heard Sally answer the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where he was sitting, he could see her head tipped to one side as she spoke into the phone, her curly chestnut-brown hair spilling down over her back and shoulders. Sally had started off as his best friend, then his secretary, then his lover. Right now she was acting as a secretary, talking into the phone and typing up notes on her tablet. Jacob put down his mechanical pencil just as she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got another one,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this bounty for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo Brobdingnagian felons who\u2019ve been using Lilliputian cities as their personal playgrounds. They\u2019re calling themselves \u2018Jack and Jill,\u2019 which is a pretty terrible joke if you ask me. Anyway, the Lilliputian government is willing to pay you a large amount to bring them to justice.\u201d Sally\u2019s long crimson nails tapped on the tablet. \u201cOf course, you still have those two other bounties. But it\u2019s up to you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there was one good thing about pursuing Brobdingnagians, it was that they were ridiculously easy to track down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jacob crossed over into Lilliputian territory, it was painfully obvious that his quarry had been through this way as well. There were two sets of immense footprints, the area surrounding them reduced to catastrophic ruin. Each Brobdingnagian footfall must have been like an asteroid slamming into the ground and he paused at the edge of one of the colossal prints, glancing down inside. To him, the footprints were as deep as he was tall; to the Lilliputians, they were hundreds of feet deep. He could see the remains of tiny houses and cars, all compacted into the packed earth, and he felt his mouth contort in a grimace of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of it was that the Brobdingnagian government probably wouldn\u2019t do anything about it. Heaven forbid that they actually send a few of their own police officers out here, in the middle of nowhere Lilliput. Sometimes, when it got too bad, they would send out some rookie (and usually, the officer ended up inadvertently causing as much destruction as the criminals.) Jacob figured that the Lilliputian army would probably be called in at some point, but usually, there was little that they could do against someone who was six miles tall. So Jacob was the only possible salvation for this Lilliputian city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he was well-armed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, Jacob could see thick black clouds of smoke drifting upwards, standing out starkly against the brilliantly blue sky. He was willing to bet that the Brobdingnagians were in that direction and a second later, a deep, rumbling laugh confirmed that suspicion. Despite its deafening volume, the laughter had almost a feminine quality to it. Jill, no doubt. He sprinted in that direction, avoiding the gigantic footprints and the debris that littered the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he caught the first glimpse of the two Brobdingnagians, Jacob dropped to the ground. He had reached the edge of the Lilliputian city and there were enough tall buildings around that he could hide himself relatively well, at least from the giant and giantess. The Lilliputians probably had spotted him, but they were too busy fleeing the city to care, streams of them rushing past him like mice escaping a housefire. He peeked out from around a highrise, studying the Brobdingnagians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had already stripped off their clothes; Jacob could see a lacy bra and a pair of black jeans draped across several blocks, most likely smothering anyone trapped beneath the heavy fabric. Jill (or whatever her real name happened to be) was a breathtaking blonde, probably a few years older than he was. She was sprawled out across the city, the diamond stud in her bellybutton sparkling as she turned herself slightly. Her partner was equally attractive, leanly muscled and with a roguish twinkle in his grayish-green eyes. The giant was crouched down, his hands moving through the streets and stirring up great plumes of dust and smoke. Jacob wasn\u2019t sure what he was doing besides causing catastrophic devastation until Jack lifted up his hand. In the center of the giant\u2019s gargantuan palm were a dozen or so Lilliputian buildings, looking like Lego blocks compared to the Brobdingnagian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost daintily, Jack pinched one of the buildings between his fingers and lifted it up to his mouth. His tongue slid out and he deposited the building on the tip of it. He let it sit there for a second before he retracted his tongue back into his waiting mouth, swallowing the entire structure with a satisfied look. Jacob sincerely hoped that there hadn\u2019t been Lilliputians in that building, but he knew better. So he hoped that they were at least dead before they reached Jack\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant moved closer to his partner and then began to feed the rest of the minuscule buildings to her, laughing as she ate them like some sort of delicacy. While they were distracted, Jacob took the opportunity to inch his way closer, trying to avoid the Lilliputians underfoot. Already his mind was forming plans and strategies, trying to estimate how close he needed to get before he\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when Jill moved without warning, sitting up. The violence of her simple movement caused nearby skyscrapers to start toppling and Jacob had to leap out of the way before a highrise that was nearly his height crashed into him. He had one nanosecond to realize that he was out in the open, completely exposed, before the giantess\u2019 bone-rattling voice confirmed that they had seen him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well. What do we have here?\u201d Jill asked, reaching for him. Jacob tried to dodge the massive columns of her fingers but the bulletproof vest beneath his sweater and his various weapons slowed him down. The giantess grabbed him and lifted him high above the ground, scrutinizing him with her sapphire eyes. Behind her, Jack squinted suspiciously at him as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is a Gulliverian doing here?\u201d The giant demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno. He looks like my old sociology professor from college, though,\u201d Jill replied, bringing Jacob so close to her mouth that he could smell her bubblegum-scented breath. There was another odor as well, slightly rotten, and he remembered that the two Brobdingnagians had been eating buildings full of people when he had first arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna fuck with him in me, Will?\u201d Jill\u2019s voice rose an octave with excitement. Jacob fought in her hand until she brought one mammoth index finger down onto his chest, the pressure and pain making him stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, Natalie! I told you not to use my real name in public.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill just continued to press her index finger gently but firmly into Jacob\u2019s chest, making him wheeze. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s going to survive to blab our real names, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grinned fiendishly. \u201cTrue enough. Yeah, let\u2019s do it. I wanna smash him out of existence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Jacob managed to shout, although it was difficult with Jill\u2019s finger pressing down on him. \u201cWhat if I told you both why I\u2019m really here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant\u2019s dark eyebrows knitted together as he looked at Jacob first, then his partner in crime. \u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was already fingering the trigger for what he called the Xiuhcoatl, a sort of super Taser that he had invented. The weapon had molecularly-sharpened electrodes made of nanotube-strengthened carbon-fiber, connected via superconducting coil to a pair of ultra-capacitors and was capable of releasing insane amount of energy. As soon as Jill removed her index finger, he pressed the trigger. The result was spectacular, the giantess\u2019 immense hand going rigid as he delivered an incredible amount of electricity into it. Then he was falling, her grip on him lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struck the soft flesh of her belly, bounced once, and then continued to roll down the length of her colossal body. By the time that he stopped, he was on her thigh. Above him, Jill gripped her hand, hissing with pain and disbelief. She was focusing too much on her injury to grab for him, but Jack wasn\u2019t. The giant was already reaching for him, annoyance etched on his handsome features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob unslung the modified harpoon gun from his back and scuttled backwards, trying to aim for one of Jack\u2019s massive eyes. The harpoon\u2019s head was impressive, its edge was a mono-molecular crystal carbon film, and it was so sharp that it could probably slice a virus in two. It certainly wouldn\u2019t have any trouble blinding a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was having trouble aiming, especially with the Brobdingnagian trying to snatch him up. When he fired the harpoon his aim was off and the projectile struck Jack\u2019s cheek instead. The giant blinked, startled. A single bead of blood welled up from the wound and rolled down his cheek like a scarlet teardrop. Jack\u2019s reaction was predictable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little sonovabitch!\u201d The giant howled, his face darkening with rage. \u201cI\u2019m going to tear your goddamn head off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jacob was already climbing down from Jill\u2019s thigh, moving with the agility of a gecko. Once he hit the ground, he took off, pumping his legs as hard as he could. Jack\u2019s gargantuan fist hammered into the area where he had been standing, obliterating all of the delicate Lilliputian buildings beneath it. The impact nearly threw him from his feet, but he continued running for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he had managed to piss them both off. The question was what he should do next.</span></div></div>",

He swallowed as he ran, the huge footsteps of the Brobdingnagians shaking the ground as they drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob had to come up with a plan. He still had a tiny bit of distance between him and the giants but they were gaining fast.

The were 6 miles tall compared to the army and couldn't really even make out the army at their feet about a single footstep away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob began to back up as he saw the couple standing there. \"Are those Lilliputians?\" Jill thundered while squinting at the ground trying to make out the tiny tanks and soldiers. The Lilliputians couldn't hear what she was saying. Her voice was just thunderous noise to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians couldn't see much past the feet and legs of the Brobdingnagians. The saw the huge smooth feet and hairy legs of the giant man, \"Jack\" going up to his shorts. The also saw the tan feet of the giantess, \"Jill\" with the toenails painted light pink and her toned, denim clad legs as the jeans were tight to her legs. Jill wiggled her gigantic toes, shaking the ground and terrifying the Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they are. It looks like maybe an army or something like that if I had to guess. Look, there's the damn Gulliverian too.\" Jack said pointing at Jacob. Jacob turned and began to run once again. He knew there was no way to take out the giants without surprising them, especially in an open field and he knew the Lilliputian army was doomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of Lilliputian fighter jets bravely approached the Brobdingnagians. They unleashed all they had. Missiles, miniguns, and all man of weapons at the jets disposal peppered the Brobdingnagians to no effect. The jets were like gnats to the Brobdingnagians, probably even smaller. \"They think they can stop us? With these sad excuses of jets?\" Jack roared while Jill laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik was a pilot in the Lilliputian Air Force. He had flown many missions and was a rather experienced pilot. He and his squad approached the Brobdingnagians and he couldn't believe how huge they were. As he started his attack run, he targeted the face of the giantess and unleashed several missiles. He watched the misuse explode against her face yet she didn't flinch. Se was completely unharmed. He watched a she turned her huge beautiful face towards him and his squadron. Her pretty blue eyes seemed to be staring straight at him. Suddenly a huge wall of flesh appeared and it swept through the sky at an alarming speed towards them while the massive Brobdingnagian women smiled. The last thing Erik saw was a wall of flesh before his jet erupted in a fireball against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huge swipe of her hand, Jill destroyed the jets. They exploded upon impact with the flesh of her hand. \"Stupid Lillis.\" She muttered as she took another massive swipe with her hand, smacking the remaining jets out of the air, little fireballs erupting against the soft skin of her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one babe. I don't think we have to worry about the \"Air Force\" any more.\" Jack said as Jill giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army began to fire at the Brobdingnagians but their weapons couldn't reach past the massive feet of the giants. The army watched as both Brobdingnagians took a step. The huge heels of their massive feet sunk into the earth giving them a view of each colossal sole. They saw Jill's huge foot, her sole reddened and dirty from stomping around and Jack's slightly larger reddened, dirty sole over them. The tanks and soldiers fired at the massive soles in an attempt to ward off certain death. Small arms fire and tank rounds explored against their soles but the Brobdingnagians felt none of it. Their huge feet crashed down, sinking into the earth and flattening the tanks like pancakes and obliterating the tiny Lilliputian soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other soldiers watched in horror as the huge feet sunk into the ground were moments before an army had been. The survivors began to scatter in hopes to avoid death. It has definitely been a mistake to cluster so close together as it give the Brobdingnagians an easy target to crush underfoot. They were cast in a shadow and looked up to see the colossal feminine foot hovering over them. The reddened, dirty sole high above them. They watched the enormous toes wiggle before the foot began to descend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill raised her other foot up and held it over the remains of the army. She wiggled her massive toes before slamming her foot down with an earth shaking stomp. The huge tan foot sunk into the ground as Jill laughed before twisting her foot back and forth killing even more Lilliputians. Jack slammed his foot down near Jill's foot and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire Lilliputian army had been destroyed by 2 foot steps each from the Brobdingnagians. \"So much for that pathetic excuse of an army.\" Jack boomed as he looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that was pretty great. Dumb little insects.\" Jill said. \"Where'd the Gulliverian go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked around. \"He must've slipped away while we were destroying this little army.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a pussy! RUN AWAY YOU SCARED LITTLE MAN!\" Jill roared before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could probably find him. I'll ask around and see if anyone might have an idea of who he is. Come on babe.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob had watched from far off with a pair of high powered binoculars. He had watched the destruction of the Lilliputian army and saw how they hadn't even stood a chance against the Brobdingnagians. They were right, he had run away. Jacob put away his binoculars and decided he would head back to the office to regroup.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jacob ran he realized he had two options. He could try to lead the massive young couple away from the city and try and minimize the causalities of Lilliputians but it would leave him without much cover in the open area around the city, not to mention the Brobdingnagian's could easily catch up to him as he tried to even make it out of the city. His other option was to face them in the city. This option seemed more likely to lead to even more Lilliputian deaths but he would be provided some bit of cover by the buildings not to mention he wouldn't leave himself exposed in an open environment. It looked like he would have to face them in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Jacob, Jack's huge fist slamming down behind him caused plum of dust and debris to shoot up allowing Jacob to duck behind some Lilliputian buildings. He gasped for breath and heard the giantess moan in pain before peeking around cover. Jill was sitting up, opening and closing her massive hand. It must've have still stung a bit from the taser. He noted how beautiful she was with her perfect, richly tanned skin and her flowing blonde hair. He was snapped from his trace by her loud, annoyed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck was that?\" She thundered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. Probably sent to stop us from having fun. I've heard of these bounty hunters before.\" Jack retorted as he scanned the city looking for Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he can fuck right off!\" Jill said before looking at Jack. \"Will, your face, are you alright?\" She said reaching toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Natalie. It's just a scratch, nothing more.\" Jack muttered as he pulled the tiny harpoon from his face, tossing it aside and dabbed at the blood with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd that Gulliverian go? I want to break his fucking neck!\" Jill roared as she slammed her fist down crushing the Lilliputian buildings near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too babe. I want to break a lot more than just that bug's neck. He can't have gotten far.\" Jack said as he stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob drew back behind his cover to hide from the massive naked giant's gaze. Jack was incredibly imposing at his full height. Jack and Jill or Will and Natalie, whatever the hell they liked being called sounded pissed. Jacob wasn't about to run away from these criminals. He had to formulate a plan. He heard more shifting and buildings collapsing and peeked around the building to see that Jill had stood up now too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at the massive, naked Brobdingnagian couple and was particularly drawn to Jill. He looked her up and down. She was breathtakingly gorgeous with her perfect breasts and long toned legs as well as her perfect tan skin and he noted her shaved pubic region. She had nicely manicured hands which could engulf him and crush easily within them. He saw the diamond belly button piercing and her toned stomach as well. He saw her shake the hand he had tasered before she made a fist with it cracked her knuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he ran away?\" She questioned as she scanned the mostly destroyed city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. We definitely would've seen him if he tried that. He's around here somewhere.\" The giant replied casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob then looked at their huge feet which now eye level with him but sill a ways away. The giantess's pedicured toenails were painted light pink which matched her fingernails. If he wasn't careful he could end up beneath those mighty feet or even worse in the Brobdingnagian woman's vagina while her giant lover pummeled him with his cock as they fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where could a pesky little Gulliverian have gone?\" Jill mused while Jacob ducked back behind the building and took a deep breath. He now had to contend with an angry couple who had pain and punishment on their minds for him. Well, no one ever said this job was easy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack and Jill scanned the city. Now that they were standing up they could see over many of the short Lilliput buildings. As scanned the area where a few buildings still remained upright, he noticed a bit of movement. He grinned and tapped Natalie on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She said turning before Will hushed her and pointed towards Jacob's hiding spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right there babe. He thinks we don't see him.\" Will whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I don't see him Jack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh! I swear he's right there. Look.\" He whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Jill noticed a bit of movement and grinned. \"So now what?\" She whispered trying to suppress her excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob hadn't heard the Brobdingnagians whispering as he hid behind the buildings. He had been busy going through his arsenal to see how he could stop them. If only I had finished that damn neurotoxin gun he thought to himself as he reloaded the harpoon gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grinned and took one massive ground shaking step to tower over the buildings. Jacob felt the ground and buildings shake. He was cast in a shadow and looked up. He saw a massive dirty sole above him and the buildings and saw Jack grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found ya bug!\" Jack said as he brought his huge foot down. Jacob dove out of the way just barely as the massive foot crushed the buildings and any unfortunate Lilliputians who were beneath the huge foot. He saw it sink it the ground a bit. He then noticed that the harpoon gun had been crushed beneath Jack's foot. He must've dropped it while jumping out of the way. He silently cursed as he started to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get him babe?\" Jill said before she spotted Jacob getting off the ground after just avoiding the stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you missed him babe.\" Jill taunted in an amused tone. Jack just grinned. \"He's quicker than I thought.\" Jack said as he began to drag his foot across the ground after Jacob who had stood up began to run while the massive foot bulldozed everything behind. He heard a loud girlish giggle as well as thunderclaps as Jill clapped her hands like a giddy cheerleader while she watched Jack terrorize Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill took a step towards Jacob shaking the ground. Jacob just managed to dive away from Jack's foot as he stopped dragging it leaving a massive path of destruction in its wake. All of sudden Jack moved his foot rather quickly and smacked Jacob hard sending him flying towards the feet of Jill. Jacob rolled over and groaned in pain. He looked and saw Jill's huge feet with their light pink toenails before he saw her raising her massive foot over him. Jacob was cast in the shadow of a massive foot once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to crush every bone in your pathetic little body.\" She said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive sole was dirty and she wiggled her toes before bringing her huge foot down. Jacob had no way to get out from underneath her massive foot. He had to think fast. Jacob pulled out Xiuhcoatl as the huge sole became larger the closer it got. Jacob held Xiuhcoatl up and watched as her huge foot came down. He prayed that the taser had recharged fully. He could see tiny red spots of blood on her sole along with crushed cars and mashed pieces of buildings along with dirt as it descended. She thought she was about to crush a bug when in reality she was about to have a very shocking discovery. He smirked as he  thought about \"shocking\" discovery.  He hit the trigger for the weapon as well as the overcharge button to release an even greater charge into the unsuspecting Brobdingnagian's foot just as the thick sole touched the electrodes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEOOOWWWWWWW!\" The massive girl screamed as the electricity flowed into her foot. The huge foot withdrew quickly as she grabbed her foot and hopped on her other foot crushing Lilliputians and their buildings as she yelped in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owie! Ow! Ow! Ow!\" She yelped as she hopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped around before falling on to her butt casing a massive crash. He saw her rubbing the bottom of her foot and shooting daggers at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe! Are you ok?\" Jack said as he looked over at her and started to walk over by her. He dropped to his knees and looked at her foot that she was holding and nursing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Will.\" She said brushing off his concern. \"He just stung me again with the stupid, like, electric thingy again. Now I'm really pissed off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you're a tough guy zapping my girlfriend huh? I'll show you!\" Jack boomed as he stood up and started to walked towards Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit Jacob thought as he stood up and started to run. He noticed Jill wiggling her toes on the foot he had tazed and saw that she was slowly getting to her feet. Jack was hot on his heels trying to step on him. He couldn't pull any of his weapons out as it would've slowed him momentarily and he couldn't afford that. The huge feet of Jack were crashing down behind him as he ran. He turned around to look and watched as Jack's huge foot just barely missed him, the huge toes landing about 20 feet away from him. This is not good Jacob thought as he ran still looking behind him.</span></div></div>",

He hadn't been paying attention to what was ahead of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud crash was followed by Jacob running straight into a soft yet powerful tan wall. He bounced off what he soon realized was Jill's massive foot which she had stomped down in front of him to block him. \"Going somewhere?\" She said grinning. He noticed a slight sweaty odor from her massive foot. He looked up the tan, toned leg and saw her leaning over. He huge hand, column like tan fingers outstretched were reaching for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was roughly snatched up by the giantess who made sure her fist was tightly around Jacob. He couldn't even squirm and struggled to breathe in her iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" She exclaimed happily while squeezing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice grab Natalie!\" Jack said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned as she brought Jacob to her face. He stared at her sapphire eyes as they bore into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really, REALLY pissed me off.\" She said as she loosens her grip slightly and looked at his belt. The bubblegum scent of her breath along with the slight scent of rotten flesh washes over him. He watched as she squinted before her eyes lit up as she spotted her target. She expertly grabbed Xiuhcoatl from his belt with her thumb and index finger and smashed the tiny thing between her huge fingers with no effort before tightening her grip on him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tough without that little zappy thingy of yours are you?\" She said squeezing him once again drawing a pained yell from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy babe!\" Jack chuckled as she squeezed him. \"You'll crush him before we even get to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe I'm just so pissed at him for zapping me. Twice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know babe but now you've got him.

Pretty sure you stepped on the Lilli power plant at some point too babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still wanna fuck with him in me?\" Jill asked with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to. Let's show this Gulliverian what happens when he messes around outside of his own size.\" Jack said as Jill giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob tried to squirm free but couldn't even budge in the fist of Jill. He was hopelessly trapped and about to be stuffed inside her massive vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please don't do this.\" Jacob gasped. \"If you let me go, I promise I won't tell anyone that I found you or know your names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill ran a tan hand through her blonde hair with her fingers spread and smiled a toothy grin at Jacob in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let you go? Ha! Fat chance of that shitstain! Maybe you should've thought about that before you shocked me. Twice!\" Jill said tightening her grip on Jacob once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But babe,\" Jack said in a mocking tone, \"He won't tell anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill laughed at Jack's mocking of Jacob. \"You're totally right! We should just let him go!\" She said before both Brobdingnagians burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they calmed down, Jill grinned at Jacob. Her other hand worked itself down to her finger she rubbed her clit briefly. \"Probably didn't think your life would end inside a Brobdingnagian's pussy while she got fucked huh?\" Jacob had to admit she was right. It definitely wasn't the way he saw himself going out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babe. I'm gonna smash this Gulliverian.\" Jack said as Jill squeezed him once more.</span></div></div>",

She first pulled after his tactical gear and belt before shredding through his sweater with her fingernails which were painted light pink like her toes. She ripped his bulletproof vest off and then giggled as she pressed him into her palm with her index finger. She pinned him in her palm and begin to pull his pants off while she giggled. Jacob tried to fight her off but she had ripped his pants and underwear of in no time leaving him completely exposed. He tried to cover himself but she easily brushed away his hands from his privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha you're pretty small, even for a Gulliverian.\" She said grinning as Jacob turned bright red and prodding him with her massive index finger. \"Are we gonna fuck or what babe?\" Jack moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh you want to get right too it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm horny babe, I can't help it.\" Jack said wrapping his arms around from behind and beginning to kiss her neck while she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was lowered in the massive fist from Jill's pretty face. He was lowered past her perky large breasts which were perfect mounds down past her toned stomach with the diamond belly button piercing. It was like being lowered down a massive richly tanned skyscraper as he was lowered past her shaved pubic area where he could see some blonde stubble. Jill held him in front of her vagina before moving him closer. He looked up at her grinning face as she moved him closer. She playfully rubbed him around her labia letting him smell her musky feminine odor. She was clearly enjoying herself as she rubbed him on the lips of her vagina, exciting herself as she did so. She then pushed him in past her labia and Jacob was in a dark, moist, humid, musky cave. He could smell her musky feminine smell as she forced him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it feel like to have him in there babe?\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty neat. He's squirming and it feels sooooooo good.\" Jill moaned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill dropped down onto her butt and spread her legs, laying back and crushing numerous buildings beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babe. I need a little more than a squirming Gulliverian in me.\" She said seductively rubbing her vagina with her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grinned as he dropped down to his knees and laid on top of Jill before passionately kissing her. Jack could feel himself getting hard and entered Jill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get all the way in there babe. I want that little fucker crushed!\" Jill said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was in the dark moist craven and all he could do was squirm about. There was no escape from the musky womanhood of the giantess. All of sudden the huge cock of the giant entered. He was dragged along the vagina by the huge penis and rammed into a vaginal wall which he could feel contract. The vaginal muscles contracted tightly applying pressure to the unfortunate Gulliverian. As he was dragged along inside until he was rammed against a muscular vaginal wall, he felt his arm get twisted and snap in two places. He screamed in pain before the huge penis rammed him again as the giant thrusted. He felt pain all over as he was rammed by the head of the penis into wall again. He could just hear the muffled moans of pleasure of the Brobdingnagian who he was inside of. He could also hear loud thumps as Jack's balls slammed against Jill with each thrust. It was even more hot and humid in there than before. Another thrust left his legs in immense pain. They must be broken he thought before the next thrust ended the pain as he realized he could no longer even feel or move his legs. It was getting more moist in her and the musky feminine scent became stronger. Another thrust broke his other arm followed by another thrust which cracked several of his ribs. Jacob was coughing up blood as the huge head of the penis slammed into him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Jill were having some of the best sex they had ever had. Jill moaned loudly as Jack rammed his dick into her. \"Oh god this is wonderful! I can feel that little twerp being rammed inside of me by your cock!\" Jill moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel him on the tip of my dick every time I thrust. You like that Jill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For fuck's sake call me by my real name Will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that Natalie?\" Jack said and was greeted by a loud moan from Natalie. They kissed again as they fucked before parting as Natalie moaned once more. They were going at it like animals as Will grunted and Natalie panted and moaned while Will pawed at her breasts. They rolled about crushing the city and any Lillis stupid enough to have not fled the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside Natalie, Jacob was being crushed between the huge cock of \"Jack\" and vaginal walls of \"Jill.\" Jacob couldn't feel or move his arms or legs and he swore his pelvis was crushed. He was pummeled and rammed over and over while the giant Brobdingnagians fucked. All he could taste was blood as the huge penis rammed into him once again oozing pre cum. The silt of the huge penis was right in Jacob's face. The next thrust brought a violent eruption of hot sticky cum. Jacob was blasted by the hot cum and swallowed some of it as it shot down his throat before it all went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill and Natalie let out loud moans as they both orgasmed. Will withdrew his deflating member as cum, both his and hers, flowed from Natalie's vagina. The sweaty giants panted as they laid next to each other. \"Wow that was great.\" Will gasped. Natalie nodded as they lay there. Natalie then sat up and looked at the cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" Natalie said pointing at Jacob's lifeless mangled body.  \"Sucks to be him.\" Will said panting before he flicked Jacob's tiny mangled body causing it to slide through the cum and then come to rest in the rubble of a Lilliputian skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing. Not only did I have you fucking me but I had that little shit squirming inside me all over! My god that was the best sex ever!\" Natalie panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know babe. I could feel him at the tip of my dick being smashed inside you as we fucked. He deserves what he got, trying to hurt us and shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and now he's crushed and filled with cum. How fucking pathetic.\" She mused as she slowly started to wipe herself clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she and Will had cleaned themselves off they stood up and began to gather their clothes. They Lilliputian city was completely destroyed and millions were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill tossed Natalie her lace panties which she pulled up over her tan toned legs and put her lace bra on. Natalie tossed Will his boxers which he pulled on followed by his khaki shorts. She picked up her skin tight blue jeans that clung to her toned, athletic legs and wiggled them over her hips, hopping a few times to get the tight jeans on and zipping them up and buttoning them. She then put her white tank top on which clung to her body and Will put on his black t-shirt. They both remained barefoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill grinned as he saw the tight jeans on Natalie's perfect firm ass. He walked over and slapped her ass causing her to yelp in excitement and grin at Will. \"So about we go find another city to have some fun in?\" Will said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that. Maybe another stupid Gulliverian will show up too.\" Natalie said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed and then began to walk from the city. As they left, Natalie purposely stepped on Jacob's already mangled corpse smashing it into nothing more than another slightly larger bloody spot on her massive foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Lilliputian city had been ravaged by \"Jack\" and \"Jill\" the Brobdingnagians. They walked away from the city leaving it completely leveled, another playground for their destruction. Among the rumble was the crushed remains of a bounty hunter who had fearlessly faced them and paid the price for failing to stop their rampage which would now continue and undoubtedly lead to more death and destruction in Lilliput.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Nah. I think I'll go with this Maria lady instead,\" Jacob interjected, taking out from his black checkbook wallet what seemed like a photograph of someone. \"Those could wait until I am done with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photo reflected the upper body of a Caucasian woman, a very beautiful one. Her crystal blue eyes set on the triangular shaped face, a long, narrow and fragile  nose sculpted just right above the plumply lips supported by the pointy chin, and  her luscious light brown hair tied in a ponytail fashion  just so to accentuate the overall features of her face. She looked exactly like the type that would typically reject young Jacob back in his high school days. And ever since those days, he became resentful towards the women who would have the same features as those young teenage girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but are you sure about that? I mean, the payme\u2014\" Sally was interjected again by her clearly resentful lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, I know! But, I just have to do this one. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally just stood there, speechless and intimidated with the sound of the freshly written notes being slowly crushed in her tight fist and her narrowed eyes gazing at the frowny face of the nerdy man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, it's up to you, honey,\" unamused, she muttered in a low tone, sitting back on the black leather chair  with her back facing her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob knew that she was pissed, but he couldn't bother with her, really. Right now his focus was all on this assassin called Maria. He wanted to get her as soon as possible, to dominate her, to have her begging for  his mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to waste, through his secret connections, Jacob managed to locate Maria\u2014she was taking a room in the fancy hotel made for Brobdingnagians just few miles away from his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter equipping  himself with the needed gadgets, Jacob drove off in his car to the hotel. When he reached the hotel, he directly used the hotel's ventilation system to get to Maria's room.<br>\r\nLuckily for him, he had the blueprint for the ventilation system. If he didn't have it, he might have wondered for hours and hours in the aluminum labyrinthine with no results.<br>\r\nHe was also in luck that he was still in Gulliveria, because if he wasn't, he would have encounter a giant rat or insect or something in these vast passages by now.<br>\r\nGetting nearer and nearer to his destination, Jacob started hearing the echoes of what seemed like feminine moans violating his eardrums as he walked towards its source. <br>\r\nReaching the illuminated shutters, Jacob stopped at his feet and took a peek through the shutters like The Peeping Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\"  he thought to himself as he observed Maria, the young naked woman on the bed, her legs high up in the sky with twitching toes, moaning with utter pleasure as the standing ,naked giant man ravaged her pussy with what must have been a monstrous cock. \"Though, I didn't think of the possibility of her having a companion in her room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turned out to be harder than expected\u2014 she was not alone, she had someone\u2014 a steel of a man that could rip him apart in a fraction  of second if he so desired to.<br>\r\nThe naked giant looked like the complete opposite of Jacob;His massive frame dominating the presence of his lover, his combed back  dark brown hair shining under the room\u2019s lighting, and the classical handsome face that both women and men would find appealing .He was one of those guys  who would swipe the girls that rejected young Jacob back in high school off their feet.<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell. This couldn't get any worse,\" Jacob contemplated, his eyes filled with  disdain as he continued to watch how the giantess was enjoying to be fucked by her lover.<br>\r\nEven though it was illegal  for him to hit other than his purposed targets, he couldn't help but have his fingers twitching at the trigger of his gun with his disdainful  gaze aimed at the male giant. He hated those types as well.<br>\r\nJacob's chain of hateful thoughts was abruptly cut when the giantess spoke.<br>\r\n\"Ted honey, I brought some Gullies with me, can you get them from that drawer?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, anything for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob watched slowly as the male giant took out his big meaty cock from his wife's flower and walked toward the wooden drawer. The giant that goes by the name Ted opened the  drawer with his meaty hand and took out what seem like 2 glassed tubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no!\" Jacob gasped at the realization of his own people being trapped in the glassy containers, crying and begging  to be freed in the giant's meaty and clammy palms. \"Well, that gives me a reason to shoot you, douche bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have shot him by now, but he still couldn't .  Analyzing the giantess's body, Jacob could tell that this giantess was swift, she had the body that exhibited the criteria for  assassination, so alerting her probably wouldn't be the best route to take right now.<br>\r\nIf anything else, this actually would make him sneak in just fine without being noticed by the two giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant walked back to his lover, Jacob used his rope and attached it to the shutter so he could slide down from the ventilation system, unnoticeable.<br>\r\nWhile Jacob was doing his best to stay hidden, the couple were immersing themselves in their \"Kidnapped Toys\"<br>\r\nMaria, with her hair messy all over her feminine face unlike how it looked like in her picture, bit her lips seductively as the towering man  before her uncorked the containers.<br>\r\nMaria's breathing became heavier when she saw her lover bringing up one of the uncorked containers up to his opened maw. She just love the sight of her man being a merciless, gigantic god to the Gulliverians and Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 young Gulliverian men inside the container went ballistic with feminine cries as the warm breath of the giant man fogged their glassy container, warming the interior with temporary warmth, hypocritical  warmth, that is. Then, like a pack of smarties, the giant man sent the 3 tiny men down crying and screaming into the chasm of his wet mouth.<br>\r\nLooking at their tiny bodies struggling as they slid down into the giant's throat , made Maria very horny. She kept on rubbing her clitoris and moaning in unison  at the notion of the 3 poor Gulliverian men becoming nothing but nutrition for her handsome partner that he would later on cum their benefits into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter feeling them fully digested in his stomach, Ted let out a strong burp that emphasized their departure from the living world.<br>\r\n\"Ew!\" Maria laughed it off, to which he just smirked back at . \"So, what are you gonna do to me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout uttering any words, Ted made it obvious to her when he spat a good amount of his own saliva into the palm of his meaty hand.<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to  rub his clammy hand over his harden cock, covering it all with his sticky and warm saliva. To Maria, the cock looked very tasty yet incomplete, as if she was anticipating something that would make it look even tastier .<br>\r\nAnd there it was, Ted brought the other uncorked tube and sprinkled its content of 2 male Guliverians and one female onto the wet, harden cock. They fell down squeaking toward it before being abruptly silenced by the handful amount of saliva when they got adhered to the monstrous thing.   <br>\r\n\"Come on, fuck me!\" Like a needy child, the young woman said, spreading out her legs for the handsome man.<br>\r\nTed smirked back at her neediness and proceeded to bring his saucy manhood toward the wet cavern.<br>\r\nOut of the 3 trapped Guliverians, the woman was the one who was having the hardest  mental breakdown at the realization of what was about to happen to her life.<br>\r\nShe just couldn't accept the fact that she would have to leave her family of 5(a Husband and 4 children) just because a couple of Brobdingnagians wanted to use her as a sex toy for their pleasure. It was hard for her to come with the terms that after living through all the trials of her life, from growing up as a child to raising four mischievous but lovable kids, that she would have to be rewarded with this\u2014 just a brief moment of pleasure for a giant couple.<br>\r\nShe wanted someone to save her right now from the horrible situation, and there was someone who could\u2014 the tiny speck of a man running just right by the wide and massive  feet of the gargantuan man . But instead of trying to save them, he decided to use them as a bait just so to take down his never ending nightmare; Maria and her likes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, she didn't need to bother herself any longer. The moment the thick meat of a pole that they were strapped to entered the humid cave, Maria\u2019s vaginal muscles contracted themselves  around the long and thick meaty pole, turning her and the two other Guliverian men into nothing  but a stream of red and limps that flew deep into the moaning woman, forever forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thanks to them, Jacob was now just right  by the corner of the bed. All he needed to do now was to use his hook and climb up the white sheets of the bed, which he did.<br>\r\nAside from the constant mattress vibrations caused by what could be the most horny woman in the world, the bed climbing was an easy task for Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had finally reached the top, he was welcomed by the messy texture grounds that stretched out like a vast canyon. <br>\r\nAnd there she was in the middle of it all, the giant, horny woman who was responsible for its creation. But, this actually was good. Like this, he had a better chance at never being found and an easier aim at the self-absorbed woman.<br>\r\nInstead of using any decent neurotoxins to take out the giantess, Jacob went for the one that would make sure she does suffer, and if anything, kills her as well, he really didn't mind that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his gun fully loaded, Jacob steadily aimed his gun at the moaning giantess.\"Down you go, bitch!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to beg the giant man for mercy, but alas, he couldn't even utter a single syllable let alone form a single word. If this were to continue for 5 more secs, his organs would have  spilled out from his mouth instead of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait babie, don't kill him,\" Maria requested  her lover. \"I think it would be a total waste to kill that tiny bounty hunter like that, even though I thought it was sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected from an experienced assassin, she'd recognize a bounty hunter if she encountered one, and Jacob was an obvious one to her.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, what would you suggest, babe?\" Ted asked in a soft tone, soften his clutch around tiny Jacob, giving him the chance to appreciate the importance of oxygen.\" I mean, don't tell me to let this bug go. I won't even forgive him for considering the notion of hurting you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria adored Ted's protectiveness of her, it made her love him even more, and it also made her ten times hornier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly, of course we won't. I've always enjoyed torturing bounty hunters that would come after me and this pathetic excuse of a man is no exception.\"<br>\r\nShe was right about what she have said. Many bounty hunters did come after her, but they usually would end up dead, either by eating or crushing or kidnapping the Lilliputian and Gulliverian bounty hunters, or by torturing and keeping the Brobdingnagian bounty hunters as slaves until she'd get tired of them and end their misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's cold words made Jacob shiver in the giant's clutch. He wanted to get away, but this giant's clutch felt like pure steel, his skin was too thick for him  to even move a limb. This is the first time he felt so powerless and weak, it caused his heart to beat oddly fast, like he was about to have a cardiac arrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Jacob shivering in her lover's hand made Maria experience an extreme rush of euphoria. She thought of making him look even bluer, so she decided to bring her sadistic face  closer to her lover's clutch, just so to intensify his fear as he would keep on gazing at her grinning, gigantic face. It was a psychological torture for the tiny man.<br>\r\nBut after a while of reveling in torturing  him psychologically, Maria finally decided to bestow Jacob his verdict\u2014</span></div></div>",

Even though I think that this piece of shit isn't worthy of serving a goddess like you,\" Ted's words made Maria blush like a teenage girl. \"But, we all know that your word goes first.\"<br>\r\nTed then proceeded with stripping the tiny bounty hunter of his clothes and equipment just so to make sure that his beloved goddess wouldn't suffer any kind of complications when she swallow the pathetic man.<br>\r\nWhen he was done with undressing our protagonist, Ted hovered and dangled him right above his lover's sexy maw.<br>\r\n\"Please! Don't do it!\" naked Jacob begged the  giantess to close her maw and the giant to not drop him into the sexy yet terrifying abyssal maw.<br>\r\nBut really, not the slightest shade of empathy was seen from the two giants, and he should have known better why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!!!\" Jacob screams matched his appearance as the giant let go of his steely grip, sending him falling down into the dark hole  that was Maria's sexy maw.<br>\r\nFeeling him bumping against her wet tongue, Maria occluded her jaws and started to mouth-play Jacob.<br>\r\nIt was an odd sensation for Jacob\u2014a part of him didn't like the fact that he couldn't do anything to stop the giant woman from swallowing him and ergo ending his live in the most humiliating way possible for him\u2014and the other part of him was enjoying the fact that he was getting free, unintentional  blowjobs from the type of women that he so despised yet desired. And she was really good at it, it beat that of his lover's as well as all the other Guliverian women, probably.<br>\r\nBut sadly, that did not continue for long, her tongue eventually lost its perfect rhyming and instead, abruptly and violently curled back in her mouth, shooting the tiny man like a canon ball, screaming deep down into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling down the horrible esophagus that  kept on contracting its muscles around his sliding body and squeezing him to no ends, Jacob could tell that the giants resumed their sex as vibrations could be felt around his surroundings as well as her sexy moans that echoed all over her esophagus. <br>\r\nAt that point, Jacob broke down in tears like a little girl, unable to come with the terms that his life is over.<br>\r\nWhat made it even worse was that he left his lover back at the office in a very horrible mood where clearly he was the one to be blamed for it.<br>\r\nOh, how he wished he could go back in time and apologize to her, he just started realizing  how stupid and selfish he was. And now, he lost his chance of ever redeeming himself to his lover\u2014the only person that ever loved him for what he was.<br>\r\nBut, that couldn't be bothered with anymore, his journey was about to end as he reached  the end of the muscular and tight tunnel.<br>\r\npassing through Maria's lower esophageal sphincter, his eyes still teary, Jacob occluded them as he fell down into the acidic sea\u2014never to experience the meaning of consciousnesses again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sports car pulled through the autonomic gates and Lucy marveled at her surroundings. Everything was so astonishingly expensive, including the car (which she knew was a Bugatti) and the castle of a house, located on a cliff overlooking the bluish-gray ocean. But what amazed her most of all was her date, Seth. He was still dressed in his Armani suit from work, where he was the CEO of one of the largest defense companies in the world. Not only was he insanely wealthy, but he was the most handsome man that Lucy had ever seen. Considering that she was a model and worked in an industry where most people were beautiful, this was saying a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he parked the car, Seth stepped out and walked around to let Lucy out, opening the door for her. What a gentleman, she thought. Rich and handsome and courteous. She couldn\u2019t believe her good luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer date led her into his mansion, where she gawked some more at the sheer size and opulence of the rooms. Everything was tastefully decorated and Lucy got the impression that many of the paintings on the wall were as outrageously expensive as the car. She pretended to study one while he poured her a glass of merlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour house is amazing,\u201d Lucy told him, not sure what else to say. Normally, she wasn\u2019t shy at all around other people, but there was something about him that made her bashful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, my dear. But you haven\u2019t seen anything yet,\u201d he replied, flashing her a perfect smile. Once more she followed him, this time out onto a huge balcony where she could see the rolling waves of the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my. It\u2019s so beautiful out here,\u201d she gasped, feeling the salty air stir her short black hair. Lucy took a minute to study the breathtaking sight before her. Then she noticed what was on the patio table: a small wooden box that looked like it belonged in an antiques shop. It intrigued her, just sitting there like that, although she didn\u2019t touch it, of course. Seth saw where her attention was focused and he smiled. He motioned for her to sit down on one of the patio chairs and as she did, he opened the box. Inside were a half-dozen tiny people, looking up apprehensively at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre those Lilliputians?\u201d Lucy already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy own private stock,\u201d he said, reaching in and taking out a young woman with braided hair. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not offended\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shook her head. She had never really viewed Lilliputians as equals; in fact, there had been a few parties after photo-shoots where Lilliputians had attended\u2026as hors d'oeuvres. It was fashionable amongst some members of Gulliverian society to kidnap the tiny people and use them for all kinds of terrible purposes. Was it illegal? Yes. Did Lucy actually care? No. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! You see, most people don\u2019t fully appreciate power. Not even most Brobdingnagians do. I, on the other hand, have become a connoisseur of power. Right, my dear?\u201d Seth squeezed the minuscule Lilliputian woman in his hand and she howled in pain. Lucy continued to watch, morbidly fascinated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight?\u201d He repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right!\u201d The Lilliputian agreed frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like to toy with them. To gain their trust and then watch them die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy\u2019s heart hammered in her chest, not out of fear but out of sadistic delight. In his hand, the bug-sized woman began to tremble violently. With his free hand, Seth gently stroked her hair; then his grip began to tighten. A high-pitched squeal of pain erupted from the poor woman\u2019s mouth and Lucy felt strangely aroused. Chewing on her lower lip, she leaned forward so that she could the Lilliputian as she screamed and tried to free herself. But Seth continued to squeeze, his powerful fingers constricting tighter and tighter until there was a wet crack. Dark blood seeped down his palm, running over his wrist and expensive Rolex watch. The tiny woman\u2019s eyes bulged in their sockets and then glazed over as she died. Seth released her body, allowing it to splatter on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy couldn\u2019t help but grin as he took out a silk handkerchief and began to meticulously wipe the blood from his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so hot,\u201d she said in a voice husky with lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree.\u201d Seth placed his hand on her knee, just below her skirt. Lucy expected him to push her skirt up, to feel the dampness already soaking her panties. But instead, he began to shout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmanda,\u201d he called out and Lucy wondered who \u201cAmanda\u201d was. A maid, maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook and then she appeared. Not a maid, but a Brobdingnagian woman wearing a purple bikini, her dark brown hair pulled back from her face. Lucy wasn\u2019t sure where she had come from; the private beach, perhaps. Not that it really mattered. What did matter was that she was strolling toward them, her eyes on the two Gulliverians. As she paused before the balcony, close enough that Lucy could detect the scent of her sunscreen, Seth laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering where you were,\u201d he said to the giantess. She gave him a meek smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I wasn\u2019t here sooner, Seth,\u201d the Brobdingnagian apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy felt rage bubbling up in her. \u201cWho the hell is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Amanda. She\u2019s my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d the giantess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of game you\u2019re playing,\u201d Lucy hissed. \u201cBut I-,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted when the Brobdingnagian reached down and picked her up around the middle, lifting her from the balcony. One of Lucy\u2019s stiletto high-heels fell free as she hung in mid-air, the giantess\u2019 face looming high above her. Fear had taken hold and she quivered as Amanda placed her other hand on the balcony, allowing Seth to step onto her palm. Once he was seated comfortably, she carried them both away from the mansion and toward the small strip of beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lucy\u2019s relief, the giantess placed her on the sand. She immediately turned on Seth, who was also now standing on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to take me home! Now! I never want to see you again, you asshole,\u201d Lucy growled. Seth ignored her, glancing up at Amanda instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmanda, would you be so kind as to take care of her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess frowned. \u201cBut Seth, I always feel bad about doing that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would make me so happy, my love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Amanda replied reluctantly. She stood back up to her skyscraper-sized height, her immense body hiding the late afternoon sun. Lucy didn\u2019t have time to even think before the giantess raised one gargantuan foot over her. She saw the massive wrinkled sole above her and then suddenly, it came down onto her body, knocking her over. Her mouth filled with sand and she tried to spit it out as the unimaginable pressure descended on her body. Amanda was only putting a small amount of weight on her, but it was enough to make her wheeze in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth, meanwhile, had climbed onto the top of his girlfriend\u2019s huge foot and was now crouched near her pink-painted toes, watching Lucy with interest. To Lucy\u2019s terror, she saw the inhuman cruelty in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, I like to gain my victims\u2019 trust\u2026\u201d Seth was grinning madly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth, please,\u201d Lucy begged. But he just glanced up at Amanda and drew a line across his throat with one finger, the classic cutthroat gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this,\u201d the Brobdingnagian said almost sadly. Lucy couldn\u2019t even see her face, only her toes as she leaned forward, applying more pressure. The agony was instantaneous, like having a multi-ton boulder dropped upon her entire body. She would have screamed except she couldn\u2019t draw a breath as her lungs were compressed. A series of sharp cracks, like someone snapping dry twigs, filled her ears and she somehow knew that it was her bones shattering. Lucy\u2019s last image was of Seth, smiling viciously. Then her body flattened, her viscera spilling out from beneath the giantess\u2019 foot in appalling patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lucy was dead and her body (or whatever remained of it) was buried, Seth stretched out on Amanda\u2019s bare belly. She was upset about the whole thing, as she usually was, but he had calmed her with promises of tender lovemaking. Such a sweet, caring person she was. It aroused him so much when she destroyed people for his pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled at him as he began to kiss the warm flesh beneath him, working his way toward her navel. His cell phone vibrated and he sighed, taking it from his pocket. There were a few missed calls and he wondered if he should call them back or just wait until later.</span></div></div>",

I wanted to ignore my smartphone and continue having fun with Amanda, but in my line of work, I couldn\u2019t afford to ignore phone calls. I was thankful for Amanda for all the shit she put up with me from the killing to the business call. To be frank, if she couldn\u2019t put up with me, she wouldn\u2019t be my girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve had plenty of women in my life. I\u2019ve dated all three races and found a particular attraction to the Brobdingnagians. They were so fucking powerful without even trying. Going back to all the chicks I dated, most of my relationships hardly lasted longer than a week. Most of the chicks were after my money or\u2014in the case of the Brobdingnagians\u2014they were trying to assert some sort of elitism over me; and that shit was going to fly with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was the first person I met that wasn\u2019t a gold digger or power hungry slut. She was the first person I met that was genuine. I worried that I times she would turn on me, but I could tell that deep down in she was a Lilliputian stuck in Brobdingnagian\u2019s body. I was able to manipulate her without trying. She respected me and obeyed all my wishes. We had wonderful sex, I bought her a huge Brobdingnagian house in her hometown, and I showered her with gifts. Poor thing was modest and would refuse my gifts most of the time\u2014she would say that me loving her was gift enough. I really liked her. Like really, really liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you Cathy?\u201d I said into my phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got some good news for you.\u201d Her nasal tone bothered me at times. It was unsexy and kind of broke the mood I was having with Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCath, you know only to call me for one thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d I could feel her smiling through the phone. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s why I called you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt worked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get so ahead of yourself. But yes. It did work. We are ready to begin testing immediately.\u201d She said, holding back a triumphant glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, the ceramic composite works? It\u2019s adhering to other surfaces?\u201d I still couldn\u2019t believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it does. We are planning on spraying a jumbo jet tomorrow. Can you imagine, Seth? We can strengthen an airliner to the point where it could survive a crash landing. Like, a vertical crash landing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities swam in my head. This was good news, not just for the civilian sector, but also for the military. Amanda\u2019s stomach gurgled below me, interrupting my thoughts. I looked up to her and she mouthed <i>sorry</i> in her cute way. Gawd, I adored Amanda. Then another thought popped in my head: a much sicker thought that would put the ceramic composite to the ultimate test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLive test is tomorrow, right Cath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many testers you got for the plane?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTesters? We just got the plane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many people can fit in the place?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 800 I suppose. What are you getting at?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet 800 subjects, testers, or volunteers\u2014whatever the fuck you want to call it. I want to test the ceramic composite with real lives on the line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me? We can\u2019t get anything like that approved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t see demonstration on my terms, then I ain\u2019t buyin\u2019.\u201d I told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy, the little Lilliputian that I\u2019ve manipulated my entire career, was silent on the other end of the line. I didn\u2019t say a word and just waited for her response. In the meantime, I another gurgle coming from Amanda\u2019s stomach greeted me. The hungrier she got, the more aroused I got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Seth,\u201d Cathy blurted. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the usual place,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m bringing my girlfriend by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour girlfriend?\u201d She gasped, \u201caren\u2019t you dating a Brobdingna\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hung up the phone. I then stripped out of my clothes and rolled around Amanda\u2019s soft stomach. \u201cYou getting hungry babe?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey, but I am a bit peckish.\u201d She said in her soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me one minute, babe.\u201d I pulled out my phone and made a call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nestled myself between Amanda\u2019s nipple and bikini. I rubbed my cock against her aroused nipple while she fingered herself between her thighs. A Gulliverian semi-truck blasted its many horns in front of my mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a guest.\u201d Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for me. It\u2019s your dinner.\u201d I tried not to moan as I spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, thank you. Want to come out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no,\u201d I laughed. \u201cYou can go eat while I\u2019m here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt the blood rush from my head to my feet as Amanda stood up. The vibrations of her footstep shook my body as she walked from my private beach to the front driveway. Even at 420 feet tall, it took Amanda quite a few steps to walk around the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver of the semi had opened the back of the trailer. Inside, covered from wall to wall, were unwrapped sandwiches, originally headed to a homeless shelter. I guess they were going to be shit out of luck\u2014I mean, my girl had to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yum, these look good.\u201d Amanda said. She proceeded to pull off the trailer from the truck and tilt the contents into her mouth. One of the benefits of being, well, me, was that I got whatever the fuck I wanted. I told them to fill a truck with turkey sandwiches ready to eat, and that\u2019s what I got. I mean, that\u2019s what Amanda got. I didn\u2019t give a shit how they got it or that homeless people were going to go hungry that night. I got whatever the fuck I wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can eat the driver if you want to.\u201d I smiled as I told Amanda from her boob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, not today honey?\u201d She groaned. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like doing that.\u201d I could tell she was waiting for me to direct her further. Whether I pushed it or not. The driver\u2019s life was in my hand even though Amanda would carry out the execution if I wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in a good mood so I told Amanda, \u201cif you don\u2019t want to eat him, then don\u2019t. It\u2019s all good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda lifted her bikini top so that I could see her pretty face and mouthed <i>thank you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlefuscu was a tiny island nation that waged war with Lilliput back several hundreds of years ago during the time of Gulliver. As the story goes, Gulliver decimated their navy and captured a dozen military ships for the kingdom of Lilliput. Fortunately, for the nation of Blefuscu, Gulliver refused the Lilliput King\u2019s order to destroy their enemy in its entirety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver hundreds of generations, Blefuscu still hadn\u2019t made their peace with Lilliput. On the outside, diplomats would proclaim peace and continued commerce between the two nations. Secretly, the two nations fought a shadow war under the noses of the public. Tensions rolled hot behind closed doors and many soldiers died without anyone noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI loved tension, shadow wars, and military expansion. Both nations fought for my business as a defense contractor and I catered to both. Blef-theon\u00ae, based out of Blefuscu, was headed by Cathy and hungry to decimate Lilliput. She currently held the contract with my company and therefore had my undivided attention. Blef-theon\u00ae owned a small strip of islands that extended from the main island to the mainland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told Amanda to dress light, as if we were going to a beach party. She went with flip-flops, cotton short shorts, and a loose shirt. Underneath all that was a green bikini. She wore these oversized sunglasses that made her eyes look like that of a bumblebee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure we are going the right way?\u201d She asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting on her shoulder, strapped to her shirt. \u201cYup, this is the right way.\u201d I pulled out my cell and gave Cathy a call. \u201cHey Cath, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoddamnit Seth, I know you are almost here.\u201d She screamed. \u201cI could see her.\u201d She yelled again. \u201cI could see her from the testing site. Why\u2014in god\u2019s name\u2014are you bringing a Brobby here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the way you want to talk to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy girlfriend is here to test the ceramic composite compound. If you don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll turn around now. Maybe head over to Lilliput and tell them what you\u2019re up to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I should clear up some things here\u2026<i>Lilliputians</i> is the given name to the smallest race known in the world. This was due to Gulliver naming them upon their discovery and the name-well\u2014just sticking. The Blefuscudians hated anytime they were called Lilliputians but the Gulliverians and Brobdingnagians didn\u2019t give a shit. If they were micro sized, they were called Lilliputians. The Blefu\u2014whatever, just had to suck it up. Then again, don\u2019t listen to me because I\u2019m not exactly politically correct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Seth.\u201d Cathy sounded defeated. \u201cPlease tell her to be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hung up the phone without responding. The environment transitioned from Gulliveria to Lilly size gradually. The forests were no longer distinguishable and just looked like blobs of green. The beaches looked like strips of white, separating the blue ocean to the green inland. There was a strait of tiny islands, that from my vantage point, looked like dinner plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight there babe.\u201d I told Amanda. \u201cStop on that island to the right. That\u2019s where I\u2019m meeting the Lilliputians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLilliputians?\u201d She asked. \u201cWhy are we meeting Lilliputians?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean the other ones,\u201d referring to the Blefuscudians. \u201cI\u2019m meeting them for a business deal and I need your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp with what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to test something out.\u201d I told her. \u201cI need you to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Every step she took quaked the earth as well as me my perch. The landscape was smooth and almost appeared flat. The blue ocean waters seemed like glass and unmoving. The dinner plate islands had white sands around its edges with lush green towards the center. One particular island had this flat grey rectangle, situated in the middle of the green island jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight there Amada,\u201d I told her via wireless headset. \u201cSet me down over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe testing area (island) was still a few steps away for Amanda across the shallow ocean. Amanda slipped her feet out of her sandals and took a step into the ocean. I could see a wave of white water explode from out under her feet. These swells resonated outwards, flooding nearby beaches and causing miles long ripples. The waters didn\u2019t have time to calm before Amanda took another step, deeper into the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down and could see the ocean wasn\u2019t even deep enough for her toes to be submerged. I stroked Amanda\u2019s bare skin under me as if she was my pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight there?\u201d Amanda stopped walking upon reaching the testing area. From our height, we could only see little black dots scurrying around. There was also an object, about half my height, sitting in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let me down.\u201d I said. Amanda lowered me to the ground with care. Everything came into better focus for me. There were hundreds of Blefuscudians running around, some were spraying the plane with the composite stuff through what looked like fire trucks. The composite stuff adhered to the exterior of the plane and left a glossy finish as if the plane was washed and waxed. The windows to the plane were still visible and <i>see through</i> through the composite stuff. \u201cWhere are you Cathy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook down.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound as happy as she was on the phone the other day. Amanda\u2019s enveloping shadow probably had something to do with it. \u201cDo you mind explaining her?\u201d Cathy pointed a finger at my Brobdingnagian girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCare to change that tone?\u201d I stepped forward, close to the one-inch woman. She recoiled at the sight of my sleek business shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoddamnit Seth.\u201d She sighed. \u201cPlease tell her to be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell her whatever I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could sense Cathy\u2019s uneasiness around me. She changed topics without further hesitation. \u201cThe luxury plane is fully prepped. I\u2019m having my team give one last coat of the compound as a finishing touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the plane fully loaded?\u201d I asked. \u201cWith people that is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy looked up to me with remorse. \u201cIt is.\u201d She paused. \u201cCan I ask why you wanted the plane loaded?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCamera\u2019s onboard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have the fuselage fully monitored with interior and exterior cameras. They transmit their signal back to our mobile command post.\u201d She was getting a bit more uneasy. \u201cWhat are you planning, Seth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m planning on testing the compound. I want to see if it\u2019s all what you crack it up to be.\u201d I smiled down at her. \u201cIf works like you said, then there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth, there are eight hundred people in there. I\u2019m not going to put their lives in great harm. Now a simple test is fine, but nothing too\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey baby?\u201d I looked up to my gigantic girlfriend, standing something like six miles for the little Blefuscudians. \u201cI need one more favor from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d She asked while pulling her dark brown hair back in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee this thing next to me?\u201d I took a step over Cathy and almost stepped on a few Blefuscudians as I walked across the cemented ground towards the plane. The engineers manning the hose abandoned and ran from me as I got closer, letting the composite shit spray all over the ground. \u201cI need you to swallow it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Amanda lowered herself at the knees. Her legs spread as she bent over, surrounding the skies with her bare thighs. I could see her enormous camel toe against her cotton shorts. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to kill me, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed. \u201cOf course not, babe. It\u2019s just something we\u2019re testing. It\u2019s completely harmless. Just swallow it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwallow it Amanda.\u201d I could feel my face getting red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Amanda lowered her fingers towards me. I loved how long and slender they were, but to the little Blefuscudians, they must have been larger than skyscrapers. Amanda used her index finger and thumb to pluck the plane from the ground, causing some of the Blefuscudians working the outside to take cover under their vehicles. \u201cJust swallow it?\u201d She said this with the plane in front of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it Seth, what are you doing?\u201d Cathy asked in our private channel. \u201cShe\u2019ll kill them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if your composite works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d Amanda lowered the aircraft into her mouth and then swallowed. Sending 800 Blefuscudians on the ride of their lives. \u201cOkay Seth I did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled down at Cathy. \u201cPull up the video feed,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s see if your stuff is the real deal or not.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there was one person that Cathy both loathed and loved, it was Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the moment that he had taken over his company from his father, she had known that he was trouble. During their first meeting to discuss a large R&amp;D project, he had swaggered into the Gulliverian-sized conference room several minutes late. And when discussions had begun, he had deliberately talked over her, even winking slyly once or twice to acknowledge what he was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy had been livid. She had clawed her way to the top, had both an MBA and master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from prestigious universities, and she didn\u2019t like being pushed around at all. After the meeting, when they had been alone, she had angrily strode across the conference table. Normally, people would cower when she unleashed her wrath upon them, quivering like whipped dogs. But Seth had seemed more amused than anything else as she had shouted up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bully, do you know that?\u201d She had demanded. He had smiled and then, quick as a viper, snatched her up in one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Seth had replied, plucking off her high-heeled pumps. Her nylons and skirt had come off next and by that point, she had been screaming threats at him, her toned legs paddling furiously through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me down! Put me down!\u201d A few minutes earlier, she had been a perfectly-composed executive. But she had been swiftly reduced to a blubbering mess, her short ash-blonde hair in disarray, her make-up smeared so that she glared up at the giant with raccoon eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had raised Cathy to his mouth, she had dug her French-tipped fingernails into the soft flesh of his lips. If Seth had even felt her frantic scratching, he had given no indication. The Gulliverian\u2019s mouth had opened, the gleaming white slabs of his incisors clamping down on her lacy thong. With the precision of a surgeon, he had ripped off her panties with his teeth. The cold air against her exposed sex had been replaced by his warm tongue caressing her pussy and thighs. Cathy had howled at this violation. To her horror and shame, her body had betrayed her, responding to the sensations so that she stopped struggling and instead bucked her hips against the gargantuan slippery tongue beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had let her go eventually, after she had orgasmed so many times that her inner muscles ached. After, when he had left her half-naked and panting on the conference table, her legs soaked with his saliva and her own vaginal secretions, she had sworn to never communicate with him again. But within a few days, she had called him and begged him for another meeting. And another. And another. As much as she hated to admit it, she belonged to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, when he had spoken to her about this crazy plan to test the new ceramic compound, Cathy had reluctantly agreed. Deep down, she knew that he was up to no good, but she couldn\u2019t find the courage to protest. Even when he showed up with a Brobdingnagian, she hadn\u2019t dared to question him; in fact, she had called Security and told them to back down for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she stood outside, her arms crossed, worriedly tapping her foot on the ground as the Brobdingnagian woman brought the plane before her open mouth, pinching it as though it was a large jellybean. It was difficult to see most of her because of her extreme size; most of what Cathy saw was projected on the movie theater sized screens that they had constructed. Seth, on the other hand, she could see relatively well, although he still towered over all of the nearby buildings. He was dashing as usual, dressed in a slate-gray suit. The sort of man who looked like he could take over the world\u2026and probably would someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched intently as the giantess slid the plane into her mouth and then swallowed, as though she were gulping down a pill. It was difficult for Cathy to fully comprehend that the Brobdingnagian had just swallowed several hundred people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull up the video feed. Let\u2019s see if your stuff is the real deal or not,\u201d Seth said. Cathy nodded at one of the techs, who pulled up the video feed on his tablet. The images on the huge screens changed, showing the perspectives of the various cameras. Cameras 1-6 showed the view from the outside of the plane, which was currently resting in a vast cavern with wrinkled pink walls. The plane\u2019s exterior lights gave the fleshy landscape a hellish quality. Cameras 7-12 were inside the plane with the test volunteers.  The majority of the volunteers were actually Blef-theon employees who were at risk to be laid-off, since the company had recently lost a major contract. For the most part, the test subjects were calmly sitting in their seats, although several glanced out the window with a mixture of wonder and apprehension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobdingnagian leaned down, her immense face dropping down from the sky. To Cathy and the other Blefuscudians, it was like watching the moon slowly gravitate closer and closer to the Earth. Cathy instinctively backed away but the giantess just squinted at the movie theater screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth, what\u2019s going on? I can\u2019t see anything\u2026those screens are really tiny,\u201d she said over the headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Seth replied. Except it wasn\u2019t. Several of the technicians had already noticed distressing information coming from the external sensors that they had placed on the plane. And everyone could see the thin wisps of smoke rising up from the plane\u2019s exterior. The giantess\u2019 stomach acids seemed to be stronger than the composite coating. Dread twisted Cathy\u2019s own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth!\u201d She called up to him. \u201cWe need to get those people out immediately!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant was too busy staring at the screens. His dark eyes had taken on an eerie shine and his mouth was curled into a fiendish grin. Cathy\u2019s voice broke as she screamed up at him. When he didn\u2019t bother to look at her, she tried his girlfriend, the Brobdingnagian. But her comms line had been turned off and Cathy somehow knew that this was Seth\u2019s doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation within the giantess\u2019 stomach was rapidly becoming worse. When Cathy glanced up at the screens, she saw that the acid had burned through the skin of the plane and was beginning to enter the interior, yellowish fluid leaking through every possible opening. The volunteers had also realized the danger that they were in and pandemonium had broken out as people shrieked and tried to find an escape. They looked like cattle on their way to the slaughter, trapped in an enormous chute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth!\u201d Cathy wailed. On her headset, the comms channel switched and she heard the cries of hundreds of people. All of the people in the plane, no doubt, their screams of terror delivered directly into her ear. That was more than enough for her. As fast as she could, she ran toward the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still watching the awful spectacle on the screen, the sadistic lust apparent in his wide smile. Desperately, Cathy pounded on the side of his massive foot, trying to get his attention. But Seth\u2019s gaze never left the screen, where the giantess\u2019 acids had flooded the interior of the plane. The volunteers fought each other as they tried to get away from the lethal liquid, which destroyed everything that it touched. Seats smoked and melted, as did the flesh and clothing of the horrified people. Cathy stopped beating at Seth\u2019s foot just in time to see a wave of acid wash over a cluster of four or five people. They jerked spasmodically, convulsing in pain as their skin dissolved. One young man turned toward a nearby camera, the flesh of his face sloughing off to reveal the gaping skull underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point that Cathy knew that those volunteers were all doomed. With a terrible numbness, she watched as the acids consumed hundreds of people indiscriminately. Eventually, the caustic fluid reached the cameras and the video went dead, leaving nothing on the screens but blackness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy slowly gazed up at the Brobdingnagian, who seemed completely unaware of the fact that she had just killed all of those people. The giantess\u2019 pretty face was as innocent as an infant\u2019s and most likely, she was thinking about something completely unrelated to the massacre in her belly.  Then Cathy looked at Seth and her vision tunneled with rage. Her anger exploded when he finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell! That wasn\u2019t supposed to happen,\u201d he said casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d Cathy was trembling so hard with raw hatred that she couldn\u2019t form a coherent sentence. More than anything, she wanted him dead. Yet a part of her still feared and desired him, especially now that he had shown how ruthless he truly was. Still shaking, Cathy considered what to do.</span></div></div>",

But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need the services of your girlfriend in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth leaned forward and swooped Cathy into the palm of his hand. \u201cOh come on Cath, Amanda did wonderful today. She\u2019s the ultimate test after all. If your dumb little scientists can come up with something that can withstand the awesome powers of a Brobdingnagian, just imagine how invincible the Blefuscudians could become. You\u2019d be able to steam roll over the Lilliputians with no resistance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy looked up past Seth and towards Amanda who stood ready for Seth\u2019s next command. About four and half miles up in the sky, Cathy could see Amanda\u2019s flat stomach, which was working on digesting her former employees, not to mention the expensive jumbo jet. Seth backed up a few steps until he was able to sit on Amanda\u2019s big toe. He let his free hand feel around her smooth unpolished nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why I just don\u2019t hire a Brobdingnagian mercenary.\u201d Cathy told Seth, still looking up Amanda\u2019s miles long legs. \u201cJust one Brobdingnagian could decimate Lilliput Island quicker than any bomb we have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you realize how quick the international police would stop that?\u201d Seth chuckled. \u201cNot to mention all the <i>human</i> rights organizations, many of them being ran by Brobdingnagians. No, this little tiff you and the Lilliputians have\u2014that\u2019s y\u2019alls war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Cathy said. \u201cGod, I hate those fucking Lilliputians so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s brow rose up as he heard Cathy\u2019s last statement. \u201cHey Cath, you still feeling bad about your people being eaten up by Amanda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cathy nearly shouted like she was a child saying <i>d\u2019uh</i>. \u201cOf course I\u2019m upset. What a terrible way to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me make it up to you. Come home with me and Amanda.\u201d Seth reached into his front coat pocket. He pulled out a golden cigarette case\u2014except cigarettes weren\u2019t inside. He popped the case opened and pulled out a shrieking Lilliputian woman between his index finger and thumb. He extended his tongue and let the Lilliputian woman down on top of it. He retracted his tongue and began toying with the nude woman in his mouth. \u201cI think you can release some stress with my help.\u201d His speech was all mumbled as talked with the struggling woman in his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked, she\u2019s just a Lilly.\u201d He swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the fuck would you do that?

Seth insisted that Cathy ride on his shoulder, and in turn, he rode on Amanda\u2019s shoulder. Each shockwave created by Amanda\u2019s sandal-clad feet was like a bomb going off for Cathy. Any wild animal that called the Gulliverian prairie \u2018home\u2019 ran for their lives as Amanda\u2019s gigantic feet reduced their homeland. Crushed without notice were many species of wild deer, horses, rodents, coyotes, millions of insects, and birds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe, drop off us at the front. We\u2019ll meet you around at the beach.\u201d Seth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, honey.\u201d Amanda lowered her boyfriend at the front of his mansion. She then strolled off, taking off the outer layer of clothing, revealing her green bikini underneath. Seth watched her backside until she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Cathy,\u201d he said, stepping through his heavy front door. \u201cHow attached are you to the Lilliputians?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttached?\u201d Cathy\u2019s eyes gazed around Seth\u2019s prodigious home. \u201cHell no, I\u2019m not attached.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to hear that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth stripped of his clothes while walking towards the back patio. Cathy shifted in his palm, nervous as to what Seth was planning. The ocean air filled their noses as he stepped out onto the patio. Amanda occupied the landscape, lying on the beach with her belly facing up, soaking in the sun\u2019s rays. Her green bikini accentuated her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have all the money I could ever want.\u201d Seth leaned on his marble railing that overlooked his private beach. He set Cathy down on the thick railing. She was still in her business attire; he was naked. \u201cBut no matter how much I have, I can never <i>buy</i> my way into the upper caste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaste? There are no castes. We\u2019re all people, though our sizes are different, we\u2019re all equ\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease spare me that liberal tripe.\u201d Seth said. \u201cWe are not equal. Look at Amanda. She doesn\u2019t know it, but she has 800 of your <i>equals</i> digesting in her stomach and she doesn\u2019t even know it.\u201d Seth started stroking his cock in front of Cathy. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me there\u2019s not a caste, and don\u2019t tell me we are equal. Amanda is on the top of the food chain whether she realizes it or not. There are no predators after her\u2014she <i>is</i> the predator. And I make her one every chance I get. She might be humble to be a Brobdingnagian, but I make sure she\u2019s living out to be the cruel, careless Brobdingnagian that this world had seen hundreds of years ago. I make sure she puts the lower class in their place through the sheer strength of her body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay Seth?\u201d Cathy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there was a way for me to become a Brobdingnagian\u2026I wouldn\u2019t care if it cost me everything I had\u2014I would do it in a heartbeat. To be so fucking huge and powerful.\u201d Seth paused his cock stroking to lift Cathy, strip her, and put her lower half into his mouth. Cathy did the usual\u2014she pretended to resist but gave into Seth\u2019s lust and let his slippery tongue slide between her thighs. \u201cYou taste so good.\u201d He mumbled. \u201cWant to know how Amanda tastes like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth called for Amanda and had her lift him up to her face. \u201cWhy are you all naked honey?\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you now,\u201d Seth said, stroking his miniscule cock in front of Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Amanda giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stuck out her tongue and played with Seth\u2019s hard member. With sensual ease, Amanda lowered her boyfriend into her wet mouth, sealing her lips with him inside. Seth rolled on his belly and rubbed his cock hard into the bumps that were Amanda\u2019s taste buds. He heard Cathy yelping as she now found herself in a vast cavern. Seth kept sucking on Cathy\u2019s lower body while he continued to hump Amanda\u2019s tongue. Amanda\u2014being the considerate person she was\u2014opened her mouth slightly and let fresh air exchange with the humid air in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth pulled Cathy from his mouth. A sharp ray of light entered between a small gap between Amanda\u2019s lip. \u201cDo you realize how many people came through here?\u201d Seth asked Cathy. \u201cI\u2019ve had Amanda eat so many people whether she knew it or not. She\u2019s even eaten Gulliverians for me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dug his hips deeper into Amanda\u2019s wet tongue, soliciting a rumbling giggle from the giantess. Saliva pooled on Amanda\u2019s tongue coating Seth up to his ass. Amanda did her trick that she\u2019d perfected over the past few months and swallowed only the saliva in her mouth, leaving Seth a little bit drier. As quick as she swallowed, more saliva gushed into her mouth; she tasted Seth\u2019s body like a salty treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth went back to licking and sucking Cathy between her legs. The tip of his pink tongue applied great pressure against her clit, only driving her mad with lust and satisfaction. Words couldn\u2019t even describe the abject terror she was feeling. Seth or Amanda could have eaten her at that moment\u2014shit, she could have ended in both stomachs when she thought of it. She came to repeated orgasm as the powerful giant played with her pussy inside a much bigger gaintess\u2019 mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth released his tiny load on Amanda\u2019s tongue. He pumped and writhed until the last ounce of his seed seeped on her tongue. Amanda, feeling his limp body in her mouth, pulled his exhausted body from her mouth and set him down between her breasts. She then swallowed the saliva in her mouth; including a drop of Seth\u2019s cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had fun.\u201d Seth gasped. The bright daylight almost blinded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s <i>we</i>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe and Cathy.\u201d Seth dropped Cathy\u2019s limp body on his cock. Sensing Amanda\u2019s trepidation, he said \u201cdon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s okay and we both had fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you told me before. She\u2019s so small I can\u2019t see her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, yea, I know.\u201d Seth rubbed Cathy\u2019s frail body into his testicles as he continued talking with his Brobdingnagian girlfriend. \u201cNow, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amanda had purposely closed her eyes as she opened her mouth wide, tossing them in as fast as she could. A few had missed her mouth and she had felt them clinging desperately to her bikini top. Shuddering, she had brushed those ones off and then swallowed the screaming people in her mouth. Afterward, Seth had asked her to pick him up and let him press his ear against her taut belly, so that he could hear the muffled shrieks of those who were still alive inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been horrible and she had wondered for the thousandth time why she stayed with him. Well, he was certainly nice to her, buying her whatever she desired. A diamond bracelet or a new top-of-the-line Brobdingnagian car, it didn\u2019t matter. Amanda just asked and he purchased it for her. Seth was also the most intense and thoughtful lover that she had ever had. Like now. He had taken off his clothing and placed them in a neat pile near her belly button. When she saw him standing near the edge of her bikini bottom, she lifted it up for him and he slithered in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, she felt his little hands and mouth against her clit. The sensation made her moan and writhe in the sand. Somehow, he managed to stimulate her like no Brobdingnagian man could and it didn\u2019t take long before the pleasure intensified and then exploded into the ecstasy of orgasm. Lucy and the people on the yacht and all the others that she had killed were soon forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at work, Seth was glancing through some paperwork when his personal assistant, Eliza, walked into his office. The other Gulliverian was an attractive blonde and if she hadn't been such an excellent assistant, he would have brought her home to Amanda a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshville still hasn\u2019t been evacuated,\u201d Eliza said. Ashville was one of the older Lilliputian cities, once an industrial center but now slowly falling into decay and ruin. The whole city had become bankrupt, unable to pay its bills, and so Seth had pounced on the opportunity. He had bought it for a reasonable amount and had immediately sent eviction notices to the residents. Once the Lilliputians were gone, he would raze the whole city and then build a summer home there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t evacuated yet?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNo, sir. We\u2019ve sent them numerous notices. Many of the residents believe that they still have a right to remain there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that certainly was a problem. At first, Seth seethed with rage; then, as he considered the situation further, a smile oozed across his face. Eliza was accustomed to seeing devilish expressions on her boss\u2019 face, but this one made the hair on the back of her neck stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCancel the rest of my meetings for today. I think I\u2019m going to visit Ashville myself,\u201d Seth announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about this, Seth,\u201d Amanda said as she daintily stepped ashore, holding him in her right hand. She looked dazzling in a sleeveless white dress, a gold necklace glittering from around her neck. Since she had waded here, she carried her sandals in a large purse, along with her make-up and cell phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, love.\u201d Seth watched, pleased, as she unknowingly flattened dozens and dozens of Lilliputian piers and warehouses under one high-arched foot. When she lifted her foot, there was nothing left but a deep crater, complete with five distinct toe imprints. Seth stared at her vast footprint; then his gaze shifted. It was amazing to be able to view the Lilliputian landscape from this height. Everything looked so extremely small and he couldn\u2019t even see the tiny people from up here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need you to drop me off. If it gets to be too much, I\u2019ll give you a call,\u201d Seth continued. Ahead of them was a small mountain range; on the other side was Ashville. With Amanda\u2019s miles-long legs, it didn\u2019t take them long to reach it. She dropped down to her knees, still holding him up high enough that he could make out the city, stretching out before him. No, correction. <i>His</i> city. He was about to take what belonged to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her four years as an Ashville police officer, Kelly had never seen anything like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost days she spent her time confronting drug dealers and gang members and all of the other criminals that plagued a run-down industrial city like this one. But today she faced a much bigger problem\u2026about four hundred feet bigger. She and her partner Darren watched as a giant strolled down the street toward them, each of his footsteps rattling the windows on the nearby skyscrapers. With his tailored black suit and scarlet tie, he looked like he belonged in a boardroom somewhere. At first, he didn\u2019t seem particularly aggressive, stopping now and then to admire his reflection in the mirrored facades of the buildings around him. Warily, Kelly and Darren stepped out of their squad car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, Gulliverians are not allowed in the city of Ashville. We\u2019re going to ask that you leave immediately,\u201d Darren said, raising his bullhorn to his mouth. The giant pointedly ignored him, leaning over to tap on the windows of an office building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, if you don\u2019t leave-,\u201d Her partner started before the Gulliverian slowly turned his head, looking at them with such contempt that Kelly couldn\u2019t help but shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Gulliverians are most certainly allowed here, especially considering that this is my city now. If anything, you Lilliputians are the ones trespassing,\u201d the giant informed them. He smirked as he went on, \u201cAnd I\u2019m within my legal rights to deal with trespassers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two officers looked on in horror as the huge man raised one foot. The street was clogged with vehicles, so when the Gulliverian brought his foot down onto a city bus, there was nowhere for it to go. Several of the passengers tried to run toward the door, but the giant was already shifting his weight onto the vehicle. Metal screeched shrilly and the bus windows exploded outward, showering glass onto the street. Darren shrieked at the Gulliverian to stop, but the wailing of the passengers and the deep laughter of the giant drowned him out. The screaming stopped as the bus collapsed beneath the polished dress shoe, the Gulliverian\u2019s foot sinking into the asphalt as if it were soft mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren dropped the bullhorn and grabbed his gun with shaking hands. A split-second later, Kelly did the same thing. They fired, but the giant appeared to not even feel their bullets. Acting as if they didn\u2019t exist, the Gulliverian reached into his pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. There was a terrific whoosh as he lit a cigarette the size of a small tree. Only when he brought it to his mouth and inhaled did he seem to notice the two police officers shooting at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly cried out in terror as the giant grabbed them both.  Standing back up, their captor took another drag of his cigarette and regarded the officers on his palm. To Kelly\u2019s astonishment, Darren continued to address him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, you are endangering innocent people. You need to leave the city,\u201d her partner insisted. The giant didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he brought the cigarette down toward Darren, aiming the burning end straight at him. Kelly raised her hands to her mouth as the cigarette plowed into the other officer like a battering ram, the glowing tip driving deep into his chest. Darren\u2019s scream was almost inhuman as the cigarette burnt a gigantic hole through him. He was dead by the time that he fell over, his chest reduced to a blackened smoking hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, the giant tossed the cigarette aside, watching as it crashed into a highrise. Then the Gulliverian turned his attention to Kelly. She was too frightened to protest as he yanked at her uniform with his thumb and index finger, the fabric tearing and shredding as he tugged. With deft precision, his finger forced her bra off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to bring you back for my private collection,\u201d the giant said as she tried to cover her exposed breasts. He swatted away her hands with ease, pinching at one breast and then the other, as if testing their firmness. They were both swollen and bruised by the time he stopped and lowered her down to just below his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly began to whimper as he unzipped his pants and then shoved her in. The air inside smelled pungently musky, like her boyfriend\u2019s crotch when she took his penis into her mouth, although much stronger. She kicked with all of her strength, her feet striking a soft tower of flesh. His cock, she realized, and then he pressed her up against it, hard enough to almost break her ribs. The hand released her, leaving her to grip the titanic flaccid penis with her arms and legs. Below her was black nothingness and she knew that she would almost certainly die if she fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d advise that you hold on tightly,\u201d he said just before he zipped his pants back up, leaving her in humid darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled as he felt the bug-like woman holding on for dear life to his cock. His mind wandered back to Amanda, who was still waiting for him on the other side of the mountain range. It would be thrilling to see her flatten this city into atoms; yet, at the same time, he liked the thought of playing the rampaging giant. He finally decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From her position near the mountain range, Amanda could see the Lilliputian landscape stretching out all around her. Everything looked so tiny and the ground was little more than a patchwork of various shades of green with some tans thrown in. It sort of resembled the quilt that she had on her bed when she was a child, except when she leaned down close enough, she could make out buildings that were no bigger than large crumbs. She really hoped that there weren\u2019t any people in those houses and stores and offices and, if there were, she prayed that she wouldn\u2019t step on them by accident. This place was so microscopic, so frightfully breakable. Even now, she could see the meandering trail of her footprints leading up from the beach and she wondered if anyone had been beneath her feet when they had descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was unpleasant and so Amanda\u2019s mind turned to other things. Perhaps when this nasty business of dealing with Ashville was done, she and Seth could do something really romantic. They could go out to a club or see a movie or just stay at home and watch the ocean \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted when her phone rang. Amanda dug through her purse and found it, not surprised to see that it was Seth who was calling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need your help,\u201d he announced without even saying hello. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, immediately concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just need you to come here for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda found her white sandals in her handbag and after she had slipped them on, she stood up and effortlessly stepped over the little mountain range. On the other side of the mountains, the landscape changed suddenly. Instead of the green blanket of microscopic trees, there was a huge grid of crystalline structures, glittering in the afternoon light. It was such a tiny city, the largest skyscrapers the size of her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at the edge of the city, afraid to go any further. Just approaching Ashville had already had consequences. Each of her careful footsteps had caused earthquakes, the minuscule buildings at the outskirts of the city toppling and imploding as the ground heaved. Nervously, she chewed at one of her fingernails and glanced out, searching for her boyfriend. It didn\u2019t take long to find him. Seth looked adorable in his black suit, a giant compared to the Lilliputian skyscrapers around him. When he saw her, he gave her that devilishly charming smile and stretched his arms wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce this city is torn down, I can start construction on the summer house,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll need your help with demolishing this place, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda continued to gnaw worriedly at her fingernail. \u201cBut Seth\u2026aren\u2019t there people here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already left. The city is completely empty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief washed over her. She didn\u2019t mind destroying a few empty buildings, but she certainly didn\u2019t want to harm more people. With extreme concentration, she took a step into Ashville. Her right foot landed atop a park and several hotels, a visible shockwave radiating outwards. Everything beneath her sandal crumbled as though it were made of spun sugar instead of steel and concrete. Amanda felt a small amount of guilt, but she reminded herself that this city was deserted, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked on as Amanda gingerly stepped into the city, entire blocks crushed beneath her immense sandal. The sound of skyscrapers being compressed into thin metal sheets was deafening and made his ears ache, but he still felt his cock hardening. He was distantly aware that the Lilliputian police officer was still clinging onto him, scrabbling to hold on as his erection tented his pants. His focus was more on Amanda and her gargantuan foot, though. Lilliputians were fleeing in swarms from the giantess, grayish clouds of dust rising up from where her sandal had settled. Of course, she couldn\u2019t see all of those panicked people. To her, the city really was abandoned and she was completely unaware that she had just reduced thousands of Lilliputians to smears of organic matter beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians were unprepared as Amanda\u2019s other leg swung by overhead, her foot crashing down a mile or so away from its partner. People tried to run, but once the Brobdingnagian\u2019s ominous shadow fell over them, it was too late. The city trembled as Amanda\u2019s other foot wiped out a financial district, her astronomical weight causing the ground to crack wide open. Deep fissures snaked out across the city, large enough to swallow cars and people alike. Seth avoided one of those cracks, pausing long enough to see several screaming Lilliputians fall down into it. Then he headed toward Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered herself down, creating an impressive view for him and an even more astonishing one for the Lilliputians. Her crotch was positioned above several old factories, most of them burned-out shells. But the workers in those factories that were still functioning could see the erotic yet terrifying sight of her mammoth sex and ass, barely concealed by the lacy panties that she wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s erection was now so hard that it almost hurt. He squirmed slightly as he felt the Lilliputian officer pressed up against his pants, the cricket-sized woman making feeble cries of pain and fear. As he craned his head to admire Amanda\u2019s looming crotch above him, he gave the writhing little lump in his trousers a firm squeeze. The Lilliputian woman yelped and her movements became more frenzied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ignored the police officer, focusing his attention on his girlfriend. Past her enormous knees, he could see Amanda\u2019s gentle smile and innocent eyes as she peeked down at him. Ah, what a contradiction she was\u2026a death-goddess who killed without even knowing, a woman with nearly unlimited power but whose ambitions were so small and humble. Seth couldn\u2019t say that he loved many people besides himself, but as he gazed up into her wide eyes, he knew that he adored her. And more than anything at that moment, he wanted to revel in her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe sooner that we tear down this city, the sooner we can get back and do something fun. How about a concert? I can buy out any concert that you want,\u201d Seth told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? My own private concert? That\u2019d be great, Seth!\u201d Her smile was like a child\u2019s on Christmas day. Seth\u2019s own grin mirrored hers as she raised one hand, the fuchsia nails catching the sunlight just before she slammed her open palm down onto the city. The impact rocked nearby skyscrapers and a few even collapsed into their neighbors, causing a domino effect. Amanda continued to smile as she rubbed out the section of Ashville beneath her hand, extinguishing countless lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch casual death and destruction. Seth\u2019s entire body shuddered with pure, primal lust. For a second, he imagined himself Amanda\u2019s size. No, bigger than that. Big enough to embrace the entire world and rape it, over and over again. He nearly came then, but he drew a deep breath and motioned for Amanda to sit down instead. The giantess obeyed, her ass coming down on top of the buildings beneath her and smashing them deep into the bedrock below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth strolled between her legs, her mammoth thighs forming huge cliffaces around him. Before him was her sex, clearly defined against the white cloth of her underwear. To him, it was the size of a large cave; to the Lilliputians far, far below, it was taller than most of their highrises. Debris was piled up before Amanda, the remains of buildings and everything from cars to street lamps to mangled tiny corpses. Seth kicked the detritus aside as he approached his girlfriend\u2019s colossal pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your panties off,\u201d he ordered her as he unzipped his pants, grinning as her hands moved down to obey him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kelly heard the sound of the giant\u2019s zipper parting, she saw a glimmer of hope. Bright light and fresh air rushed into her humid prison. Just as her eyes adjusted to the light, however, she spotted a strange sight before her. Through the opening in the Gulliverian\u2019s pants, she could make out wet, reddish flesh, tons and tons of it. That\u2019s all that she could see, in fact. She was still trying to figure out what she was looking at when the giant bucked his hips, pitching her through the air. Kelly\u2019s had a few seconds to scream before she smacked into the crimson flesh, her shriek abruptly cut short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should have slid down the wall of flesh but she didn\u2019t. Sticky, clear goo adhered her in place and it took all of her strength just to move her head slightly. To her right, the giant was thrusting against the tremendous mass of flesh, groaning in time with his movements. Kelly still wasn\u2019t sure where the hell she was until she heard an even louder moan, this one drowning out the Gulliverian\u2019s cries. It was another person, she realized, and they were even bigger than the giant. As she glanced around further, she could see a vast opening that could have devoured entire Lilliputian neighborhoods. A woman, she thought. I\u2019m trapped on a Brobdingnagian woman\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant\u2019s thrusting sped up, his groans reduced to growls as he rammed his penis against the soft living mountain before him. The Brobdingnagian obviously felt his movements because she moaned again. A flood of warm secretions erupted from the flesh all around Kelly and she didn\u2019t even have time to struggle before the thick slime swept her away like a mite in molasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda\u2019s love juices dribbled down all around Seth, splattering onto the ground below and carrying away the debris at his feet. He came when he saw the tidal wave of her fluids filling the streets and drowning any of the Lilliputians unlucky enough to be mired in the pungent stuff. As Seth panted in pleasure, he looked up at Amanda, his innocent goddess. She had caused so much destruction already and his heart raced with excitement when he considered all of the things that she could do to this pathetic Lilliputian city\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHoney, we shouldn\u2019t do this out in the open,\u201d Amanda tried to stifle a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth pulled himself off Amanda\u2019s puffy labia, coating his pristine suit with her love secretions. He took a few steps back in order to see Amanda over her pelvic mound, plowing through a few Lilliputian shops in the process. The powdery rubble under his fancy dress shoes turned to goop as a gentle flood of Amanda\u2019s pussy juice poured onto the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re bashful,\u201d Seth said while stepping on a fleeing family van. \u201cBut we\u2019re alone out here. It\u2019s just you and me babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda gave her one-inch boyfriend a playful smile. She then pulled back her heels towards her ass, dragging her long feet across the cityscape. The destruction was palpable. Seth\u2019s throbbing member stained his underwear as he gazed at his girlfriend\u2019s feet. They were about ten times his height as they were long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wouldn\u2019t it be crazy if this abandoned Lilliputian city was populated?\u201d Seth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be horrible.\u201d Amanda frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would be able to live with myself if I stepped on defenseless Lilliputian city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, that would be horrible.\u201d Seth stroked his cock. \u201cCome on babe, you need to finish this so that we can get ready for the concert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood to her full height. Her white dress stretched and contoured to her body. She slipped on her sandals over a residential district, wiping all domestic life from thousands of loving Lilliputian families. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one-step forward, stepping right in front of Seth so that the arch of her foot was in front of him. The soles of her foamy sandals were half his height. He reached out and felt her soft sensitive skin. Seth looked around the neighborhood and then at Amanda\u2019s long feet. His heart rate went to overdrive as he tried to calculate the many lives were lost under Amanda\u2019s unaware feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda\u2019s smile was full of love as she proceeded to saunter around Ashville. Unable to move with his hard erection, Seth stared at his girlfriend\u2019s leg muscles flex and relax as she walked. Every deep <i>thu\u2019mm</i> of her steps caused Seth to twitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can make this go real fast.\u201d Amanda said as she reached the outskirts of the city. Ashville itself was modestly size city. It occupied an area similar to a large living room rug. Amanda started at the outermost part of this city and started circling in. Leaving rectangular round footprints were a happy little city once stood. \u201cThe Lilliputians are so cute. I wish I can meet some of them, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to see them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can arrange something if you really want to meet some Lilliputians.\u201d Seth said as Amanda continued her devastating destruction with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see them.\u201d Amanda stepped atop of the slums located near the base of the mountains. None of the poor structures passed the top of the foam soles. \u201cI might hurt the Lilliputians without knowing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took another step and stopped to admire her pedicure. The shiny pink polish differentiated itself against the greys of the city. She continued another lap and drew closer to the center, where skyscrapers strained to match the height of her ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth took off his jacket and let the lavish fabric drape across Ashville\u2019s fleeing citizens. Seth couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he felt structures implode under his leather dress shoes; it was as if the structures were made of Popsicle sticks. A few times, Seth had to jump down into one of Amanda\u2019s catastrophic footprints. The various hues of grey and brown were indiscernible to Seth, but what made him smile from ear to ear were the flattened Lilliputians. They looked like road kill, taking in the pattern from the underside of Amanda\u2019s sandal soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall skyscrapers were either two or three times Seth\u2019s height. He looked in wonder at the cars zipping between his feet and the swarms of screaming Lilliputians taking shelter back in the buildings they evacuated. Mass chaos ensued in the lobby of these downtown buildings as the heard of evacuees clashed with the heard of people trying to rush back in from the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chaos turned uniform when the saw an extravagant Gulliverian shoe crush a packed bus. The female Lilliputians let out high pitch squeals as glass from the bus shot outwards like an exploding aquarium, the male Lilliputians for the most part knocked each other over as they tried to clamor towards safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaggles of Lilliputians lost their footing and dropped to the ground, reaching out and grabbing other Lilliputians to break their fall\u2014it was like watching a set of dominoes fall one by one. Elevators strained to lift their packed cabs up to higher ground. Tight stairwells came to standstills, as the fleeing Lilliputians didn\u2019t know whether to go up or down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth loved it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slum district that disappeared under three steps from Amanda feet probably cost Seth the equivalent to his upscale bathroom back at his mansion. The endless rows of suburbs were as expensive as two of his <i>cheaper</i> cars. The business zone, to include the five skyscrapers, cost as much as complete wardrobe. Overall, Ashville was expensive, but only a fraction compared to Seth\u2019s vast wealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s hands dug into the corners of the nearby financial tower laden with reflective blue glass. He could see his handsomely cruel face in the mirrored windows as he began to push the building over. His feet dug into the Lilliputian street as if it were a gym mat as he put his weight and strength into toppling the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corners of the building under his hand broke off letting his hands go free, but his forward momentum meant that his face struck the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. Glass rained down onto the streets. Seth was starting to see red and began huffing and puffing. The tower stood tall and unfazed by Seth\u2019s attempt to topple it over. It was as if the building were mocking him with its superior height and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rippling sound filled Seth\u2019s ear\u2014the source of the sound came from high above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw everything,\u201d Amanda didn\u2019t attempt to hide her boisterous laugh. \u201cNeed some help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda balanced herself on one leg, sinking deeper into the ground as her whole body weight shifted. She raised her right foot, free from her sandal, right beside Seth and even gave him a gentle push out of the way. She then then splayed out her toes and jammed her big toe and second toe on either side of the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth could see the frantic Lilliputians from inside the building rush to the windows to see what was causing the violent quakes. The Lilliputians looked insignificant compared to Amanda\u2019s toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda gave her toes a squeeze. Steel groaned and glass shattered into trillions of pieces. The top of the building swayed back and forth and leaned over the gash Amanda\u2019s toes left. She removed her foot just in time to see the building collapse like a tree falling in the forest. The Lilliputians inside didn\u2019t know what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mighty building collapsed on the ground and managed to hold its form\u2014it more or less looked like a sack of potatoes. Some Lilliputians survived, but that was rendered moot as Amanda brought her foot down on the fallen building (only a third the length of her foot).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked on with a straight face. Amanda used next to no energy demolishing a proud building. A building he couldn\u2019t even make shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go tiny one.\u201d Amanda giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you stop messing around and get going with demolishing this shithole?\u201d Seth shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said, quit screwing around and destroy this fucking place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the language?\u201d Amanda asked with a soft, concerned voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you tiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up already.\u201d Seth had steam coming out of his ears. \u201cI\u2019ll take away the goddamn concert if you don\u2019t demolish this place in the next minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her breath, and with a look of a child being scolded, Amanda said \u201cmaybe I don\u2019t want a private concert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth starred back with no change in emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked down with eyes showing the first signs of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry honey,\u201d Amanda broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019ll do as you say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda\u2019s saunter around Ashville turned to destruction that was more clinical. The Lilliputians never stood a chance to her feet as she stomped and swiped her foot across the crumbling cityscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth let some of his rage by reaching into standing structures and grabbing Lilliputians by the handful. He proceeded with just squeezing their lives between his fingers. Seth walked away from the downtown district, no longer aroused, and no longer amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda returned to the downtown area after seeing Seth walk away and made quick work of the prominent skyscrapers. She flattened each one, one by one, as if crushing aluminum cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screaming ceased. The sirens from emergency vehicles ceased. The only sound that remained was the steady rumbling of flames in the distance. Ashville once stood on flat ground with crystalline towers, green patches of parks, and labyrinth like suburbs\u2014was now just dirt; similar to a tilled land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky turned orange as the sun lowered in the horizon. Seth looked up at Amanda who looked down with concern</span></div></div>",

Seth climbed aboard her trembling hand and then sat down with his back to Amanda. As if she were holding a mug with spilling hot coffee, Amanda rose up to her full height and walked out of the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you tiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that word again. It drove Seth insane. <i>Tiny</i>? Him? Tiny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you never to call me that.\u201d The one-inch man flipped around to face his 425-foot tall girlfriend. \u201cI\u2019m not <i>tiny</i>! Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded her head with quivering lips and glassy eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed as he looked up at his frail girlfriend. Although she was a Brobby, she sure acted small and fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen,\u201d Seth said, \u201cjust drop me off at my car. I\u2019ll call you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda lowered him next to his shiny red roadster by the beach. He fired up the car and dropped his foot on the accelerator. As the wheels spun in place, he could hear Amanda say \u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left her at the beach without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s car squealed and drifted into place in front of his mansion. He got out and slammed his door shut before racing up the marble steps to his home. The heavy wooden doors opened up before he reached them by his assistant, Evelyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome home, sir.\u201d She said with trepidation. \u201cI hope everythin\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo things Evie,\u201d he walked straight to his five-foot tall (with four-inch heels) assistant\u2014hired as his assistant primarily for her small stature. He looked down at her large pupils and relished her obedient attention. \u201cDraw me a bath and call Angelica and Caprice. I need them here fifteen minutes ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Evelyn took off like a sprinter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth watched her small ass scurry away behind a tight business skirt. She was dressed in a uniform one would wear at an upscale hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth took off his clothes as he walked up his grand staircase towards his master bedroom. He dropped everything on the floor as he walked; his tie, his shirt, undershirt, shoes with Lilliputian blood still on them, trousers, and precum stained underwear. Seth walked naked with his massive manhood swinging between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiny, smooth marble covered every inch of his wide-open bathroom. Chrome fixtures shined under the many lights spread across the room, including an extravagant crystal chandelier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn turned the golden knobs to stop the flow of water into Seth\u2019s glossy white bathtub. Large clean mirrors hung on every wall and reflected Seth\u2019s nudeness as he stepped in. Evelyn saw his reflection and shut her eyes in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d Evelyn squeaked. \u201cI just got off the phone with the girls you requested. They will be here in less than fifteen minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s bare feet slapped against the smooth surface of his marbled floor. He walked right up to Evelyn and moved his hand behind her head. He stroked her long hair twice before grabbing a fistful and pulling back. Evelyn yelped as she felt her head jerk back. Tears squirted out from the jolt of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I wanted them here fifteen minutes ago, Evie.\u201d Seth looked down at his little assistant as she squirmed within his grasp. His plump cock grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize sir,\u201d Evelyn cried a little more as Seth pulled her hair even tighter. \u201cI\u2019ll call them back and tell them to hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth pushed Evelyn back, causing her to fall into his full bathtub\u2014a bathtub large enough to hold five people comfortably. Evelyn pushed herself above the water and gasped. Her professional looking uniform was ruined and soaking wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of my tub Evie.\u201d Seth said in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Evelyn coughed up water. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Seth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth? What, we\u2019re on first name basis now?\u201d He asked, irked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth reached in and pulled Evelyn out from under her armpits. He swung her out of the tub and held her in front of him. She was light even with wet clothes. Her soaked hair clung to the front of her face. Water pooled on the floor of his bathroom, wetting his bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Evie.\u201d Seth lowered her to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bad day and I don\u2019t mean to take it out you. You\u2019re the best assistant I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn couldn\u2019t look up at him, so he used his finger to lift her chin up. Her eyes showed she was hurt and afraid of Seth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like my car right?\u201d Seth said. \u201cThe red one? I\u2019ve heard you talking to your friends about it. Well, it\u2019s yours. You can have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn sensed a trick. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes really. For me being a jerk to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile appeared on Evelyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow go change. And send the girls up here when they arrive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn hurried out of the bathroom leaving Seth alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was hot. It took Seth a few moments before he got in all the way in, adjusting his body to the steaming hot water. He leaned back into the tub and lowered himself all the way to his chin. His eyes grew heavy and closed after a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey big guy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth didn\u2019t need to open his eyes to know who it was. He recognized Caprice\u2019s feminine voice as she entered his lavish bathroom, followed by Angelica. Seth opened his eyes and looked up at his sexy girls, dressed in tight little dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to join me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls took off their clothes and their lacey heels. Caprice was the first to enter the tub. She snuggled her naked body against Seth. Angelica had a similar body to Evelyn, but looked more exotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was so important that we had to rush over here?\u201d Caprice asked, running her fingers through his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth wrapped an arm around Caprice and pulled her closer to his body. They made skin-to-skin contact underwater, which caused Seth to grow more excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmanda and I got into a fight.\u201d Seth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d Caprice leaned into Seth and locked lips with him. \u201cI thought you two were perfect for each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth continued to kiss Caprice and feel her tight ass with his wondering hands. Angelica swam over and went straight to stroking Seth\u2019s cock. Seth moaned in approval as he continued to kiss Caprice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you two fight about?\u201d Angelica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your goddamn business.\u201d Seth snarled before returning his kisses with Caprice. \u201cI knocked over a Lilliputian skyscraper today.\u201d He said to Caprice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, really?\u201d Caprice said in surprise. \u201cWhere there any Lilliputians inside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThousands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica could feel Seth\u2019s cock getting bigger within her skinny hand. She used her free hand to cup his balls and play with them. Seth enjoyed the feel her tiny hands against his enormous member but continued fondling and kissing Caprice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so impressive,\u201d Caprice said. \u201cI wish I could have seen it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was amazing. There were thousands of them running away from me as played in Ashville.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet, who wouldn\u2019t be scared of giant guy like you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m huge compared to them.\u201d Seth was growing more and more excited. He buzzed the intercom near the tub and told Evelyn to bring up his special box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth reached over and pulled Angelica up to his lips for a kiss. He then lifted her over his body and brought her down beside Caprice. The two girls knew what to do and started kissing each other for Seth\u2019s amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn appeared in dry clothes holding a cherry wooden box. The action going in the tub didn\u2019t faze her at all. She set the box down and asked if she could get anything else. Seth dismissed her and she scurried out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d Caprice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yea.\u201d Seth opened the box and pulled out a struggling male Lilliputian. \u201cAngelica, you were playing with my cock, who\u2019s bigger? Me or this thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica grinned and looked over the Lilliputian. She pulled his pants and underwear off and looked up and down his body. She held back a giggle as she saw his miniscule cock within his black pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so much bigger Seth.\u201d Angelica kissed Seth. \u201cEven if he was a Gulliverian, you\u2019d still be so much bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s eyes grew heavy as Angelica found his hardening cock underwater. He flipped the screaming Lilliputian towards him and then curled his fingers. He increased the strength of his grip until he felt the first crack and then stopped. He looked at his fist and felt the feeble man squirming for his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputian\u2019s struggles grew weaker. Seth squeezed harder and solicited renewed struggles and another cracked rib. The male Lilliputian went limp and lifeless. Seth threw the Lilliputian towards the open toilet and missed. His body plopped on the hard ground, staining the marble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so hot.\u201d Caprice straddled Seth and pulled out a female Lilliputian from the box. \u201cWhat do you want me to do with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth loved the screams coming from the one-inch woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat her?\u201d Seth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaprice yanked the clothing off the woman and then popped her in her mouth. Seth pulled Caprice down for a kiss and felt around the female Lilliputian with his tongue. Caprice opened her eyes and stared back at Seth. With a sultry look, she sucked on the Lilliputian, swallowing her whole.</span></div></div>",

Her pussy lips kissed the length of his engorged cock. \u201cI wish I could have been with you at Ashville.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Seth kissed her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could step on thousands of Lilliputians for your entertainment.\u201d Caprice went on a kissing spree from his lips and down to his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his throbbing cock get harder to the point of pain. As much as he wanted to fuck Caprice\u2014he didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t even kiss her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmanda destroyed Ashville for me.\u201d He admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea,\u201d he sighed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even know it, but she killed everybody in that city today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Caprice said. \u201cI was just joking, but\u2026did she really do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, she\u2019s great.\u201d Seth stared off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaprice lowered herself for another kiss, but Seth wasn\u2019t all there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d Seth pushed her off him. Her whole body submerged into the bathwater as Seth got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth, what the hell?\u201d Caprice got up from the tub. Angelica got out as well and stood behind her friend. \u201cYou called us for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, and then I changed my fucking mind. Can\u2019t I change my mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yea, but\u2026come on, you got me all horny.\u201d Caprice cocked her head to the side and looked up adoringly to Seth. She played with the front of his white bathrobe he slipped on seconds earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a girlfriend, Caprice.\u201d He played with her hair and hooked a lock behind her ears. \u201cA very gigantic girlfriend I might add.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be the gigantic one.\u201d Caprice said. \u201cYou deserve it after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica, who wasn\u2019t much of a talker, grabbed the forgotten wooden box and walked up to Seth. \u201cI know how you can feel gigantic.\u201d Angelica lifted a female Lilliputian from the box and held her struggling form next to her unsure smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed as he took the crying Lilliputian woman between his fingers. \u201cThis is how small I look to Amanda.\u201d He let go of the Lilliputian and watched her splatter the floor between all their bare feet. \u201cI wish I was bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re bigger than you think.\u201d Caprice took his hand and guided him to the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s bed was an oversized King-sized bed with plush pillow tops, satin sheets, and dozens of pillows of various sizes. All the bed sheets were alabaster white and contrasted against Caprice\u2019s tanned skin. Her body sunk into the bed. Small pillows and the white sheets spilled over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngie, pour the Lilliputians on me.\u201d Caprice begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica obeyed and poured five Lilliputians over Caprice\u2019s torso. She moaned as she felt the Lilliputians tumbling over her body. Angelica climbed on top of the large bed and got on top of Caprice, leaving a small gap between both girls\u2019 stomach. They both embraced in a kiss and stoked each other\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth wanted to fuck them <i>so</i> bad. He had in the past before he met Amanda. Seth turned and looked out his bedroom window and watched the shiny stars twinkle by the millions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth, darling.\u201d Caprice said. \u201cI need someone big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s cock would not let up. It pressed against his robe and dribbled with precum. The moans from the girls increased as they continued to fondle and kiss each other. It\u2019s been a long time since Seth fucked a woman his size. Sexy times with Amanda were just as great, but he hadn\u2019t had a pussy that could grip and squeeze his cock in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Seth was lost for words as Angelica shoved a male Lilliputian into Caprice\u2019s pussy. \u201cMaybe we can have some fun. But no fucking\u2014I got a girlfriend after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaprice moaned as she nodded. Seth let his robe fall to his feet as he got up on his bed. He got down next to Caprice and started kissing her. Angelica slithered her way between Seth\u2019s legs and started sucking his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians that were on Caprice were now scattered on the bed, trying to escape. Seth felt one of them trying to squirm out from under his ass. Seth shifted himself on the bed while kissing Caprice. The one-inch thing fell between his crack. Seth clenched his muscular gluts until he felt the struggling thing crack within his butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Seth knew it, Caprice was on top of him and kissing him with uncontrollable lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis guy inside me isn\u2019t doing it,\u201d Caprice said between kisses. \u201cI need a giant inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said no fucking, Caprice.\u201d Seth kissed her more. \u201cI got a girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on babe, she\u2019ll never know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica held the base of Seth\u2019s cock. With her other hand, she parted Caprice\u2019s labia and guided her lower onto the cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do this Caprice,\u201d Seth said as he felt the tip of his cock get wet from Caprice\u2019s furnace hot pussy. \u201cMy girlfriend will get mad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, I won\u2019t tell.\u201d She lowered herself more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth tried to push her off with weak arms, but Caprice was determined with Seth getting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop.\u201d Seth wasn\u2019t convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaprice yelped as she brought herself all the way down on Seth. She let out a high pitch moan as she felt the Lilliputian inside her get rammed into her cervix. Seth\u2019s cock stretched the walls of her vagina much more than the Lilliputian ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth placed his hands on Caprice\u2019s hips and guided her up and down his cock. He moaned and grunted as he felt the sensitive tip of his penis pulverize the Lilliputian male. Right before he felt like climaxing, Seth pushed Caprice off him and motioned for Angelica to climb on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother heavy moan escaped Seth as he entered Angelica\u2019s tight pussy. Caprice got up and swung her legs over so that her knees were on either side of Seth\u2019s head. Seth could hear Angelica and Caprice kissing. He started eating out Caprice as she lowered her pussy to his mouth. He sucked on her labia and ran his tongue across her clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica bounced up and down on Seth\u2019s cock, while Seth sucked harder and harder on Caprice\u2019s pussy. The Lilliputian man found himself transferred from Caprice\u2019s sticky pussy to Seth\u2019s wet mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was amazed to find the Lilliputian still alive. He swallowed him and continued to lick Caprice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey switched positions. Caprice was on her back with a fluffy pillow on her ass. Seth was on his knees, fucking her while kissing Angelica. Caprice leaned forward and pulled Seth down for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to destroy a city with you.\u201d Caprice moaned. \u201cI want to see your godlike body being worshipped by thousands.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She dangled the flailing woman over Caprice\u2019s mouth before letting go. Caprice gobbled up the Lilliputian and returned to kissing Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarling, can I ask you for a gift?\u201d Caprice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d His thrusting slowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have that car that\u2019s parked in the front?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, sure.\u201d Seth was on the verge of climaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t mind if you bought me a new house.\u201d Caprice kissed Seth. \u201cMy condo is getting too small for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you whatever you want.\u201d Seth moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a new purse full of Lilliputians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth nodded and with one final thrust, came to an explosive orgasm. He shot out streams and streams of hot cum inside Caprice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Seth rolled off Caprice and gasped alongside her. Caprice buzzed the intercom and instructed Evelyn to bring up a large bottle of wine with three glasses. Angelica went down on Seth and lapped up all the leftover sexual juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so bad. And Amanda never has to find out.\u201d Caprice kissed his sweaty forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Seth opened his eyes wide. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn came inside the bedroom holding a tray with a bottle of wine and three clear glasses. She set the tray on a glossy wooden table and poured the drinks. She tried to ignore the three naked people on the bed\u2014though she snuck a few peeks at Angelica sucking her employer\u2019s soft cock. Evelyn excused herself and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth didn\u2019t drink any wine. The girls drank their portion plus Seth\u2019s glass. The girls talked to each other about various topics that didn\u2019t interest Seth. Caprice kept going on and on about the car, house, and purse he promised to buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was lost for words. He simply looked up at the ceiling and thought of Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threesome fell asleep, their naked bodies rubbing against one another. Seth was the last to shut his eyes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A pounding sound against the bedroom window awoke the threesome at once. It was sometime in the morning as evident from the light streaming in from outside. Evelyn burst into the bedroom with fear just as Seth was climbing out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, Amanda is outside.\u201d Evelyn said short of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Was all he was able to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth grabbed his bathrobe, told the girls to stay put, and ran downstairs. He exited the rear of his mansion where he met up with Amanda\u2019s bare feet. She wore a green bikini and was wet\u2014Amanda often times swam to Seth\u2019s private beach from her hometown. Evelyn had followed Seth out, but stood still at the steps that led to the sandy beach. She held her hands together in front of her hips, awaiting any direction from Seth. She couldn\u2019t help but quake under Amanda\u2019s shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe!\u201d Seth tried to sound excited, but couldn\u2019t mask the tremble in his speech. \u201cWhat are you doing here so early in the morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came for the truth Seth.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh fuck. Shit, shit, shit. How does she know I cheated on her? Shit, fuck.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshville wasn\u2019t deserted like you said.\u201d Amanda crossed her arms in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed in relief. \u201cOh, that? I thought you were mad abou\u2014I mean, what do you mean Ashville wasn\u2019t deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda lowered herself so that she was on her knees and sat back on her heels. The breeze from the ocean caused her to shiver due to her wet skin. She looked down at her one-inch boyfriend wearing his favorite bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may be trusting honey, but I\u2019m not na\u00efve.\u201d She said. \u201cI know you can see Lilliputians\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d She paused for a moment. It looked like there was a cry moments away on her face. \u201cWhy\u2014\u201c She gulped. \u201cWhy would you make me destroy a populated city?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were trespassers!\u201d Seth let out a maniacal laugh. \u201cThat city was my property and gave them all eviction notices. I\u2019m fully within the law to deal with trespassers as I see fit\u2014even if it means using deadly force.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what I was?\u201d She asked. \u201cDeadly force? Why didn\u2019t you tell me there were Lilliputians there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t have gone through with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you lied to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda\u2019s lips quivered. \u201cI killed almost a million people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou killed over a million <i>Lilliputians</i>. Don\u2019t think of them as people.\u201d He walked closer to Amanda\u2019s knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I think of them as people? To make what I\u2019ve done seem harmless? Irrelevant?\u201d Amanda\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cThey\u2019re people, and I killed them without knowing it. I didn\u2019t even give them a chance to escape me.\u201d Streams came down over her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrying ain\u2019t going to bring them back.\u201d Seth patted her kneecap, which looked like a boulder to him. \u201cNow how about that private concert? You want to do it tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you get so mad at me last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for fucks sake, Amanda.\u201d Seth walked off a few feet from Amanda\u2019s knees. \u201cJust let it go already. What\u2019s happened in the past, happened. It\u2019s done. We can\u2019t go back in time and change anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI called you tiny, and you got mad at me even after I said I was sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay. I was mad. Now I\u2019m not mad. Can you just drop it already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda soaked in the words her boyfriend was saying. It was nothing new. She thought the first time he had an outburst was just a one-time thing. However, Seth was really showing his true colors. His wild mood swings and outbursts were just a preview of things to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement coming Seth\u2019s bedroom window caught her eye. Seth followed her eyes to the bedroom then back at her. He mouthed <i>shit</i> when he realized what it was. This made Amanda think he was hiding something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom was on the second floor, which stood about six inches from the ground. Amanda shuffled forward, avoiding Seth and broke his glass windows opened with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Seth yelled out. \u201cAmanda, babe, let\u2019s go to that concert. Babe, I\u2019m sorry. Honey, get out of there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda ignored him and peered into the bedroom. A tiny woman that was about \u00be of an inch tall stood stupefied in the middle of the room, starring back at the shocked giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the crack of a whip, Amanda reached in and plucked Angelica from the bedroom who was still nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d Amanda was no longer crying. Instead, she was red\u2014seething red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d Seth sensed the giantess wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cShe\u2019s my cousin, she\u2019s just visiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re bedroom? Naked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014uh, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing there. What were you doing there, uh Cindy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda\u2019s eye twitched with anger. She saw Evelyn still standing obediently at the rear of the mansion. She plucked up Evelyn with her free hand and held her in the middle of her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this woman, Evie?\u201d Amanda growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting sick and tired of people lying to me.\u201d Amanda\u2019s hot breath slammed into Evelyn. \u201cWho is this woman and why is she naked in Seth\u2019s bedroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d Evelyn cried. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was holding Angelica by the waist and gave a squeeze in frustration. She then started rotating her palm with Evelyn on it. Evelyn sensed what Amanda was doing. If she kept rotating her hand, then Evelyn would fall off her hand and plummet 150 feet to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Evelyn cried out more. \u201cPlease, Amanda, don\u2019t do this. You\u2019re a nice person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me who she is.\u201d Amanda almost yelled at the tiny woman in her vast palm. In fact, Evelyn was smaller than Angelica and looked ten times as fragile. \u201cTell me who she is, or I\u2019ll drop you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Angelica. She\u2019s an escort that Seth calls sometimes for sex.\u201d Evelyn blurted out as she saw a glimpse of the ground over the edge of Amanda\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Amanda was at a lost. She returned her palm parallel with the ground. \u201cDid they have sex last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn wanted to look at Seth for a clue as to what to say, but she couldn\u2019t see him anywhere. She looked at Amanda\u2019s face and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda went through a hundred emotions just then. She looked down at the shivering Evelyn and then at Angelica who started fighting her massive fingers. Then down at Seth who stared back up with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just lie and lie.\u201d Amanda said to Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set both girls down next to Seth. Amanda got up to her full height. The three of them on the ground could only look up at Amanda\u2019s perfect body and only guess what she will do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she did it. </span></div></div>",

The foot stomp was enough to knock Evelyn back, losing her heels in the sand in the process. She was still alive. A plum of white sand landed on her. Evelyn got back up and saw Amanda\u2019s toe right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn\u2019s body shook uncontrollably as she came so close to death. <i>I\u2019m still alive</i>, she had to remind herself. Amanda wasn\u2019t mad at her! She did good! Evelyn looked around and could see Seth getting back on his feet, his robe almost falling off. Evelyn looked around for Angelica but couldn\u2019t see her anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sand under the ball of Amanda\u2019s foot started to stain red outwards. Evelyn breathing went into overdrive as she realized Amanda had crushed Angelica right in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn screamed. She screamed as if she was being tortured. \u201cOh, god, oh god! She\u2019s dead.\u201d Evelyn ran back into the mansion with her arms in the air flailing about. She couldn\u2019t control her screams and cries. \u201cShe killed her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that for?\u201d Seth yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d Amanda lifted her heel and grinded the ball of her foot into the sand. \u201cShe was just a <i>Gulliverian</i>. Not like she was person or anything.\u201d Amanda looked like she had a glow about her. A powerful glow that Seth could feel radiating out of her body. His cock stirred under his robe. He wanted her more than ever. He wanted to make love to Amanda right then. \u201cDon\u2019t ever call me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda spun around and headed into the ocean. Her gigantic body displaced millions of gallons of water as her long legs thrust her deeper into the ocean. Seth was left of a view of her bikini-clad ass sailing away towards the horizon. Her long feet that were responsible for so many lives crashed into the surface of the ocean as she propelled herself away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of ocean water flooded the beach and even reached Seth where he stood. The ocean water washed away the bloodstained sand where Angelica once stood. Just a fading memory was all that was left of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn sat on comfortable bench at the foot of the grand staircase. She had tissues in her hands as she cried out a waterfall. The image of Amanda\u2019s toes haunter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth came inside the house and went straight for his bedroom. Caprice was dressed in her clothes from the previous night and heading down the stairs. Seth and Caprice exchanged sullen looks as he went up and she went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaprice\u2019s lacey heels clanked on the polished stone floor that covered the entrance to the mansion. She heard Evelyn sobbing near the staircase and walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up Evie,\u201d Caprice said in her authoritative tone. \u201cSince my counterpart is squished, I\u2019ll be taking her fee, as well as mine, to my account.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn looked up dumbstruck by Caprice\u2019s attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeth promised me the red car parked outside, so I need those car keys now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn stood up on her bare feet\u2014she was looking extra small without her heels. The top of her head didn\u2019t even reach the bottom of Caprice\u2019s breasts. \u201cSeth gave me that car.\u201d She heard herself say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he gave that car to me.\u201d Caprice smiled. \u201cNow get me the fucking car keys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn\u2019s lips twitched. Having come so close to death was still affecting her\u2014not to mention the whole extortion for information bit. Evelyn really thought Amanda was one of the nicest Brobdingnagian she\u2019s ever met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my car.\u201d Evelyn cried with streams of tears pouring out of her eyes. \u201cHe gave it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaprice grabbed the little girl\u2019s hair and yanked it upwards. Evelyn cried out even more and tried to fight the bigger girl, but it was obvious she was far too weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet it through your fucking skull,\u201d Caprice snarled. \u201cIt\u2019s my car now and if you don\u2019t get me the fucking keys, I\u2019m going to ram the spikes of my heels through your eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaprice pulled Evelyn\u2019s hair to the side with a jolt, causing Evelyn to fall on the ground. She continued crying in pain and begging for Caprice to stop. Caprice walked over to Evelyn\u2019s face. Evelyn brushed her hair back and saw Caprice\u2019s toes within the slutty heels. Caprice\u2019s toes reminded Evelyn of Amanda\u2019s crushing feet, making Evelyn shake on the floor. Caprice wasted no time and brought her foot over Evelyn\u2019s temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe keys, Evie.\u201d Caprice started putting more weight on Evelyn\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn cried and fished out the keys from her business skirt. She raised her hand with the key and felt Caprice swiping it from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally.\u201d Caprice removed her foot from Evelyn. \u201cLater bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn didn\u2019t get up from the cold ground. She continued to sob and form a puddle of her tears on the floor. She later heard her former car drive away from the mansion with music blasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never got a chance to drive it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sat alone on his bed. He should have been happy. He was a young bachelor with more money than he knew what to do with. He had a fantastic home, a hot fuck buddy, and no care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wanted Amanda. And it was becoming apparent he couldn\u2019t buy her love anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a noise at the entrance of his room and looked over. It was Evelyn. She looked rough and was still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Evie?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d Evelyn sniffed up her boogers and walked in front of Seth. Even though he was seated, she was still shorter than he was. \u201cCaprice took my car. She said you gave it to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yea. I guess I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026sir, you promised that car to me.\u201d She whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, and then I gave it to Caprice. Sorry.\u201d Seth couldn\u2019t care less about the car. He had other things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I gave away your fucking car.\u201d Seth got up on his feet. He towered over Evelyn\u2019s diminutive frame. She backed up and raised an arm to shield herself from Seth. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking believe you right now. You had Angelica killed and now you\u2019re bitching about a car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmanda would have killed me if I didn\u2019t say the truth.\u201d Evelyn\u2019s voice wavered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth grabbed her by the neck and brought her to the bed. The veins in his forearms grew as wrapped his fingers around Evelyn\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat makes you think <i>I</i> won\u2019t kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought,\u201d Evelyn was turning purple and coughing. She tried to push Seth\u2019s arm away but it was futile. \u201cI thought you loved me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth thought about this and removed his hand from her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoddamnit, what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d He grabbed a golden lamp on the nightstand and threw it against the wall. He then flipped the nightstand over. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, Evie.\u201d Seth huffed and puffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Evelyn said in the dead quiet room. \u201cI want you to love me. I thought when you gave me the car\u2026that you loved me. Why did you give it to Caprice?\u201d She sobbed. \u201cYou don\u2019t like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I like you.\u201d Seth sat on the bed next to Evelyn. He wrapped an arm around her and brought her close to his chest. \u201cWhat will convince you that I like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn sniffled. \u201cKiss me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth gave her a peck on the cheeks\u2026then a kiss on the lips. </span></div></div>",

His company sold equipment and weapons to the militaries around the world\u2014and not just to the Gulliverians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conference room had one wall made of glass, giving everybody a spectacular view of the city from the 23rd floor. The table was made of mahogany and stretched from one end of the room to the other. Twenty executives attended the meeting with Seth sitting on the front, leading the day\u2019s agenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA portly fellow by the name of Louis led the R&amp;D department. The department enjoyed a vast budget but came with Seth\u2019s close eyes on them. For years, Seth had pushed R&amp;D to develop cross class changing technology. Size changing. That\u2019s all Seth ever wanted from them, but they have consistently failed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I am happy to report we have moved project X-3 from experimental to testing.\u201d Louis waited for approval from his boss, but Seth just sat there with a skeptical look. \u201cThe biggest problem with changing one\u2019s size from a Lilliputian to Gulliverian\u2014or even a Brobdingnagian\u2014is the need for an incredible amount of energy. We have tried nuclear power to feed the growths, but we\u2019ve had\u2014far too many incidents with radioactive material.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this.\u201d Seth said. \u201cGet to the good part.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I told the research team to forego nuclear and think about one to one substitutes. Think about it this way, if a Lilliputian wants to become a Gulliverian, like us, then all we have to do is find a Gulliverian that wants to be a Lilliputian. Using our displacement machine, we can take the matter from the Gulliverian, turn to energy, and then feed it into the Lilliputian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth leaned over the table. Louis finally got his attention. \u201cWill it work with a Gulliverian and Brobdingnagian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it will! One to one conversion is all that is required. We can even go Lilliputian and Brobdingnagian conversions. We just need a volunteer willing to give up their size.\u201d Louis walked around the room and continued his talk. \u201cI imagine a world where we can bring all races of people closer together. Imagine giving a Lilliputian just graduating high school a chance to start a new life as Brobdingnagian. Or even better, we can take the energy created from making someone small and feed it back it to the power grid. We would be able to lessen our dependence on fossil fuels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to make me a Brobdingnagian.\u201d Seth said. \u201cMe and my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth walked past his secretary and into his lavish office. \u201cEvie?\u201d He asked. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn held a bottle of wine and walked up to Seth, wearing high heels with two-inch platforms and six-inch heels. She was still short compared to Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to surprise my husband with lunch.\u201d She reached up for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth wrapped his arms around his tiny wife and gave her small butt a squeeze. He stood back up and looked down at his cute wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I got a bigger surprise, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yea?\u201d They both sat on his couch near a bookshelf. \u201cWhat kinda surprise do you got?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to grow into a Brobdingnagian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn laughed. \u201cWhat? There\u2019s no such thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is. My company just made the tech. By this time tomorrow, you and I will be huge Brobdingnagians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Evelyn was half-naked and riding on top of her husband\u2019s cock while they fucked on his office couch. They didn\u2019t try to hide their passion. They wanted the whole building to hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Seth arrived on the company island, ready for the size change. The testing area was out in the open, on an expansive flat tarmac field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I beg you, let us run the tests on other people.\u201d Louis said as he tried to keep up with Seth\u2019s brisk pace. \u201cYou needn\u2019t risk your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me you already ran the test with different sized animals, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they all grew and shrank successfully? Correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen run the goddamn test on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t done the size change with humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now you will. I will be the first person born a Gulliverian to grow into a Brobdingnagian.\u201d Seth smiled malevolently. \u201cCome on, get this going. I want to surprise Evie before she gets here. You got a male and female Brobbies, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, we did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they want to become Gulliverians?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the sum we offered, yes. They are willing to shrink themselves. The male subject should be arriving soon. His female counterpart will show up later when your wife arrives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone on the tarmac felt the deep booms. Seth took in a long breath as he remembered Amanda. He remembered her booming footsteps even when she was trying to be careful with her steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the horizon, Seth and all the Gulliverian employees could see the giant approaching. He had an olive colored skin and wore only a short bathing suit. His quadriceps were defined and bulging. His stomach rippled with a six-pack. In addition, his lats flared out like wings. Seth could tell the Brobby worked out hard to keep his body immaculate. Seth reminded himself he had to do the same when he grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut of curiosity Louis, what are the names of the Brobbies coming in today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis gentleman here is Jacob.\u201d Louis looked at his clipboard. \u201cAnd the name of the female is Samantha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Seth had two things to do after growing huge: get muscles and show them off to Amanda. He couldn\u2019t wait to see the look on her face when he shows up bigger than she is. He was going to rub everything in her face; his vast wealth and his huge stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dudes,\u201d Jacob said in stereotypical surfer speech. \u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis flipped on his headset and spoke, \u201cover on the big red X.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Jacob\u2019s feet thudded across the tarmac as Gulliverian scrambled away from his huge peds. The floor cracked and buckled under his extraordinary weight, mainly caused by heavy muscles he was packing. \u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019 everybody?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis turned to Seth and shook his hand. \u201cGood luck sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work Louis,\u201d Seth kept shaking his hand. \u201cI will kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope it does!\u201d Louis gave out a fake laugh. \u201cOh, before I forget, both of you will have to get naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Seth nor Jacob had a problem getting naked in front of everyone. Though Seth grew a little envious at the size of Jacob\u2019s cock. In fact, everyone grew jealous of Jacobs\u2019s huge flaccid cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resizing cannons were the size of a school bus. One pointed at Jacob and the other at Seth. They looked like comical artillery guns with copper tubing going around the barrel. Thick, black cables came off the cannons and fed into an electrical substation with banks and banks of large power arrays capable of storing immense amounts energy for a second. As soon as the mass was taken from Jacob, it would feed into the power array and shoot Seth, turning the energy back to mass. It was possible that Seth would <i>steal</i> some, if not all, of Jacob\u2019s muscle mass in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady gentlemen?\u201d Louis shouted over the hum of the cannons. Steam shot out the sides of the cannons as water flowed inside the various compartments to keep it cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady.\u201d Seth shouted, starring at the dark barrel of the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it, bruh.\u201d Jacob said with excitement, but felt uneasy that the cannon was pointed at his junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis counted down from five. When he hit one, he pushed a red button on a remote. </span></div></div>",

The ground quaked as energy travelled through the substation causing a few transformers to explode. Beams of yellow light with sprinkles in it, struck both Jacob and Seth at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt fantastic. As if, every cell in his body danced with excitement. Then it felt like his cells shriveled. The atoms in his body disappearing. The world expanding around him. Something wasn\u2019t right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gulliverian workers screamed at each other as the cannons faulted. The electrical substation popped and erupted in flames. The cannons stopped firing and swiveled within their platform. More sparks and rays of light shot out in every direction. Three Gulliverians were sliced in half as the rays of light acted like high beam lasers. Another explosion came from the underground aquifer causing everyone to lose their footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Jacob. \u201cWow.\u201d Was all he said as he stood still. The Gulliverians ran around his feet as if they were on fire. In fact, some of them were on fire. \u201cHey I didn\u2019t shrink guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob watched as the substation shot out a firework display of lights and sparks. The cannons were going haywire with steam popping out from his rivets. The guns then seemed to melt. The black metal of the cannons turned orange as they reached a melting hot temperature. The ground underneath the cannons seemed to sink as the cannons went were sucked into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look right.\u201d Jacob still hadn\u2019t moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cannons sunk into the ground as fissures cracked throughout the tarmac. A few unlucky Gulliverian workers fell into these fissures as they webbed outwards from each cannon. Looking into the crack of the fissures, Jacob could see molten lava deep undergraound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody help me!\u201d Seth yelled out, but he was far too small and the sounds of the catastrophe going on were far too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob felt strange. He felt the presence of Seth nearby but couldn\u2019t see him on the ground. The area he was standing was still there. It had a little red X where Seth once stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you there tiny dude?\u201d Jacob knelt down but couldn\u2019t see a thing. \u201cIf you\u2019re there, don\u2019t move.\u201d Jacob bore his fingers into the ground far from the little red X. He then pulled up, taking a huge chunk of land\u2014the size of dinner plate\u2014up with him. \u201cI hope I got you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob walked off the island and entered the ocean\u2014the waterline was just above his pelvic bone. More explosions went off on the island, as it seemed to sink on itself. Some of the smarter Gulliverians escaped and jumped into the ocean. The unfortunate ones, like Louis, were caught up by the unexpected fissures and fell straight to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Was it?\u201d Jacob asked the slab of land between his mighty fingers. If Seth were on the slab of land, neither of them would hear each other because they weren\u2019t wearing any headsets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob spotted a large Gulliverian yacht and waded off towards it. \u201cAhoy!\u201d He heard the ship\u2019s captain shout out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo.\u201d Jacob said. \u201cHey dudes, there was an accident on that island. You should call the military or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Evelyn came to the railing of the yacht and looked out in fear. She couldn\u2019t see the island from where they were out in the ocean. \u201cIs Seth okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you guys.\u201d Jacob shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew of the yacht went to the stern of the ship and opened up a hidden compartment in the ground, revealing one Brobby size earpiece. Jacob held the slab of land carefully as he put in the one earpiece into his left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear you.\u201d Evelyn shouted. \u201cWhat happened? Where\u2019s Seth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, I don\u2019t know what happened. We were about to the size change thing when everything went ape shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Seth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that the guy that was trading sizes with me? I think he\u2019s on the piece of cement I pulled from the ground.\u201d Jacob lowered the slab of land next to the yacht. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn looked at the flat piece of tarmac and didn\u2019t see her husband anywhere. \u201cI don\u2019t see him anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he shrunk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn motioned Jacob to bring the piece closer to the ship. She climbed on top and dropped to her knees. She looked at every inch of the tarmac, looking for her husband. \u201cOh my god, Seth!\u201d Jacob twitched as he heard Evelyn\u2019s squeal. She scooped up her one-inch husband from the floor and lifted him to his eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob followed the yacht back to the docks. Seth didn\u2019t say anything. He couldn\u2019t come to terms with what happened. He was sitting on the palms of his petite wife. Evie of all people looked like a giantess to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn my dick looks huge.\u201d Jacob said as he walked up on shore. He then let out a laugh. \u201cYou know what? I think my dick got bigger because Seth shrunk. Haha, what luck, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s nose flared as he heard the dumb giant talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey ship guys, can you call my girlfriend and tell her where I\u2019m at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob gave the number to the crew. They dialed the number and patched his headset to the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay dear.\u201d Evelyn tried to console her tiny husband. \u201cYou\u2019re still big in my books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me, Evie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. It\u2019s not like I called you tiny.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth wanted to jump off her hand and strangle her neck. But as it stood, Evelyn was large enough to swallow him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Samantha.\u201d Jacob said. \u201cThere was an accident\u2026I\u2019m at the Gulliverian docks\u2026yea\u2026yea\u2026that\u2019s fine\u2026see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to try this again, Jacob.\u201d Seth said. Anyone with an earpiece could hear Seth\u2019s voice. \u201cI can\u2019t stay this small. I\u2019m supposed to be huge right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, don\u2019t worry little dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me little!\u201d Seth screamed as he kicked Evelyn\u2019s thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw.\u201d Evelyn jerked her hand back, letting Seth fall on her bare thighs. \u201cNo kicking.\u201d Evelyn smiled as she looked at her pissed off husband between her legs. She wore a bikini and even the fabric covering her pussy was larger than Seth was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn and Jacob made small talk while waiting on his girlfriend. The crew of the yacht was busy docking the ship. \u201cOh, I see my girlfriend now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour girlfriend is a Brobby?\u201d Evelyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she was okay with you being a Gulliverian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yea, she\u2019s totally cool with it. She has a thing for Gulliverians.\u201d Jacob started to wave at someone in the distance.  \u201cHey Amanda, over here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmanda?\u201d Evelyn and Seth asked at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought Samantha was the name of your girlfriend?\u201d Seth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, she\u2019s just a friend. She picked up Amanda\u2019s phone earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be <i>our</i> Amanda.\u201d Seth asked his wife. \u201cCan it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn\u2019s heart started to race. She was at a loss for words. She looked up and nearly pissed herself when she saw those familiar toes crash onto the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Evie.\u201d Amanda said with a toothy smile.</span></div></div>",

They met in high school, and after they graduated, they got married. James and Sam are eighteen-years-olds. Their parents thought getting married at such a young age was the stupidest thing that their kids have ever done. Their parents had such hopes for them, like getting a college degree, or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their parents may have been disappointed with them, but they still allowed the immature couple to stay at either of their parent's homes. However, that came to a halt when the couple's sex life began to become kinkier, and kinkier. They were not virgins when they married, sense they have been sexually active for well over three years now. They were simply bored, and trying to spice things up. What got the young couple in trouble and kicked out of both of their parents homes, were their four arrests for public indecency. They were both caught a few times out in a public area, naked as the day they were born and having unprotected sex. After the last arrest, the young couple became homeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With literally the clothes on their backs, and a limited supply of food and water in their only possession, a black book bag, the extremely attractive young couple holds hands, while talking about their options, less than an hour after being homeless. After talking a bit, Sam came up with a good plan that James found interesting. Sam's plane is to walk over and enter Brobbie territory. Her reasoning is that everything is much bigger there, including scrapes food and any shelter they could find there. They could easily survive in giant territory until they could think of something better. James asks her, 'Well the humans are giants in their land, but so are the animals too. We could get eaten or something.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam smiles at him and says, 'Relax, humans our size have been going over there for years now safely.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Yes, but those normal size people had giant police escort, we won't' James responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam looks at him, and says, 'Well we are just going to have to make friends with a giant fast. Think of it as an adventure. Imagine it, we could finally be completely nude together, making love out in the open with the sun on us, and nobody will see us, or maybe they will' Sam says licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam looks down to see that James is a fully hard at the idea of doing that. The nave young couple holds hands and heads to giant territory. After hitching a ride on a truck, and a small march, the couple finally reaches the edge of giant territory. Each territory is an island onto itself, with the giants naturally inhabiting the largest one. These three islands are close to each other, but the couple still needs a boat to get to the other island. They see a small ferryboat nearby that is operated by other Gulliverians. The boat has no automobiles on-board; just other Gulliverians who like them are heading to the Brobbie Island as they call it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The young couple, now on the boat looks around and sees other nice-looking couples of various ages, none over 40 all around them. They even see a few attractive families on this boat as well. There were a few teen couples, and none of the parents looked as if they are over the age of forty. 'I wonder what they all are doing here,' Sam asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'''''..<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Eighteen-year-old James has a nice, well-toned body. He has short, well trimmed, lit-brown hair, blue eyes, and he is clean-shaven, with a young looking face. He is well-hung, with a really nice ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eighteen-year-old Samantha has a lovely, well-defined body. She has long, strawberry blond hair, sexy, greenish, cat like eyes, and she too has a young looking face. She has perky, natural, cantaloupe size breasts, a well-trimmed pussy, and a fantastic ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both have smooth, lightly tanned skin.</span></div></div>",

Special drone cameras will record all the action so that you don\u2019t miss a thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you two come from?\u201d Chris, a blonde male in his late teens, asked Samantha and James. \u201cDo you guys want to team up with my mom and me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh\u2014\u201c Samantha was unsure what to say. \u201cSure, I guess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferry reached a dock on the shores of Brobdingnag. The ramps opened up and the contestants disembarked. The announcer looked straight into the camera and with his signature smile and said, \u201cthey\u2019re off! The clues to the first item will be sent to them on their smart phones in thirty minutes. That will give them enough time to get spread out and deep into Brobby land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get a smart phone,\u201d James told one of the filming staff. In less than 10 seconds, the staff handed them an official game show smart phone. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Samantha started running behind the other contestants. Chris and his mother, Louis, tagged along as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobby forest in front of them wasn\u2019t much of a forest. It was probably only two rows of trees before it led to a Brobby suburb. To the Gulliverians, the two rows of trees were like an expansive forest. As they headed towards the suburb, they got their first clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on guys,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI just got a text.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis stood behind her son Chris as they waited for Samantha to read the first clue. James also waited eagerly for the first clue but couldn\u2019t help but steal glances of Louis\u2019 smoking hot body. Louis was an incredibly sexy MILF that James wouldn\u2019t mind seeing naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first clue says,\u201d Sam said, \u201cyour fingers and toes grows them, use this to slow them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis looked at her fingers. \u201cOur fingers and toes have nails. And there are ten of them. Do you think it has something to do with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only thing that grows on my fingers and toes are my nails.\u201d Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t get it. What the fuck slows your nails?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNail clippers!\u201d Samantha said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be nail clippers. That\u2019s all we got to find.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we got to find nail clipper's belonging to a Brobby,\" James said. \"Where do you guys want to go?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u201cWell the only place we are going to find giant nail clippers is near a giant house, and I see some huge dwellings nearby\u201d James says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, given the size of giant land, I seriously doubt they hid the nail clippers very far\u201d Sam says with pride, \u201cBut which dwelling?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The four of them look around to see several normal size families and couples running for the closet giant house, and the mountain size building nearby, probably an apartment complex of some kind. Naturally being rebels, the four of them begin to march towards the giant house on the other side of the road, where nobody their size is going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Samantha and James continued their mach towards the house. Just then, they are alarmed to see something moving through the tall grass towards them. However, they relax when they see it is five more normal size humans from the show, who have the same idea as they did. The two groups size each other up, and begin to greet each other. This new group consists of another good-looking young couple, along with an attractive family, a single father, and his two hot young daughters. The couple is nineteen-year-old Malcolm and eighteen-year-old Amanda. Malcolm has short, well-trimmed black hair, with no facial hair, brown eyes, and he too is well hung, with a nice butt. Amanda has long lit-brown hair, blue eyes, and she has perky, natural, cantaloupe size breasts too. The family consists of the father thirty-seven year old Brian Wilson, and his teen daughters, Emily and Julie Wilson. Brian is muscular, with a lean body. He has a shaved head, no facial hair, blue eyes, and he is well hung, with a nice ass as well. His daughters have long brunette hair, blue eyes, with fantastic asses. They both have perky, natural breasts of slightly different sizes. Emily has grapefruit size breasts, while Julie has orange size breasts. Chris has short, well-trimmed golden blond hair, brown eyes, and he too is well hung, with a nice ass. His mom, thirty six year old Louis is hot for her age. She has medium length golden blond hair, brown eyes, and she has perky, natural, cantaloupe size breasts, with a lovely ass too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n James looks around and notices one thing the group all have in common. They are all Caucasian, or White, and extremely attractive, in their child barring years. Even the other contestants on that boat are like them. Maybe it is nothing, James thinks to himself. The tiny group of now nine humans finally reaches the titanic size house. They all see some nail clippers nearby, and a large note next to it. Samantha reads the note aloud, and it reads, \u201cCongratulations, you made it this far. Now see the two swimming pool size bowels of warm water nearby. The ones that are separated by a large, lush, tree size shrub for privacy. Take off all of your clothes, all of them, and get in the water. You will find some normal size soap, and a small ladder that reaches each of those bowels next to them. The females can go in one, and the males in the other. When you are finished, someone will bring you some fresh towels. Failure to undress completely means your team loses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell those bowels are not that high. I could probably jump in and out of it without a latter,\u201d Chris says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not wanting to risk losing, everyone did what he or she is instructed to do. All five of the hot females completely undressed and jumped into the bowel of warm water. All four of the cute males completely undressed, and dove into the water as well. As they all swam, and scrub themselves down with soap, a mysterious force quickly grabs all of their clothes unnoticed, leaving them all naked as the day they were born. Similar situations are occurring with the other groups as well. Thirty minutes later, all nine of them get out of the water, and they quickly notice that all of their clothing is gone. After a quick search, they conclude that someone has taken them. They also see another large note nearby. Covering their private parts with the only things available to them, their bare hands, the two genders carefully walk towards each other, with the two parents and three kids feeling the most embarrassed. James reads the letter this time, \u201cNow that you\u2019re clean, you must search for another clue as to where your clothes are. Enjoy the sun on your buns.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fortunately, for the group of nine, the sun is out, and it is nice out right now. With no choice in the matter, the nine involuntary nudists walk together in the yard of a nearby giant house, unaware that they will never see their clothes again. While they walk through the tall grass, they see another note, and Malcolm reads it, \u201cTwo couples will have to breed each other nearby, near some rocks, and the men will have to cum inside of their ladies. If there is any danger nearby, you must continue to have sex until the both of you have cum, or else the group loses.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naturally James and Samantha volunteer, followed by Malcolm and his girlfriend Amanda. Separated by a hundred of their yards, the two naked couples begin to make love. The two families are behind a nearby third rock, in-between them. What is near the couples?</span></div></div>",

Good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Samantha made love doggy style. A few feet away from them were Malcom and Amanda also making love in the missionary position. The rest of the groups were hidden behind a rock waiting for the couple to finish their business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was preoccupied with thought and a little on edge because they were naked and in Brobby territory. It was for those reasons that they didn\u2019t hear Angelica sneaking up on them. One of the fathers in the group was the first to turn around and see Angelica coming down upon them. The man shrieked, causing the others to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slender foot, clad in pink flip flops, came down on the shrieking father. His one-inch body exploded under the foam soles of Angelica\u2019s flip flops. The others in the group were eye-to-eye with her red painted toe nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group dispersed and ran into the tall grass, hiding from the sexy giantess. One teen boy came running up to Angelica\u2019s left foot and started pounding on her toes. \u201cThat was my dad!\u201d He yelled, unsure if the cruel giantess heard him or not. \u201cYou killed my dad!\u201d He cried and slumped over Angelica\u2019s perfect toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica smiled down at the little teen that was smaller than her pinky finger. She lightly tapped the boy, sending him tumbling backwards into the dirt. She then lifted her foot over the crying teen. He could see the remains of his father, smashed flat and contorted under the pink soles of the flip flop. Angelica dropped her foot upon the pathetic teen. She felt a delectable crunch as she twisted the body into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops!\u201d She giggled. \u201cWhat did I step on? Oh well, it couldn\u2019t have been anything important. It\u2019s not Gulliverians are running around in my backyard because they\u2019re not supposed to be here in the first place. So it must have been a bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Samantha saw everything and it only heightened their already awesome sex. Malcom and Amanda on the other hand were uneasy and paused to see the terrifying giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s so great!\u201d Samantha said with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d James pumped faster into his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long before Angelica spotted the two couples having sex in a little clearing. \u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d She smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica planted her feet on either side of the couple as they continued to make love. They looked up and followed Angelica\u2019s long leg which led up to a short skirt. They could see she wore no underwear. She then bent her legs and lowered herself closer to the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe challenge was to have sex and cum in their partners no matter what the distraction. James and Samantha were having a blast under the Angelica\u2019s shadow. Malcom and Amanda were finding it difficult to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica lowered her hand and plucked Malcom and Amanda so that they were still coupled. They found themselves in the middle of Angelica\u2019s palm. \u201cWell don\u2019t stop because of me.\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcom was taken away by the giantess\u2019 good looks and sweet breath. He found renewed vigor and started driving his excited dick into Amanda. Angelica rubbed herself as she watched the little porno taking place on the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are so cute; I could just eat you up.\u201d Angelica\u2019s eyes became heavy as she looked down at them. \u201cAs a matter of fact\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica dumped the couple into her mouth. She slid them around in her mouth. The couple became separated inside the tight space that was Angelica\u2019s mouth. Their bodies were covered with Angelica\u2019s saliva. Amanda struggled against the giantess\u2019 strong tongue. She flailed her arms around until she found Malcom\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica swallowed as she continued to rub her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and Malcom screamed inside the humid and wet throat. Angelica\u2019s esophagus worked the little couple down from her mouth to belly. She could feel the lumps burn in her throat as her muscles pulled and squeezed the couple downwards. The feeling was almost painful but all so satisfying. Angelica felt the lumps enter the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to finish the challenge!\u201d Malcom shouted from inside Angelica\u2019s dark stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt hurts!\u201d Amanda yelled as she felt the stomach acid burn her skin. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore. I want to go home.\u201d Amanda wept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcom fought through the pain and located Amanda in the slimy stomach. He found her trying to beat her way through the stomach walls. Amanda\u2019s skin felt like it was covered with Goosebumps. His cock was hard and ready. He entered Amanda from behind and started making love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious? Now? We are going to die in here.\u201d Amanda cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let me have this!\u201d Malcom grunted and found it increasingly difficult to breath. He was on the verge of passing out. He grabbed onto Amanda\u2019s\u2019 hips and pulled her furiously into his. The stomach acid reached about past their naval. It was hot and smelly. The stomach began to churn and digest the little couple. Before blacking out, Malcom came inside Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcom\u2019s limp body fell into the acid. Amanda screamed hysterically as she sunk lower into the acid. She tried to claw against the walls of the stomach but her energy was depleted from lack of oxygen. Her body sank into the pool of acid and landed on top of Malcom. Their bodies were promptly broken down and digested by the pretty giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames watched Angelica rub her belly and give a light burp. He and Samantha came at the same time as they witnessed the giantess brutally eating one of their kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pulled out his still hard cock from Samantha and picked her up. \u201cCome on; let\u2019s go before she decides to do something to us.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even thou they both have had fantasies about being swallowed alive as they have sex, nether one of them wanted to know what it was really like, at least not yet. The gulliverian couple runs as fast as they can, naked through the tall grass towards their group. However, when they finally got to their last known location, all they see is a giant footprint, and in the center of this massive footprint are the crushed remains of two people who are around their size. Realizing what has happened to their teammates, the couple moves away from the area as fast as they can, just in case the giantess comes back. However, a quarter of a mile to a tiny person is only a few yards to a giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tiny naked couple finally stops to catch their breaths near a gigantic tree. As they rest, they see the ebony giantess Angelica still searching for them, farther away this time. They also see more giants searching through the tall grass looking for others of their kind. Samantha looks down and sees that James still has an erection. Samantha grabs a hold of her husband\u2019s hand, and seductively takes him back into the tall grass, and away from the huge tree. They see a very small field nearby, so Sam grabs a hold of James rock hard cock, and gently begins to stroke it. \u201cHere, now, damn you\u2019re a horny girl\u201d James says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell we could die at anytime in this land. You see those giant birds in the air; any one of them could come down and swallow us completely as we make love. Hell, even their chicks could do that\u201d Samantha says licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo you want to be birdseed,\u201d James says surprised, becoming even horny at the thought of becoming food while they do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo, but if it happens, we might as well have fun. See that huge green grass snake way over there, it could easily swallow the both of us also, and see that giant spider\u2019s web over there. The empty one, imagine us doing it near or on the web. Heck, being swallowed by that giantess, or having them fight over us is kinky. I could even become pregnant,\u201d Sam says in a horny voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n James gets even more excited about the idea of getting his wife pregnant in a dangerous situation. Not one to pass up sex, the tiny couple begins to make love. First, they passionately kiss each other, while masturbating one another at the same time. Five minutes later, they begin to have unprotected intercourse in the missionary position. As he pumps her pussy, the tiny couple who are hidden amongst the grass sees the ebony giantess getting closer to them, along with another giant. They could also see the giant animals moving towards them as well. Ten minutes later, they switch to a female dominate position. As Samantha rides James like a cowgirl in heat, Sam sees that Angelica now has a glass jar with her, and inside the jar, she sees four tiny naked people inside, desperately trying to get out. Sam sees one adult woman, a young teenage boy, and two tiny teenage girls beating on the glass, screaming for help. Sam instantly recognizes them as their remaining acquaintances Louis, Chris, Emily, and Julie. The tiny naked couple can also see that Angelica and another giant are close now, along with a few giant animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Who catches the tiny nude couple first, as they passionately make love to each other?</span></div></div>",

The trimmed green grass is nearly twice their size. Sam is currently bent over; her bare hands are pushing on a huge stick, while James mounts her furiously from behind. As her young husband\u2019s rock hard cock moves in and out of her wet pussy, the couple can see the two giants fighting over them, which made their love making that much more intense. James is securely holding onto his young wife\u2019s round hips, as his hard cock pumps Sam\u2019s pussy from behind. The tiny young couple watches lustfully, as the ebony giantess begins to get the upper hand in their titanic battle for them. \u201cDo you think if she wins she will eat us, or feed us to something,\u201d Samantha asks while licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMaybe if we give her a good enough show, she may let us live a bit longer? Maybe she will make us her pets. A breeding pair of tiny humans, or maybe she will just put us in her soup, or make us food for her pets,\u201d James responds while moaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI hope she has a snake?\u201d Sam says moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhy\u201d James asks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBecause they swallow their food whole, and we might die together as we make love in its stomach,\u201d Sam says moaning even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The thought of dying that way is a bit arousing to James also. If you have to go, that would be a good way to do it. As they continue to have sex, they watch a naked young survivor, a tiny hot blonde girl from another group in her late teens running away from the titanic fight nearby. They watch as she runs over a large, weird looking plant. Almost immediately, the plant quickly closes its mouth around her. The mouth of the Venus flytrap closes, and imprisons the tiny girl in its mouth. The tiny couple could barely see her nude form moving around inside its mouth, screaming in fear, and desperately trying to get out. Her screams of fear quickly turn to pain a minute later, as its digestive juices cover her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tiny couple watches as the fight ends. The loser walks away with nothing, but the winner still has the jar that contains their surviving group members still in hand. The couple watch as the victorious giant looks down out them, licking her lips. \u201cYummy, you two are a lovely couple, and you actually like to be watched. I might just keep you both alive for a while sense you like putting on a show. Maybe I will take you to class tomorrow and let my giant students watch you two? Maybe I will just eat you myself, or feed you to my pet snake. Maybe I will sell you two as a breeding pair at an auction. Maybe I will make the tiny hot mom and her cute young son do each other as well. Who knows,\u201d the familiar ebony face of Angelica says to them in a thunderous voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After hearing that, the tiny naked couple moans loudly as they both cum together. The tiny couple stay connected for around thirty seconds more, as Sam\u2019s pussy is filled with James\u2019s sperm. \u201cDamn, the way you two go at it, you both will soon be parents,\u201d Angelica says laughing, as she gently grabs them both, and gently places them inside the glass jar with the other tiny naked people, the hot mom and her cute son, along with the two hot teenage sisters.

Now are the four other groups of suckers, meals, I mean groups of contestants ready,\u201d the second one asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIn four hours we will send in the tiny black meat, I mean contestants, four hours later we will follow with some Latin meat, followed by some Asian meat, and finally a mixed ethnic group just as the boss wanted,\u201d the first one says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood, now let\u2019s get ready for the next group,\u201d the second one says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, James and Sam are holding hands, running from that ebony goddess as fast as they could. \u201cThat was the best sex we ever had,\u201d Sam says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, and it could have been our last, but it was stimulating\u201d James says grinning, \u201cTo bad it cost that other couple their lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, the tiny naked couple ran into the four naked survivors. The Louis, her teenage son Chris, and the two teenage girls who are in a state of shock after watching their dad, and brother die. The couple wanted to tell the two girls they are sorry, but that would have to wait, the giantess is looking through the grass trying to find them. They all naturally run away from her, and as they do, they easily notice that several dozen giants are outside looking in the grass for something, while holding glass jars in their free hand. However, she is still the closet one, but three other giants are close by too. The four closet giants are a mix of ages, and both genders. They even hear the mouse like screams of other normal size people being found by the giants, both by humans and by giant animals. However, our group of six is still unnoticed for now. As the six of them run naked through the grass, what happens? </span></div></div>",

Well over a hundred extremely attractive Gulliverians of various ethnic groups, who happen to be mostly White or Caucasian look towards the two thuggish looking men whom operate this boat. The captain grabs a megaphone, and says, \u201cAttention ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the first annual Brobbie challenge. The goal of this illegal event is to race across Brobbie territory, follow the instructions on the notes we gave you, and try not to be removed from the game. If your team or group makes it to the end by completing all of the assigned tasks, then everyone on your team will earn a million dollars each. If you are removed from the game, then you lose. I see we have several attractive, last minute contestants here, welcome on board, your all now part of the race, and there is no need to register. I see we have several families here tonight, along with a few dozen couples, welcome. These small, flying drones will follow your progress closely, and the internet audience at home can watch everything. Now for the first command, everyone please remove all of your clothing now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The various couples on board undress with little to know influence, but the many families on board are naturally reluctant to follow commands. The parents and children on board as you would expect do not want to see each other\u2019s nude bodies. The captain speaks into the megaphone again, and says with a stern voice, \u201cAttention, anyone refusing to follow the first command, will lose the game.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The families fearing that they might lose the money reluctantly undress. \u201cPeople will do anything for money,\u201d the Second Mate says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No contestant has refused this first challenge. Everyone is now completely undressed, and a minute later, there is nothing but asses and elbows parading around the deck. The nude crowd hears the Captain speak into his megaphone one last time, \u201cAttention, leave all of your belongings, including your clothes on the ship, you will get them back. Now let the games begin. On your marc, get set, go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A heard of tiny Gulliverian humans, including our young couple storm the giant sandy beach, naked as the day they were born. A few minutes later, after the last of them has left, the Second Mate asks the Captain \u201cIs any of what you told them true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Captain smiles wickedly, and says, \u201cWell, we do have tiny drones flying around, watching them. There is some notes scattered around that island too, and there is an internet audience watching them, but other than that, nothing. Our bosses should be pleased.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, as the tiny naked mass of humanity marches through the incredibly tall grass, they naturally begin to break up into several, much smaller groups. Sam and James have joined a group consisting of two other attractive couples, and two attractive Caucasian families. The first family consists of Louis, a hot thirty-six-year-old single white mom, and her cute teen son Chris. The other family consists of a single white father named David, his young teenage son, and his two hot daughters, Emily, and Julie. The second couple is Latino, and the third is white like our couple. The group of eleven moves through the tall grass, and runs into some huge, mountain size structures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n What kind of giant is nearby?</span></div></div>",

Even thou there are treaties in place forbidding the capture, and enslavement of miniature Gulliverian humans, they are almost never enforced. Just last week, she saw the local mayor and police chief on their internet website holding a clear glass cage that contained many Gulliverian humans, and they were auctioning them off. \u201cTrespassers, or illegal\u2019s,\u201d they called them, and why they keep coming to her land is a mystery, but she is glad they still do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cruella is now standing next to this ship, faking a surprised look on her face. However, her fake look of surprise quickly turns to that of real surprise, when she sees a tiny White couple on the boat, naked as the day they were born, passionately making love to each other in the standing doggy position. They both look young, around eighteen-years-old. The tiny young man has an incredibly well detailed, lean, muscular, nearly hairless body, while the tiny young woman has a body most actresses and models would kill for, complete with large, very perky breasts, and a fantastic ass. They would make the perfect breeding pair, or entertainment for lunch, the bisexual giantess thinks. The Broddy who collects them could make a lot of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the same time, her husband James is furiously pounding his wife Samantha from behind, as her husband holds onto her bare hips, and thrusts his rock hard cock deeper into her wet pussy. They both moan with delight, as a crowd of Gulliverians, and one good-looking, giant female Brobby watch them with surprise, curiosity, and lust on their faces. As they continue to have dangerous public sex, they wonder what the giantess might be thinking. They know she is enjoying the show, the hunger on her face gives it away, and her giant tong licking her huge lips worries, yet excites them both. Anything could happen. The tiny nude couple is getting close to having an orgasm together, when they naturally see Cruella reaching for them. The horny, yet unwise young couple smiles with excitement, as her giant hand moves towards the living sex dolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before we go on, what does Cruella do?</span></div></div>",

I was going to go exploring in Brobdingnag for fun, but Lilliput Island sounds like it could be fun too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we aren\u2019t allowed to get off the ferry.\u201d Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d Lizzie smiled from ear to ear. \u201cCare to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Samantha\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou\u2019d take us to the island.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Lizzie placed all her weight on one foot and swayed her hips. She looked sultry and highly desirable. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go by myself and I overheard you two talking dirty. You two sound like my kind of people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferry docked and waited for the Brobdingnag storm to die down. Lizzie walked ahead with James and Samantha in tow. They reached the ramp leading to the dock where they were promptly stopped by a security guard. Lizzie flashed her special passport and when the guard saw the name on the passport, he jumped aside and let Lizzie through along her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no Gulliverian sized structures around except for the dock. Upon walking the length of the dock and stepping into the sandy beach, Lizzie spotted the Lilliputian passport control building. There were little roads connected to the structure that went deeper into the island. The roads were probably just as wide as her black leather boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalt right there.\u201d An authoritative voice came over the headset. A one-inch tall Lilliputian border guard came out of the passport control building. \u201cGulliverians are strictly forbidden from entering. What the hell are you three even thinking? I will be contacting the authorities immediately and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie pulled out her passport, flipped to the first page, and brought it down to huffing and puffing border guard. Her passport photo was as large as a billboard. The guard could clearly read her name and see in red letters <i>No Restrictions</i> written plain as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Hartwell, I had no idea.\u201d The guard stood at attention. \u201cWelcome to Lilliput.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie sighed apathetically and stuffed her passport in her pants pocket. She didn\u2019t even say a word to the guard or even look back at him. She swung her 175 foot long leg over the saucer plate-sized structure and continued her walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Samantha were starting to like Lizzie even more. They followed her lead and took lazy steps over the guard and his tiny building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease ma\u2019am,\u201d the guard\u2019s voice came over the headsets, but this time he maintained a respectful tone, \u201cplease keep off the roads. They are not built to withstand much weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie heard him\u2014and didn\u2019t care. Her next step after the guard\u2019s word of caution was right on top of the three inch wide road. Cracks formed like webs under Lizzie\u2019s boots. It felt like she was stepping stale crackers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha saw what Lizzie did and got giddy. She moved her next step over the road. Unlike Lizzie, she wore pink flip flops with foam soles. Despite its soft outward appearance, it was merciless to the fragile Lilliputian road. Samantha being taller than Lizzie also meant her feet were bigger. Her one footstep created much more destruction to the road than Lizzie\u2019s step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames admired the tiny scenery. It felt like he grew, but in reality, he just stepped into another world. The tiny forest trees barely reached his shins. With a bird\u2019s eye view, he could see tiny wildlife like deer running in the forest. He couldn\u2019t wait to see a Lilliputian town or even a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie stops walking and turns to face the couple. \u201cSo, what are we going to do first?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick was in bed wearing nothing more than his boxer briefs while watching Family Guy on his wall mounted TV. His body sunk into his comfy king-sized bed and his head was propped up by expensive pillows. He let out a weak belch and could still taste his wife\u2019s delicious pumpkin pie from dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia went through her nightly ritual of brushing her teeth, wiping off makeup, and applying her cocoa bean body lotion. She wore her black boy-shorts and loose white shirt. She then pulled her red hair back and tied it in the back with a scrunchie. Once satisfied with her upkeep, she gently grabbed her smartphone from the bathroom counter and headed to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a surprise for you,\u201d Felicia smiled as she took careful steps to the bed. She held her smartphone parallel to the ground and took great care in keeping it level. She then placed the smartphone on her husband\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s your favorite thing in the whole wide world,\u201d she smiled wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked down on the seemingly empty smartphone. Felicia grabbed the remote from Nick\u2019s hand and then slid into bed; except she faced the opposite way from Nick, so that she was belly down with her head facing the foot of the bed, bringing her eyes closer to the TV. She then propped herself up with her elbows and started flipping channels while she bent her legs at the knee and let her bare feet sway back and forth like an upside down pendulum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smartphone appeared off, but it really just had a blank screen with a counter in one of the corners. Nick could see the number 50 displayed in white font. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this what I think it is?\u201d He asked his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Felicia found the celebrity channel. A gossip show was on and talking about a Gulliverian starlet who was famous throughout the three civilizations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick concentrated on the center of the screen and could see the subtlest of black dots against the smooth glass screen. \u201cNo way!\u201d He exclaimed in an excited voice. The counter on the smartphone changed to 48. \u201cYou got me more Lilliputians?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup,\u201d Felicia said looking over her shoulder. \u201cJust a little present for my honey,\u201d she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, I love you so much right now babe.\u201d His cock began to stir in his boxer briefs. \u201cAre these Lilliputians legal or\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014Black market.\u201d She said indifferently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck yes.\u201d Nick attempted to muffle his excitement. He was already pitching a tent in his underwear with his awakened cock. \u201cI love you so much right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d Felicia got on her side to better look at her husband. \u201cSo happy for little specks of dust? I swear those things are better than Viagra for you.\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t argue with that.\u201d Nick grabbed the smartphone by the sides and placed it on the nightstand next to the bed. He then rummaged in the nightstand drawer for his expensive magnifying glass. He held it up to his eyes and examined the 48 Lilliputians huddled together, cowering under his gaze. His boxer briefs were getting annoying as his cock had run out of room to grow; Nick shimmied out of his underwear and slowly stroked himself as he got a better view of his present. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have fun with you little people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not people, silly.\u201d Felicia said while keeping her eyes on the TV. \u201cThey\u2019re just Lilliputians.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick kept looking through the magnifying glass while he pulled out a small index card. He brought the edge of the index card down to the cowering Lilliputians. His hand trembled lightly and his heart thumbed in chest excitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up little ones.\u201d He said in a whisper. \u201cI need ten of you to get on the card. If I don\u2019t get ten on volunteers on the card, I will crush you all right now under my cock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t need to repeat himself. Under the magnifying glass, he could see the little dots clamoring to get on the index card. The smart phone now read 37. Close enough he thought. He set his magnifying glass down on the nightstand and lifted the index card as gently as he could. He maneuvered onto the bed towards Felicia\u2019s legs. She still had her legs bent at the knee with the soles of her feet facing the ceiling. She was on her belly watching her show, unaware of what Nick was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick took the index card and held it at an angle, so that the Lilliputians slid off and landed on the ball of Felicia\u2019s right foot. Nick held onto Felicia\u2019s ankle so she wouldn\u2019t move, and dropped the index card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Felicia asked, looking over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI poured eleven Lilliputians on your foot. Can you feel them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, can\u2019t feel the little things. Why did you put them there anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo get a better view of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve to get a better look of me.\u201d Felicia returned her attention to the show. She then angled her foot so that her toes pointed up. The eleven Lilliputians screamed for their lives as they slid down the bumpy and wrinkly sole. They took a huge dip at the arch of her foot. The eleven dots scattered in the air and fell alongside Felicia\u2019s shapely calf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was still holding onto Felicia\u2019s ankle as he watched the little Lilliputians fall off. He lost sight of them when they landed on the bed. Nick let go of Felicia\u2019s ankle and stroked his member. It was such a sexy display of power for him: to witness eleven people fall to their deaths because his wife moved her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her ankle free, Felicia moved her legs closer to Nick, purposely on top of where the Lilliputians fell. If any survived the initial fall, they were certainly now crushed under Felicia\u2019s knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cruel,\u201d Nick said with smiles as he returned to the remaining Lilliputians on his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not cruel,\u201d she turned down the volume on the TV. \u201cI\u2019m super nice and you know it.\u201d She was being serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not nice to the Lilliputians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you already, they\u2019re not people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick loved it when Felicia spoke like that. She had always lived an easy life and got pretty much whatever she want. Both the Lilliputians and Gulliverians were considered sub-human to her. She enjoyed indulging in her husband\u2019s odd fetish, but she didn\u2019t truly share it with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t act all high and mighty,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ve done to the Lilliputians before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know.\u201d Nick grinned from ear to ear as he looked down at the little dots\u2014too scared to move. \u201cBut the difference between you and me is that I see them as human. I see them as equals except for the size. I take great pleasure in taking their lives unlike you who doesn\u2019t even notice them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia muted the TV and flipped on her back as she looked over to her husband. \u201cYou\u2019re sick, you know that?\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen more on the card you little twerps,\u201d Nick told the dots. He held the card close to them and saw the counter on the smart phone lower to 26. \u201cTake your shirt off, hun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what are you going to do?\u201d Felicia asked while taking off her white shirt. She wore no bra and her breasts were perfectly rounded mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick crawled on the bed, being mindful to keep the card with the ten Lilliputians safe. He straddled over Felicia and then poured the Lilliputians between her boobs. The Lilliputians looked around their surroundings. A freckle near the base of Felicia\u2019s breast was bigger than the Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly hell they are so tiny. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get use to them being so fucking tiny.\u201d Nick lowered himself so that his chin rested it on Felicia\u2019s belly. He looked down and admired the little scene with the Lilliputians dwarfed by Felicia\u2019s soft mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d She asked whilst looking up at the ceiling. She concentrated her senses and tried to feel the little Lilliputians, but couldn\u2019t feel anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re just standing there.\u201d Nick squinted his eyes. \u201cAt least that\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, they should feel honored for being on me so long. If it weren\u2019t for you, I would have wiped them off as soon as they got on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon, I\u2019m scared. What are they going to do with us?\u201d A woman with Asian features asked her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know honey.\u201d The Lilliputian said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great booming voice filled their ears. \u201cOkay little ones.\u201d It was Nick speaking to them. \u201cThe first person to make it to my wife\u2019s belly button gets to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLive? What is he talking about?\u201d Kim asked her husband, but he was no longer standing by her side. \u201cBrandon?\u201d He had taken off and left his wife standing alone. The other Lilliputians were already running down the great expanse of Felicia\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god. What is going to happen to us?\u201d Kim was in shock and unable to move. Below her feet, she could feel the beating of Felicia\u2019s massive heart. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d The stupefied woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve moved about an inch already.\u201d Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Felicia asked. \u201cThey are so worthless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, looks like one of them hasn\u2019t moved at all. It\u2019s just staying still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow inconsiderate.\u201d Felicia said. \u201cThe one time I allow the little things an opportunity to touch and explore me, and it just stands there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I do with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. Just don\u2019t squish it on me. I don\u2019t want the thing to even touch me anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled. He lowered his face over the lonely dot and licked. When he pulled his face back up, the dot was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked back between Felicia\u2019s boob mountains. He looked just in time to see the giant lick up his wife. He returned his attention to the goal line. The ground swayed up and down several hundred feet as Felicia breathed. The fine hairs throughout her skin were like wading through weaves of grass. Her abdominal muscles created crevices and uneven ground which were like huge obstacle for the Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky darkened and the air filled with masculine musk. Brandon looked up and saw Nick\u2019s member, nearly three quarters of a mile long, hanging dangerously low. His balls were large enough to crush Lilliputian towns without notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick kissed Felicia as he straddled her torso. He broke his kiss and stood up on his knees. He looked down below his cock and could see the little dots haven\u2019t moved much. Maybe two inches, tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take them forever to get to your belly button.\u201d He lightly kneaded Felicia\u2019s left breast with his powerful hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, let me help them out.\u201d Felicia rose up from her lying position, and moved up to plant a kiss on her husband\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians went flying down Felicia\u2019s landscape belly as she angled up. One Lilliputian fell to the side, falling off Felicia\u2019s body and landing on the bed near her ass, where he subsequently fell deeper in the impression on the bed. He was later squished unknowingly by Felicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Lilliputians slowed to the area below her naval and above her boy shorts. Felicia stopped her kiss and fell back on the bed. \u201cDid they make it?\u201d Nick shimmied off Felicia and looked for the micro Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re a lot closer. And I alive I think.\u201d He sounded surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you planning to do with them?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick moved his face away from his wife\u2019s lower belly. The Lilliputians resembled little more than multicolored specks against her milky white skin and it took a lot of squinting to distinguish them from things like pores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think I should do with them?\u201d He asked, directing the question back toward her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Felicia leaned back against the pillow, her dark red ponytail falling to one side. It looked like she was getting bored, so he decided to spice things up. Nick gently pulled down her boy shorts, revealing the gingery patch of her pubic hair. When he parted her legs and then began to lick at one of her thighs, she sat straight up again. Several more luckless Lilliputians tumbled from her abdomen, shrieking as they plummeted to the sheets far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered soothingly. He knew how she felt about receiving cunnilingus; it was something that she enjoyed yet she always felt self-conscious about it. Nick didn\u2019t mind pleasuring her in that way, especially when there were tiny helpless people involved. His cock hardened as he thought about how huge and terrifying he and Felicia must appear to them. An evil idea occurred to him and he smiled at the dots on his wife\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, everyone. I want you to go here,\u201d Nick said to the Lilliputians, using his index finger to trace the route to Felicia\u2019s pubic mound. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t a request; it\u2019s an order. I\u2019ll squish anyone who stays behind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe specks, smaller than fleas, began to run again. It was like watching pepper grains slowly rolling downward over Felicia\u2019s smooth skin. Nick tried to envision what they were seeing: his wife\u2019s endless belly, stretching out like a flesh-colored desert; his immense face, watching them with the imperious cruelty of a god. Between his legs, his cock was throbbing almost painfully and it took all of his willpower not to come at that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he\u2019d save that for later. He wanted to savor this moment first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a doubt, today was the worst day of Beth\u2019s life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputian had planned to spend her twenty-first birthday with her friends, partying and having fun. Instead she had ended up here, in the bedroom of a gigantic couple. She had heard that Brobdingnagians were massive, but actually seeing a pair of them in person was overwhelming. At first, she had just stared up in wonderment as the giant ordered them onto the card; then, when she heard his threat, she reluctantly climbed on. As she stared up into the twin moons of his eyes, she prayed that he would be merciful and just let them go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the giant casually licked up the woman, Beth knew that her prayers were in vain. He planned to kill them all, she realized. Still, she clung fiercely onto the hope that she could somehow get away. Perhaps the Brobdingnagian woman would intercede on their behalf or perhaps they could somehow sneak away. The key was to do whatever the giant wanted until an opportunity to escape arose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that what the giant wanted was for them to sprint toward another destination, like marathon runners dashing toward a finish line. Fortunately, Beth was an excellent athlete and she pumped her long legs as hard as she could, quickly outdistancing everyone else. She began to slow down, hesitating, when she reached the edge of what appeared to be a forest, complete with reddish-brown hairs the size of sequoias. The odor was what gave it away, almond-scented soap mixed with something more earthy and organic. Beth instantly knew what it was, since she had smelled it numerous times. It was the smell of a woman\u2019s sex, except a billion times more intense than anything that she had experienced before.  She didn\u2019t want to continue, but the giant\u2019s colossal finger hovered ominously above the area where he wanted them to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others had caught up with her and they reluctantly stepped into the tangled thatch of pubic hair, the mammoth strands of hair rising up for hundreds of feet and blocking out the overhead light. If someone had asked Beth how she planned to spend her birthday, fighting her way through a living jungle wouldn\u2019t have been on the list. For some reason, the notion struck her as absurdly funny and she began to giggle hysterically. A tall, good-looking man paused to grab her shoulder and shake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asked, concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday,\u201d Beth told him in a serious voice and then she began to sob. The man didn\u2019t seem to know what to do. He gave her an awkward hug as she wept against his shoulder, leaving large wet spots on his polo shirt. With an almost chivalrous gentleness, he led her forward. Beth wasn\u2019t sure how long they trekked before they finally reached their destination; it seemed like forever and her legs ached by the time that she saw the titanic living canyon rising before her. By this point, the smell was overwhelming, a pungent odor that filled the humid air and made her gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d the male Brobdingnagian ordered them. Beth was seized by animal panic and her first instinct was to run, but the handsome man with the polo shirt held onto her upper arm. His expression was oddly composed, but his pale eyes were wide with fear. He said something to her; it sounded like \u201cCome on,\u201d but she wasn\u2019t sure. Her head was swimming with fear and it was difficult not to just pass out. Reluctantly, they marched forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he leaned very close, Nick could make out the microscopic Lilliputians as they worked their way over Felicia\u2019s engorged outer lips and the hood of her clitoris. He had to hold his breath; he suspected that if he exhaled too hard, the speck-people would simply blow away. While that would be amusing, he had other plans in mind. Dipping his head down, he nuzzled Felicia\u2019s inner thighs with his lips, slowly making his way upwards\u2026toward the Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth had a terrible feeling that she knew exactly where she was. The spherical bulb of flesh that she stood on was a maroon color and hot to the touch. It glistened underneath her sneakers as she looked down. A clitoris\u2026she was on a clitoris the size of a large building. Worse, it was evident that the giantess could feel her. Every time that she moved slightly, the Brobdingnagian woman uttered a deep, almost subsonic, moan that caused her entire body to vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming before her was the giant, his vast face split in a bloodchilling grin. As Beth and the others watched, his mouth opened, his white skyscraper teeth gleaming. Like something out of a feverish dream, his gargantuan tongue slipped out, licking gently at the giantess\u2019 vagina. She had never imagined seeing a human tongue so huge; at this size, she could see the knobs of his tastebuds coated with saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was moving closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth caught a whiff of the Brobdingnagian\u2019s warm breath, which smelled strongly of nutmeg and clove and pumpkin, as he swept his tongue toward them. Several of the other Lilliputians were either crushed into jelly beneath the reddish mass of flesh or else they were stuck to it, wailing in horror. She wanted desperately to close her eyes but her eyelids seemed paralyzed. All she could do was cower as the tongue came for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d Felicia said, just before Nick reached her clitoris. He glanced up at her and swallowed whatever was in his mouth. Probably more of those Lilliputians. They were such gross little things, like lice that could talk. Still, Nick enjoyed tormenting them and she enjoyed the way that his eyes sparkled with lust. She couldn\u2019t help but be turned on by his arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have another idea,\u201d she told him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick scrambled over to his nightstand and pulled out a condom. He ripped apart the wrapper and was about to slip it on his throbbing member before he looked down at his smart phone and remembered about the 26 remaining Lilliputians. He lifted his phone and brought it to his cock where he then tilted it, dropping 26 Lilliputians on the head of his penis. The condom slipped on right on top, leaving a dome\u2014larger than a stadium\u2014for the Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick crawled back between Felicia\u2019s legs. Precum was already drowning a few Lilliputians in the condom prison. The lubricated condom split through Felicia\u2019s excited labia like a hot knife through butter. Nick felt his cock heat up by a few magnitudes just by entering his excited partner. He inserted his cock all the way in until his balls made contact with his wife\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought the Lilliputians didn\u2019t make you excited?\u201d Nick leaned down and gave his wife a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking about what you said.\u201d Felicia moaned as Nick thrust himself in and out like a slow oil pump. \u201cThat they\u2019re little people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are people like you and me. Just very, very small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia moaned. \u201cDid you put any in the condom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are two dozen in the condom, fighting for their pathetic lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia jerked and tightened her thighs around Nick\u2019s hip as began to pick up the pace of their fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth tried to hold onto the attractive man that helped her earlier. The violent movements underneath them caused the man to tumble over Felicia\u2019s gigantic clit and down towards her pussy. His fall was broken by a nearly mile long cock. Without time to react, this cock rammed itself inside an equally large vagina. His body was crushed against the slippery vaginal walls without either Brobdingnagian noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth wanted to cry but didn\u2019t have the luxury in doing so. Nick and Felicia\u2019s fucking had picked up in greater speed. Beth held onto a pubic hair that was as thick as she was. Beth cried to herself as the giant couple killed and fucked without mercy. It was Beth\u2019s birthday. Why was this happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. He performed one last deep thrust before coming to an orgasm. The reservoir in the condom filled with his hot cum, drowning any remaining Lilliputian inside. Nick and Felicia stayed connected, exchanging wet kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you be able to get more?\u201d Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure can.\u201d Felicia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decoupled a minute later. Nick pulled off the condom and tossed it in the bin\u2014an unceremonious end to 26 Lilliputians. Felicia sauntered to the bathroom, still lightheaded from a fantastic fuck. She looked at herself in the full-length mirror and tried to imagine what she looked like to all the Lilliputians they killed. Her milky white skin contrasted beautifully against her crimson red hair; still in a ponytail, but a little in disarray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreams of her pussy juice flowed down her inner thigh. She marveled at her pussy and smiled thinking about how large it must have looked to the Lilliputians. In fact, she thought she could still see one. But that had to be her imagination, Lilliputians were difficult to see with the unaided eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo that was a Lilliputian, holding onto one of her hairs. Felicia lowered her finger and used an upturned fingernail to scoop up the pepper grain sized speck. She lifted her nail to her eyes and examined the little thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are like fleas.\u201d She spoke softly to the Lilliputian, though she knew the little thing wouldn\u2019t be able to understand her. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy thinking of you as a real person with a real life and all. You are so damn small. Maybe I should keep you and get to know you. Maybe I could see things from your point of view.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny dark speck that was Beth didn\u2019t move from the fingernail. She stood still and looked up in fear at Felicia. She didn\u2019t know what Felicia was saying, but she hoped it was promising. Felicia then opened her mouth and tossed Beth into her mouth. Felicia sloshed around some saliva in her mouth and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops.\u201d Felicia smiled. \u201cI ate you on accident.\u201d She patted her flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**-----------------**-----------------**-----------------**----------------- **<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kevin, why do you look so gloom?\u201d Felicia asked her co-worker in the next cubicle over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d Kevin sighed. \u201cListen, Felicia, can you keep a secret?\u201d Kevin had confided in Felicia many times in the past. They worked together well and were even better friends. Kevin and his wife, Brittany, had gone on many double dates with Nick and Felicia. Sometimes they\u2019ll go to each other\u2019s home for dinner and drinks. \u201cI\u2019m bankrupt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Felicia\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear. What are you going to do? Does Brittany know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe knows.\u201d Kevin slumped in his office chair. \u201cWe\u2019ve been considering on what to do. We even thought about down-classing in order to make money and pay off our debts, but you know what that means. I don\u2019t think Brittany wants to live as a Lilliputian even though we\u2019ll make money out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light went off in Felicia\u2019s head. \u201cMaybe I could convince her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin looked up confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, like you said, down-classing will solve all your problems and wipe your debt away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sort of for it\u2014but Brittany doesn\u2019t want to be a Lilliputian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave that to me.\u201d Felicia had a hard time holding back a sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Felicia whined. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible if you don\u2019t down class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a Lilliputian though.\u201d Brittany said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be tiny and helpless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not helpless. They have a thriving population and live wonderful lives with all those inventions they keep coming up with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s say if Kevin and I did become Lilliputians, we won\u2019t be friends anymore. You\u2019ll be huge compared to us.\u201d Brittany used her fork to shovel her salad into her mouth. She and Felicia were seated at an outdoor restaurant during their lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ll be friends. I would love for you and Kevin to visit us when you become Lilliputians.\u201d Felicia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls chatted more as they ate. Felicia kept persuading her friend for the entire lunch hour. Brittany was still on the fence about the big decision. She and her husband would need to discuss it more. However, they would need to decide quickly; their debt balloon was nearing the breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the Down class\u00ae brochure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to make fast easy money? Are you a Brobdingnagian willing to go on an adventure of a lifetime? Curious what it\u2019s like to live as a Lilliputian? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Science\u2122, we use the mass-energy equivalence to shrink you down to Lilliputian size. Your lost body mass is then turned into pure energy that goes straight to the power grid. We pay big $$$ for that potential energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCall your local Energy branch for a free quote! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week has passed. Kevin and Brittany couldn\u2019t even afford to buy food. Too proud to ask their friends for a handout, Kevin and Brittany decided to commit to down classing. They received a quote on how much they would make for both of them to down class. They would receive enough money to pay off their debts and even buy a large Lilliputian mansion afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire shrinking process was fast and efficient. In less than a day, they went from being homeless Brobdingnagians to rich Lilliputians. Before buying a home, Kevin and Brittany chose to stay at a fancy hotel. Life didn\u2019t seem to bad anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a surprise for you,\u201d Felicia said entering the bedroom only wearing panties. She was holding a smartphone like before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this looks good.\u201d Nick perked up, already nude and in bed. \u201cYou got some more Lilliputians for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! These ones are a little different from before. They are <i>willing</i> Lilliputians. These guys actually volunteered to be bought Brobdingnagians for pleasure. Can you believe that shit? These little pervs are crazy.\u201d Felicia set the smartphone on the nightstand next to her husband. 1,000 was displayed on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Nick\u2019s eyes went big as he saw that number. He started to stroke his cock. \u201cThere are so many of them that want to be used for our pleasure? Fuck yea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before she slipped into bed, Felicia heard the house phone ring. She grabbed the cordless phone from the dresser and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Brittany.\u201d A cheery voice came over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey girl, ever make that big decision?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. Kevin and I are Lilliputians!\u201d Brittany giggled over the phone. Felicia smiled. \u201cWe did it this morning. We\u2019re in a hotel near the border city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, you have to come over and visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, if you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Brittany let out a nervous laugh. \u201cSo soon? What are you and Nick up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia looked over at her husband. He had the smartphone, with the thousand Lilliputians, sitting at the base of his cock. His huge shaft throbbed over the heads of the cheering Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust another boring night.\u201d Felicia told Brittany. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask Kevin if he wants to come over.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Brittany and Kevin rode the Tubes to their friends\u2019 house, they couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous. Normally, they would chat about everything on road trips, ranging from what was going on at work to which team they thought would win the Brobdingnagian football championship. But today they were both silent, contemplating their new life. It was humiliating to think that they were now the size of pepper grains and that their family, friends and coworkers could no longer even see them without some sort of magnification device. Oh, they had tried to convince themselves that it was fine, that their lives were as great as ever, if not better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all, think of all the money that I can save on clothes at this size!\u201d Brittany had joked, although her laughter had been forced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest part had been seeing the Lilliputians when they were no longer microscopic in comparison to them. Kevin couldn\u2019t get over how human they all were, rushing about their everyday business like any Brobdingnagian would. It was grimly fascinating to think that a few weeks ago, he could have stepped on thousands of them at once without even noticing. Back when he was his former size, he could have unknowingly swallowed the maid who changed their hotel sheets or inhaled the taxi driver who drove them to the Tubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was beginning to appreciate what he had once been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were going to see the first Brobdingnagians since they had been transformed into Lilliputians. Of course they were uneasy; who wouldn\u2019t be uneasy at the thought of seeing six-mile tall people? Both Brittany and Kevin had to keep reminding themselves that they had known Felicia and Nick for many years and despite the great size difference, they were still friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany thought about all of the good times that she had had with Felicia and she focused on these memories as the Lilliputian train finally reached its destination. As the train rolled into their friends\u2019 kitchen, she peered through the window at the incomprehensible landscape surrounding her. She assumed that what she was looking at was a granite countertop and appliances in the far distance, but everything was so astronomically huge that she couldn\u2019t be sure. There was a brownish-white object the size of a house resting a few hundred feet away and her mouth fell open as she realized that it was a breadcrumb. The gigantic breadcrumb put things into perspective and her mind was reeling with the overwhelming knowledge of how microscopic she really was when the vast shadow fell over the train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over and saw someone approaching the counter, although she couldn\u2019t tell whether it was Nick or Felicia. All that she saw was a seemingly-endless torso and far above, two colossal arms. The Brobdingnagian\u2019s head was out of view. As she gawked up, Felicia\u2019s voice came over the headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys! I\u2019m so glad you were able to make it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was Felicia outside of the train, larger than any Lilliputian mountain. Brittany exchanged a brief glance with Kevin, who seemed equally astonished. With great trepidation, she took his clammy hand into her own and they stepped out of the train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany could now Felicia\u2019s titanic face high above them, although at her new height, her friend looked both familiar and unfamiliar. She had tied back her dark red hair into a ponytail, a few stray strands hanging down over her forehead and ears, and despite the fact that it was night, she was wearing some sort of futuristic sunglasses. Brittany guessed that the glasses were some sort of magnification device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin tightened his grip on her hand, shaking slightly as Felicia lowered herself down to eye-level with the counter. They could see themselves and the train mirrored in the dark sunglasses, each lens the size of a huge lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Felicia asked, and even though she was still far away, the force of her exhalations were like powerful gales, whipping around Brittany\u2019s long hair. If it wasn\u2019t for the tone of her voice, which was soft and concerned, they would have fainted from sheer fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-we\u2019re doing okay,\u201d Brittany answered, trying her best to sound brave. But it was difficult, considering that Felicia could have reached out and squashed them both under a single fingertip if she wanted. She had to keep reminding herself that this was her friend; the warm smile spreading across the giantess\u2019 fair face helped that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I promise not to crush you guys by accident. I can see you pretty well with this,\u201d Felicia told them, tapping her sunglasses. \u201cI\u2019d imagine that it\u2019s terrifying, being that small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Kevin admitted just as Nick walked through the doorway, pulling on a white t-shirt. He was also wearing a headset, although he only had a wrap-around optical device over one eye. The giant noticed the train, then the two Lilliputians standing on the countertop. He didn\u2019t remember to turn on his headset right away and so his voice was just a deep, thunderous rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn on your headset, Nick,\u201d Felicia said, pointing at her own for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah. Sorry.\u201d His voice sounded normal as soon as he switched it on. He looked down the tremendous length of his body at them. \u201cSo are you two staying for a few days?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Brittany replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019s it like being a Lilliputian?\u201d Nick asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same as before, except everything is huge. You and Felicia are so unbelievably gigantic,\u201d she said, immediately noticing the devilish little grin that appeared on the giant\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I must be scary as all hell.\u201d That grin didn\u2019t go away; if anything, it grew larger. He moved closer to the counter, his hands on his hips, and Brittany saw something that she wished she hadn\u2019t: the massive bulge of his penis twitched and stirred within his shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick! Stop it!\u201d Felicia hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant\u2019s grin finally disappeared. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on hurting them, Felicia. I just like imaging how big I am to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia shot him a look that indicated that he would sleep on the couch if he continued and then she padded over to the opposite counter, taking out wineglasses and a corkscrew. As Brittany and Kevin watched, she uncorked a bottle of merlot and poured some into the glasses. Then she rooted around in a drawer until she found a thimble. Carefully, she allowed a drop or two of the wine to fall into the thimble before she brought it over to where they stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any Lilliputian glasses, I\u2019m sorry to say,\u201d Felicia said, placing the gargantuan thimble down first and then offering her finger for them to climb upon. Kevin and Brittany clambered up onto the fingertip, which had the lingering aroma of the giantess\u2019 vanilla-scented hand lotion. It took some maneuvering, but they managed to get onto the lip of the thimble, where an immense ocean of dark wine awaited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia and Nick sipped their own drinks as the four of them chatted about everything and nothing. It was beginning to feel like old times until Nick glanced over at his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what about our other guests?\u201d He half-whispered, his voice slightly slurred from the wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia\u2019s cheeks reddened. \u201cNick! Not now. We\u2019ll discuss it later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d Kevin asked, feeling lightheaded himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess opened her mouth but Nick spoke first. \u201cYou want to see \u2018em?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for bed now,\u201d Felicia said flatly. The mischievous smile had reappeared on her husband\u2019s face and perhaps it was the alcohol, but Brittany was strangely intrigued.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWait,\u201d Brittany said and both of the Brobdingnagians glanced down toward the thimble where she was sitting. \u201cWho are these guests? Other friends of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaw, they\u2019re Lilliputians. They volunteered to be purchased for fun and pleasure,\u201d Nick replied casually. Felicia glared at him, then made a sort of defeated gesture, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the secret\u2019s out,\u201d she muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how about it? Wanna see them?\u201d Her husband\u2019s grin was stretched wide, showing far too much teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Brittany said, afraid to back out now that she had expressed interest. Felicia reached up and removed a necklace from around her throat, setting it near the thimble. It looked like a normal piece of jewelry, the crystal beads sparkling and catching the light, except for the pendant in its center. Brittany saw that the pendant was really a transparent sphere as large as a small skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Lilliputian carrier,\u201d Felicia explained. \u201cit\u2019s supposed to be a safer way of transporting tiny people.\u201d The disdainful way that she said that word \u201cpeople\u201d indicated that she didn\u2019t exactly view them as such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we supposed to get in there?\u201d Kevin sounded shocked at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Kev. It won\u2019t be so bad,\u201d Brittany said to him as Felicia\u2019s gargantuan finger once again came for them. She crawled up onto it and he reluctantly followed, looking frightened when the finger swept down toward the colossal pendant. There were Lilliputian-sized doors built into it and Brittany opened the one closest to her, stepping inside. Kevin followed closely behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were circular benches with vinyl covers everywhere, enough seats to hold hundreds of Lilliputians. Brittany and Kevin chose one of the benches that were near the outer wall of the sphere so that they could see out. As soon as they were seated, Felicia gently scooped up the necklace and placed it back around her slender throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view was incredible, to say the least. Their entire world was now Felicia\u2019s vast body, her neck and lower jaw looming above them, her chest and breasts stretching far below. The air temperature inside of the sphere steadily rose, warmed by the giantess\u2019 heat, and they had to both take off their coats. Through the walls of the carrier, they could hear the steady beating of her massive heart as it pumped millions of gallons of blood throughout her mountainous body. The sound was oddly soothing in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia strolled into the bedroom, the pendant swaying with her movements. Everything seemed to rush by in a blur until the giantess stopped at the foot of their king-sized bed and then gracefully sat down near the headboard. Through the clear wall, Brittany and Kevin saw Nick pick up his smartphone and bring it closer to his wife. The enormous phone passed by the pendant and they spotted a huge crowd of Lilliputians standing on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, you freaky little pervs?\u201d Nick asked the thousand or so tiny people. A sea of voices rushed over Brittany\u2019s headset, the voices of all of those Lilliputians. She caught a few snippets of sentences, most of them expressing excitement and lust at the sight of the godlike Brobdingnagians. At first, Brittany couldn\u2019t understand why the hell anyone would be excited about being in the presence of miles-tall titans who could wipe them out of existence without a thought; then, as she looked up at Nick towering above them and heard and felt the pulsating of Felicia\u2019s heart, realization dawned upon her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasure tightened her lower belly and she blushed, glad that her friends couldn\u2019t see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who wants to serve their gods first?\u201d The giant smiled as the Lilliputians began to shout enthusiastically. Nick licked his fingertip and then brought it down onto the screen. Carefully, he lifted it back up, toward the eye that had the optical device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of them are stuck to my finger,\u201d he announced, studying the specks that were glued to the soft pad of his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, gross. Just get rid of them,\u201d Felicia said, disgusted. The vibrations from her mammoth vocal cords rattled the pendant and its two tiny occupants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick lowered his finger to his mouth and lapped up the Lilliputians, staring directly at the carrier around his wife\u2019s pale neck as he did. Kevin couldn\u2019t believe that he had just eaten several people. Back when he was still a Brobdingnagian and Lilliputians were mere specks of dust, that was one thing. Watching people his own size consumed by a cruel giant was something entirely different. And the way that the Brobdingnagian was watching them was unnerving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Nick said, reaching out and delicately twisting the pendant, freeing it from the rest of the necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Nick?\u201d Felicia demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going to hurt them. I mean, they\u2019re my friends, too.\u201d He pinched the pendant between his thumb and index finger, holding them a thousand feet away from his dark eye. \u201cThis is gonna be awesome, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany slowly nodded at the immense eye before them, her heart racing; Kevin, on the other hand, seemed less than thrilled, especially when Nick brought the carrier up to his lips. A glistening reddish-pink tongue that could have held several Lilliputian blocks on it darted out and swept over the sphere, coating it in a thick layer of saliva. Once he was finished licking the pendant, he brought it down toward the smartphone, where a cluster of a hundred Lilliputians were watching with bated breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Kevin croaked, closing his eyes as the gigantic sphere came down upon the people below. Brittany continued to watch, simultaneously horrified and enthralled as those directly beneath the pendant were instantly flattened into pulpy mush, blood squirting in all directions. The Lilliputians who weren\u2019t caught beneath the sphere were stuck to it, adhered to the surface by Nick\u2019s saliva. By the time that the giant lifted the pendant back up, there was a multitude of bodies cemented to it, some smashed into bloody smears of flesh, others still alive and wiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, Nick brought them up to his mouth, but this time, he dropped the pendant on his tongue. Kevin opened his eyes just in time to realize that he was inside the living chasm of their friend\u2019s mouth, his mesa-like teeth surrounding them. A few of the Lilliputians were washed away by a sudden flood of saliva, shrieking as they were pulled back toward the dark abyss of the giant\u2019s throat. For one awful moment, Brittany was afraid that Nick would simply swallow the pendant as well. But he didn\u2019t, instead moving his face closer to Felicia\u2019s. They saw her full lips drawing nearer and nearer, parting just as Nick kissed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive thing that was the giant\u2019s tongue lifted slightly, pushing the pendant and all of the Lilliputians attached to it into Felicia\u2019s mouth. The bright white EverGlo lights inside of the carrier illuminated the giantess\u2019 tongue and cheeks and ridged upper palate as the pendant rolled to a stop. More Lilliputians were dragged away by saliva, this time gulped down unknowingly by Felicia. Kevin thought that the people who were already dead were the lucky ones. At least they didn\u2019t have to worry about being dissolved alive in an ocean of stomach acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Felicia\u2019s mouth opened and light streamed in, all of the Lilliputians had been swallowed. The giantess reached in and plucked up the pendant, withdrawing it from her mouth. She looked concerned, her brow furrowed slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d She asked, setting the carrier in the center of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin\u2019s face had turned the color of cottage cheese and he couldn\u2019t manage more than a pitiful whimper. But Brittany slowly smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat <i>was</i> awesome,\u201d she replied in an awe-struck voice. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kevin switched off his headset and turned to his wife. \u201cWe should head back home.\u201d His face was still white with fear. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can trust them anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany made certain that her headset was off as well. \u201cOh, quit being a wet blanket sweetie. Those are our friends we\u2019re talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they just ate hundreds of Lilliputians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re Lilliputians! What if they turn on us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Brittany rolled her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re only messing with Lilliputians who volunteered to being eaten and crushed. They\u2019re not harming Lilliputians that are unwilling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you two okay?\u201d Felicia\u2019s concerned voice filled the pendant. \u201cWe can stop this if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany fumbled and flipped her headset on before Kevin could. \u201cWe\u2019re great!\u201d She shouted with glee. \u201cDo you and Nick do this kind of thing all the time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick likes to play with Lilliputians more than me. He\u2019s obsessed with them.\u201d Felicia let out a half giggle as she watched her husband strip out of his clothes except for his tight white underwear. Defined against the white cotton fabric was his bulge. \u201cPersonally, I can\u2019t stand the things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThings?\u201d Kevin asked after flipping his headset on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, Lilliputians. Sorry.\u201d Felicia\u2019s cheeks turned red from embarrassment. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense taken.\u201d Brittany said. \u201cKevin and I never thought about Lilliputians when we were normal. I guess we never saw them as people until now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia sighed. She didn\u2019t understand society\u2019s notion that Lilliputians were <i>normal</i> in any sense of the word. Even her friends were turning into liberal hippies perpetuating the idea that Lilliputians\u2014or themselves for that matter\u2014were normal. She loved her friends and wouldn\u2019t dream of hurting them; but face it, they were no longer normal. They were things. Specks. Dust. <i>Lilliputians</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Felicia understood why her husband insisted the Lilliputians were normal. Lilliputians looking up at Nick as a god always got him rock hard and excited. Felicia didn\u2019t share his same views, but she did love the crazy sex that came with the Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin looked out the pendant and wondered what Nick was planning. He did <i>not</i> want to see his bud naked\u2014especially because he was six-miles tall. Brittany sensed her husband\u2019s discomfort and knew he was going to spoil the fun for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Felicia?\u201d Brittany asked. \u201cDid you ever get that pedicure you were going on and on about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I did.\u201d Felicia smiled. With her free hand, she removed her black leggings that ended at her upper thigh. Once her legs and feet were bare, she brought the pendant a few inches from her toes. Her nails were painted red with white flowers printed on the big toenail. \u201cI really like this new place and they\u2019re priced well too. The lady that did them up didn\u2019t take long either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grinned and knew what Brittany was doing. Inside the pendant, Kevin was staring out with an opened mouth. Felicia\u2019s feet were almost a mile long and her toes were as long as a commercial airplane. Brittany looked over at her husband and almost laughed, he looked like a kid staring at his first pair of tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should really show them off honey.\u201d Nick pinched the pendant from Felicia and lowered himself to the other end of the bed where Felicia had the soles of her feet on the bed. Her legs were bent and her chest against her knees. Nick lowered the pendant until it made contact with Felicia\u2019s toe. \u201cCome on out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Kevin unbuckled himself from the vinyl seat and walked out the nearest exit. He opened the door and looked out at the vast red surface. He always tried to steal a peek at Felicia\u2019s feet when at work or visiting their home. Now, her toe alone was like a landscape. He wanted to step out, but he felt his body frozen at the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his specialized glasses, Nick watched his hesitant friend at the doorway of the pendant. Then, from behind, he saw Brittany giving her husband a shove. Kevin fell face first onto Felicia\u2019s smooth toenail. He flipped on his back in time to see his giggling wife shutting the door. Nick lifted the pendant from Felicia\u2019s foot and then walked over on the bed near the nightstand where the smartphone full of Lilliputians was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick, don\u2019t leave him there.\u201d Felicia whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cKevin loves your feet. I\u2019m actually doing him a favor by leaving him there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe likes my feet?\u201d Felicia questioned. Then, remembering the headset and that Kevin could hear her \u201cis that true Kev? You like my feet?\u201d Felicia looked at the little dot that contrasted against the white flower on her nail. She had a strong urge to twitch her toes, as if there was a bug on it. That\u2019s what Kevin felt like to her\u2014a bug. A thing. If it were any other Lilliputian, she would have flicked her toe in order to get rid of the nasty little thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was her friend. She stopped herself from wiping out his existent with a slight movement of her toe. It was difficult\u2014very difficult; like trying not to scratch an itch. She kept her toes still and looked down at her former co-worker on her big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014uh,\u201d Kevin stammered. \u201cI think they\u2019re nice.\u201d He heard himself say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick plopped on the bed beside his wife and held the pendant with Brittany still inside. \u201cSo Britt, anything you want to see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to see you having more fun with the Lilliputians.\u201d She said. Nick\u2019s good looks astounded Brittany. His five o\u2019clock shadow had little hairs taller and thicker than she was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou seem too excited.\u201d Nick smiled. \u201cYou can learn something from Brittany, Felicia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia rolled her eyes. Playing with dust seemed so dull and uninteresting to her. She refocused her gaze on Kevin. He had travelled a couple of millimeters, closer to the center of her toe and the white painted flower. Her electronic glasses gave her a picture-in-picture close-up view of Kevin. Felicia almost smiled as she saw the look of awe on Kevin. He was looking left and right and taking in the grand view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia could tell that Kevin turned off his headset, because he was sniffing in the air in an exaggerated motion, like a florist sniffing in his aromatic flowers. But Kevin wasn\u2019t smelling the flowers. He was sniffing in Felicia\u2019s scent; a pleasant mixture of her foot sweat and vanilla spiced lotion she applied hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKevin?\u201d Felicia whispered. She wore a shy grin as she attempted to get his attention. \u201cKev?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t working. Kevin was lost in his own world. With careful ease, Felicia lifted and lowered her foot off the bed. It was less than an inch, but to Kevin, it felt like the world lifted and lowered a couple hundred feet. He looked up into the sky and could Felicia looking down on him. He flipped on his headset and looked up as if he was caught red-handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you saying something Felicia?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to ask if you want to get off.\u201d Then with a second thought, she said, \u201cbut it looks like you\u2019re enjoying yourself down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2014am.\u201d Kevin swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m good here. Unless you want me to get down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really enjoying yourself on my toe?\u201d Felicia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I am. I admit it.\u201d He sighed in relief. \u201cThis is like my fantasy come true. Your feet are gorgeous, especially at this scale. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here. You\u2019re so\u2026big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia blushed from the compliments. Things were still processing in her head. Her former co-worker, who <i>was</i> the same size as her, was now the size of a dot and exploring her toe. As she gazed at his delighted face through her glasses, she started to see him more as a human despite his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you want to see?\u201d Nick asked Brittany. \u201cSome more eating? Some crushing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I haven\u2019t seen crushing. Do that.\u201d Brittany was as giddy and still a little numb from the wine from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then addressed the willing Lilliputians on the smartphone. \u201cWho wants to be crushed?\u201d He smiled. A chorus of excited shouts came over the public channel. \u201cAnyone who want to be crushed under my finger, move here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swarm of about 25 Lilliputians came under the area Nick pointed at. \u201cWant to meet them before I kill them?\u201d Nick asked Brittany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Brittany asked. \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick lowered the pendant so that was on the smartphone, near the gaggle of Lilliputians. Brittany stepped out and greeted the willing (soon-to-be) victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi guys!\u201d Brittany waved at the gaggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of them shouted <i>hi</i> in unison. They then started asking many questions at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Brittany asked. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t be joining you guys. I don\u2019t want to die. I was actually a Brobby and now I\u2019m little like you people. No, I don\u2019t share the same fantasy as you all, but I like to watch. Okay, I need to get going.\u201d Brittany hugged a few of the ecstatic Lilliputians and shook a few hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians were downright happy and excited about their impending doom. Brittany jogged back near the pendent, but didn\u2019t go inside. She turned and faced the crowd and waved them goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to his glasses, Nick was able to see them all and make sure Brittany was safe before lowering his index finger. Everyone in the room heard the cheers from the doomed Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany watched with wide eyes as Nick\u2019s colossal finger came upon the Lilliputians. Their cheers grew louder and louder\u2014then silent. The tip of Nick\u2019s index finger smothered them all, crushing them against the shiny surface of the smartphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany felt a slight breeze from Nick\u2019s descending finger. She shuddered as she saw all the Lilliputians she interacted with earlier disappear under the skyscraper-sized finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia and Kevin heard the shouting and cheering cease. Kevin gulped and felt uneasy. Felicia felt herself getting warm between her legs. It would have been so easy for her to do the same thing to Kevin just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany gave Nick a thumbs-up, before returning to the pendant. Nick gave her a moment before lifting it up. He then went down to the end of the bed and stood above Felicia\u2019s feet. Kevin looked up at Nick\u2019s muscular legs and trembled as he looked at the huge bulge within his tighty whities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to get back inside big guy?\u201d Nick asked Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was evident Nick was enjoying his position over Kevin. The bulge twitched and seemed to grow larger. Kevin reflexively lifted his arm over his head, afraid the enormous cock would fall on him\u2014though at his size, there was no stopping Nick\u2019s cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yea.\u201d Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick lowered the pendant onto Felicia\u2019s toe and waited for Kevin. Once he was secured, Nick got on his bed with his knees and then shifted himself over Felicia. He straddled her and placed the pendant back around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick lowered his body against Felicia and gave her a kiss. His chest came close to the pendant, and gave the little couple a good view of his hard pectoral muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, we can\u2019t do this in front of them.\u201d Felicia said, not convincing her husband. \u201cThey\u2019re our friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should ask them, then.\u201d Nick said drunk with lust and wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think <i>I</i> would be comfortable with that, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, we do it all the time in front of other Lilliputians. And they get a lot more personal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia kissed her husband with flaming hot desire. She ran her hands down his trim sides and felt around his pelvis towards the heavy package. She grabbed a handful and gave it a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pendant was between Felicia\u2019s breasts, atop of her shirt. The tiny couple inside could feel the temperature increase within their enclosure. The beating of Felicia\u2019s heart not only grew faster, but louder too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201d Nick asked.</span></div></div>",

He lowered his face on her crotch and added pleasure, licking and shifting the pendant all around.<br>\r\nThe foreplay went on for a bit, then the brobby couple parted and Nick went to check for the shrunkies. His wet member was now more than exposed to the tinies below.

She doubted the 50 people in her panties were still alive too. Nick gathered another 100 Lilliputians on the card and moved himself so he could pull off Felicia's panties. He rubbed her labia with his free hand drawing a moan from her before parting the folds. He dumped the 100 Lilliputians into Felicia's vagina. The Lilliputians fell into the dark, warm, moist cave and could smell the overwhelming musky feminine odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had always loved giants, so when a chance came to be sold to a Brobdingnagian, she didn't want to pass up the chance. She had been in the first 50 who had been dumped into the giantess's panties. She had been tangled in the trimmed auburn pubic hair very close to the vagina and all she could do was smell that musky feminine odor emanating for the massive womanhood. The others had been either crushed or swallowed up by the huge womanhood of Felicia. Lisa struggled once again but was hopelessly tangled in the pubic hair. Oh well she thought. She then saw massive pillars come down and realized they must be fingers that parted the folds of the massive vagina after rubbing them. She then watched as a card with more Lilliputians was lowered and dumped into the massive vagina. She heard the joyous screams as they plummeted into the cavernous vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grabbed a a condom and dumped 200 Lilliputians into it before pulling it on his erect penis. He could feel the tiny squirms of the Lilliputians just barely on his massive penis. The Lilliputians were tapped between the latex of the condom and the warm flesh of the giant's erect member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw a massive penis that looked like a monument hovering above. She began to squirm trying to escape the pubic hair once again. She watched the giant place a condom over his huge penis after dumping numerous Lilliputians into it. Lisa watched as the giant's huge pelvis came close. Aloud thunderclap was heard as the the giants bodies hit and Lisa was crushed between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia grinned as Nick began to fuck her. A loud moan escaped her lips as Nick began to thrust. He thrust his erect penis into until his balls were pressed against her. He then repeated the process drawing aloud moan of pleasure from Felicia. The giants moaned in pleasure as they fucked. The Lilliputians inside Felicia's vagina were slammed into the walls of her vagina or stuck to the condom while the ones inside the condom were squeezed. Felicia and Nick went at it, they're sweaty bodies crashing against each other as they ha sex and passionately made out. Nick thrust over and over grunting while Felicia moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia wrapped her legs around Nick while she moaned loudly as Nick's balls slapped against her as he rammed his comic deep into her. The Lilliputians inside the condom began to drown from precum and Felicia's contractions crushed many of the Lilliputians. They were enjoying themselves immensely, even more so with the little willing Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 500 remaining Lilliputians watched the huge Brobdingnagians fuck and cheered. They watched as the giant couple bucked as the giant neared climax. With a loud groan Nick came, filling the condom with his hot, sticky cum and drowning any Lilliputians still alive in the condom. He pulled his deflating cock from Felicia and collapsed on the bed next to her. They were both sweaty and panting heavily and and staring up at the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Felicia said as she fixed her auburn hair which was still in a ponytail although it was a messy one now. Felicia had cum flowing from her vagina down her thighs and it was flowing onto the sheets. Nick reached over Felicia to grab the smartphone with the Lilliputians. He then removed his condom and examined it look on to see if he could see any survivors in the cum. Nick, seeing none, tossed the condom into the trash bin. He took 50 Lilliputians on a card and turned towards Felicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick dumped the 50 Lillis onto Felicia's toned, sweaty stomach. Nick kissed Felicia's lips and then kissed his way down to her stomach while she smiled and giggled. Nick began to kiss her stomach, catching some Lilliputians and swallowing them and crushing others as he kissed the tight abs of Felicia. Felicia giggled as she watched Nick lick some of the Lilliputians off her toned stomach. The little Lilliputians had been enjoying themselves on the toned stomach and now cheered as Nick kissed and licked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go again?\" Felicia said smiling as Nick looked up at her after kissing her stomach. Nick glanced over at the counter which read 450 and smiled. They still had many willing toys.</span></div></div>",

The \"Ebony Goddess\" had a long, thick, wavy brown hair, green-blue-ish eyes and most importantly,Her flawless dark but yet glowing skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attire was consisted of a white tank that had \"I am a goddess.Worship me!\" written on it in black ink,Tight blue jeans that accentuated her ass to the public mass and a pair of simple looking black flipflops that went well with her black painted toenails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not that it all mattered to Nick as he had the privilege  to see this beautiful goddess naked.<br>\r\n\"Oh,Hello Nick!\". Viola greeted Nick with a gentle smile as she flipped her luscious hair,exposing her full,beautiful face tohim. <br>\r\n\"Hey,Miss Viola! Nice to meet you!\".Nick extended his hand,greeting the goddess before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they greeted each other,They(including Cynthia) went down to discuss businesses.<br>\r\n\"So,you know what this  is about, right?\".Viola pointed her long index finger toward the quarantined city to  Nick,completely ignoring the tiny woman on his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.How did you manage to convince the people in the city about this? I mean,I can't imagine them agreeing  to volunteer to be used by us like this...\" Nick asked her.<br>\r\nViola just broke into laughter upon hearing his words.\"Of course they wouldn't want to,silly! That is why we set up a perimeter over the city for them.Those who'd try to pass it would get immediately executed by us......\". She rose up one of them Flip flops to Nick,Revealing some youths' remnants that tried to escape earlier  sticking under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing their guts crushed under her sexy foot,Made  Nick hornier then ever,showing a bit of his monster cock raging  under his pants to the Ebony goddess.<br>\r\nViola bit on her lips as she saw glimpses of the famous cock that she was about to be ravaged with on the soon to be ruined city.<br>\r\n\"Alright,Once you're prepared, go talk to my crew so we could start shooting while the sun is still bright.\"Viola told him as she left him and Cynthia behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick himself wasted no time in doing so.He handed Cynthia to one of the female crew(He couldn't give her to a man,knowing that he might harass her),got naked  and took his first step into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit....\".Nick thought to himself as he saw the one inch talled people running for their lives before his feet.\"This is gonna be awesome!\"<br>\r\nNick observed as Viola entered the city from the other side naked,exposing her valuable privates  to the tiny people of city and to the drooling,white giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Nick,Viola was not as near as careful as Nick was with the city.Without any care to the people beneath her,Viola strolled into the packed streets toward Nick,Crunching anything beneath her brown feet of fleeing,terrified  people to occupied  cars that were trying to outrun her thunderous,swallowing steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide,opened mouth,Nick espied as her endowed-chest bounced with each approaching step she would take to murder the terrified,fleeing Gulliverians beneath them in unison as she kept on reaching his proximity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick did nothing but savor this wonderful,sexy moment until it ended with her setting her brown  toes before his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... It does look impressive in person,actually!\".Viola evaluated his manhood with a grin on her face.\"..But, show me first what you can do with that before I give you the highest privilege in this world of allowing you to be inside of me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And what would that be?\".Nick tried to keep himself cooled despite having the argue to fuck her on spot,Right now on this very tiny city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rape that building to crumbs!\".She commanded him,pointing her index digit toward the tall building  standing beautifully next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With fucking pleasure...\". With a board smile on his face,Nick stopped before the clean,shining mirror of the tall building that was slightly taller then him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the horrible thing that the  giant was about to do to them,The panicking people inside the busy building tried to escape it but were unable to do so due to Viola implanting her foot right before the building's main entrance,completely blocking anyone from escaping their upcoming fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the argue to fuck Viola on spot , Nick wasted no time in ramming his pumped manhood into the packed building,pulverizing floors and Gulliverians into red pastes on his dick as he kept on ramming and slamming his cock vertically and horizontally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gulliverians in the building mindlessly scattered around  as they tried to avoid  the meaty wrecking ball from turning them into red pastes.<br>\r\nSome even attempted to escape the building  by jumping off from its windows.But that ended  horribly for them as  their bodies shattered on the concrete streets once it  made contact with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her fingers rubbing  her clitoris,moaning,Viola watched  the building toppling  to its stone foundation as the the giant man wrecked it down with his cock,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola took out her foot back as soon as the building completely  toppled to its demise,Taking the rest of the lives of the lucky ones that miraculously managed to survive Nick's wrecking ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\".Viola congratulated the puffing man as he tried to catch his breath back from the intensive  session that he just had with the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick just grinned back at her with pride as he regained his composure <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She liked the sound of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss it...\".Nick coldly commanded her with a slow voice as he looked at down  her like she was nothing of significance to him(Well,she was,actually...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing him commanding her like  a pet,like someone at his disposal, turned her on.<br>\r\nLike a dog with its mouth opened,Nikki embraced the thick, meaty walls with her naked body as she worshiped it with kisses and pussy/breast rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gently moaned as he felt her submission to his impressive cock,promoting him to use his finger to rub her against his manhood,just careful enough not to burst her against it...yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the main picture,Cynthia was there, standing by herself alone with her fingers rubbing her clitoris in gentle moans  as she observed the events unveiled before her.<br>\r\nShe also enjoyed seeing Nick's impressive manhood in motion.In fact,She and him would get it on sometimes when he is not with his wife.She just hoped that she wouldn't be found by her at some point as she  knew that it definitely would be the end of her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sexual play heated up between the male brobdi and the female guli,Nick decided to take it up a notch;He pinned the Asian woman onto the ground with his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki didn't know what was coming for her as she  felt her body was violently pushed against the glistened sand by the immense   weight of the erected penis.It was a painful sensation to her and her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait!\".Nikki called out for the giant man to stop with coughs coming out from her mouth as the immense weight of his manhood pushed out the oxygen from entering her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nick's horny mind was apathetic.He just enjoyed ramming his dick violently against her,digging up a hole ininto the ground with her back in the process. Nick could hear the asian woman's pleas over his headset,But it did nothing to him but make him enjoy rapping her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia stopped playing with her clitoris as soon as she realized that Nick looked like he was about to dig out a grave for the guliverian woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick! Stop this as once!\".Cynthia commanded him over the headset as she tried to get closer to the drilling penis.\"Nick!!!!!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a minute for the giant man to murder and bury the victim into the ground the moment he ejaculated his load like  a nuclear artillery,splattering her mixed with his cum.<br>\r\n\"You fucking idiot! Look what you have done!\".Cynthia shouted to the giant as she stood next to the small pool of white and red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that....\".Nick apologized with a sneer as he took his dick out from the woman's grave.\"I just have this thing for submissive asian women...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not amused with his words,Cynthia walked up to Nick's sandal and kicked it as hard as she could with her black heels.\"You are really that selfish, are you not!? Tell me what are we supposed to do now with this?\". Cynthia pointed her finger at the scared domestic workers who  watched everything unfolded via the  windows of the exotic mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking easy...\".Nick stood straight on his feet,engulfing the mansion with his shadow.\"You know that I'd always feel hungry after sex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick walked past the angry woman and  toward the mansion.The screams  could be heard as the giant man bent down in front of the mansion to rip its roof apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick throw the roof as far as he could, away from its main vessel before shifting his gaze back at the powerless domestic workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending his hand toward them,Nick managed to get hold of almost all of them as the others who were fast on their feet escaped his clench and into different rooms of the roofless mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids as well as the butlers screamed and begged the man to keep them alive as they were brought up to his face.<br>\r\n\"Since I am quit the fan of Asian cuisines ,I think I'd enjoy those who make it as well~\".Nick laughed as he sent the oriental domestic workers down  into his mouth and subsequently swallowed  into the depths of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for the rest of you cunts in the mansion...\".Nick brought his gaze back at the mansion.\"Don't think that I'd let any witness escape my sight...\",<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick bent down again with his ass hovering above the mansion.In the count of unknown numbers,Nick brought  his full weight down on the roofless mansion,flattening the mansion into the ground as well as everything was inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking crazy...\". Cynthia muttered as she reverted back to rubbing her clitoris as she heard the giant's moans ,Betraying her integrity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnsuring that all witnesses were no longer in the current world, Nick picked up Cynthia from the murder scene  and walked back to his country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a fail.I apologize about that...\".The apologizing man lowered his full hand  down next to the tiny car parked in front of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...,,,It's fine.Anyway,I have to go now for a meeting with some Lilliputians a  new device called the  \"PRD\u2122.\".She told him as she got into her tireless car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PRD\u2122?The fuck is that?\".The dumbfounded giant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't disclose any infos.But you might  see a different version of me if it ever worked....\".She winked at him before driving away from his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna call you later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick watched as the tiny car ridiculously sped off away on the giant street.\"Fucking ridiculous..\".He giggled to himself before walking into his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The next day...</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He planted several more kisses on her foot before picking up the other foot and doing the same. Her feet so soft and the red toenails were perfect. He then began to massage her feet and he could hear coos of pleasure from her as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia had been annoyed with Nick but the kissing of her feet and now the wonderful foot massage sure were swaying her opinion on him at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched TV together a little longer in silence while Nick massages Felicia's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babe, let's go upstairs and let me really make it up to you.\" Nick said as he pushed Felicia's legs and feet off his lap and stood up.

Nick had been focused on making Felicia feel amazing and he thought he did a pretty good job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick got up and watched as Felicia in her bra and panties got up and put a t-shirt on before walking out of the room. He stared at her perfect firm ass as she walked. He heard her feet slap against the hardwood of the hallway and heard her go downstairs. He pulled on a t-shirt and went downstairs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia made a nice breakfast for the two of them and they made small talk as they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinking maybe we get more Lilliputians for tonight? What do you think babe?\" Nick said as he ate a piece of bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to.

So what do you have for me today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two things. The first is pretty much the usual you know? It's a girl, Lucy, who wants to have some fun with a giant. She's a Gulliverian so I'm sure you can imagine what kind of things she wants from you.\" Nick smiled at this as Cynthia read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia just rolled her eyes in the other room as she cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other one Cynthia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a actually a custom request from a friend of a friend. Can you get Felicia in here too? She should probably here this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia!

So he had this idea for a video and he's willing to pay a boat load of money to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Felicia said a little more attentive at the mention of a lot of money<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He recently acquired a large Lilliputian city, don't ask how and he essentially wants a giant couple to turn it into their own personal palyground. You know go on a rampage, stomp around, eat some Lillis, the whole nine yards. Maybe even fuck or something I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt his dick harden in his pants. This sounded amazing. He looked over at Felicia who seemed a little apprehensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants the two of you, and he was very specific about that, to be the giant couple in question. He says that the scenario is a \"a giant couple who are are playful and go on a rampage through the populated city. He wants you both to be barefoot and he wants Nick in shorts and a t-shirt and you Felicia in a tank top and cutoff jean short shorts. The clothing is negotiable as he gave me a list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babe! This would be awesome! Besides you don't really care for Lilliputians to begin with!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Nick but I don't really know if I want to be in one of your videos.\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always the other one.\" Cindy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babe!\" Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's offering a lot of money for it.\" Cynthia said. \"All you do is stomp around in a city filled with tiny people, maybe eat some. It's just mayhem and destruction with a bit of sex if you feel like it.\" Cynthia finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia was definitely considering it, Nick could just tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a few more details, mainly just stuff about setting up the scene, you know backstory for the giant couple and what not. Just tiny details. You should do it Felicia in my opinion.\" Cynthia said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say Felicia?\" Nick said looking over at her as she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me and not some other girl?\" Felicia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He feels the interaction will be more natural if it's a real couple. He's willing to negotiate the price, even buy you a gift Felicia.\" Cindy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick thought his dick was going to burst out of his boxers. The thought of playing in a Lilliputian city with Felicia was incredible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to do it now, I'm sure the offer will stay open for later.\" Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia looked over at Nick and saw the bulge in Nick's boxers. She made her decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Chloe is currently walking around on a sandy beach, which is part of the large island Kingdom of Brobdingnag. From her people\u2019s point of view, Brobdingnag is just a very large island, but from the point of view of the inhabitants of Gulliver, and Lilliput, her home island was the size of a continent. Chloe is creating a mental map of her world in her head, made up of three islands, the largest naturally being the island continent of Brobdingnag. The second largest island belongs to the Gulliverians, the second largest of the three types of human that inhabit the planet Terra. Gulliverians are not native to her world, only the Brobdingnags, and Lilliputians are. The midsize Gulliverians actually migrated here accidently through a portal called the Bermuda Triangle from another planet called Earth, where everyone is around the same size. The new midsize immigrants quickly created a homeland for themselves, where more and more new arrivals arrive each year from their world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That is the reason Chloe is walking around on the beach. She is hoping to get lucky. Every so often, somebody from one of the other kingdoms, or a vessel from Earth accidently washes ashore. The Lilliputians are the size of tiny ants to her, and nearly a waste of her time, unless she could get them by the thousands. However, the Gulliverians standing at over an inch tall made her day. She loved to humiliate, and finally devour them alive in different kinds of food, especially if they are having sex. The taste of their tiny nude bodies screaming and having an orgasm together as they go down her throat is beyond description, but they had to be nude. She tried to swallow some clothed tiny people once, and not only did their clothes taste terrible, but they almost chocked her too. It was like eating a nice hamburger still in its wrapper. Sometimes she might even feed her tiny nude humans to her huge pets, especially as they make love. She also made a great deal of money by running a secretive restaurant that caters to other giants, who have a taste for living miniature people in their normal foods. In addition to eating them, she also works as a college science professor. Sometimes she would bring the miniature people she captured to her biology class for study, and to promote her restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On this day, the nice looking, chubby giantess is walking around on the sandy beach. She is carrying a large, nearly empty book bag that contains empty glass jars. She also has a long butterfly net with her. Chloe\u2026</span></div></div>",

Anyone and any location was susceptible and at constant risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Escape</i> was a tiny and cramped club located in Seoul, South Korea. On any given night, the club would be filled with people of all races thanks to the nearby university. The club was dank and dark, lit by an array of neon lights and obnoxious strobe machines. The club gave off a cyberpunk sort of feel, especially when it rained outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electronic music blared as the club goers flirted, danced, and drank their soju. The girls wore their best skimpy outfits while the guys ogled them. A flash of white lit as bright as the sun overcame the inside of the club in a split second. Minutes later, a few more students stumbled in the club only to find it empty. Even the bar tenders were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe club goers have been chosen by the portal. They were no longer in their dank club, but outside during a clear a day. Their eyes winced as they tried to get accustomed to the bright sun. All their senses were out of whack. They could smell the ocean, feel a pebbly ground, hear crashing waves\u2014complete opposite the electronic music, sticky hard floors, and smell of spilt drinks. It didn\u2019t help them much that they were all drunk with internal body clocks telling them it was one in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe wore her skirt and t-shirt as she walked the beach in her bare feet. She was a bit heavier than the average Brobby, but a lot prettier than the skinny bitches at her school. She didn\u2019t consider herself fat, just a little soft. At any rate, she didn\u2019t give a shit about her weight and wasn\u2019t about to diet\u2014since that would mean she would have to cut back on her intake of little people. No way that was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked along the shoreline, scanning the clean sandy beach hoping to find some unlucky souls. A flash of light, like lightning, caught her attention in front of her. She knew what that meant. She walked briskly in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Chloe said aloud when she spotted the one inch club goers. \u201cI hit the fucking mother lode.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 brand new Gulliverians from Earth were at her feet. She could see that they were dazed and confused by their slow movements and inability to walk straight. She grew even more excited when she saw how attractive and well-dressed they all were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t anyone move,\u201d she told the crowd as she swung her backpack off her shoulders and pulled out a few glass jars. \u201cI\u2019ll make this quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Korean women screamed as she looked up at the 400 foot tall giantess. Chloe kicked up some sand with her foot towards the crowd, gentle to her, painful to the Gulliverians. The club goers fell back into the sandy beach and tried to get a hold of their bearing. Chloe took the moment of their incapacitation to collect them and drop them in her jars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chloe was finished, she slid the jars back in her backpack; all except for the Korean woman who screamed earlier. Chloe lifted her up and held her in front of her eyes. Chloe felt a tinge of jealousy as she looked at the skinny Korean. She stripped the one inch woman and then lowered her into her mouth. Chloe then placed the backpack over her shoulders and continued walking down the beach as she played with the woman in her mouth. Her tongue shoved the fragile thing all around her mouth, coating her in saliva. Chloe swallowed when the woman\u2019s movements grew weak. The tiny lump travelled effortlessly down her throat where she was immediately forgotten.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chloe took her time walking in the forest, wading through the Gulliverian trees as though they were blades of tall grass. It was nighttime and the only source of light came from the crescent moon overhead. But she didn\u2019t dare to use a flashlight, since she was technically trespassing on Gulliverian territory. Besides, she didn\u2019t want her prey to see her ahead of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees rubbed against her legs as she crept through them and she was glad that she had decided to dress in plain jeans and a short-sleeved blouse. Once, when she had gone on a similar hunting expedition, she had worn shorts and her legs had been thoroughly scratched. It had been difficult avoiding the inevitable questions from her neighbors and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chloe saw the tiny spot of orangish-gold light, she carefully crouched down, trying not to topple any of the fragile little trees. Guillverians, no doubt. Just the thought of the small people made her salivate. She was thankful that she had had a large dinner; otherwise, her stomach would have been growling loudly enough to scare the Guilliverians away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting her head, she listened with the intensity of a lynx hunting a rabbit. If she concentrated, she could make out faint voices coming from the direction of the flickering light. A predatory smile stretched across her face as she slunk toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Dylan. Did you find those beers?\u201d Nate asked as he tossed another stick onto the fire. It was too wet and it smoldered and smoked but didn\u2019t catch fire. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his friend searching through one of the coolers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, why do you hang out with him?\u201d Tom whispered, his brawny arm draped around his blonde-haired girlfriend, Katherine. They all looked over at Dylan, who was now looking through the second cooler for the beer. As much as he hated to admit it, Dylan was sort of an embarrassment. They had been friends since they were little kids, but now that Nate had returned home from college, he saw what a big nerd Dylan had become. He was even wearing some sort of math t-shirt with a whole bunch of weird symbols, which Nate guessed was supposed to be funny, except he didn\u2019t get the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, on the other hand, was one of his frat brothers and he was the sort of guy who made the sorority girls swoon. Tall, muscular, tanned: that was how Nate would describe him. He could be sort of a jerk at times, but Nate put up with it. It had been his idea to go camping and so here they were, in the middle of the woods, watching Dylan hunt for the beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s my friend,\u201d Nate finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a nerd, bro. I bet he\u2019s never got laid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine giggled at Tom\u2019s statement and looked at him fawningly. She really was attractive, big-breasted and full-lipped, her eyes a startling sky blue. Nate felt a stab of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of getting laid, you wanna?\u201d She asked him, batting her fake eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck yeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate watched them crawl into their tent and zip up the opening. Meanwhile, Dylan had found the beers and was carrying over a few bottles, trying to balance them in his chubby arms. Without warning, he froze like a deer in headlights, his eyes widening behind his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Nate asked him, startled to see the blood draining from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something coming toward us.\u201d Even as Dylan spoke, the ground beneath them quivered like gelatin and there was a sound like thunder. Except thunder wasn\u2019t so rhythmic. The noise was more like\u2026footsteps. Really big ones. Nate stood up just in time to see the gargantuan shape outlined against the trees. At first, it was difficult to make out what it was; then he saw the flash of light high up as the gigantic eyes reflected the moonlight. It was a person, he realized. A Brobdingnagian, to be exact. He heard rumors about them, not all of them good, but he figured that trying to introduce himself would be the best course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Nate called up to the Brobdingnagian. The giant (or rather, giantess, since he quickly saw that it was a woman) didn\u2019t say anything as she bent down. As her face drew closer to the fire, he saw that she was pretty despite some extra weight, her green eyes reminding him of a cat\u2019s. Nate didn\u2019t panic until he saw that she was reaching for him, her palm and outstretched fingers swooping down from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he panicked. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe couldn\u2019t help but smile as she picked up the Gulliverian. He was young and handsome and would have been out of her league if he had been a Brobdingnagian. The firelight illuminated his tiny face as she studied him, deciding whether she wanted to eat him now or later. A soft gurgle from her stomach decided for her. She hadn\u2019t had dessert yet and he would be perfect. Almost tenderly, she peeled off his shirt and jeans, giggling as he began to plead with her. It was always so thrilling when they begged for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sneakers came off last and she licked at his minute feet, laughing as he shrieked and kicked. Chloe sucked him gradually into her mouth, feeling the almost-microscopic nub of his penis slide against her tongue. She savored his taste, the salt of his sweat and his designer cologne. To her, he tasted better than the finest chocolate. As his friend with the glasses watched, Chloe poked his head into her mouth with a fingertip, pushing him around with her tongue. Rarely did she chew; she disliked the coppery taste of raw meat. Besides, the sensation of tiny people squirming in her stomach was exquisite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe\u2019s eyes met those of the chubby Guillverian and she slowly swallowed his cute friend, feeling his weak struggles as he traveled down the length of her esophagus and into her belly. She covered her mouth and burped, the insect-sized man still thrashing inside of her. The other Gulliverian cringed as she started to grab for him; then, something else caught her attention. There were groans and moans coming from one of the tents and she seized the top of the tent between her fingers, curious. As soon as she yanked it from the ground, she spotted two more tiny people. It was obvious that she had caught them mid-coitus; they were still joined at the hip. The two Guilliverians gawked up at her, too petrified to move as she plucked them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two look delicious,\u201d she purred and they both began to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine found herself several hundred feet above the ground, shivering despite the warm summer air. The Brobdingnagian\u2019s fingers were constricted tightly around her nude body, the giantess\u2019 monster truck wheel-sized ring digging into her abdomen. As Katherine fought and beat at the coiled fingers, she saw the giantess dangle Tom above her open mouth. She stopped pounding at the columns of flesh just in time to see the Brobdingnagian release him, allowing him to plunge into her waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw her boyfriend devoured, Katherine redoubled her efforts to get away. She would rather have slipped free and plummeted to her death than be eaten by a monster. But the giantess\u2019 grip was too strong and no amount of wiggling could free her. She too was raised before the immense mouth, the lips shining dully as they pulled apart. Even in the relative darkness, she could see the giantess\u2019 teeth and tongue and worst of all, the utter blackness of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooooo!\u201d Katherine screeched, shrieking until her lungs ran out of air. The Brobdingnagian woman waited until she stopped wailing and then tossed her nonchalantly into her mouth. She saw the massive lips and teeth rush by her in a blur and then she landed on the huge tongue, which was slimy and wet and hideously warm. Saliva washed over her, filling every orifice, but she was too busy pummeling at the ridged roof of the giantess\u2019 mouth to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobdingnagian chuckled and closed her lips, leaving Katherine in unbearable darkness. She felt rather than saw the tongue undulate beneath her, pushing back toward the throat. Grabbing wildly for anything to hold onto, she managed to seize hold of one of the back molars. But the tooth was too slick and she gasped as her lost her grip. Her scream echoed loudly around her as she tumbled backwards into the throat. She was aware of being squeezed tightly by the esophagus; then she fell through the sphincter into the hellish depths of the giantess\u2019 stomach. To her horror, she could still hear Tom and Nate, who were slowly being dissolved by the acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave one final hopeless push against the walls of the stomach; then her consciousness began to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pleasantly full, Chloe glanced around, trying to find the last Guillverian. He had probably fled when he had seen her eating his friends. But when she looked down, there he was, right by her left foot. To her amazement, he was staring up at her with a mixture of adoration and awe. Chloe had never seen anyone look at her that way. She was used to being the plump girl, the one that Brobdingnagian men didn\u2019t look at twice. The tiny man\u2019s admiration was strangely flattering. When she squatted down to pick him up, he didn\u2019t run from her. Slowly, she brought him up to her face, feeling conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in her life, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do\u2026</span></div></div>",

Luckily for these long surviving students,They all already had  experience unlike the last ones who got instantly squashed every time Jess would carelessly move her feet around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the older sister stood before her younger sister,towering over her in height,She looked down at her endowed chest and  noticing  this person called Dylan.<br>\r\n\"Are you fucking kidding me!?\".Jess broke into laughter as she realized what this was all about with Chole.\"You couldn't find a man of your own size so you had to reserve to a Gulli? What a fucking shame! Dad and Mom would be ashamed of you as I am right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChole just lowered her head in shame as the dominant words cruelly washed over her,leaving her on the verge of tearing down.<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's not nice for you to say,you know?She is your sister..\". Dylan naively  stood up  for his \"Date\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as his naive stand up cries for his date were processed in her mind,Jesslyn broke into teared down,laughing at his pathetic attempt of shielding a woman already hundred  times his size.<br>\r\n\"I'd crush you right on my sister's chest for saying that,you Nerdy looking bug!\". Jesslyn taunted Dylan as she gave him a full scan with her sea colored eyes.<br>\r\n\"i m doing her a favor here. I mean how the fuck  could she have sex with you? I'll tell you this so keep it in mind,boy.No woman of any race would flock to your kind or Lilliputians once they had taken the Brobdingnagian man's huge,satisfying cock!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words,Dylan felt utterly shattered.He felt that he couldn't fight back the hard truth that was spilled from the lips of these awful yet beautiful  woman..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......Until a miracle happened <br>\r\n\"Let's go  to my room,honey.\" Chole comforted the tiny nerd in  between her chest  just like he  did  a while ago,coldly walking away from her furious sister and into her room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n .....</span></div></div>",

Jesslyn wasn't  that kind of a Brobdingnag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the 3 runaways ran past the TV stand,a giant manicured and uncompleted from toe painting fell right before them,knocking the 3 students 10 meters away from it with a great,thunderous  shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck that hurts!\".One of the student said as he tried to stand up on his feet with his hands on  his paining head from the fall.\"Oh,shit...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 students couldn't clearly see Jesslyn's face since it was shadowed by the room's lighting  as she looked down on them.But they could tell from that  sightly visible right  eye staring down coldly  at them that she was not amused at all at their escaping attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recall dismissing you three...\".Jesslyn's voice coldly went through the 3 students' bodies,causing them to shiver  with fear.<br>\r\nThey all froze in their places with the wish that she would just forgive them and just bring them back to their other classmates to serve her like they were meant to do.They really just wished  for that to happen from the bottom of their hearts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas,They made a grieve mistake and missed that chance,forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys interested on going into a biology tour?I have vacant seats as of now..\" Jesslyn coldly taunted her 3 students before her unfinished painted toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students knew what she meant by that.And it really,really caused their heartbeats to increase tremendously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 students followed the first one as he ran toward her gigantic toes and started kissing and rubbing  them for forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesslyn just giggled in amusement as  her 3 young students begged her for their lives through worshiping her toes with their  whole existences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesslyn gave them false hope by allowing them to worship her  passionately for as long as they could go for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their bodies reached their full limits,The 3 students's bodies just shut downed abruptly and fell defeated before the worshiped toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,it was about time!\".Jesslyn said in amusement as she bent down toward the 3 fallen worshipers and plucked  them up from the ground with her right hand to her face's level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,I'll tell you this.You guys did really well with the worshiping.But you know that you made the biggest mistake you could ever do the moment you left your supposed posts without being told to do so!\".The biology teacher   gazed down with her sky colored eyes  on the 3 tired bodies in her palm as her mint breath washed over them.\"But like I said,You guys are going on a tour of biology.I'll see you guys back  tomorrow in the bathroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesslyn just opened her mouth and send the 3 students  into her mouth like she would do with her sleeping pills at certain nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students were in no condition  to struggle in her mouth.They were all tired from all the previous,pointless  actions that they had to take to save their lives..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow,They just wished for a quick,bad ending for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jesslyn was never the kind to be kind toward Gulliverians in any kind of circumstances.She was 10 times her younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesslyn moved the  3 students with her wet tongue to her side molars and bit down just a bit so  that  the giant molars would just  rip a part of each student's body or drill into their bodies  enough not to kill them immediately ,leaving them to suffer grievously as the 3 were all sent down into her esophagus to their biology tour.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesslyn moaned in ecstasy with her right  hand on her delicate neck as the 3 students were being violated  by her throat's muscles before being sent down into the acidic sea of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,That certainly cooled me off a bit from my younger sister of a bitch!\".Jesslyn told her self as she walked back to her couch to let the other students finish their work on her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students continued painting her perfectly shaped toes into dark shades,Jesslyn took her phone from the table to call somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who should I call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

And he shares the same for me as well!\".Chole explained her feelings toward the tiny man in her palm to her family.But that did nothing but keep them more confused.They couldn't take any of her words seriously as they all knew that  Chole was always the one who would be the most ruthless of them all toward the Gulliverians as well as toward  the Lilliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me down,Chole..\".Dylan requested from Chole witha serious tone .Dylan didn't like the reception at all.<br>\r\n\"B-But....\".Chole tried to reason with him.<br>\r\n\"Just let me down,Please...\".<br>\r\nDespite being doubtful,Dylan's tone managed to subdue her,prompting her to lower her hands gently,allowing the man to leave her clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChole  slowly observed as Dylan stopped before the old couple's feet who were sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Dylan,Nice to meet you!\"Dylan introduced himself to the headset-less parents as he extended his hand in peace.<br>\r\nStill dumbfounded,Fabian just gazed down confusingly  at the tiny man before his aged toes.<br>\r\nThough Marcia was more responsive to him.She couldn't hear him clearly but she knew that he was greeting them.She gently bent down toward the tiny young man with her wrinkled,long index digit rubbing against his upper body.A part of Marcia never  aged in her.Feeling him rubbed against her finger,Marcia felt the need of dominating him on spot under her finger.But thanks to her aged mind,She managed to successfully leave the young man in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter successfully getting a green response from one of the parents,Dylan decided to walked toward her brother and his apparent girlfriend.<br>\r\nUnlike the older couple,Dylan felt intimidated by these two.His legs started quivering  in fear as he was overshadowed by the giant,muscular legs  before him let alone being over shadowed by the much  slender yet toned legs that were next to his.<br>\r\n\"...Nice to meet you,I am Dylan..\".Still quavering in fear,Dylan extended his hand toward the two gods.<br>\r\n\"Fucking hilarious!Lauri,Can you believe this?\". Jon broke down in tears as he  looked at the delicate,beautiful  face of his girlfriend.More or less it reassembled that of Barbara Palvin.<br>\r\n\"Can I? I mean,Look at how  tiny he is  next to our feet!What a pathetic bug!\".She replied back at him as she looked down at Dylan with a degenerative gaze.<br>\r\n\"You're right....Maybe I should just crush him for you right here right now....\" Jon uttered in a low tone before hovering his left feet over the tiny man.<br>\r\nDylan tried to run away from the approaching foot as it came down on him.But  he just failed horribly to do so.The best of his action could do  for him was leaving his lower part  of his body pinned down by the foot while his upper  half was exposed to the outer world in between the giant's toes.<br>\r\nDylan struggled for oxygen as his lower body was being slowly crushed  against the carpet beneath him as the  droplets of sweat from the  giant's sweaty toes fell into his mouth,giving him an unexpected dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is fucking hot! I like seeing men being dominated under your feet!\".Lauri  kissed her boyfriend's lips as she rubbed her foot over his,Giving Dylan the admixture atmosphere smell  of  man's sweat and  strawberry lotion smell..\"......Or maybe we should take this little grunt upstairs to  show him how much of a  man you are!\".Lauri bit on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's erected penis liked the the idea as it tried to escape his pants.But at the same time,His foot squeezed harder against the tiny man beneath their fused feet.<br>\r\nLuckily for Dylan,Jon's penis beat it his foot.<br>\r\nJon took out his foott off the minuscule body beneath it allowing Dylan to catch his breath.<br>\r\n\"Today is your lucky day,you little fucke!.You'll be joining us in our sex between me and the hottest girl in Gulliveria!\".Jon sarcastically congratulated the tiny man at their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..............<br>\r\nWhat does Chole do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Ironically,She couldn't fit his whole dick into her mouth as it was too big for her.But she knew that Jon would handle the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept on sucking and sucking until Jon commanded her from doing so.<br>\r\nJon took off her head by her hair away from his dick and commanded her to stick the injured tiny man onto his feminine saliva covered manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauri gently plucked up the injured nerd off from their bed and  hovered him above her man's mammoth sized cock.<br>\r\nShe didn't even have to press him against the cock.With a close proximity,Her Saliva did its job by adhering him on the man's cock.<br>\r\n\"Perfect..\".Jon said as he rubbed the tiny man onto his dick,making sure of having all of his manhood covered by Lauri's warm saliva<br>\r\nJon couldn't even fight back as his body was still in a shock state  from the damages that it received a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jon was preparing himself,Lauri did the same by undressing herself and positioned herself on the bed with her ass facing Jon,ready to take his \"Spam Javelin\" in with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon stopped rubbing his cock when he felt that everything was in place and steadied himself to ram his \"Spam Javelin\" into her starving pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything felt like it was in place for him,Jon groped her tights and rammed his dick as hard as he could into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan couldn't do shit in his position as the giant log that he was on made vicious contact with the watery cave.He just hoped for it to end as soon as possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!!!!!!\".Lauri let out moans of pleasure and pain with a sedated expression on her face as the giant cock ravaged her pussy.<br>\r\nNobody else on this world managed to make her feel like a woman but Jon.He was the only guy that she would gladly submit to and obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Lauri's humidity vagina,Dylan was suffering from asphyxiation and barfing as the motions of the ramming cock made him experienced a second hell.<br>\r\nHe was still amazed by the fact that he was not dead yet.But alas.The outcomes of that was nothing but upcoming sufferings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan tried his best to move his numbed body around the gluey ground around him so that  he could hopefully fall to his death and thus ending his suffering in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tortuous attempts,Dylan finally managed to have his body detached  from the ramming log.<br>\r\nBut things did not went like he had imagined.<br>\r\nIn the sheer second that  his body detached from the giant cock,Dylan falling body was surprisingly hit  by the giant cock as it retracted and rammed harshly onto him in the air,spattering and disseminating his remains all over Lauri's vaginal walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauri's pleasure doubled when she knew that the man had just lost his life inside of her pussy.<br>\r\nWith his death still gone unnoticed to the horny god,Jon continued on ravaging his girlfriend's pussy before ejaculating into it,bleaching Lauri's vaginal walls with his cum and washing down the remnants of the tiny man deep into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laid next each other on the bed,fully contented from their love making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear,I am sure nobody could fuck me like you do...\".Lauri praised Jon as she tried to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,You better keep thinking like that,bitch! It makes me feel happy...\".Jon replied back as he pinched one of her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a log of chatting,They both went  into deep sleep....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Chloe looks down, smiles at him and as he smiles back up at her, and she raises her huge foot up, slamming it down on him, squashing the tiny teenage boy like a grape. \u201cWeakness and sympathy are things she will not tolerate in herself,\u201d the giantess says angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, her foot slamming down hard has the effect of a 2.9 earthquake two miles around her, which causes concerned Gullivarian\u2019s to call their local police force. Thinking it was just a simple Earthquake; a police car is sent over to the affected area. The black and white patrol car drives around slowly. Inside the car, two police officers, a young 25-year-old African man who looks like a male model, and a young 24-year-old Asian female that looks like a female model are cautiously looking for any damage. Frank and Sara were teamed up a year ago, and six months ago, they began to date, which naturally turned sexual. Even thou their relationship broke most of the rules, they did not care, and they are in love, a love that is soon to be tested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the patrol car slowly drives around in the darkness, Frank suddenly slams on the brakes with a look of horror on his clean-shaven face, jerking the two officers forward. Suddenly, they scream when they see a giant hand engulfing their toy size car. Frank tries to use his radio, but before he can use it, their car\u2019s roof, along with the antenna is ripped off. The stunned tiny officers are quickly removed from the car, and end up on a giantesses hand. As the giant woman throws the toy car into the nearby sea, the two officers draw their tiny sidearm\u2019s, and say with tiny, mouse like, soft voices, \u201cFreeze, you\u2019re under arrest for violation of several treaties.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chloe just laughed, at her size those tiny weapons would not be felt, much less harm her in anyway. They fire on her, but Chloe just grins. Chloe reaches over, knocks their weapons away from them with her pinky, and orders them both to undress or die. The two terrified officers reluctantly do as they are told, and undress. A minute later, they are both completely naked, standing in the palm off her huge fleshy hand, attempting to hide their tiny privates from her huge hungry eyes. She smiles at them both thinking, \u201cwhat excellent specimens she has.\u201d She takes her huge pinky, and gently flicks their tiny clothes from her hand leaving the tiny couple with nothing to wear. She thought about swallowing them both, but she remembers she has a business to run, and these two will do nicely. She takes out a glass jar she has with her from her book bag, and opens it up. Chloe gently places them both inside, and secures the lid. Happy with her recent hunt, she knows it must continue. One tiny couple will not be enough for her giant customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chloe continues her hunt on the outer sections of Gulliverian territory, careful not to repeat her stupid stunt with the police. She carefully and quietly moves around the area. \u201cThat was stupid,\u201d she thought,\u201d she could have been in deep trouble if those cops got a radio message off to their military. Their police force might be a joke, but their military is deadly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chloe quietly walks around and sees a few tempting targets. The first is a two-story dollhouse looking structure, and there is a White family inside, two parents, a hot 39-year-old mother, and a handsome 40-year-old father, along with their good-looking children, both genders, all of whom are 18 and over. The other targets are two large, two story dwellings, about a Gulliverian half of a mile away. Those two structures are a college fraternity, and sorority. Those two houses have a reputation of having the best-looking college age girls and boys on this island. Each house contains around seventy to a hundred hot looking, horny college age students. Even better, they are both going through hell week, and they are full of dozens of tiny, hot looking pledges, mostly young women wanting to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chloe decides to go where first. She can always get the others later. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Noah entered his apartment after his thirty minute run. He didn\u2019t bother with a shirt as the weather was warm and sunny. His skin was covered in a sheer layer of sweat. He stripped himself of his shorts and shoes and went straight for the shower. His run times have been improving and it showed in his physique. He used a razor blade to shave off the hairs from his abdomen and crotch. He had to make sure he looked good due to his particular career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up and throwing on a pair of shorts, he went for his laptop and checked to see if he had any jobs available. He had an email from a Lilliputian named Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that Dave was married to Gulliverian named Becky. Dave and Becky had a typical inter-size difference marriage. Not totally uncommon in the grand scheme of things. Their marriage, according to Dave\u2019s email, had grown stale. He was afraid he couldn\u2019t satisfy his woman in bed anymore and turned to Noah for his assistance. Dave wanted to fulfill his cuckold fantasy and satisfy his woman in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah agreed to the job. It\u2019s not the weirdest thing he\u2019s ever done. There wasn\u2019t much he\u2019d be able to do with a one-inch woman, but he had some ideas. And humiliating a speck-sized Lilliputian would be a walk in the park for him. Hell, he can even humiliate fellow Brobdingnagians with what he was packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave didn\u2019t tell Becky where they were going. He just told her to head to the train station and board a train for Brobdingnag. Becky was incredibly attractive woman in her mid-thirties. She went with her usual getup of black yoga pants and a sweater. She let her one inch husband ride in her panties as she walked to the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on honey, tell me where we\u2019re going,\u201d Becky said over the headset as she boarded the bullet train heading for Brobdingnag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d He nestled against his wife\u2019s pubic hairs. This was certainly not the first time Becky travelled in public with her husband against her crotch. As a matter of fact, they\u2019ve done it so many times before, it almost felt routine and normal. Still, for Dave, it was heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Brobdingnag or even seen a Brobby before.\u201d The train was travelling near the speed of sound but the passengers hardly noticed inside the comfortable train cars. \u201cAre we meeting a Brobby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah uncorked his favorite brand of wine and poured himself a drink. He was in a great mood and ready for some dirty action. He gulped half his drink and then poured his glass to the brim before heading over for the living room. He sat back in his couch and caught up with his favorite TV shows as he waited for his clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky exited the train when they arrived in the Brobdingnag train station. It was at this point that Dave gave her the address to Noah\u2019s house. Becky walked over to the personalized train transports, known as the tubes, and requested a trip to Noah\u2019s house. The tubes were actually just that, tubes. There was an elaborate network of tubes that linked up nearly every home in Brobdingnag. It was the preferred method of transportation for the smaller races when they entered the huge land of Brobdingnag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky entered the personalized train car which was empty aside from her and Dave who was still in her panties. Becky was growing excited about the trip. She didn\u2019t know what Dave had in store, but she could already tell it was special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who\u2019s Noah,\u201d she failed to hide the excitement in her voice as she asked her one inch husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a friend.\u201d Dave said unconvincingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train started to move and then catapulted to bullet speed as it traversed the complex network of tubes. \u201cWhat are we going to do when we get there?\u201d Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll see.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she whined, \u201cjust tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave slid himself lower until he was in front of his wife\u2019s labia. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to hang out.\u201d He poked around until he was able to stick an arm between her lips. \u201cSee where the night takes us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky breathed a little harder as she felt her husband touch her in just the right spots. \u201cIs he good looking?\u201d She nearly moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll like him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of what Noah looked like rushed in her head. She loved her husband, but she also loved size differences the most\u2014one of the reasons she married Dave in the first place. But the novelty of being married to a one inch man had worn off. She now wanted to see 430 foot giant compared to her one inch husband. A visible patch of wetness appeared in front of her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah finished his first glass of wine when he heard a ding, signifying the arrival of a transport at his tube receptacle. He got up from his comfy couch and walked over to the kitchen counter just in time to see the entrance of the tube open up. An attractive Gulliverian with black hair walked out onto the kitchen counter with awe in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Becky,\u201d Noah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky swallowed as she looked up at the Adonis in front of her. He was shirtless and only wore black gym shorts. His abs was defined and filled her view as he walked right up to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where\u2019s your husband.\u201d His voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky stuck a shaky hand into her panties and pulled out Dave, who was wet with his wife\u2019s excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah grabbed a headset from the counter and placed it into his ear. \u201cIs that you Dave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d Dave started to quake in fear as he looked in the horizon and saw the upper three miles of Noah, standing there, looking down at him. Doubts and regret started to run through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you want to do this Dave?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cI have to ask before we get started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looked down confusingly at her one inch husband, trembling in the middle of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Dave said, even though he didn\u2019t sound like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to hear.\u201d Noah hooked both thumbs under his waistband and pulled down his shorts towards his bare feet. When he stood back up, his 7 inch flaccid cock was about eye level with Becky. To her, the monstrous male organ appeared to be 42 feet long. To the speck sized Dave, it was more like 3,024 feet long. Noah\u2019s flaccid cock rivaled the heights of some prominent Lilliputian skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Becky could react, Noah grabbed her and headed for his bedroom. He propped up some pillows against the headboard and sat back against them. He stretched his legs out and sprawled out, feeling his silky smooth sheets under his bare skin. Noah then lowered Becky down to the base of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo Becky, why don\u2019t you set your little guy down there.\u201d Noah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky obeyed and dropped her husband at the base of Noah\u2019s cock. Noah couldn\u2019t see Dave with his naked eye, but he saw the movements from Becky that suggested she dropped her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Becky still pinched between his fingers, Noah lifted her up to his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s a pretty thing like you doing with a Lilliputian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d Becky was enthralled with Noah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to take your clothes off for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky nodded and started stripping. Noah helped and shifted his fingers around until Becky was completely nude. He then lowered her legs into his mouth and started sucking her little legs. It was amazing for Becky. She had always had the power in her relationship with Dave, but being completely at the hands of someone so much bigger and powerful was exciting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah sucked on the one inch woman like candy and used the tip of his tongue to taste her pussy. He then let go of Becky and closed his mouth. Noah then placed both hands behind his head and started tasting and playing with the tiny woman in his mouth. Becky screamed for help which he heard in the headset. Dave heard it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t kill her!\u201d Dave shouted from the base of Noah\u2019s growing cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah moaned as he listened to the both of them crying and begging for him to stop. He eventually reached in his mouth and pulled out the one inch woman by the ankle. \u201cI could have eaten you just then.\u201d He said with drunken eyes to Becky. He then dropped Becky unceremoniously on his abs before resting his head on his pillows. \u201cMake me hard or I\u2019ll really swallow you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was breathing hard. She felt exhilarated and so alive. She shivered feeling a little bit cold because she was wet with Noah\u2019s spit. No matter, she rose to her feet and ran down towards Noah\u2019s cock. Her bare feet narrowly crushed her husband as she almost forgot he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Becky, watch it!\u201d Dave screamed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky gripped and hugged Noah\u2019s cock as if it were a sequoia tree. She placed her whole body weight against Noah\u2019s growing tree and even licked his soft skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecky?\u201d Dave didn\u2019t expect his wife to jump on Noah so fast. He expected it would take some convincing to get along with Noah, but it didn\u2019t take any convincing at all. \u201cDon\u2019t forget about me.\u201d Dave whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yea,\u201d Becky reached down at her feet and picked up her husband. She then held him up to Noah\u2019s cock and giggled as she realized that the smallest vein running along Noah\u2019s cock was bigger than a freeway to Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky licked her lips as she decided what to do next\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In her left hand was David being rubbed against one of the veins on Noah\u2019s cock. \u201cI should say my girl now actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky hung upside over Noah\u2019s mouth once again. She gripped David tightly and held him up to her large breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah, you two are fucking pathetic.\u201d Noah\u2019s alcoholic breath filled the tiny couple\u2019s noses. \u201cWhy do I even bother picking up jobs from dust like you Dave? Oh well, if you two can make me cum without me touching myself, then I let you two live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLive, wait\u2014\u201c Dave\u2019s worried voice came over Noah\u2019s headset. \u201cWhat do you mean live? I didn\u2019t agree to any\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the fuck up, dirt.\u201d Noah\u2019s thunderous voice made the tiny couple jump.

If you want to live, you\u2019ll make me cum.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah let go of Becky on his balls and went back to relaxing. He could feel the feeble one inch woman trying to get her balance on his testicles. Becky and Dave changed the frequency on their headsets to something private that Noah wouldn\u2019t be able to listen in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019s serious?\u201d Becky asked her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fucking hope he\u2019s not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you even meet this guy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInternet.\u201d Dave admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, he\u2019s so big.\u201d Becky was still aroused as she witnessed the enormous tower of meat in front of her. She could smell Noah\u2019s masculine musk all around her. Noah\u2019s dick was resting on top of his pelvis, extending past his belly button. From his balls, Becky was able to climb on top of his slowly hardening cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Dave asked his wife sternly. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here. I don\u2019t trust this guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh lighten up Dave,\u201d Becky said as she grinded her crotch against Noah\u2019s pulsating cock. \u201cYou set this up for whatever reason, so you might as well start enjoying yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sorry if I can\u2019t enjoy myself after a giant threatens my fucking life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky rolled her eyes and slid up to Noah\u2019s circumcised head. She rubbed her free hand all over the tip of Noah\u2019s penis. She lowered her lips and ran her tongue the superheated organ. She felt her whole body bob up and down as Noah\u2019s erection grew harder and bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey little one,\u201d Noah said in a husky voice. \u201cShow that little shit you call a husband what a real cock looks like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah felt a tiny pin prick where Becky was rubbing her husband against him. Noah desperately wanted to grab hold of his member and start masturbating but he fought the urge and let Becky do her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was screaming to his wife to stop, but she didn\u2019t listen. His entire body was rubbed hard against the soft purple surface. Seeing that Becky wasn\u2019t going to listen, he flipped the frequency on his headset back to the general one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoah, stop this.\u201d His voice was muffled as Becky pressed him harder against the purple head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough shit dude.\u201d Noah said looking down at his full erection. He got more aroused knowing that a tiny speck of a human was being forcibly rubbed against his cock. Becky straddled Noah\u2019s tip and then inserted her husband inside of her as she rode Noah like horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah was on the verge of cumming. Precum seeped from his slit and adhered to Becky\u2019s calves and feet. Dave was choking on his wife\u2019s pussy juice and felt a few ribs cracking as Becky bucked her hips uncontrollably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut him in me.\u201d Noah commanded Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky simply nodded and pulled Dave\u2019s broken body from her pussy. She leaned over to Noah\u2019s piss slit and delicately shoved Dave into Noah\u2019s urethra. She mouthed \u2018I love you\u2019 as she looked at Dave\u2019s frightened face as she let go of the piss slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah listened to Dave choking in his precum. He could also hear him struggling inside to stay alive inside his cock. It was enough for Noah. The giant came to a powerful orgasm, his initial load liquefied Dave\u2019s body as jets of cum came shooting out and landing all over his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that was good.\u201d More and more cum shot out enough to fill a large Lilliputian lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god what did I do?\u201d Becky shouted from atop Noah\u2019s still hard cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you all crying about, it\u2019s what he wanted.\u201d Noah closed his eyes and basked in his afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to die! He wanted to go home. Oh my god, you\u2019re a murderer! I\u2019m going to call the police. I\u2019m goin\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah had enough of the Gulliverian broad. He plucked her from his cock and dropped her in his mouth. He swallowed her down with one gulp. More cum seeped out as he felt her struggling body travel down his esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it was a job well done. He wanted to find a new job like the last one\u2014something that really showed off his size and power.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Noah sat cross-legged with his laptop on his knees, reading through his emails. There were several job offers and it always pleased him that his services were so much in demand. He was halfway through his coffee when he saw an offer from a Lilliputian woman. He had done similar jobs once or twice, but it was the amount that she was offering that made him pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit, that was an impressive sum. Noah briefly wondered how the hell the Lilliputian broad had so much money; then he realized that he didn\u2019t really care. He\u2019d take the job, partly because he wanted the money, mostly because it sounded like a chance to have some more wicked fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry to relax, Rachel,\u201d Lauren said as she handed her a margarita. \u201cI mean, this is your bachelorette party, right? The last hurrah before you get married next week. You should try to enjoy yourself. Seriously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked up at her friend who, as usual, looked glamorous in her coral sundress and gold bangles. Lauren was the sort of Lilliputian woman who could have gotten any man that she wanted. Even a Brobdingnagian wasn\u2019t out of the question. With her perfectly-styled auburn hair and aristocratic features, she could have been an actress or a model. And she was incredibly wealthy to boot, her family the owners of a large biotech company. How she and Rachel had ever become friends remained a mystery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow they stayed friends was an even bigger enigma. Lauren could be an extremely generous person when she wanted to be. She was the one hosting Rachel\u2019s bachelorette party on her private island; she had even hired a band and the alcohol bill was probably as much as the GDP of several small countries. But Lauren could be pushy as well, and the way that she gazed down at Rachel told her that she had better relax or else. So Rachel sat in her beach chair and sipped the margarita, trying to enjoy herself. The island was certainly nice, one of those tropical paradises with sugar-white sand and palm trees. There had to be fifty women there, the majority of them Lauren\u2019s friends. Rachel noticed that Lauren hadn\u2019t invited many of her friends, but she didn\u2019t want to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to know the best part?\u201d Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hired some special entertainment,\u201d her friend told her with a lewd wink. Rachel nodded in understanding, although she nearly spat out her drink when Lauren continued: \u201cHe\u2019s a Brobdingnagian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLauren, why the hell would you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s hot. And I know how you like big men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot six miles big!\u201d Rachel was about to protest more, but she could see something over the horizon, blotting out the setting sun. It looked like a landmass had been transported into the ocean. Worse, it was striding toward them. She had no doubt that this was the Brobdingnagian that Lauren had just mentioned. Her friend was right; he was really handsome. He was far enough away that she could still see him all at once, dressed in shorts and a tight t-shirt that accentuated his muscular body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant\u2019s mammoth legs churned up the water as he marched purposely toward them. Already, the waves were growing larger as a result of the Brobdingnagian\u2019s movements, crashing loudly into the shore. The women closest to the water backed away from the huge waves, all the while watching the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he stopped before he came too close to the island. Lauren put down her drink and slipped on a headset, a much smaller version of the one that the Brobdingnagian was wearing. He also had on some sort of wrap-around optic device over his right eye, which probably allowed him to see them. Otherwise, they were little more than near-invisible specks to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren dropped a headset into Rachel\u2019s lap as well. As she was fumbling to put it on, her friend addressed the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Noah. Looking good, big guy,\u201d she said with her \u201cI\u2019m-going-charm-everyone\u201d smile. The giant glanced down toward the island, squinted through the eye-piece and returned the grin. He said something back and it took the headset a second to translate the deep rumbles from his tremendous vocal cords, which had to be a few hundred feet in length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I would have been here sooner, but I ran into a Lilliputian cruise ship. Or it ran into me, if you want to be precise.\u201d The smile never left his face as he said this and Rachel hoped that he was kidding. Or maybe not. She tried to imagine what it would be like to be on a cruise ship when a Brobdingnagian loomed over it and she felt a chill between her shoulder blades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo! Which one of you is the bachelorette?\u201d Noah asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is,\u201d Lauren replied, grabbing Rachel by the arm and yanking her from the beach chair. The margarita fell from her hand but she hardly noticed. The giant\u2019s gaze was now on her and her alone. It was thrilling and terrifying, all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d When he spoke again, she nearly jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, he was so handsome. Not that her fianc\u00e9 Jonathan wasn\u2019t attractive, but this Brobdingnagian had the face of Adonis. Rachel felt her cheeks grow red-hot and she mumbled, \u201cR-Rachel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Rachel. This show\u2019s for you,\u201d the giant announced. There was something about the way that he said it that caused her heart to speed up. When he peeled off his shirt, revealing the muscular curves of his torso, all of the other Lilliputian women began to laugh and cheer. His hands slipped down to his shorts and he pushed them off with a slow, sensual grace. He was wearing some sort of black underwear underneath, the kind that left little to the imagination. Whistling, Lauren reached down and pulled the top of her own dress down, revealing her perfect suntanned breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant seemed to soak-up the adoration from the tiny women, flexing and posing for them. Noah\u2019s biceps alone looked like gargantuan hills and as Rachel admired them, she pictured Jonathan in comparison. He\u2019d be nothing more than a piece of lint compared to the Brobdingnagian, a microbe stranded on the powerful arm of a deity. Despite herself, she could feel the warm wetness spread between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Noah took an awe-inspiring step forward and then bent down. He reached out, casting the entire island in darkness. All that Rachel could do was look on in wonder as he placed a single fingertip at the edge of the beach. At his mind-boggling size, Noah\u2019s finger looked more like a pinkish-brown skyscraper. Each of the finger ridges were higher than she was tall, rising up like colossal walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHop on,\u201d he said to her and she had to crane her head all the way back to see his face. Even then, it was partially obscured by the thin wisps of clouds. As much as she wanted to, she couldn\u2019t get her legs to cooperate. She stood there, paralyzed, until Lauren shoved her forward. Everyone was silent as she cautiously approached the outstretched finger and then began to climb it. Never had she been so close to a Brobdingnagian and she felt utterly overwhelmed as she clambered up onto the tip of his finger. As soon as she was standing on it, Noah stood up. The island, in fact, the entire world, seemed to fall away and she found herself held several miles over the turquoise ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah lifted her up to one eye for inspection, the one wearing the magnification device. Behind the tinted glass, she could see the vast pupil of his eye constrict as it focused on her. Rachel managed a weak smile as she trembled before him. Then he began to lower her back down, past his chiseled abs, toward the bulge in his black underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel came face-to-face with perhaps one of the most erotic sights in her life. Behind the dense fabric, the threads several times thicker than bridge cables, she could see the the cylindrical column of his cock, larger than an aircraft carrier. His balls alone could have crushed several Lilliputian neighborhoods at once. The giant held her close enough that she could feel his body heat, warming the already sultry tropical air. Perhaps it was because of the incredible amounts of pheromones that he was releasing, or perhaps it was just being in the presence of something so irresistibly powerful, but Rachel\u2019s entire body tingled with desire. She pressed herself shamelessly against him, grinding her breasts on the fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah\u2019s laugh reverberated throughout her from head to toe. He brought her back up to his eye-level again. The smile that she saw was still charming, but she saw that it had taken on a malicious quality as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI normally don\u2019t offer this, but would you like a special show?\u201d The giant inquired casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nervously touched her headset, fidgeting with it. \u201cWhat kind of special show?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d Noah said and then raised one foot up, thousands of gallons of ocean water rushing off of it. Many of the party goers were drenched as he lifted it over them and then carefully stepped down on Lauren\u2019s expensive beach house. Rachel wasn\u2019t sure if there was anyone inside; if so, they simply disappeared beneath the ball of the Brobdingnagian\u2019s titanic foot, along with most of the surrounding area. From atop Noah\u2019s finger, she saw the visible shockwave that blew the Lilliputian women over like dandelion seeds in a strong wind.  It took a moment for them to pull themselves up, and not surprisingly, her friend was furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was my beach house, you big dick!\u201d Lauren screeched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah gave her a horrible smile. \u201cYou wanna see a big dick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren didn\u2019t answer; her rage had quickly turned into terror. For some reason, the knowledge that her bossy friend had been so easily cowed made Rachel smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d the giant said to her. \u201cYou interested?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up at the immense Brobdingnagian, whose inconceivable size made it impossible to see more than a fraction of his body at a time, Rachel felt torn. She had never been so aroused in her life; had she touched herself at that moment, she would have orgasmed, probably several times. After what Noah had just done to the beach house, Rachel had little doubt that the \u201cspecial show\u201d was going to be horrific to behold. But she couldn\u2019t help herself, really. Morbid curiosity was driving her at that point. That, and a cruel part of her wanted to see Lauren suffer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She was shocked when she heard herself utter the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d Noah said, clearly delighted. He lifted his foot up from the island and swung it back into the water. The enormous crater that he left behind was as clearly defined as the footprints that she had made in the soft beach sand earlier. Except that this one was measured in thousands of feet instead of inches. Whatever remained of Lauren\u2019s house was embedded deep within it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend\u2019s enraged voice came over the headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some very powerful friends and if you don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019m going to have the entire Lilliputian navy blow up your giant ass,\u201d Lauren threatened. There was still a quaver in her voice, betraying her fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. I\u2019m terrified, believe me,\u201d the giant responded with a cocky grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou godd-,\u201d Lauren started before Noah talked over her. With the thunderous volume of his voice, it was easy to do.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you saying about big dicks?\u201d He asked. To Rachel\u2019s awe, his cock slowly stiffened and stirred within his underwear. At his size, it looked like some sort of gigantic monster moving ponderously beneath the fabric. Without waiting for an answer from Lauren, he pulled down his underwear with one hand, allowing it to simply fall into the water with the rest of his clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stared at his hardening erection. Once, back when she was still single, she had seen a Gulliverian man\u2019s penis. She had been at a bar that catered to multi-size clientele and she had caught the eye of a good-looking Gulliverian. After he had brought her back to his apartment, things had become somewhat passionate (\u201csomewhat\u201d being the key word; they were both more than slightly intoxicated and it was mostly clumsy groping). Rachel had convinced him to show her his cock and so he had, freeing something that was as large as a city bus from his pants. She had been impressed then, but now, seeing Noah\u2019s manhood throbbing before her, she realized that she hadn\u2019t seen anything yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other women saw his tremendous cock as well, but this time, there was no cheering. By that point, they were too terrified of the behemoth who watched them with amused eyes. Even Lauren had ceased her threats as she gawked up at the naked god standing arrogantly over her island. Still holding Rachel on his fingertip, he lowered himself to his knees, his movements causing violent waves. One or two of the partygoers were swept away by the water, screaming as they were dragged out to sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah\u2019s knees dug deep into the island, displacing countless tons of sand and causing minor earthquakes. He placed his finger onto his right thigh and Rachel crawled off, onto the massive musculature of his leg. Before her was the pillar of his cock, the flesh swollen and the highway-like veins pulsating with the beating of his heart. High up, she saw the flash of the optic device as Noah tilted his head. Evidently, the giant was looking at her and so she acted on impulse, slipping down the spaghetti straps of her dress. Once she had wiggled out of her dress, the remainder of her clothes came off as well, ending with her panties. She stood nude before the Brobdingnagian, her breasts and pussy aching fiercely. Had it even been possible, she would have fucked him then and there, but their vast size difference made it impossible. So all she could do was watch him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was right\u2026the show really was special. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing his index and middle fingers down on the base of his cock, Noah brought his monstrous member down onto the beach far below. It looked like a colossal zeppelin taking a nosedive and many of the Lilliputian women tried to flee as it crashed down upon them. Those who can\u2019t get away in time were flattened deep into the ground, their bodies unfelt by the giant. Lauren\u2019s voice came over the headset again. She was practically hyperventilating as she tried to bargain with him: \u201cI\u2019ll pay you anything that you want. In fact, I\u2019ll give you a million bucks if you go away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah seemed to consider this, rubbing at his square jaw with his free hand. His other hand still held down his titanic cock, pressing the mushroom head against the ground. A great deal of precum was trickling down from its dark slit in an obscene waterfall, pooling on the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! A million dollars in your bank account if you go away,\u201d Lauren pled. Rachel knew that she wasn\u2019t lying. Her friend probably had her smartphone in her hand as she spoke, ready and willing to part with an impressively large sum of money to make her very big problem \u201cgo away.\u201d The Brobdingnagian finally shrugged his broad shoulders, a gesture that looked mind-blowing when performed on such a gigantic scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Transfer a million dollars into my account and I\u2019ll go away,\u201d he told her. A strange disappointment settled over Rachel as her friend quickly did as she was told. Although she hated to admit it, she wanted to see what else Noah had planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere. The transfer\u2019s going through. Now leave,\u201d Lauren ordered. But Noah didn\u2019t move at all; he remained still, his erection proof that he was still very much aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you waiting for?\u201d Her friend demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll leave\u2026eventually. Once I\u2019m finished here,\u201d Noah replied. He didn\u2019t give her a chance to protest further. With a slight nudge of his hips, he created a gaping canyon in the sand, gouging the ground with his penis. Palm trees and screaming women fell indiscriminately before it as the gargantuan piston of flesh steamrolled over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone who wants to live should climb on,\u201d the giant informed the survivors, motioning toward his murderous cock. The women didn\u2019t have headsets like Lauren and Rachel and they probably couldn\u2019t comprehend his deafening words. But they definitely understood when he pointed. From atop the giant\u2019s thigh, Rachel could see tiny dots obeying, climbing up onto Noah\u2019s erection. Unfortunately for them, he didn\u2019t give the women much time and he unexpectedly released his fingers from the base of his cock, the organ springing back up. Several climbers lost their hold and splattered somewhere on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah\u2019s eyes narrowed as he studied those who were trapped on his cock. Rachel wished that she could see them better; from her position, the other Lilliputians resembled nothing more than multicolored specks against the pink satiny skin of the giant\u2019s penis. When the Brobdingnagian spoke, his expression was one of open contempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I can\u2019t even feel you pathetic microbes,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou know what I said about letting you live? I think I\u2019m going to crush you anyway.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel held her breath as his hand descended toward his cock. A few more of the Lilliputians tumbled off to their deaths; the others clung on as Noah\u2019s hand wrapped around them, his fingers curling like articulated skyscrapers. As the giant smashed the women into paste between his hand and member, Rachel\u2019s own fingers found their way between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eagerly caressed her clitoris in time to Noah stroking his cock; then, an ear-splitting shriek in her ear made her jump. It was Lauren, who was still on the island with a half-dozen others. The scream was one of rage and terror and hopelessness. Her friend continued that godawful wailing until Noah moaned in lust, his stroking speeding up. Rachel saw where his penis was aimed: directly at the island. And when he came, his first shot came crashing down with the power of an atomic bomb, tearing up the landscape. The subsequent blasts began to flood the island, turning it into a milky white lake. Rachel heard Lauren again, but she wasn\u2019t shrieking this time. The noise that she made was terrible, the sound of someone whose lungs were slowly filling up with fluid\u2026semen, to be precise. With a cold deliberation, Rachel turned off the private channel to her friend on her headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only noise now was that of the Brobdingnagian\u2019s heavy breathing as he enjoyed the post-orgasm endorphins flowing through his system. The island had been reduced to a wasteland of viscous liquid, the salt tang of the ocean replaced by the chlorine-like odor of cum. Lauren and all of those other women were dead, their lives sacrificed for a moment of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, this knowledge pleased Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was one hell of a bachelorette party, huh?\u201d The giant finally said after what seemed like an eternity. She looked up, unable to see much. Night had finally arrived and Noah was nothing more than a mountainous outline against the sky. Rachel shivered, painfully aware of her smallness. The Brobdingnagian was quiet for a minute or two longer. Then he spoke to her in his godlike voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat next? The way that I see it, your friend paid for several hours of my time. So what do you want to do now? There\u2019s another island nearby that I\u2019d love to terrorize\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

He looked down at Rachel as if she was a child. \u201cDo I have to spell it out for you?\u201d He moved his eyes, Rachel following his gaze, down towards his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beach house, which was more like a mansion, but in Rachel\u2019s mind it was considered more like a humble home, was about the size of a small pimple. The home stretched from the white sands and extended a little ways in the loosely dense tropical jungle. Noah\u2019s foot, being as titanic as it was, went from shore well into the jungle. Stepping on the home was like the equivalent of a tactical airstrike taking out a shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t think I want the special show,\u201d Rachel forced a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d Noah\u2019s deep voice invaded her ears, as well as the fifty party goers still on the beach. \u201cYou know you want to see me wicked.\u201d Noah lifted and moved his foot over the women on the beach. They began to scream and run as his foot hovered above them like an alien mother ship taking over their planet. At over a mile across, trying to outrun his foot would take the fastest Lilly woman about 8 minutes of fast running to clear. Despite this, they ran and screamed. \u201cDo you hear them? Give me the word and I\u2019ll crush them all at once. Then you won\u2019t hear them screaming anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel felt like she was in a trance as she listened to Noah\u2019s voice overpower the screams of the women below. Her heart fluttered and was beating as hard as Lauren\u2019s heart as she ran across her private beach. Regrets flooded Lauren\u2019s mind as she felt incredible stupidity for inviting a Brobby to her island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have the power now, Rachel.\u201d He held Rachel\u2019s full attention. \u201cI\u2019m just a conduit for your deepest, darkest desires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel slowly closed her eyes and isolated the screams of her friends that she heard over the headset. She could hear Lauren\u2019s <i>real</i> voice going hoarse from all the pleas and begging she was doing. Lauren offered Noah more money, property, and land as she ran and tripped on the sandy beach. Rachel laughed at how pathetic her rich and powerful friend sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the power?\u201d Rachel\u2019s voice didn\u2019t sound as meek as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have the power,\u201d Noah confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t step on them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge grin formed on Noah as he could hear a pinch of confidence from the little speck. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah removed his foot and dropped to his knees; half in the ocean and half on the strip of beach. Between his legs, occupying a small square millimeter, were the 50 women including Lauren panting in relief as the orange sunlight touch her skin instead of the darkness of Noah\u2019s soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so scared little women,\u201d Noah enthused. \u201cThis is all part of the show. Don\u2019t you feel fucking alive right now? Don\u2019t you feel so pathetically small under me?\u201d As Noah spoke, the bulge behind his black undies expanded. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel blessed, that a god has spared you? That deemed you worthy to live another day. Well, don\u2019t thank me so fast, this little bachelorette decided to spare you. So you should thank her and pray to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah lowered his finger to the beach in front of the exhausted women and ever-so-lightly tipped it forward so that Rachel gracefully fell to the sandy beach. She received confused looks from her friends. After all, they were unsure whether to thank her for saving their lives, or pissed at her for taking so damn long to come up a decision that would save their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said pray to her.\u201d Noah didn\u2019t exactly yell, but his voice was like thunder times a hundred. A literal god giving the Lilliputian women a command from the heavens. A god who could turn wrathful on a dime. \u201cI see you clear as day,\u201d (magnified thanks to his eyepiece) \u201cand if you don\u2019t start kneeling to Rachel and praying to her\u2014well, you don\u2019t want to find out what I\u2019ll do, let\u2019s say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitation overcame the women. Most looked at Lauren for guidance, though she was unwilling to be brought down to dirt, she complied in fear of the six mile giant. Rachel showed no expression as she looked down at her bare feet, sinking into the powdery sand slightly. About a foot away was her friend Shannon, already on her knees with her hands in front of her chest, palms together. Next to her was Lauren, begrudgingly murmuring something to herself as she looked at Rachel as if it was her fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly hell, am I having fun or what?\u201d Noah said with smiles and gusto. \u201cAren\u2019t you girls having fun? How\u2019s our benevolent bachelorette doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was unsure how to answer. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren shut her headset off and in a loud hush said, \u201ctell him to stop.\u201d Rachel turned her head from the sky to look at Lauren. \u201cTell him to stop this.\u201d She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked towards the ground, as if she was ashamed for something. After all, she had her closest friends on their knees, <i>praying</i> to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, Noah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my little master.\u201d He lowered his chiseled face closer to the beach. \u201cWhat would like me to do next? It\u2019s your day after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel felt warmth coming off Noah, not just because of his physical body heat, but the way he smiled and talked to her that made her feel so at ease, unlike what her friends were feeling. The way he bent down and listened to her, Rachel almost felt like she had a leash on him. Lauren kept murmuring for her to make Noah stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that special show\u2026?\u201d Rachel cocked her head to side and looked up at him with a sultry half-smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah\u2019s cock pulsated as this shy Lilliputian was fighting to break through her shell. He smiled malevolently as he said, \u201cdo you want to see the special show after all?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Noah finished his jog the next day on a high note. He took pleasure in knowing that Becky's little body was turning in too much needed protein for his bulky leg muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went through his usual routine of taking a shower and checking for new job offers. He was used to wide range of jobs and clientele; he hardly ever got a request that made him hesitate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised a brow when he saw an email from a governor over at Lilliput. \"What would a dust speck, who governs over more specks, want to do with a Brobdingnagian gigolo?\" Noah asked to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah read the encrypted email carefully and liked what he saw. He replied to the job offer by the governor and waited for his reply. He had an election under the weight and warmth of his laptop. Another encrypted email was received by the governor. Noah read over the email and smiled wide. It was the best job offer he'd ever received. He would have done it for free; shoot he would pay to do the job the governor offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah went to the docks near his town and inquired about a boat that the Lilliputian governor had reserved for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later and he was out in the blue ocean, following the GPS coordinates that were prerecorded. Noah stripped down to his swimming trunks and leaned back in the Captain's chair as the boat chugged along the vast blue sea. He knew he was getting close when the choppy waters turned calm and nonexistent. The ocean almost seemed to have turned into glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt! You are entering Lilliputian waters.\" Noah\u2019s boat radio crackled with the voice of an authoritative speck. \"This is the Lilliputian Coast Guard; turn your vessel around immediately.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah grabbed the transmitter and cleared his throat before speaking. \"This is the PG-niner-one, I have authority to be here. Check your EAL.\" Noah cut the throttle to the boat and waited patiently for the Lilliputian to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PG91, this is Coast Guard 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Coast Guard 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have you on the access list, but we need to confirm. Brobdingnagians are not allowed on Lilliput Island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy that,\" Noah said. \"I'm going to turn this tub around and head back. Where are you guys so where I should avoid piloting this thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are at your three o'clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you boys have a nice day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah looked out at the still blue waters and didn't see any sign of the Coast Guard boat. Not that he would at six miles in height. In the horizon he could see the Lilliputian coast. Noah hit the anchor release button and then proceeded to jump overboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandemonium struck the 150 foot long Coast Guard boat. The crew of fifteen double timed and tried to speed away from the quickly approaching giant. The ship moved along the sea at full throttle but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough speed to avoid a six mile mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant swung his miles long arms in and out of the water as he barreled down on the doomed vessel. The swells in the ocean gave rise to the ship. Three men fell overboard. They were in the shadow of the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah opened his mouth to breathe in. The ship, including the three overboard, we're swallowed unknowingly by the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe packed Lilliputian beach saw Noah's boat since it arrived, but it seemed so far away that it wasn\u2019t much for concern. But now a Brobby had jumped off and was swimming right at them. What seemed like a great distance was now being covered in mere seconds by the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beach goers rushed for their cars and gridlocked the roads immediately. Others headed for the many hotels lined up against the coastline. Though hundreds have already made it for the hotels and their cars, there were still thousands upon thousands on the beach. They scurried and ran like ants, desperately trying to make it further inland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the panic and chaos ensued, the sky turned dark as if thunder clouds were rolling in. Huge droplets of water started to rain down on the Lilliputians as they tried to run from the giant, if only they looked up, then they would have known how incredibly futile their efforts were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree highways, three dozen roads, 10 hotels, 50 tiny houses, 5,000 cars, and 17,000 Lilliputians met their fate as Noah took one step. His feet plowed deep into the soft ground. No structure even resisted or pushed up on the soles of Noah\u2019s feet as it dropped. Many didn\u2019t even know they were crushed before darkness consumed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah breathed in the fresh Lilliputian air as he stepped out of the ocean. He unknowingly stepped on two towns under his feet without realizing it. He ran his fingers through his hair, trying to wring out more ocean water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape looked just like a satellite photo. Even at six miles tall, he could still make out the features of the land and even see some tall skyscrapers a few footsteps away. His cock started to stir underneath his wet swimming trunks. He felt pretty damn powerful just standing there watching the scenery. He wondered about the ancient tale of <i>Gulliver\u2019s Travels</i> and how he must have felt when he landed on Lilliput Island. Except Gulliver would have been one inch compared Noah. He looked down at his feet at that thought to try to picture Gulliver, but instead saw his foot in the middle of what looked like several coastal communities. Webs of roads and highways disappeared as it looked like it ran straight into the side of his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops.\u201d Noah said unconvincingly as he lifted his foot and brought it down on another untouched part of the land. He felt the soft ground yield against his foot, unaware of the tens of thousands of people he was crushing with every step. \u201cSorry, you guys aren\u2019t apart of the job. Oh well, collateral damage was to be expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah thought back to the instructions on the email. It gave him specific directions on where to go once he made it to land. \u201cOkay, go straight past two big cities, and then go 90 degrees to the right. There\u2019s a city in the valley and that\u2019s my target. Don\u2019t harm any cities except the target.\u201d He repeated in his head over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah took one step forward and a village of five thousand Lilliputians disappeared under his heel. He swung his other foot which landed in a dense forest where he crushed wildlife and a few campers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like flying in a plane for Noah. He admired the beauty of the island as he casually strolled forward. He thought what it must be like for the little Lilliputians to be visited by a Brobby. Probably not the first time it\u2019s happen for them, but it was a first for Noah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Noah walked\u2014devastating the serene land underfoot\u2014he could see two distinct cities about three feet to his left. The cities were constructed in a typical fashion where the downtown districts were concentrated in the center and suburbs peppered the outwards. These suburbs were crushed into nothingness by the uncaring giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah counted the two cities and took a right. A mountain range lay before him. He stepped over the mountain range with hardly any effort. Before him was a sprawling metropolis complete with 50 high rise skyscrapers and row after row of smaller buildings. He became incredibly excited as he saw his job in front of him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Lilliputians felt Noah's arrival before they saw him. The bustling city nestled within a mountainous valley never really experienced any type of catastrophe in its history. Even the weather was mild as the mountains shielded bad storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes. But the protective mountains failed to even slow down the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed wrong from the get go. A Brobby visiting Lilliput Island only spelled disaster. The Lilliputians located in the outer belt of suburbs, ran for their basements or sought shelter under their beds. It didn't make a difference where they hid; Noah's feet flattened and compressed suburbia 300 feet into the ground, compacting them and their homes into the thickness of a paperback book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah didn't care about the thousands of Lilliputian homes that he so casually stepped on. His eyes were on the prize; a mecca of tall buildings, highways that bridged over other highways, little airport with planes and helicopters taking off, and rows upon rows of buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of it had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was going to have fun in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, he had to strip. Noah pulled the cord around his waist letting his wet swim trunks fall to his feet. A shockwave of dust and debris blew out from his fallen shorts causing a few more deaths. His erection bobbed up and down, now free from the constrains of his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah scratched his balls before setting off to work. First order of business: isolation. He took three steps into the city until he was upon the airport. The entire airport, runway included, was crushed easily under his big toe. He then swatted the airspace above the airport to take care of any flying nuisance. He couldn\u2019t see it, but he smacked two passenger airplanes and five helicopters from his rough hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah left the industrial section of the city and headed for the mountains. He followed the main highways that acted as the arteries of the city that linked itself to the rest of Lilliput. It wasn\u2019t hard for him to spot the grey ribbon that curled around the landscape and into tunnels through the mountains. Noah used his index finger to run a line across the highway before it reached the mountains. Dozens of fleeing cars were ruthlessly wiped from existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething caught Noah\u2019s attention. It wasn\u2019t a highway, but it was a transport of some sort. It made a straight line and had something white, about the length of his pinky finger, travelling at speeds even fast for him. Noah smiled as he realized it was a bullet train, making a mad escape out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bullet train was about 1,200 Lilliputians, packed from front to rear. During the panic of Noah\u2019s coming, the Lilliputians bum-rushed the train and refused to get out. The train engineers didn\u2019t give a fuck about safety protocols and let the train fill up to the brim before pulling out of the station. The doors barely closed, but the determined Lilliputians pushed and shoved until they did. The cars were damp and hot with all the bodies inside. People were standing on top of each other as they shook in fear. Outside the windows, half the Lilliputian passengers could see Noah playfully poke their land in the nude. His ludeness and murderous intent appalled them to the point of some vomiting inside the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he was gone. Some saw Noah stand up, others said he disappeared. Was he really gone? The passengers still breathed hard and their little hearts were racing. They weren\u2019t going to feel better until they were well out of the valley. The train went dark as it entered the long tunnel which was going to take them from inside the city to the great Lilliput expanse. Some sighed in relief as they felt escape was possible and that they were going to live. Some even clapped and cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train was lit up by the sun again as it made it out of the tunnel and onto a long bridge that was going down on a gradual slope towards the grasslands. Sparks flew as the train\u2019s brakes engaged. Passengers that were standing went flying into each other as the train tried desperately to stop. They looked outside but couldn\u2019t see anything. Only the conductors of the train saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness enveloped the bullet train again as it derailed in slide into a dark pink abyss. The train came to a full stop abruptly and pretty much every one was injured. Male musk entered the cabin of the train. A deep boom pulsed through the train as the temperature and humidity rose. The inside of the train started to compress and crumble as the cave enveloped and literally squeezed the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah smiled as he looked down at his cock. His piss slit managed to swallow three train cars, while four were still outside. He let go of his piss slit, letting it clamp down on the train. He then carefully stood up from the remains of the bridge. The train cars that were still outside his cock, hung by a metal thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians who were in the train cars outside his cock screamed as they realized what had happened. They also felt light headed after being lifted three miles into the sky in one second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Noah, it looked like a small piece of white string hanging outside his cock. The remainder of the train didn\u2019t even make it past his purple head. It was an incredible rush of power for him\u2014to imagine all the little people praying to him while hanging off his blessed dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah looked back devilishly at the valley city. There was still so much to do\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tipped Becky (painfully again) next to a disgarded CD case on the floor and sat on the bed looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave yelled deafly as the woman he loved dumped him on the huge platform. He couldn't tell what it was. Just a flat surface with garish colours underneath. She'd put him on silent! They could both see him, or rather a terrifying pair of bare hairy feet resting on the wooden floor. For Becky the smell was pretty strong as she got closer. Being so much smaller everything was magnified. Everything about him was immense. The pores on his skin, the texture of his hairs, his scent, all overpowering... Dave being even smaller was only spared by the sheer difference in size making his nose less receptive to Brobdingnagian bacteria. It was bad enough as it was, but if he'd got all of it at his size he'd have choked.<br>\r\n\"Becky! Becky! Come back please! Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky stared at the giant toes in front of her. The big toes was half as tall as her. She'd never felt so helpless, and as she watched those huge toes flex, although she felt terrified and guilty, deep down she loiked it. She'd been playing at being big with Dave for so long, and realised how much she wanted to be small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a building crashed down nearby! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo... A laptop computer.... Huge fingers closed around Becky crushing the breath from her in more ways than one. Everything went black for a second, then an impact shook her back to reality and she was on a surreally oversized keyboard. Behind her was a vast screen. To her left some way off was Dave, feebly unable to risk jumping down from a CD case and still waving his arms around. To her right, those big feet, big even for a Brobdingnagian and looking up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might like to see a video clip of some of my work to... get you in the mood.\" the giant boomed, and Becky shivered at the way the bass made her feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" she stuttered, trying and failing to sound confidant and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA godlike hand came down from the sky and pressed outsized buttons.

She was straddling a big throbbing vein when Noah's big hand came down and gripped her and himself and began to grip and move her up and down. The clip went on showing more, as he made her cum with his tongue and how she was playfully squashed under his heavy balls. She wormed between his cheeks and tried to push herself inside him. They saw her writhing between his toes and finally saw Noah cum, huge jets of his seed squirting out, and the tired and dirty girl falling into it and squirming in it in ecstacy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want that?\" Noah's voice shocked them back to reality. The video was over. Becky was sitting on a giant laptop near the biggest feet she had ever seen. Above she could see his amazing cock hanging over the edge of the bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" screamed Dave! \"This ends now! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" breathed Becky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't get that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" she screamed.

You like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo!\" screamed Dave, not even able to cope with the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first video showed Noah naked on his bed with another Brobby woman. She was much older than him but not a bad looker by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Sharon,\u201d Noah said as he too watched the video closely. \u201cShe was dumb enough to marry a Gulliverian man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon was on top of Noah nude, with her breasts pressed up against his chest. Noah\u2019s hand moved down to his crotch where he adjusted his cock and inserted it into Sharon. She let out a squeal as her vagina stretched to accommodate the large Brobby cock. She was used to making love with her one inch husband, and not with a real man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon let out numerous high pitched moans as the giant cock went in and out of her. \u201cIs he still alive?\u201d Noah asked, referring to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sharon barely managed to say. \u201cI could feel him struggling in me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah grinned as he pumped her a few times before cumming inside her. Sperm sputtered out of her pussy as Noah came furiously. \u201cHow about now?\u201d She shook her head \u2018no\u2019 in satisfaction. Her husband drowned in Noah\u2019s seed while inside his wife\u2019s vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video cut to a new one. This time it was two Lilliputians, husband and wife, having sex together on Noah\u2019s bed. Right above them was Noah\u2019s smiling face. \u201cYou guys know the punishment for not cumming.\u201d He looked at the couple through a magnifying glass as they fucked harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah then brought his, monstrous, half mile cock in front of the Lilliputian couple. His piss slit was already dripping with precum. \u201cYou two better cum before I do.\u201d With that, he started jerking off. His purple head was getting more swollen and purple with every stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple eventually came to an orgasm and was relieved at the same time. Noah, unfortunately, didn\u2019t see this and continued jerking off. One more stroke and then he let out a torrential stream of hot white seed upon the Lilliputian couple. Sad thing was, the couple only paid Noah to give them a striptease while they fucked. They didn\u2019t pay him to be drowned in his cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more video for you two,\u201d he said to Becky and Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one was of a party of twenty Gulliverian women, celebrating some type of promotion they were getting. Noah was running through the routines of stripping for the girls on his coffee table. They drank heavily and shouted obscenities, egging Noah to get dirtier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah did his trademark grin, then lifted a random Gulliverian woman and tossed her in his mouth. The other women shouted cheers, thinking it was a part of the act. What they didn\u2019t know, was that Noah swallowed the drunken woman and that she was already being digested by his violent stomach acid. Noah was naked and leaned back into his large couch with his head resting on one of the arm rests. He brought ten women on his chest and instructed them to play with his hard cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, he feasted on the other nine women. One by one, he swallowed women. He got harder and more excited every time he sent a struggling Gulliverian into his stomach. There were also the ten women, all giddy, playing with his 50 foot cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the last woman, he felt himself cumming like a fountain on top of the ten remaining women still playing with his erection. They cheered drunkenly as they felt his hot white seed land on them. They high fived each other as they felt an accomplishment of getting a Brobby off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah needed a shower, so he stood up without removing the ten women. They cascaded down his legs and fell to the floor with serious injuries sustained. Noah kind of took notice of the women and started crushing them one by one under his foot. Their screams dwindled until he finally crushed the last one. Blood and guts stained his wooden floor. He scratched his balls and yawned as he went to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I get so many clients,\u201d Noah said, breaking Dave and Becky\u2019s trance off the laptop. \u201cBut I do. Like you two idiots. But I\u2019m feeling nice today. I\u2019ll give you a choice on how I end you tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being daughter of wealthy parents, she always was the center of attentions, mainly because of her stunning appearence and more than average self-confidence. She was 5'6ft tall, with green eyes and long light brown hair. Her skin was white toned, and she deeply appreciated her feet and hands. Anyway, at age of 18, she never really had any serious sexual activity with a partner, but since young that she took some time in pleasuring herself. But here comes the strange part... Emily becomes turned on by watching/interacting with both gulliverians and liliputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is kind of a secret, but since she was able to buy 10 gulliverians in the black market she was never able to stop. These poor 10 gulliverians faced an extremely horny and unexperienced  16 year old Emily, and they didn't last long enough to even get near her wet panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, she grew found of these tinies, and always kept some hidden in her room. Gulliverians, at their size, usually would be nice to play all kind of games. But in the latest times Emily was feeling a great enthusiasm about dealing with liliputians. Of course she wouldn't be able to play with one liliputian, but she had a life-changing experience, two weeks ago. Emily bought a small tube containing 5000 liliputians, and dropped the content on her room table. She was mesmerized when she saw that they covered an area that was equivalent to her fingertip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis size difference made her immediately become wet and nervous, something that she didnt felt for a long time. Before even interacting with the tinies, she began to stroke herself, just by looking at them. And it was that way she orgasmed, and they were still there. Not for long, because she tapped her sticky fingertip on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, she got stuck on the idea of having more liliputians. One day she orgasmed just by watching a live coverage of a meeting between the brobdingnag ambassator with the liliputian population. She was sitted on the floor, barefooted and with shorts (pants would be dangerous for the liliputians) with millions of liliputians in the area between her legs. Emily just orgasmed by thinking what would happen if it was her instead of the ambassator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven this, she came up with a plan:</span></div></div>",

Emily playfully commanded her maid to get in her room.<br>\r\nRosie,The black haired,fair skinned and blue eyed maiden acted to her mistress's command and came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!!!

But the size difference between her and the Lilliputians was unfathomable.<br>\r\nThey were micro sized next to her 5 miles height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to pop the tube open with her teeth,causing in the process those who where hanging to it inside of the tube to fall unnoticeable  down into her continent  sized cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlucky(or lucky in this case?) Lilliputians  bounced off from her gigantic tits and fell deep into the abyssal hole in between that divided the two perfectly shaped mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unnoticed to our young goddess,Emily then went on and sprinkled the contents of the blue tube onto the page of her opened economic book that she was studying earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screams of the Lilliputians increased  double in volume as the young female  Brobdingnagian sprinkled them onto her the page of her collage  book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...\".Emily thought to herself as she saw the black tiny dots gathering all together  from every corner of the white page creating a black swarm in the middle of it.<br>\r\nHer pussy started dripping once she realized how in fear the Lilliputians were in.Nothing brought her  into such ecstasy in her life like the Lilliputians did .Not even her boyfriend,Chad's dick could get her into this euphoric  state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was still moaning and daydreaming about what she could do to them,The Lilliputians down there,were panicking causing senseless chaos between them..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dis bullshit yo!

The tube contained nearly a hundred thousand real life Lilliputians that were smaller than grains of sand to her. She tried to feel for their yielding bodies, but could only feel wetness as her pussy lips sealed over Chad\u2019s shaft. She poured an entire tube over Chad, and they were already gone. Dead after a few seconds of passionate lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s legs twitched as she felt her first orgasm overcome her. She had everything she could possibly want in life. Wealth, huge house, no worries, servants, and now Lilliputians. They would pay the ultimate price for her bouts of lust and desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowed herself on Chad and started gyrating her hips slowly, moving his cock around her already tight vagina. She grabbed another tube without getting off Chad and brought it to her eyes. She looked at the sea of little dots, pounding on the glass walls of their tube prison. So many little lives, unjustly taken from their homes, and brought to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad kneaded Emily\u2019s round breasts as she toyed with the Lilliputian tube. She popped the cork and told Chad to open wide. He did and then Emily tipped the open end into his hungry mouth. The sensation of a hundred thousand bodies landing in his mouth only made him hornier. Chad easily fit the entire contents of the tube in his mouth and then swallowed without making any other movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re so delicious.\u201d He told Emily. \u201cI want another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled malevolently as she grabbed another tube filled to the brim with Lilliputians. This time, she brought the tube to her breast and gave the Lilliputians a tour of her perfect body. The tube then made it past her flat belly and onto Chad\u2019s chiseled torso. They were right above his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook below you,\u201d She giggled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be going here soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily then moved the tube up to Chad\u2019s already open mouth. He received another hundred thousand Lilliputians. The Lilliputians struggled to stay afloat above the giant\u2019s sticky saliva, but the effort was futile. Their struggles didn\u2019t surmount to much, regardless, it didn\u2019t matter, because Chad swallowed the group as quickly as they entered. The tens of thousands of survivors made it past his slimy esophagus and into his stomach. They fell on top of the half-digested bodies of the previous tube. The screams inside his stomach only lasted a few seconds. Chad\u2019s stomach had consumed the most Lilliputians at once to date. Two hundred thousand Lilliputians were hardly worth any calories to the muscular Chad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily laughed as she heard Chad burp on purpose. She ran her fingers over his bumpy abs and wondered about the doomed Lilliputians. Chad shoved her off him and positioned her doggy style on the bed. He then got behind her and started fucking her hard, his body slapping against her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Emily asked, pausing the fucking for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Yvonne, madam.\u201d Came the voice of one of Emily\u2019s many servants. Yvonne was a tall, skinny blonde that was really shy and timid around the bossy Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Emily said. Chad continued railing into his girlfriend as the door swung open slowly. Yvonne nearly slammed the door shut when she noticed her master fucking. \u201cWhere you going, I said come in!\u201d Emily shouted in between moans as Chad\u2019s cock filled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry madam, this also came in the mail for you.\u201d Yvonne entered the bedroom caring a large cardboard box that looked like housed a large board game. Yvonne carried it parallel to the ground, per the instructions on the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh set it down on the floor there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne did as she was told and set the box gently on the ground, in front of the black flats she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen it up.\u201d Emily said as Chad slowed his fucking, as he was curios as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne pulled the top portion of the box upwards slowly. When the top portion was off, it revealed a tiny Lilliputian city. The denizens of the city screamed in unison as they looked up the three mile legs that belonged to Yvonne. Even she felt a twinge of jealousy that Emily was going to enjoy the city, and not her. She could easily take out the downtown center with one placement of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet, it\u2019s here!\u201d Emily got off Chad and the bed and walked over to the city. She then used a toe, to feel the little structures get crushed so effortlessly. \u201cOkay, you go away now.\u201d She pushed Yvonne away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad came up behind Emily and\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chad got a tingling in his lower regions from this simple action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching his destination he roughly pulled a random tube out of the box and examined it. He couldn\u2019t make much out from the sheer difference in size between him and them but he could see mass movement inside the container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning he lowered the tube down to his flaccid cock for comparison. His dick completely out dwarfed the tube, seeing this Chad got a rush of excitement which went straight to his dick, going erect in a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJeez you Lilliputians are pathetic\u201d Chad mocked \u201cThe container holding all of you is smaller than my dick.\u201d Chad found this hilarious and this situation just fed his alpha male ego more and more. After mocking the Lilliputians Chad got a devilish idea in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the lid of the container Chad tilted it until three fourths of the container was milling about in terror in his hand. Leaving the remaining Lilliputians safe from his wrath\u2026.. for the time being. Chad held the specks of humanity in his open palm and tipped them in his mouth but made sure he didn\u2019t swallow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad received an extreme rush of power knowing that thousands of people were in his mouth at the moment completely and utterly at his mercy. Using that feeling he grabbed his huge erect cock in his hand and started masturbating, Using the tickling feeling in his mouth to get him closer and closer to climaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for chad to climax at that point and the second he did he swallowed the what was left of the Lilliputians in his mouth and held his dick over the container which contained the few thousand left behind. His cum came down upon the remaining Lilliputians like a torrential downpour. Many were crushed by the thick white globs of death but many still were able to survive but were trapped at the top of the container stuck in his thick cum with many not even able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad lifted the container filled to the brim with his seed and some Lilliputians and then went along with the next plan of his idea.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What are you up to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just bought some tubes full of Lillis so probably going to be playing with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds awesome! I have to buy some more Lillis. I just ate a couple Gulliverians for a nice snack but Lilliputians are so much fun cause you can eat them by the thousands!\" Ashley exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on over then! I've got way too many tubes for just me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll be there. See you in a few!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily hung up and smiled. Ashley was one of her best friends and they had been friends forever. Ashley was filthy rich just like Emily and stuck up, spoiled and bratty. She was a gorgeous 5'9 blonde who was also 18 and was the cheer captain at their high school. She had perfect tan skinned and was athletic. Ashley loved playing with anyone smaller than her and often ate, tortured, and crushed numerous Gulliverians and Lilliputians. Emily couldn't wait for Ashley to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had instructed her servants to let Ashley in and direct her to her room. Ashley entered the room and Emily ran to hug her. Ashley was wearing a pair of cut off jean short shorts showing off her tan, toned legs and a white tank top. She was also wearing a pair of black rubber foam flip flops and her fingernails and toenails were painted a bright pink. A pair of designer sunglasses sat on top of her head. Ashley hugged Emily before kicking off her flip flops and walking over to the desk where Emily had the tubs of Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you bought a lot of these!\" Ashley exclaimed as she picked up a tube and examined it. The Lilliputians inside the tube screamed as the huge blue eye of Ashley stared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you've bought just as many before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all at once though. May I?\" Ashley said gesturing to the tube she had in her hand with her thumb ready to pop off the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley grinned as she then popped the top off the tube and lifted it up to her open mouth and tipped the tube. The Lilliputians screamed as they plummeted into her warm moist mouth. Ashley swallowed many alive and then decided to keep the remainder of the Lilliputians in her mouth. When the tube was empty she closed her mouth and sloshed the Lilliputians around. Some drowned in her saliva while others were smashed across her huge pearly white teeth. She then swallowed them condemning them to her death in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh. I love eating Lilliputians.\" Ashley mused as she put the tube down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily followed suit and popped the top off of a tube dumping it into to her mouth and swallowing the Lilliputians alive. She patted her stomach and grinned at Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley held up another tube and smiled at the Lilliputians inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must suck to be that small. Stupid little things.\" Ashley mused as she shook the tube jostling the Lilliputians about. The Lilliputians inside the tube screamed as the face of the beautiful blonde Brobdingnagian dominated their view, her huge blues eyes studying them. She smiled revealing her perfect white teeth and the Lilliputians screamed even more as the teeth parted and a low \"Ahhhhh\" sound erupted from her. Emily just laughed in response to Ashley's terrorizing the Lilliputians. Ashley put the tube back down and looked over at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember one day after a real hard cheer practice I came home and dumped a whole tube of these fuckers in one of my cheer shoes. It must've smelled awful for them but it was so funny thinking they had to smell my smelly cheer shoe where my huge sweaty foot was!\" Ashley said grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's hilarious! I'd love to see a bunch of Lillis choking on your sweaty foot odor!\" Emily said before the two girls both laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was awesome.\" Ashley said as they calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled. \"So should we keep playing with these Lilliputians in the tubes or do you want me to order us a city for some rampaging fun?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhhh, I'm not sure.

Nothing made sense according to his physical senses. But he understood what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim, and the thousand other Lilliputians were seated on the glass floor. They were packed in tightly with hardly any room to move around. Not that moving around would change anything. They knew they were imprisoned and that it was only a matter of time before they would meet their end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach Lilliputian had been given a backpack of provisions. It contained bread, rice crackers, and bottles of water. Barely enough to survive for two days. But Gareth, along with a few of the other Lilliputians, knew they weren\u2019t going to survive longer than two days. It was eerily calm in the tube prison. Sure, some Lilliputians chattered with each other, raising the volume inside the tube comparable to a mall. But everyone\u2019s mood was calm considering their destiny -- a mere few seconds of enjoyment to two 18-year-old Brobbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn adjacent tube filled with thousands of Lilliputians was ferried away. Gareth thought he could hear their screams, but it must\u2019ve been his imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir tube grew quiet. It was hard to see outside, through the distortion of the glass, but they could make out some basic details. Such as there being two Brobbies standing over them. The taller one was doing something with the tube. Possibly examining the hapless Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the tube was returned. Empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGareth felt a hole in his stomach. There were thousands of Lilliputians...now all gone. There was enough Lilliputians to populate a small town. Where were they? Looking out, Gareth could see the taller Brobby pat her flat stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGareth closed his eyes and brought his knees close to his chest. There was no escaping his fate. They were utterly small and defenseless. All the Lilliputian lives in his tube prison were completely vulnerable to this young goddess among women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt his stomach drop ten feet below. His body weight felt to increase over five-folds, as his tube prison was raised into the sky. His seated body collided with other bodies around him. He felt sick as the motion of his prison kept sliding him around into others. Some unfortunate Lillies, the smaller ones, were tossed into the air as the unpredictable tube kept moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, what\u2019s another four thousand Lilliputians?\u201d Ashley said as she peered into the full tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you ever think about them?\u201d Emily asked. \u201cWhat they must be thinking right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the time.\u201d Ashley carefully popped the cork. Her blue eye filled the opening of the tube. \u201cAll their little lives are so pathetic. If you can even call that living.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley inserted the tube into her mouth so that the opening of the tube reach the back of her mouth. In slow, methodical motion, she tilted her head back. As she felt the specks strike the back of her throat, and then she swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGareth looked on and saw the sea of people sliding down the smooth tube and into the throat of the Brobby.His hands and feet looked for purchase on the glass floor, but found none. He, along with the others around him started sliding down into hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screams were awful. People shrieked as loud as they could to the point where they went hoarse. Gareth couldn\u2019t help but let out a yelp as he picked up speed on the slide. He looked overhead and saw the he passing the white teeth of the giantess. Her tooth alone was larger than most buildings from his former neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, past the glass floor, and marveled at the details of the giantess\u2019 tongue. Taste buds larger than a car, raced past him as he neared his destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the heat. He smelled her breath. He could hear her moan. As he fell over the edge of the tube, he could barely make out the massive esophagus, undulating as it swallowed thousands of his kinsman. Then there was darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley removed the empty tube from her mouth. She licked her lips and patted her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are so many people inside you right now.\u201d Emily marvelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Lilliputians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily came closer to her friend and lifted her shirt. She placed her hand over the her friend\u2019s stomach and wondered about the population currently being digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s exciting to think of them as people. Like me and you,\u201d Emily began, \u201cjust a lot smaller. They probably all had futures and dreams, and families, but now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley felt renewed excitement for what she had done. \u201cBut now, they\u2019re just a snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily bit her lower lip. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pam was capable of much worse. \u201cI can have it done in two hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn second thought, I could use a passport too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go honey,\u201d Pam said to her teenage daughter. \u201cYou can now visit Lilliput without the authorities stopping you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! Thanks mom.\u201d Emily hugged her mom and yanked the blue passport from her hand. Emily\u2019s heart fluttered as she scanned through the pages that listed no restrictions. She was allowed to do whatever she wanted in Lilliput. Devilish thoughts raced through her mind. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither can I,\u201d Pam said under her breath as she felt her own passport in her pocket.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyway, before she went on her trip she had to study 2 very important things: one was where were located the biggest Lilliputian cities and the other... was how would she be dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily searched maps on the internet and quickly found out that there were lots of big cities, or atleast big  enough for her to give a couple of steps. While looking at the map she asked herself how the cities would look in real for her, would they look much different from this map view? This kind of thoughts always made her wet, and while thinking of this she zoomed in to a more suitable scale and centered the map on one of the biggest city's downtown. Then she removed her socks and placed her hot baresoles on the screen. That was really umbelievable, that downtown was not big enough for her to rest even one barefoot. Big Plazas were just big enough for her to rest a couple of toes, and not big enough to plant her bareheel. At this point Emily grabbed one vial that she had, filled with 100.000 Lilliputians, and dropped all of them inside her panties. She barely felt them, but she started massagin her sex, with her fingers outside the panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis really opened her apetite for the visit, so after seeing the maps, it is time to choose the outfit, grab lots of vials filled with lilliputians (because Emily likes to deal with lots of tinies and in the city it could hard to make them swarm) and then travel to lilliput.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich clothes should she use?</span></div></div>",

It's not ruined!\".Pam said in relief again when she reached out for the small water proof hand bag that was wrapped  around her fertile hips to make sure that the passport was in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she made sure of it,Pam put the passport back with her phone in the handbag and closed it tightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...what should we start first~?\" .Pam playfully asked herself as well as the frozen dots near her wet and sand soaked feet.\"I think I have an idea of where to start....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians couldn't  heard  of what the giantess was saying since her voice was too thunderous(And none were wearing their hearing devices.Not the Lilliputians nor the giant woman.)  But they knew that standing frozen like statues was not the best idea when  their saw her right foot moving from it's implanted place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!!Get out from the beach now!\".One of the life guards screamed as soon as he realized what was about to happen to them.<br>\r\nAt the screams of the lifeguard,The frozen crowd went  into a panicking state and started uncontrollably running in the opposite direction  of the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not enough for them. Coming into contact with an unfriendly Brobdingnag is Lilliputians' worst nightmare.There has been a huge  dark history before coming into good terms with the other two races,that Brobdingnags were using Gulliverians and Lilliputians as nothing but pleasure toys and just a part of their diets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians tried their best to escape the clutches of this giant woman.But it only took few seconds for her to hover her milky skinned foot above a part of the running crowd and impaled it down mercilessly  onto them.<br>\r\nWhen the foot came down on them,The Lilliputians that were engulfed  by its shadow,were  made one with the sand as the woman compressed them with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panicking doubled after the other surviving  Lilliputians saw some of their own race getting brutally murdered under a \"Woman's foot\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam didn't waste any time with her next movement  as she felt the warm,Lilliputians' blood soaked sand under her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent down a little bit toward the running crowd while carefully balancing herself so she would not fall onto the running crowd  and extended both of her arms  down towards   the panicking crowd,scooping many as many lives as she could within the grip of her slightly pale hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter securing many lives  within the palm of her hands,Pam stood up again on her feet while bringing the Lilliputians in her grips   up to her face after giving them a free tour of her body that they should appreciate as the last thing  they  will enjoy from this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam brought up the Lilliputians to her squarely  shaped face and gazed down upon them with her hazel colored eyes.<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians  at this point were turning blue but yet at the same time were mesmerized  with the color of her eyes as the sunlight enriched them,making them look like priceless gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Lilliputians knew better to  focus more in being blue because the giantess didn't bring them up all the way in here  just so they could  admire the beauty and the femininity of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam slowly opened her mouth to the Lilliputians,exposing to them the deep chasm of  her mouth that  kept on sending the Lilliputians in her hands,heavy,warm breaths over their fragile bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew unlucky Lilliputians that were on the edges of her palms fell to their deaths from the strong currents of warm breath that continued to run over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam wasted no time in raising her hands over her opened mouth and tilted  her head a bit in the process to send the micro bugs into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small tilt from Pam's hands,The Lilliputians started falling down into the chasm of her sexy mouth.Many tried to hang onto the skin of  her hands,But due to the softness of them,None managed to do anything  but to accept their their faiths  of falling down into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pam felt her mouth was full and her hands were empty,She closed the doors of her mouth and started to play with the micro creatures in her mouth with her wet tongue.<br>\r\nFor a Gulliverian,being played around in a Brobdingnag's tongue was endurable.But for Lilliputians,It was a different case.Their minds couldn't comprehend what was happening to them.<br>\r\nThe only thing  that their bodies understood were the dizziness that came over them and the short of breathness that tortured them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter feeling like she had enough of them being tasted and accepted by her tongue to swallow them,Pam bit down with her strong jaw down onto the unfortunate ones that were stuck around her teeth,juicing down into human wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving in more few bites,Pam decided then to swallow the the contents in her mouth,Sending the sea of Lilliputians' blood mixed with their body parts alongside the surviving   Lilliputians that were swimming in it down  her esophagus and subsequently into her stomach.The place where it will become the graveyard for these unfortunate Lilliputians who lived their lives and endured all trials that came with it just for it to end in the stomach of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who were lucky enough,fell directly into the sea of acid that was awaiting them in her stomach,vaporizing them  instantly   while the other unlucky ones got stuck into her slimy esophagus and had a tortuous death of suffocation from the lack of oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the growling   of her stomach settled down,Pam patted her stomach slightly with pleasure and content.<br>\r\n\"Oh,I miss the days that I used to eat them after the after parties of my fashion shows.Emily might have took over her father's looks but she certainly  inherited my malevolent behavior toward the Lilliputians and Gulliverians!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam then gazed down on the empty beach that stood before her godly stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.....What should I do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She ran her right hand down her side, resting it on her hip. She was beautiful and here in tiny world, she was a goddess, and she knew it. She chuckled as she took a step, her deep, sultry voice echoing across the area. She made sure to slowly lower her foot, feeling the crunch of a small town under her perfect sole. The older woman shivered in delight, just being able to feel the tiny specks under her as well, thanks to her training as a model. When she had first started out inter-size shots were a huge business, and paid very well, and \u2018Smaller people\u2019 training had been a requirement. She had been a huge star in the field, the fact brining a grin to her face as she looked down and wondered how many of the specks had admired her, or used the image of her for their needs. Well, it was her turn now, though she supposed it always had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman smiled happily as she began walking regularly, covering entire miles with each step. Power was a wonderful thing, Pam decided. Back home she had power through money and fame, but here? Here she had total, physical power to do as she wished. It was so freeing. She smiled and suddenly unzipped her little handbag, still strapped to her wonderful hips, and pulled out her phone. She had a friend that she wanted to talk to, a fellow model named Miranda. She hit the call button and held the phone to her ear, while away in the more civilized Brobbie nation, Olympia, the fellow model picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPam, it\u2019s so good you called.\u201d Miranda\u2019s voice giggled on the other side. \u201cWhat are you up too?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam smirked as she walked, stopping above a small town, her keen, experienced eyes seeing it easily. She lifted her foot up and lowered her big toe just above it. \u201cOhh, nothing.\u201d She said, then lowered her toe down on the Lilliputian town, grinning as it was totally wiped out. \u201cJust having some fun in Lilliput.\u201d She added as she resumed walking. She heard a sigh then a giggle from Miranda. The other model had a more gentle view of the smaller races, though she devoured and played with plenty of them thanks to the whole legal contract thing Olympia had going on. Pam had bought plenty of bins full of those contracts. She had to admit, the willing victim thing was pretty hot, how the specks wouldn\u2019t run from her as she lifted her foot over them, unless she told them too. In fact most got down and worshipped her, or cheered on their coming deaths. Still though, this was even more fun, killing thousands of the germs as they tried to run for their lives, or plead with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPam, you are such a bitch!\u201d Miranda laughed. Pam smiled at that. Yes, she was indeed a bitch, and she loved it. The older woman brought her free hand up and slicked her still wet hair back, making her all the more stunning looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know. But you love it, and I know you do. Even if you prefer willing victims, don\u2019t you ever forget that one summer vacation.\u201d Pam chuckled. Miranda may have been younger, she certainly looked younger, but they had shared plenty of fun times together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda giggled. \u201cOh yeah, kind of hard to forget. We were pretty flat chested before then. At least compared to now.\u201d She snickered. Pam smiled at that, her hand coming to her right breast and giving is a firm squeeze, earning a sultry moan from her. \u201cYes, we certainly were. Hm, Miranda? Could you send my that Olympian GPS app? The one with maps for Lilliput?\u201d She asked with a wide grin as she stopped her walk, slowly sitting down, not knowing that her massive ass came down on a spread out town, tens of thousands crushed under it as there was a state fair in the town. She heard Miranda click her tongue in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, alright.\u201d Miranda giggled. \u201cI want pics and vids though. You know how hot you are when you do this sort of thing.\u201d The \u2018gentle\u2019 brobbie model giggled. She was just helping a friend out, not actually committing the mass killings herself after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam smiled wide and lounged back, her hand propping her up as it dug into the ground, deep, massive craters being formed. \u201cThanks Miranda, you\u2019re a doll. I should come visit you some time soon.\u201d She said. That would be after this little \u2018vacation\u2019 though.</span></div></div>",

If the mites down below had thought her visit was going to be bad before, it was going to get much worse now that she would have precise navigation. She waited a minute before the screen blinked about the download in progress. It would take a small amount of time, about ten minutes. But that was alright, there was plenty for Pam to do before then. With a slight grunt of effort she pushed forward and rose to her feet, mass amounts of debris falling from her rear. To her it was like bits of sand, but to any down below it was like a meteor shower. Of course there weren't many Lillis down below to be devastated by it, as her sitting down had all but wiped out any habitation below her, the shock wave of her countless tons of weight slamming down kicking up a wind and earth quakes that had leveled even more. Of course, Pam could care less about all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled wide as she lifted her foot from the ground, a perfect imprint of her massive foot crushed into the ground, and took a step forward. Square miles of forest were utterly devastated with the simple step. She actually smiled, able to feel the faintest fractions of resistance from the trees and rocks and little hills. Her eyes were turned down, scanning for signs of serious life, something to play with, to grind under her body. She began a steady walk across the Liliputian country side, smiling as she did. She tried to imagine how it looked from their view, a towering goddess strolling across their lands, miles at a time, leaving behind devastation that would last for generations. It amused her, more then anything, and exited her. Her hands slowly traced down the curves of her body, one hand stopping to rest on her hip while the other rubbed at her crotch. She let out a small moan of pleasure and bit her lower lip lightly. Something about being among the mite sized people was always a turn on. The power of it all, no doubt. Her eyes slowly closed as she continued walking and rubbing her crotch, but the sudden crunch of metal and concrete snapped her eyes open. She looked down and found her foot trampled across some sort of junction of highways, massive six lane highways leading off in several directions. She wondered where they each lead, and which to follow. And that was when her phone beeped. Her frown turned into an immediate grin of joy, and some evil no doubt, as she brought her phone to her face. She laughed with joy as she saw the app was downloaded and installed. She quickly set about finding her location, her grin forming into a smirk as she saw what was beyond her vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the north was a city, pretty large as well. And to the east was a large air force base. Both tempting targets. A city to ravage, and a military base to show her absolute superiority over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices, choices...</span></div></div>",

She just stared out to sea feeling the wind on her face and imagining what hell her angry frustrated young daughter was going to wreak on a whole country of people less than a millimeter tall. Or what hell <i>she</i> would wreak on them. She licked her lips, tasting the salt air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was going to be beyond a diplomatic incident, she knew. War? No. Brobdingnag only allowed rights to Lilliput to placate the Gulliverians. And they only did that for the political faction who cared. What could the Brobs do if they broke the peace? She smiled. Time to stop pandering to insects!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela had been born into money and had married into far more money as a teenager. He died, she prospered, as had her spoiled daughter. The world was whatever they wanted. She looked at Emily. She was shorter than her, at only 5'6 she hadn't inherited her mother's build and Pam was still taller with longer legs even now. And honestly, she liked the jealosy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, Pamela had decided on, a fashionable swimsuit, under an even more fashionable ensemble consisting of a plain black halter top with matching skirt, above the knee, sheer stockings and thigh-high black leather boots with a wedge heel. Emily was probably wearing something too. She reminded herself to pay attention later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCustoms. The official is agitated. Little man in an ill fitting uniform. Speaking of which.... Emily is wearing a tartan miniskirt, a short white top and stupidly implactical high heel platform sandals. Pam sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really want to go through? Both of you?\" From his eyes he was almost pleading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" he mumbled, \"But please be careful. Please. I've worked here a long time and they're people too and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam glared and pushed the small man aside as they passed into Lilliput...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and daughter walked for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where<i> is</i> it?\" wailed Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam smirked despite herself. \"Look down, Emily! If I'm going to get you into Lilliput, the least you could do is pay attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe indicated down. Between them was a bumpy patch on the ground; a town of tiny 2mm high buildings. Small blurs of colour were crowds of people... The whole village was less a foot across!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, the people of Lundfulnap stared up in terror. It was near enough to the customs checkpoint that they had seen Brobdingnagians, and sometimes the old official talked to them from a distance, but the shaking ground and the sight of a pair of boots well over a kilometer long and a pair of platforms with a heel nine hundred metres tall was something no-one was prepared for. The ground shook with each of the giantesses footsteps. Windows shattered and powerful winds blew down the streets bringing clouds of dust. Older buildings collapsed and people where knocked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mom, thank you!\" Emily cried stepping over and embracing her mother, and treading on half the village. With her two inch sole she didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And whilst he might have considered roles as an ambassador or investigate their respective cultures, his sharp mind and proven prowess in all of the sciences from youth drove him down the path to become one of Lilliputt's renowned biological academics, an impressive feat for a man only aged 29. And his interest in both races had gone from simply biologically minded to a definite physical attraction to those bigger than he was. James had knew awkwardly that he felt more than a twinge of sexual thrill when he was around an attractive Gulliverian woman, and even more so with a towering Brobdingnagian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it wasn't simply the fact that Gulliverians and Brobdingnagians were the same as his own kind save bigger, but that they seemed identical in every aspect save size, a matter which with mostly healthy nations between all three races demanded further investigation. James had thus become involved in a project overseen by scientists from Lilliputt, Gulliver and Brobdingnag to learn how exact each race's biology was by checking - internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this end Doctor Adams had worked with technicians on creating both a biosuit which would allow a Lilliputtian to survive inside either of the bodies of the other two races, and from there a transport device for small teams to utilise as a science platform, predominantly for use inside a Brodingnagian as their insides would be easier to navigate. The work had taken nearly two and half years of research and spending a good deal of time adjusting to being in a secure facility with people of all three sizes, but it hadn't been so bad, and the prospect of getting the chance to finally use the suits and craft to explore their larger cousins bodies and determine just how similar they all were was an exciting one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus of course being surrounded by a lot of attractive female scientists with no access to the outside world - since the governments and their science divisions wanted to keep the research a secret until the findings were made for fears that certain parties might disapprove - meant he had met someone he liked a lot...</span></div></div>",

With her thick black curls and slender yet attractive figure, the fact that she was about six going on seven miles tall to Jamie didn't bother him in the slightest, and he wished it was possible to tell the attractive scientist and main test subject for internal Brobdingnagian exploration how he felt about her.

She grimaced as she opened her eyes, daylight blinding her momentarily. \"Somebody turn down the sun...\" She muttered as she sat up right in a teal seat of her carrier. She reached under her mane of curly blonde hair and rubbed her stiff neck. She looked through the glass roof for her friend. \"Where's Michelle?\" As if on cue, a thunderous roar rang out from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to find Michelle's cheek pressing on the other side of the wall. Her Brobby friend's sideways face loomed close, snoring lightly. The Lilliputian girl flinched as the cavernous mouth hung slightly open, its full lips directly above her ceiling. Her carrier had fallen into the incline made by Michelle's gargantuan head. Tan skin pressed against the wall. A thick deluge of drool fell from above, covering Cindy's transparent living space in disgusting slobber. She remembered her titanic, equally drunk friend deciding to crash on the couch. She noticed neither of them had taken off their headsets before passing out. She turned her own on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle! Michelle, wake up!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The humongous girl stirred a bit. \"Five more minutes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. You're drooling all over my carrier!\" She continued lamenting. They'd been friends since high school. She knew her friend's lazy tendencies. Being hungover probably didn't help, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay! Stop yelling!\" The mountain-like face rose up. Michelle propped her head up on her arm as she laid on her stomach, giving Cindy an unwelcome but familiar view of her friend's towering cleavage. Michelle was wearing a low-cut blue tank top, not unlike Cindy's. Despite their size difference, she and her six-mile-tall friend had a knack for wearing similar outfits. Two fingertips the sized of a dozen city blocks clamped onto either side of the carrier. She was carried up to a world-filling blue eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, that's not the worst way you've ever been woken up.\" The larger girl said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me.\" Cindy said, shaking off memories of her glass abode being sloshed by a tongue big enough to slurp up a town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat for a moment before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cindy felt like she was being carried to the heavens in her friend's palm. By Brobdingnagian standards, she was around 5'7 but to Cindy she was an astronomical six miles tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast?\" Michelle asked into her headset simply, eyeing her speck-like friend in the Tic-Tac sized carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read my mind.\" Cindy rubbed her growling stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the kitchen, Michelle set the carrier on the table gently. Cindy opened the door and walked out onto the vast glazed wooden surface wanting to stretch her legs. They were both too tired and hungover to chat much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bagels or waffles?\" Michelle held up the two options across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely bagels,\" Cindy said. Sharing waffles with a Brobby could get unbelievably sticky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter retrieving a bagel big enough to wall in a small town, Michelle sat down at the table. Her colossal upper-body loomed above Cindy. Two cream-capped mountains jiggled and bounced off each other a bit as she settled in. Even the edge of her saucer stood high above Cindy's head. She began to spread strawberry jam on it with a towering butter-knife. As she did so, Michelle yawned downward, right in Cindy's direction. While it wasn't strong enough to blow the micro girl away, the humid gale blustered around her violently. A sweeping fog of morning breath stung her eyes. Cindy gagged a bit as she realized she could taste her friend's breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Why don't you ever brush your teeth before we eat?\" She said between coughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit whining, ya big baby.\" Michelle lowered her upside-down fingernail to Cindy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy rolled her eye as she climbed on.

A large desk sat before the chairs and behind that sat another chair, more modern though, black cloth and plastic, and on wheels. A loud 'click-clack' soon filled the old office as its owner entered and walked to her chair, her automatic door silently closing as she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria Small, the up and coming undefeated young lawyer with her own law firm at the young age of only 25. She was tall even for a Brobbdy, with shapely legs, and the seemingly natural figure of Olympian Brobbdies. Wide hips and a shapely rear end, Victoria's slightly larger than the average, and a tonned body. Her breasts were the envy of her female peers, F-cups. It was with this figure, her size, and just her sheer personality that she had never lost a case. She used her size to intimidate people, but never hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in her chair and flicked on her holoscreen computer, something only found in Olypmia thanks to the more integrated society, everyone could easily get top of the line Lillputian technology. The first thing that came up was the news, the head line making her frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Size tensions rise as Brobbdies invade Lillputian home island' She sighed at her less enlightened cousins from the other side of the world. She clicked the story and brought up the article in detail. Two seperate incidents were being reported. A male brobbdy, a suspect in multiple disappearance cases regarding Lillputians and Gulliverians, had decimated a city, almost a million Lilliputians killed, the survivors describing it as nothing less than a 'sexual rampage'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother incident was actually two in one, apparently a mother- daughter tag team of sorts had obtained 'ambassador' pass ports, and were on their own string or rampage and murder. Victoria sneered at that, at their weakness of their mind. Many Brobbdies, even here in Olympia, had such thoughts and desires, but that's what separated them from their cousins. They had the mental strength to dismiss them. And while the consumption of Gulliverians and Lilliputians was permitted there was a legal market for it. No randomly abducting a city of Lilliputians, no plucking people off the streets. There were contracts involved, most people who ended up being eaten ended up there willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part of the story made her grin. The Olympian prime minister vowed harsh sanctions against their fellow Brobbdies, and a freeze on accounts if rich Brobbdies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will make them think twice.\" Victoria grinned as she brushed a strand of her blone hair over her ear. Almost all the advanced technology those uncivilized Brobbdies used was manufactured in Olympia. It would be an interesting state of affairs, and she might just see some clients out of it. She closed the international headlines and skimmed over the local stuff, sipping at her tea as she enjoyed her relaxing day, while it lasted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria walked down the sidewalk with great excitement. Today was the day that she was to meet her new client. But what made this client different from the myriad of clients Victoria had already represented was that this client was a Lilliputian, her first lilliputian client in fact. Victoria had seen a lilliputian before of course, but she never truly spoken to one, as in never had she had a one on one conversation with a lilliputian before. Victoria had red the file, apparently the Lilliputian she was representing was a 26 year old man named Carlos Moya. Carlos was suing his ex wife who was a Gulliverian for attempted murder. Victoria showed great entrust for this case, she understood that mixed sized relationships where not against the law but where still rare, marriage even more so. The real question was what could have happened to cause this loving relationship between a Lilliputian and a Gulliverian to go so sower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was to meet Carlos at a coffee shop called Mixed Sizes. As the named suggested this coffee shop was for Lilliputians, Gulliverians, and Brobdingnagians. There were very few restraints that served mixed size customers, for obvious reasons but this coffee shop in particular made it possible for people of mixed sizes to interact with each other in a safe environment. Mixed Sizes was a big coffee shop that supported three sections, each section bigger than the last. There was the Lilliputian section, where there stood 5 Brobdingnagian tables each one carrying thousand if not millions of Lilliputians. Since these Lilliputians where on top of these large tables only a Brobdingnagian could reach them. Then there was the Gulliverian section where hundred of Gulliverians sat and relaxed at their tables drinking there coffee. Unlike the Lilliputians the Gulliverians where not put on Brobdingnagian tables so for the first time in any of their lives the Gulliverians where looking up at the Lilliputians. Then there was the Brobdingnagian section, the biggest section, filled with 50 Brobdingnagian\u2019s who where like gods to the smaller races. The coffee shop Mixed Sizes in forced one rule that was non negotiable. Sections where forbidden from interacting with each other, for their own safety of course. Lilliputians could not cross over to the Gulliverian section nor could the Gulliverians cross over to the Brobdingnagian section. The only exception was if both party\u2019s agreed to the interaction, upon agree to the interaction the smaller race would be carried to bigger section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the coffee shop Victoria was seated in the Brobdingnagian section. There she patiently and eagerly waited for her client. Little did she know her client did not feel the same excitement she was herself was feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos Moya hated his stupidity more than ever. Here he was making the same mistake he made before, trusting another giant person, and this giant was even bigger than his bitch of a ex wife. It was to late for regrets, he was already here in Olympia, he already had a meeting with Victoria Small. Deep down Carlos knew that the only way for him to be free from his ex wife was to believe in Victoria, but it was hard trusting some one so big, so gigantic, especially when he had already done so and it literally blew up in his face. Rumor has it, the Brobdingnagians that live here in Olympia are more polite and gentle than their cousins that live in foreign land, but could Carlos really trust a rumor, especially when his own life was on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a Carlos Moya.\u201d A young Gulliverian waitress said with a booming voice as she looked down on the thousands of Lilliputians that littered the Brobdingnagian tables. The Gulliverian waitress was riding on a hover cruiser made for Gulliverians. The hover cruiser was one of the inventions that was only created and sold in Olympia, it was made off of the same design as the Lilliputian cruiser that helps Lilliputians travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos upon hearing his name stood up from his seat and raised his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Carlos Moya!\u201d He yelled trying not to sound nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant waitress looked at Carlos for a few seconds, and soon smiled. \u201cYou have a meeting with a Brobdingnagian women named Victoria Small, is that correct?\u201d The giant waitress asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment every Lilliputian looked at Carlos with a shocked look on their face. A Lilliputian meeting with a Gulliverian was not unheard of, but meeting with a Brobdingnagian was rare. It couldn\u2019t be true<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos (embarrass by all of the shocked looks everyone was giving him) answered the giant waitresses question. \u201cYes that is correct.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians could not believe it this man was really meaning a Brobdingnagian. Some Lilliputians looked at Carlos with envy and rage, others with disbelief and pity. This kind of interaction rarely ever ends well, all they could do was watch as the Gulliverian waitress picked up Carlos and and flew away on her hover cruiser, towards the holy ground, which was the Brobdingnagian section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take the waitress and Carlos long to get to the Brobdingnagian area, just a few seconds in fact. The giant waitress along the way shielded Carlos with her hand so he was not effected by the air pressure to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk here we are.\u201d The waitress said dropping Carlos on the hard wood floor which Carlos recognized as the exact same table he was on before, the only difference was that their was no one else on this great expanse only him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIve brought him ma\u2019am\u201d the giant waitress said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos looked at the waitress and noticed that she was looking up at something. Before the waitress left she gave Carlos his very own head set and instructed him on how to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d Carlos says into the head set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELLOS MR. MOYA MY NAME IS VICTORIA SMALL ITS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.\u201d Victoria\u2019s voice shook Carlos to his core. Carlos found himself on his butt, for he could no longer stand because of the earthquake generated by Victoria\u2019s voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth quake cake to a abrupt stop, and yet still Carlos was horrified not because of Victoria\u2019s display of power but because of the site before his eyes. A 300ft blue gigantic eye was staring right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs Victoria I presume\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

White cloth covered the table, so Victoria was able to make out Carlos minuscule form, which appeared as a very small colored dot, in the middle of a ocean of white. Victoria wore a headset, to hear Carlos. She couldn\u2019t believe how normal Carlos sounded. Lilliputians, what fascinating little creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos world was shaking by the second. He knew that these earthquakes were caused by Victoria speaking. The Gulliverian waitress had left, leaving Carlos alone with Victoria. Deep down Carlos wished that she had stayed, one for support, and two for a quick exit if he needed one, but alas here he was standing before this titan, that completely dwarfed his ex wife, with ease. He couldn\u2019t do this, he had to leave this god forsaken place. Carlos looking up at Victoria couldn\u2019t even see her whole entire face, which was hidden by her gigantic mile long  breasts, which were firmly planted on the table, as close as Carlos was to Victoria, Victoria was just to wide to massive for Carlos to make her full visage out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMR. MOYA?\u201d Victoria says with a booming voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d Carlos jumps a little from Victoria\u2019s voice shaking him out of his trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO JUST JUMP RIGHT INTO YOUR CASE.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, I suppose you are right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos couldn\u2019t leave not now, if he was to put a end to this injustice then he had to stay, and face his fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria could feel the uncertainty in Carlos voice, and she didn\u2019t blame him for being scared. She understood that Carlos was in alien territory, territory filled with gigantic beings that where more likely to kill him by accident then on purpose. Victoria didn\u2019t know how Carlos felt, even among her fellow Brobdingnagians she was taller than most, even men. The point was that she rarely had to look up at anyone, she was almost always looking down at people. There were even a few instances where she used her height to intimidate people, but never hurt. But to Carlos she was beyond intimidating, and he was obviously scared, and yet here he stood his ground, for reason still unknown to Victoria, for now. Carlos had earned Victoria\u2019s respect, which wasn\u2019t easy to do. Victoria let out a little giggle. She couldn\u2019t help but think that, this little man had earned her respect, something that other Brobdingnagians had failed to do. What a man. She thought leaning forward, looking down at the little dot on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO MR. MOYA HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME YOUR STORY.\u201d Victoria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can just call me Carlos Ms.Victoria.\u201d Carlos said in a low voice into his headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH? OK NOT REALLY PROFESSIONAL, BUT OK, IF WE ARE ON A FISRT NAME BASES NOW YOU CAN CALL ME VICTORIA.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria smiled at the Carlos. She actually preferred it this way, she believed that calling each other by your first names would help Carlos relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK CARLOS HOW ABOUT YOU EXPLAIN.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes of course.\u201d Carlos says stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy wife, my ex-wife is out to kill me.\u201d Carlos says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Victoria shook a little in anger. This anger was nothing new to her, she had felt hundreds of times, whenever a Brobdingnagian or in this case a Gulliverian missed used their power she had felt it, but this time to her confusion her anger seemed to flare even more powerful than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos fell to the hard ground, a little startled by the sudden earthquake more powerful than any other, he had experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Ma\u2019am, I mean Victoria are you ok.\u201d Carlos asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUH YES, SORRY JUST GETTING COMFORTABLE, PLEASE CONTINUE.\u201d Victoria says feeling a little  embarrass. Victoria saw Carlos fall down and felt a little bad.\u201dSORRY IT WONT HAPPEN AGAIN.\u201d Victoria knew that she had to control herself, her getting angry would only put Carlos in danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos remained seated as he told his story to Victoria. Carlos told Victoria about his ex-wife who was named Jill Wagner, Carlos told her how he met Jill at a bar and one thing led to another and they found themselves in a relationship. They had been married for 4 years. This completely surprised Victoria. Carlos soon grew sad as he continued his story. Carlos told Victoria how Jill became pregnant. Victoria first came to the conclusion that Jill. Cheated on Carlos, but that was never the case. Jill was pregnant with Carlos baby, a Gulliverian was pregnant with a Lilliputian child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!!!!\u201d Victoria jumping up from her chair, towering over the speck on her table. Victoria drew the attention of many of the Brobdingnagians that were seated by her. They couldn\u2019t see Carlos, who was less than the size of a speck to all of them so many of them thought she was crazy, beautiful, but still crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Carlos this simple action had caused him a lot of pain. Carlos went flying back a few feet from the winds generated from Victoria standing up. Carlos had to cover his ears to prevent them from bursting, because of Victoria\u2019s loud shout. By the time Carlos came to his senses he saw something that utterly scared him. Victoria standing up totally casting his Lilliputian form into her shadow. She was bigger than any mountain, bigger than a 1000 lilliputian skyscrapers. Victoria\u2019s face was no longer blocked by her massive bosom, therefore Carlos eyes were able to see her massive face. Massive wasn\u2019t the right word, their was no word to explain how huge Victoria was, but through the fear even Carlos had to admit she was beautiful. Victoria\u2019s face was miles away from Carlos so Carlos was able to make it out, if only a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria soon realized what she had done, along with a few Brobdingnagians looking at her like she had lost her mind. Once again she was embarrassed, and when she looked down at Carlos she realized that he was not in the same place he was before, instead he was a few feet away from his  previous destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMY GOODNESS ARE YOU OK.\u201d Victoria asks sitting down and leaning in to inspect the little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh y, yes Victoria I\u2019m fine.\u201d Carlos says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria could hear the fear in Carlos voice, she knew that she was responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI AM SO SORRY BUT YOUR STORY IS HARD TO SWALLOW.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria says pushing a few strands of hair behind her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Carlos Victoria moving her body was like watching a whole land mass move, and it quite frankly amazed him. Carlos didn\u2019t blame Victoria for not believing his story. He couldn\u2019t believe it ether. Their had never been a child born of two different races before. Scientist believed it to be impossible, because the anatomy of a Lilliputian, Gulliverian, and a Brobdingnagian was different. They were all in a sense human beings but, humans with a few changes in them, these changes make a big differences, like the massive size differences between the three races. It is because of this difference in anatomy that Lilliputians can be eaten by a Gulliverian or a Brobdingnagian, and it is not called cannibalism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria started to relies how huge this case really was, this was history, it was the kind of case lawyers dream of, and it was all hers. Victoria couldn\u2019t help but fill happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes me and Jill were about to have a baby.\u201d Victoria turns her attention back to Carlos, reminding herself that this wasn\u2019t just about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd even though I was so happy about this new life coming into our lives, Jill, she was angry.\u201d Carlos says with a dark angry tone, that caught Victoria by surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos told Victoria about how he and jill got into huge arguments about the baby. Jill wanted a abortion, but it was to late the baby was already fully formed in her stomach. The baby was so small that Jill didn\u2019t have a baby bump or anything, nobody if looking at her would never even think she was pregnant. Jill soon had the baby, the  birthing process was very easy for Jill, and it went smoothly. They had given birth to a healthy boy, that had Lilliputian and Gulliverian blood running through his vain. The doctors did not know how big the boy would get, but figured he would be a little bigger than a Lilliputian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL THATS GREAT, YOU MUST BE SO PROUD.\u201d Victoria said, still amazed at this miracle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I was, I was so proud.\u201d Carlos begins to cry a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was confused, was like in pas-tense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe went home right after Jill gave birth to our son, in the car Jill didn\u2019t speak a word, she didn\u2019t even look happy, nor did she look at me or her son, she just drove the car all the way home.\u201d Carlos said still crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we got home Jill carried me and the baby inside the house. When we got in the house she took the baby from my hands and, and......\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos couldn\u2019t say it, he didn\u2019t want to say it, but he knew he had to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAND WHAT?\u201d Victoria had a general idea of what Carlos bitch of a ex-wife did, and it really pissed her off. She looked down at Carlos with tears starting to appear in her own eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe killed our son, crushing him in her own hands.\u201d Carlos said putting his head in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for a few minutes, neither Carlos, or Victoria said a single word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJill and me divorced, and now she wants me dead, because I threatened to bring her to justice.\u201d Carlos says finally breaking the long silences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJill knows powerful people who are also Gulliverians. All of them are dead set in seeing me dead. So Ms. smalls you are my only hope. I don\u2019t care what I have to pay, but please help m.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge pile of flesh covers Carlos mouth preventing him from speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDONT WORRY I WONT LET THEM HURT YOU.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda Hart was in an industry where at 24 years old it could have been easy to turn into a greedy or selfish person who viewed her career above everything. And it was true that her work as one of the leading and beautiful models in Olympia was important and rewarding to her, but she'd found the happiness and joy she'd given to her fellow co-workers, friends and family much more significant. Miranda was clearly incredibly attractive with her long brown hair, a well toned and developed physique, fine curves, perked bottom and 36 DD cups after some three years in the industry. But people who knew her well said it was her kindness and consideration for others which defined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking over an array of photographs from her latest shoot amid a flick of her slender pink fingers, Miranda reviewed them in turn as she sat in her apartment, nodding and smiling her trademark smile at the ones she considered best, usually the ones which were sexy but tasteful. She had no worries about allowing her body to be shown off in beautiful ways, just as long as the context was fine. Miranda knew she had her fans across all three nations and loved them for doing so, though she was still currently single. Recently she'd been thinking about trying to rectify that, but finding the right sort of guy wasn't always easy in her line, especially when she was after someone who'd view her personality and desire to help others - as evidenced by some work she'd undertaken for Gulliverian and Lilliputian charities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she'd been a bright and spunky little girl Miranda had been very curious - but in a kind way and quite unlike some of her more violent Brobdingnagian cousins - about the smaller nations of her world. She liked the tiny peoples, imagining them roaming across her palms, exploring her hair and perching on her nose tip. And since being aware that she had fans in Gulliver and Lilliput, there was a part of her which wondered whether she could do more for one of them. There was something wonderfully excited about dating a man who could explore her vast fingers and tipped toes, where she'd be a landscape as much as a lover. There were hundreds of Brobdingnagian and Gulliverian relationships in her country, and she had long heard that the people of Gulliver were liable doing the same with some of the people of Lilliput. But a Brobdingnagian dating a Lillputian? Or marrying? Unheard of. Miranda bit her lip, knowing that so many of her less enlightened people really only viewed Lilliput people for a few purposes, virtually none pleasant. Maybe just dating a Gulliverian would be easier, after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long sigh she straightened her slightly tall 5'8 body from the computer and smiled. If she was the first to try, it would probably be taken as something of a publicity stunt by some who already knew her good works for the tiny nation. Better she'd find someone from either nation quietly and done properly, whether that ended up being some kind person out of showbiz altogether or in a similar field on a tinier scale who was genuinely good like her. But in any case, she had some work to take care of today, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Private Olin mashed the top button of his alarm clock that signified it was 0430 in red LED numbers. He flipped over onto his back on his springy bed as he fought the urge to go back to sleep. Olin stared at the ceiling with tired eyes for several minutes as he tried to wake up his body. Ten more minutes had passed and he was still in bed. Olin sighed as he lifted his upper body up into a seated position. His mouth was dry, his head heavy, and vision blurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carpeting in the barracks was similar to those in hospital waiting rooms. The carpet fibers were thin, rough, and stain resistant. Olin\u2019s bare feet thumped across the teal colored carpet to the shared toilet. He could only wish that his roommate didn\u2019t lock his side of the bathroom again. He twisted the door handle\u2014it was unlocked. Maybe it wasn\u2019t going to be a bad day for Olin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn basic training, the Lilliputian soldiers were taught to perform the three \u2018S\u2019 in rapid succession. Shit, shower, and shave\u2014in that order. It\u2019s been almost a year out of basic, and Olin was still practicing the ritual with increasing efficiency. He pooped. He showered. He cut his neck shaving. He slipped on his olive drab uniform and black leather boots. He could already tell that his supervisor was going to give him shit for not spit shining his boots, but it was too early in the morning for Olin to give a shit about that. Before leaving his room, Olin pulled the little white pieces of toilet paper stained with a red dot from his neck and tossed it in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another beautiful, dark, foggy morning. The yellow lamps that littered the base hummed and glowed their bile colored yellow. The sun was still asleep and had another hour before it rose up. In the meantime, the sky had a dark purple hue. Olin could smell the water in the air thanks to the extra heavy fog that morning. He walked across the bricked footpath that weaved around a Gulliverian sized tree. It was time for the best part of the morning\u2014breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mess hall served disgusting food for Lunch and Dinner but breakfast was hard to fuck up, even for DFAC. The morning air around the mess hall always smelled of fried eggs, bacon, and sausage. Any soldier in the vicinity had their stomach\u2019s gurgling and their mouthwatering for some good ol\u2019 fashioned Lilliputian breakfast. Except, most soldiers were still asleep in their warm comfortable beds. Olin and a few others were the unlucky ones to have to start their shifts at the butt crack of dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin ate his eggs and bacon alone. He took a bite of his muffin and almost spat it out because of the freezer burn taste. The fake eggs and not so crispy bacon were good enough. Thanks to a heaping dollop of hot sauce. There were only two other soldiers in the dining on their breakfast. They were quiet and emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old red brick building with no windows and 5-story antenna sticking out from the center served as the communications building. The top of the antenna had a dim red light to serve as a warning to any low flying vehicles. The red light seemed to seep out into the fog. Private Olin punched in the four-digit door code to enter the exterior of the building. He wasn\u2019t done, however, he had to go through two more doors with their own unique key codes\u2014then down a labyrinth of narrow hallways and then through two more doors protected by a dial combination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy grey vault door was the last obstacle for him to overcome before reaching his work center. He picked up a 20-year-old analog phone and dialed the Base Defense Operation Center to gain entry. Once cleared, he entered the combo to the vault door and entered the communications facility\u2014 but he had to enter one more combination on a hidden keypad in 10 seconds, otherwise the facility alarm would go off. Olin could perform the procedures in his sleep. He entered the four numbers on the keypad, turning the red LED, green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took him four minutes to enter work from the front door to the communications floor. He was getting good at his job. He turned on a relic of terminal machine on. The green monochrome monitor flickered on and gave him a \u201c&gt;\u201d prompt. He entered a command signifying he was onsite and reporting for duty. It was now time for Olin to start work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flopped down on a comfortable office chair, kicked his feet up on his desk, and shut his eyes. The loud hum of all the communications racks were like white noise to him. There were 30 racks spread throughout the comm floor. Some were archaic Lilliputian analog multiplexors. Other racks consisted of multi-million dollar digital networking equipment with state of the art intrusion detection systems. Other racks contained sophisticated servers whose sole job was to analyze tons of data obtained by intercepting Blefuscudian networks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate Olin didn\u2019t know how any of that shit worked. His job was to babysit the equipment and provide hands-on maintenance with heavy guidance of the agency on the other side of the phone. It happened only once to Olin since his assignment to Falcon Point. The agency\u2014that Olin never heard about\u2014called Olin\u2019s phone up and had him hard reboot the SDP router. Once he did that, the agency hung up and never called back. Olin went back to his paperback book and didn\u2019t think any more of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin jumped out of his seat when he heard a crashing sound coming from the server room. He heard the hum of a thousand internal equipment fans spinning\u2014but that crash was way out of place. It sounded like a metal pipe falling on concrete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe equipment hum responded. Private Olin rose to his feet and hesitated about what to do next. It had to be his imagination. No one, except a select few knew the codes to enter the comm floor, and even then, they wouldn\u2019t usually come to work until around nine. Olin walked through a wooden double door that led to the server room. The expansive room was dark except for the thousands of flickering lights that littered the front displays of rack-mounted equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin went for the light switch and flipped it on. One by one, the florescent lighting flickered on\u2014row by row, the server racks were illuminated. The humming was loud; there might as well been a five ton truck idling in that room. Olin walked down the rows of racks and kept an eye out for anything suspicious. There was nothing. Just racks with cables spilling out onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d Olin said to himself. He headed out of the server room and turned the lights off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother crashing sound. This time it sounded like a plastic printer exploding into a hundred pieces. Olin flipped the light on again\u2014one by one the fluorescent lights turned back on illuminating one rack at a time as fast it took a traffic light to turn green. The room was still half-dark when Olin turned around, only to come face to face with the end of a pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove and I\u2019ll blow your fucking brains.\u201d A man that Olin never met said. He had a thick Blefuscudian accent. \u201cTurn around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin was surprised to see his trembling hands up in the air. In the past, Olin had fantasized what he would have done if he ever had a gun pointed at him. Just like in the movies, he pictured himself grappling the gun from the bad guy, only to shoot the villain in the stomach. Now that a real run with its black barrel pointed between his eyes was less than five inches from him\u2026 It took an incredible amount of willpower not to piss his pants right then. He wanted to speak but his throat locked up with a cold lump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blefuscudian cocked his pistol and planted the end of the barrel against Olin\u2019s forehead. \u201cAre you fucking deaf, mate? Turn the fuck around.\u201d The terrorist sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dimmed in the server room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hum of the equipment strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun in the terrorist\u2019s hand trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pulled away from Olin\u2019s forehead and retreated closer to the terrorist\u2019s body. \u201cWhat the fu\u2014?\u201d Still with trembling hands, the man\u2019s wrist rotated. Brought to the man\u2019s temple was the barrel end of the gun. Olin looked as surprised as the man did. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The terrorist shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin wasn\u2019t doing anything! His breathing became rapid and irregular. He feared for the man as much as he feared for his own life. The man\u2019s trigger finger quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He shouted with glassy tear filled eyes. The man tried to move, but only managed to shake a millimeter. The man couldn\u2019t run, nor move his arm. His finger squeezed the trigger. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d His voice was hoarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Olin was crying just as much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun went off. The nine-millimeter bullet entered the man\u2019s skull and tore a hole through his squishy pink brain. The exit wound exploded out of the side of the man\u2019s head, pulling brain matter out. The wall adjacent to the terrorist splattered with gore and bits of brain. A mist of blood freckled Olin\u2019s terrified face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin screamed like a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called the military police a second later.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Olin went to parade rest. \u201cYou know why I called you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I believe it has something to do with the incident from last week, sir.\u201d Olin shifted his eyes around the room. The Colonel served over two decades in the Lilliputian Army and it showed with the memorabilia around the office. There were plaques, shadow boxes, awards, dozens of coins on his desk, and other tacky gifts going-away gifts from previous assignments. Grey outdoor lighting seeped into the dim office. Olin sensed that there was someone else in the room. Someone in the shadows that wasn\u2019t really trying to hide, but at the same time didn\u2019t want to make himself known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmart man.\u201d The Colonel\u2019s raspy voice said. \u201cDo you find it odd, how you survived that pesky ordeal son?\u201d His tone wasn\u2019t of concern but almost accusatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, the private believes that the Blefuscudian was on a suicide mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, cut the crap Olin.\u201d The Colonel\u2019s voice thundered. \u201cYou think one of those Blef-idiots would break into a top secret comm facility only to blow his brains out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you?\u201d The Colonel jumped on his feet and leaned over his desk. \u201cYou want to explain to me, how you made a fucking Blefuscudian blow his goddamn brains out in my comm facility?\u201d The volume of the Colonel\u2019s voice was much scarier than the gun at Olin\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I don\u2019t know how he\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll throw you in the goddamn brig if you keep acting a fool. Don\u2019t waste my fucking time. What did you do, to make that Blefuscudian prick shoot himself?\u201d The Colonel picked up a remote from his desk and flipped on a wall mounted TV that Olin didn\u2019t notice. It played a surveillance video taken from the server room right behind Olin\u2019s shoulder. The tape recorded the look of terror on the Blefuscudian\u2019s face. \u201cTell me, goddamnit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough Johnny.\u201d A disembodied voice said. Olin turned his head and saw what looked like businessman materialize from the dark shadows. \u201cThe boy clearly doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d He held a small glass filled with honey colored whiskey. \u201cAnd that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mysterious man in a black suit was, as it appeared, higher in chain of command because the Colonel sat back down behind his desk, steam still coming off his baldhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrivate Olin,\u201d the man in the suit was well into his fifties and it showed in his soft wavering voice, \u201cwhy did you join the military.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to protect our people, sir.\u201d It was the first bullshit reason Olin could come up with on the spot. The real reason he joined the military was that he didn\u2019t have money for college and didn\u2019t want to live with his parents; left with little options, he enlisted. Olin was smart enough to know that that\u2019s not what the suit wanted to hear. Giving a shitty reason like protecting Lilliputian freedom should assuage him. \u201cI believe in protecting freedom for all Lilliputians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d The man in the suit took a sip of his drink. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me son. It won\u2019t work. You joined because you didn\u2019t know what to do with your life. You didn\u2019t want to work and try to college at the same time. You figured the military was an easy way out of your parent\u2019s house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin wasn\u2019t sure to fear the Colonel or this mysterious man more. It was as if he was reading his private life story. As if, he was in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be reassigned, Joel.\u201d The suit took another drink. \u201cYou are going to be reassigned to a Gulliverian woman by the name of Jennifer Torrance. She\u2019s got the same talent as you, but not nearly as powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What talent? I don\u2019t have a talent.</i> Olin thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do have a talent, and she\u2019s going to help bring it out.\u201d The old man\u2019s cold blue eyes saw right through Olin. \u201cAfter all, you want to protect all Lilliputians with your selfless service, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin nodded. He then looked at the Colonel who still had a bulldog look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d The old man in the black suit said. \u201cYou report in thirty minutes. I suggest you run off and pack up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2014uhm just had\u2014\u201c Olin stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had a question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had security cameras in the comm facility?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Private Joel Olin had never ridden in a private hover car. His pilot wore a sharp suit and offered Olin a drink from the vehicle\u2019s bar. Olin was still in his uniform with his green duffel bag by his scuffed up boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be landing in a moment, sir.\u201d The driver said through the vehicle\u2019s intercom system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not a \u2018sir\u2019, I\u2019m just a Private.\u201d Olin corrected him. \u201cThe term \u2018Sir\u2019 is only reserved for Officers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds interesting.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hover car landed without a bump onto a flat tarmac plane with no discerning features. The sky was clear blue and didn\u2019t have that damned fog that Olin was accustomed to for the past year. As the vehicle landed, Olin plastered his face against the tinted window and looked out. He couldn\u2019t see any trees, mountains, or anyone for that matter. A little dust cloud blew out from under the hover car as it came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d The driver said. \u201cYour contact will meet you here shortly. Be sure to grab a communications headset on your way out, <i>private</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin clicked open the door and then threw out his duffel bag. He grabbed a headset before hopping out. He closed the door, walked over to the driver side window and asked, \u201cso I just wait here for my contact?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver didn\u2019t answer. The engine hum crescendoed as the vehicle levitated above Olin\u2019s head before firing away like a rocket. Olin looked a little perplexed as he stared off into nothingness. He examined his headset before fitting it around his skull and powering it on. \u201cHello?\u201d Only static answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited there for another ten minutes. Nothing came over the headset; the tarmac plane remained vacant. Olin had some time to think about that morning when he killed the Blefuscudian terrorist. Just thinking about the fact that he <i>killed</i> someone seemed preposterous, let alone the notion that he committed such a heinous act with his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin sat on his duffel bag and waited for another fifteen minutes. The heat bouncing off the tarmac from the sun was starting to get at him. He fanned his blouse from his chest for some relief. He used his forearm to wipe the sweat off his forehead. He kicked around a few pebbles as he fought the intense boredom he felt. Telekinesis. That\u2019s what it\u2019s called he thought. Does he really have such powers? Do such powers even exist? He focused on a small pebble in front of him. He pictured the rock moving away from him. Nothing happened. He shut his eyes and focused more on the pebble. He opened his eyes and squinted. He could almost <i>feel</i> the rock moving. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bounced. Olin adjusted himself on his makeshift duffel bag seat. He focused more on the pebble and tried to make it move. It bounced up and down. Olin smiled in disbelief. He was doing it! He was moving an object with his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he noticed the pebbles around the one he was focusing on were moving as well. In fact, all the pebbles were bouncing up in down. Shit, <i>he</i> was moving up and down in sync with the pebbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin looked around and saw someone in the distance, his or her form distorted like a mirage from the heat in the air. Olin got up to his feet and looked on with curiosity. The figure that stood several hundreds of feet away caused the rhythmic booms he felt under his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell\u2014uhm, hello?\u201d The figure came closer. Olin could now tell it was a woman wearing a Gulliverian military uniform. Unlike the Lilliputian uniform, the Gulliverian version had a digital urban colored pattern. The boots were green suede and didn\u2019t require shining like the leather Lilliputian version. \u201cI\u2019m Private Olin with the 94th Signal Company. I\u2019ve been assign\u2014hey, watch out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin tried to jump out of the way but he was too slow. The green suede boot was upon him. Olin collapsed onto his back on the hot tarmac ground. The thick treads of the boot felt like rubbery concrete on his thin body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re the one everyone is talking about.\u201d He heard a feminine voice through the headset. \u201cThe so-called <i>Prodigy of Lilliput</i>. You don\u2019t look like much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore weight fell on top of Olin as the 430-foot tall Gulliverian female soldier rested her boot on top of him. His ankles bent to the side and found some relief between the thick boot tread. The soles of her boots made contact with his cheeks. Olin tried to push her off him, but it was like trying to bench press a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much of a prodigy if I can step on you so easily. Shit, I can tell the boss I accidently stepped on you and that\u2019ll be the end of that.\u201d Jennifer stood in silence for a few moments before continuing. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are replacing me. Not only that, but they expect me to train you? I\u2019d rather you become a stain under my boots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer let more weight drop on her left foot. The Olin could feel his ribs on the verge of cracking, his ankles almost broken, and his breathing labored. The dusty underside of the sole felt like sandpaper on his cheeks. Darkness enveloped his sight, both due to bus-sized foot blocking the sun and due to lack of oxygen to his brain. Olin made one last Herculean effort to push Jennifer of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer\u2019s left foot swung back like a reverse football kick. Her foot swung back with such a jolt that she lost her balance and fell to the ground. Her palms broke her fall, scraping them against the hot tarmac in the process. Olin was right below her shocked and angry face. A few locks of hair escaped from under her uniform hat and partially covered her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer composed herself and stood back up brushing her palms together. Olin tried to fill his lungs with air, but it felt like he was breathing through a straw. He got up to his feet and looked up at Jennifer. She had malice in her eyes as she stared down at the one-inch Lilliputian. She calculated her next words with care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou passed.\u201d She said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Olin coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you deaf? I said you passed. You\u2019re not dead\u2014after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Olin said to himself as he looked around in a daze. \u201cYou almost killed me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. What I did just now was part of the training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat training? Stepping on me? You wanted to kill me! You didn\u2019t know I could push you off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut now I know you can push me off, otherwise you would be red stain on the street.\u201d Jennifer adjusted her hair under her hat. \u201cWell, grab your stuff and follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Olin slung his duffel bag over his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t keep up with you.\u201d Despite his outburst, he tried to run after Jennifer. His lungs still ached as he breathed muggy air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer did an about face, pebbles grinding under her boots as she did so. \u201cYou said you were a Private right?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cWell, I\u2019m a goddamn Sergeant.\u201d Her voice thundered, shaking the one-inch Lilliputian. \u201cAnd when an NCO gives you a goddamn, lawful, order, you fucking obey, got it, <i>Private</i>?\u201d She snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate Olin snapped to attention. \u201cUnderstood, Sergeant Torrance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glimmer of satisfaction appeared on Jennifer\u2019s face as she re-composed herself. She spun around and continued walking. Olin sprinted with his heavy bag on his back, chasing his 430-foot tall Sergeant.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the longest time, the Gulliverian sergeant didn\u2019t say anything. Which was fine with Olin, because he had to run to keep up with her tremendous strides and he couldn\u2019t imagine trying to simultaneously engage in idle chitchat. Luckily, he was in excellent physical condition or otherwise he would have passed out already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sprinted along, his mind tried to process all of the changes in his life. One minute he had just been another Lilliputian soldier, destined to lead a boring, routine life (assuming that a Brobdingnagian didn\u2019t attack without warning; it was rare but it did happen from time to time. He had lost countless friends and fellow soldiers when some giant or giantess decided to destroy a major city). But now his life had been turned upside-down. He had some sort of weird powers, which was both frightening and exciting, and he had been assigned to this Gulliverian, which was just frightening. Olin could practically feel the disdain that she felt for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she read his mind, Jennifer stopped without warning. Olin didn\u2019t have time to slow down and he crashed into her left boot, just below the huge rounded mass of her ankle. Lights flashed in front of his eyes as he fell over backward. As he scrambled to pull himself up, he saw the giantess reaching down for him, her massive fingers spread wide. It was one of those images that he had nightmares about, being grabbed by a giant person, and he cried out in panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer\u2019s hand froze in its descent. It took him a minute to realize that it wasn\u2019t his cry that had made her pause. Somehow, he was holding her hand back. Even now, he could see how her enormous palm and fingers trembled, pushing against an invisible barrier. The giantess\u2019 mouth twisted in annoyance, quivering almost as much as her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. I was going to carry you inside, but I don\u2019t want to touch you, anyway,\u201d she finally said, withdrawing her hand and standing back up. She turned and marched toward a Gulliverian-sized brick building that looked utterly cheerless. It was the sort of bleak architecture that Olin associated with government buildings. He watched as she unlocked the door and disappeared inside. The last thing that he wanted to do was follow her inside but he knew that he had no other choice. Sighing, Olin trudged toward the colossal door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one step in front of the door and he carefully climbed it, using the grooves in the concrete as foot and handholds. When he pulled himself up on the top of the step, he spotted Jennifer in the doorway, her arms crossed over her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, you are so slow,\u201d she remarked. Olin purposely didn\u2019t meet her eyes as he walked past her inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, were you raised in a barn? Close the door behind you,\u201d the giantess ordered. Olin looked over his shoulder at the door, which had to be the size of a skyscraper, and then glanced up at Jennifer\u2019s scowling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSergeant Torrance, I\u2019m unable to close a door that siz\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith your powers, Private!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin focused his gaze on the door and concentrated. He inhaled deeply, clenched his fists, narrowed his eyes\u2026and nothing happened. The door was impossibly huge and he couldn\u2019t move it even a fraction of an inch. Sweat was beginning to bead on his forehead, a result of his intense concentration and the unnerving way that the giantess was glaring at him. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her mammoth arm swing out and shove the door shut with a thunderous burst of noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou. Are. Useless,\u201d she growled, inserting a pause between each word. Her eyes had become mere slits, although he still saw enough of them to notice the changeable color of the irises. One minute they were storm-gray; the next, they were deep blue or vividly green, depending on how the light hit them. Olin had never seen eyes like hers and he stared at them until she frowned. Wisely, he averted his gaze and she began to unlock the door to her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of her apartment wasn\u2019t what he expected. For some reason, he imagined her living in more spartan quarters. But this apartment was lavishly decorated, the sort of chic style that he associated with home and garden magazines. Along the wall were rows of photos of various people, which he guessed were her family and friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer took off her hat and tossed it aside. Her hair was honey-colored and framed her face in a flattering way. She would have been a beautiful woman if she wasn\u2019t so terrifying. Olin put down his duffel bag as she sat down on the couch, placing her hands on her knees and peering down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how long have you have your powers, Private?\u201d She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for very long, Sergeant Torrance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her eyebrows quirked upward. \u201cYou mean, you just found out about them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer didn\u2019t respond at first. She seemed to be considering something. Then she leaned forward, her huge face towering far above his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to train you, Private. Or kill you. One of the two,\u201d she told him coldly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Lilliputian certainly didn\u2019t look very impressive. Jennifer had seen cockroaches that were larger than he was. Yet she could feel the psychic power that he was emitting; he was practically pulsating with it. Had his height equaled his power, he would have been fifty miles tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt frightened her, frankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer\u2019s own powers were modest in comparison. She could turn on and off light-switches, levitate small objects, that sort of thing. It had been impressive when she was a child and could cause her teacups to float around her head. Her parents had been stupefied and amazed by her powers. Everyone had been, really. By the time she was an adult, she had been funneled into this clandestine program, its classification level above top secret. She had a gift and the brass intended to use it. The problem, however, was that her gift just wasn\u2019t that astonishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of being in the field, she was here, training some Lilliputian who was so small that she could have stepped on him without even knowing it. That knowledge chafed, like rubbing salt into an open wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Jennifer had to live with it for now. She had been serious about what she said\u2026either she would train the little punk or squash him and call it an accident. That was the thing about Lilliputians. They squished so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin was watching her as she took off her boots and then peeled off the socks underneath, purposely tossing one of them in his direction. The tiny man cringed and raised his arms as the mass of fabric descended on him. Then it unexpectedly flew the other way, as if caught in a strong breeze. Jennifer considered this. He hadn\u2019t been able to close the door, but he had stopped her foot and her hand and the sock. So his powers were triggered by fear and survival instincts, at least for now. She would have to remember that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer stood back up and padded toward the kitchen, deliberately stepping close enough to Olin that he leapt back to avoid her foot as it crashed down. As much as she hated to admit it, she liked how she made him tremble. The spiteful part of her enjoyed the fact that she was so much larger than he was. It almost made up for the enormous discrepancy in their telekinetic abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a skillet and then took some ground hamburger from the fridge. Olin remained in the living room, obviously reluctant to come toward her. To be honest, she was surprised that he hadn\u2019t already fled for his life. He had courage, she\u2019d give him that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first thing you need to know about these powers is how to recognize and channel the telekinetic energy. Once you can recognize that energy, you can direct it,\u201d Jennifer said to him, gesturing toward the package of hamburger. Using her own powers, she tore open the plastic and lifted up a glistening ball of meat. Olin\u2019s mouth fell open as he watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hamburger plopped into the skillet with a sharp sizzling sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsually I just eat Lilliputians for lunch,\u201d Jennifer said as she located a spatula. She noticed how rapidly Olin\u2019s face paled. \u201cHoly shit, Private. I\u2019m just joking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d he replied weakly. Neither of them said anything while she finished cooking the hamburgers and then placed them on the kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to eat?\u201d She asked as she slid onto one of the chairs. With extreme hesitance, Olin wandered into the kitchen toward her. When he reached the table, he glanced at the gargantuan table leg, then up at her. Of course he couldn\u2019t climb it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLevitate yourself, Private. That\u2019s an order,\u201d Jennifer barked. The Lilliputian flinched at the sound of her voice. Maybe it was because of the fear that he felt, but as she looked on, he began to slowly lift himself off the ground. Jennifer sucked in her breath, astounded. She certainly couldn\u2019t have done that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlin was almost to the top of the table when something happened\u2026perhaps he doubted himself and the hold that he had over his powers faltered, but he suddenly started to plummet to the floor below. Jennifer reacted instantaneously, her hand shooting out to catch him. He bounced on her palm and then lay there, motionless. Concerned, Jennifer prodded at him with one finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, Private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Olin stirred on her outstretched palm, looking dazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he mumbled and she grinned broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Because your training\u2019s not over yet.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olin nearly screamed as Jennifer tilted her palm and he started plummeting. He dropped towards her burger, the soft bun breaking his fall. Breathing heavily, he just laid there, not sure how much of this he was going to be able to take. Ever since he discovered his powers he\u2019d been terrified for his life. He wasn\u2019t a very brave or tough man, for a solider he was kind of a wimp. He almost didn\u2019t want to sit up, but he did and immediately regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d move if I were you, private,\u201d Jennifer remarked as she held the burger in front of her face and then opened wide. Olin nearly screamed when he saw the inside of her mouth. The gleaming teeth, twitching tongue and pink, wet walls, an entire squadron could fit inside her maw and he was heading right into the yawning cavern. She really was going to eat him!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking he flew backwards, away from the hungry mouth just before she bit down. He skid along the bun until he flew off and began falling again, luckily he managed to slow his decent enough that when he crashed he didn\u2019t break anything. Shaken, he peered up as Jennifer chomped down on the spot he\u2019d been lying on. If he\u2019d been one-second slower she would have eaten him. She chewed her meal slowly, glancing down at the private with a bored expression. He had survived so far, but things were only going to get tougher and the more she saw him freak out the less convinced she was that he had what it took to be a good solider. If he didn\u2019t learn to keep his cool he was going to be a red splotch on the sole of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry?\u201d She asked before lowered the burger down to the table beside where he had landed. Looking at the house sized burger, Olin stomach growled, reminding him that he hadn\u2019t eaten anything since yesterday. For so long he had only had to eat the tasteless army food provided for him in the mess hall. He couldn\u2019t even remember the last time he had eaten something that didn\u2019t taste like crap. Licking his lips he took a tentative step towards the meal, but stopped when Jennifer picked it back up and took another bite. Once more the burger was back on the table, but he was no longer as certain he wanted to get closer. If he tried to climb up and grab some hamburger meat she might lift the burger back up and take another bite, possibly eating him too. It might be safer to just wait for her to get finished and eat whatever crumbs are left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you hungry? You're going to need all the energy you can get for training, so eat up.\u201d Jennifer then grabbed the burger and took another bite as though to mock the Lilliputian man. Olin remained still, unwilling to risk his life to fill his belly. His refusal to follow orders got him an annoyed grunt from the sergeant. \u201cUse your abilities to feed yourself. Rip a piece of my hamburger free for yourself before I finish or you\u2019re not eating tonight, got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, he nodded and focused on the burger after she took yet another bite. He had to move fast or she\u2019d finish it. He was still trying to figure out how to use his abilities, most of the time he just used pure instinct and when he tried to focus his powers he often failed. Too bad there wasn\u2019t an instruction manual for using psychic powers, because he could really use one right now. Or maybe it would help if his teacher wasn\u2019t a sadistic, bitch that nearly killed him the first time they met. Of course he\u2019d never say that out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFocus, focus,\u201d he repeated as he tried to picture a piece of that hamburger meat tearing. He almost thought he had it, he could see a tiny piece coming loose, but then Jennifer grabbed the burger up and took another bite, ruining his concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPathetic,\u201d she complained with her mouth full. A few chewed up bits of hamburger flew from her mouth, splattering on the table. For one dark second, Olin considered picking up a chunk of drool covered meat and eating that instead, but quickly tossed that thought aside. That was too pathetic, even for him. He wasn\u2019t some loser; he was just scared and confused by everything that had happened. He didn\u2019t even know people had powers like his until he killed that terrorist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not pathetic,\u201d he told himself as he concentrated again as the burger came down. He grit his teeth and focused his mind on tearing a sizeable chunk out before it was pulled away. He wanted this, needed this. He was going to show the Gulliverian he wasn\u2019t some bug that she could just step on, that he was a solider, a man!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought a chunk of brown, cooked meat flew towards him so hard that it smacked him in the chest and knocked him over. Humiliated again, he still laughed as he hugged his meal to his chest. He had done it, just barely but he\u2019d done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations, you pulled off a trick I learned when I was ten, you should be very proud of yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer\u2019s sarcastic response did nothing to dampen Olin\u2019s spirits. It was just a small feat, but he had consciously done it, proving he could control his new powers. It gave him a momentary happiness and sense that maybe he could fully governor his abilities and be more then just a faceless Lilliputian private in an army of millions. He could make something of himself and show the sergeant that he was worth a damn.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Olin bit into his hamburger it was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted. Maybe it was because he used his powers to get it or maybe it was because he\u2019d been eating mess hall crap for over a year, whatever the reason was he savoured every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get cocky yet, private, we still have more training before we call it a night.\u201d Jennifer had finished her burger and had cleaned up as her student finished his meal. For someone that had just learned about his gift he was learning fast, faster then she did at least. She tried not to feel jealous, remind herself how puny the private was, but when she saw him show her up she just wanted to flatten him and tell her superiors it was an accident. However, she was a professional and no matter how irritating it was that a man no bigger then a bug was replacing her she wouldn\u2019t do anything to defy her orders, unless he was unfit for duty. The army didn\u2019t need a coward or weakling. If he wasn\u2019t capable of surviving her training then he didn\u2019t deserve to live.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olin stands on the table watching Jennifer clean up their meal or as she would call it his latest test. He didn\u2019t know what his training was going to be like, but if it was as nerve racking as the so called snatch and grab hamburger challenge he just went through, then he feared for the future. If their was one thing that Olin was sure of, it would be that, one Jennifer hated him, and two this so called training could cost him his life, for Jennifer already explained that she would either train him or kill him, with a smile on her face Olin presumed.<br>\r\nOlin lost in thought didn\u2019t see the gigantic hand coming towards him. Jennifer grabbing Olin brings him up to her gigantic face. \u201cHop to private, being distracted could cost you your life!\u201d Jennifer yells almost bursting Olin\u2019s ear drums. \u201c I hope your ready private, the real training begins now.\u201d Jennifer says  tightening her grip to the point that Olin could hardly breath. Jennifer slowly brings the arm holding Olin back and then with Half of her strength, throws Olin towards the hard floor. \u201cOW MY GOD!\u201d Olin shouts as he falls towards certain death. Owen closes his eyes waiting for the end to come, but as he waited and waited for almost a minute, to his confusion he did not feel the hard impact of the floor nor did he feel pain or a threat to his life, instead he felt calm as if he was child in his mother\u2019s embrace.<br>\r\nOwen opens his eyes and he sees the floor a few feet below him. Olin to his surprise was floating in the air but unlike before, when he needed to concentrate hard, this time it almost came so natural, that was what he would\u2019ve said if he could keep it up, because as soon as Olin became aware of his power he fell to the ground with a hard thud. Jennifer was in complete shock, she expected that throw to kill the little insect but here he was still alive, still her problem. \u201cDon\u2019t rest yet maggot.\u201d Jennifer said seething with anger as she stomps toward Olin with earth shaking steps. Olin sitting on the floor was at this moment terrified of this women, she was really trying to kill him. \u201cYour training for today is to survive for 1 hour as I try to stomp the life out of you, think of this as cat and mouse.\u201d Jennifer said lifting her right foot and wiggling her giant toes. \u201cI would get up if I where you private.\u201d Jennifer said slowly lowering her foot toward Olin who was still upon in complete shock. <br>\r\nOlin snapping out of his trance starts to realize his situation. Olin seeing a gigantic foot coming towards him puts his hands up and starts to scream, deep down Olin knew that his hands, and his meager strength would not be able to stop the building sized foot from squishing him, but he also knew it was to late to get up and run at this point, all he could do was face death once again. Jennifer meant every word that she said, she was going to kill him. Jennifer didn\u2019t see Olin try to run away, and could only assume that he was to terrified to do so, even though she was going easy on the little man at first, by lowering her foot slowly, giving the maggot  enough time to escape. \u201cPathetic\u201d Jennifer thought as she lowered her foot all the way to the ground.<br>\r\nJennifer, upon lowering her foot to the floor didn\u2019t feel The tiny body of the insect that called itself Olin squish Beneath her gigantic feet. This confused her she new she had to have gotten him. Jennifer sees something move in the corner of her left eye, turning her head she sees Olin sitting on the floor looking at her in shock, fear, and confusion. Jennifer knew that once again the maggot used his powers subconsciously to protect himself, since the maggot was to afraid to move on his own, his powers acted on their own and moved him to a safe place, and did so, so fast she couldn\u2019t see the act in progress. Jennifer hated to say or even think it but the maggots powers where amazing. \u201cit\u2019s not over yet private.\u201d Jennifer says running towards him with the full intention to kill.<br>\r\nFor a half an hour Jennifer has been trying to step on Olin and for half a hour Olin\u2019s powers have protected him subconsciously, moving him away from danger. Owen at this point was able to find the strength to run, but compared to a person hundreds of feet tall running after him he didn\u2019t make it far. Owen still terrified felt something else, in the pit of his chest, something he hadn't felt in a long time, anger. Olin was pretty much a laid back guy, he didn\u2019t get angry, it was more like he couldn\u2019t get angry because deep down he knew if he let his rage take over something bad was going to happen, his very instincts warned him of the danger, but right Olin didn\u2019t care. He had been pushed around by this women for long enough and he had, had it. Olin stops running, and stands completely still.<br>\r\nJennifer sees Olin stop his meager attempts to run away from her, and to her confusion stand completely still. Jennifer could sense something was wrong. The maggots powers were dangerously high and wild like a wild animal. The maggots body was glowing a azure blue color high was evident to her that Olin\u2019s powers had fully manifested them self's. Jennifer stopped running toward the maggot and stared in disbelief at the one inch man that now she feared. <br>\r\nOlin slowly turns and faces Jennifer, with eyes glowing bright blue. Olin\u2019s power starts to surround his body  fueling him with ground breaking power, power he didn\u2019t know how to use or control, but at this point he didn\u2019t care, all Olin saw was the enemy, a target he wanted to destroy. <br>\r\n\u201cMonster.\u201d \u201cWhat is that child\u201d \u201cget away from us you freak.\u201d Olin started to hear voices echo throughout his head. The screams of women and their children started to invade his ears, and with a flash of pain that attacks his mind he sees a young boy, a boy in a white t- shirt and wearing black Nicky shorts. Olin soon realized that this young boy was him no older than 8 years old. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Olin said grabbing his throbbing head. Olin saw his 8 year old self surrounded by women who looked to be school teachers and children who were to afraid to come near him. Some of these other children where beat up, and had scratches and bruises all over their body. Olin soon realized that this place was the elementary school he attended all those years ago, but what really shocked him was that the desks, books and pencils and papers started to float off the ground. Olin could tell that his 8 year old self was the cause of the phenomena and also that this child was pissed off,  he was probably even more angry than Olin was right at this moment. \u201c don\u2019t call me that.... I\u2019m not a monster!!!!\u201d 8 year old Olin screams. The vision starts to shift away from the school and Olin sees his 8 years old self being hugged by a man he did not recognize. \u201cIt okay to be angry my boy, but it\u2019s not okay to hurt people because of that anger, promise me you will never let your anger control you.\u201d The man said in a gentle voice. \u201cOk I promise.\u201d The 8 year old Olin says \u201cHey dad, am I a monster?\u201d The 8 year old Olin asks with tears in his eyes. The man looks at the young boy and smiles \u201cNo your a perfectly normal boy Olin.\u201d <br>\r\nThe vision ends and Olin comes to, Olin\u2019s headache was gone and his rage had vanished as quickly as it had appeared. \u201cWhat had happen, who was that man, why did I call him dad?\u201d Olin had so many questions, but something snapped him out of his train of thought, Olin noticed something that took his breath away. The ground was ripped apart, the furniture was everywhere, the few windows the building had where smashed, the hole building was trashed and even the brick walls where filled with cracks and looked to be unstable, but what really shocked Olin was that Jennifer looked beat up, she looked to be surrounded in some kind of force field but she was still covered in scratches and her uniform was ripped in certain places, and her long hair was no longer tied neatly in a bun but hung loose past her shoulders.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I done.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>1 PERSON (Olin) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days had passed since I had lost control of my powers, or to be exact three days had passed since I almost destroyed Jennifer\u2019s home. Ever since that day Jennifer has been avoiding me like the plague. Beside\u2019s the usually names that she calls me when we cross each other\u2019s paths like maggot, insect, privet, or little man, she barely takes even a little time out of her day to truly talk to me, \u201csorry if it\u2019s so hard.\u201d Jennifer would just ignore me and watch the news off of her flat screen TV, or read one of her books that she kept on a large wooden shelf, that dwarfed almost every Lilliputian structure ever made. We apparently were taking a little break when it came to training, I didn\u2019t Blame her for not wanting to teach me, I almost killed her, if Jennifer hadn\u2019t put up her force filled in time she would\u2019ve died or been severely injured. Honestly though I think the thing that was most injured was her pried, I of course would never tell her this to her face, I still had a Intrust in living, but that would explain why her attitude seemed to get even worse when it came to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI truly was the bane to Jennifer\u2019s existence, she made that clear when ever we were around each other. One time when Jennifer was sitting on her black leather couch watching TV, I wanted to watch TV with her but their was only one problem I was to small to sit down on the couch. I tried to climb to the top of the couch to sit down but their was not enough nooks and crannies to aid me in my climb. Despite my struggle Jennifer didn\u2019t help me, instead she just looked down at me with a smug smile on her face. I didn\u2019t dare use my powers to try to help me, I didn\u2019t know how they would react, so long story short I wasn\u2019t watching TV. Other times Jennifer would knock me over with her building sized feet when she passed me, like I didn\u2019t already have enough trouble standing up from all the earthquakes Jennifer generated when she walked, and every meal I would have to use my powers to steal from Jennifer, so that I could eat, just like we did, the first day I moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent most of my time in my room, which was Gulliverian size so I had a lot of space. I could only bring a few things from base camp so, yea I had a lot of space.  It was currently night time so I was getting ready to dose off to sleep, I stopped my self when I heard talking in the room on the other side of my wall. The voice belonged to Jennifer, she sounded like she was on the phone with somebody, the question was who. I couldn\u2019t make out much, the only words that I heard was that \u201che was not ready.\u201d These words came from Jennifer who sounded in destress, if I didn\u2019t know any better she might of been talking about me, no it couldn\u2019t be Jennifer would never sound even a little bit worried about me, the man she despised. But if she was talking about me, then what was I not ready for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole night I could not fall asleep. My life seemed to be falling apart. Fist my superiors send me to the boot camp from hell to train with satan herself, who could crush me with nothing but her baby toe, now they where making even more plains behind my back. If their was one thing I hated, it was when people decide how I\u2019m going to live my life, and not even consult me about it at all. The more I thought about it the more pissed off I got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBang\u201d the door bust open and Jennifer starts walking in with booming foot steps. Jennifer wore nothing but skin tight white Nicky boxers that really showed off her smooth tan legs, and a white t-shirt left little to the imagination, her gigantic boobs pushing up against the white t-shirt outlined her huge nipples, and her thin belly was also displayed proofing that the T-shirt was to small for her. I couldn\u2019t help but blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet your ass up maggot we need to talk.\u201d Jennifer says bending down and forcefully picking me up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile holding me in my fleshy prison Jennifer takes me to the kitchen counter and without warning drops me hard on its marble surface. I swear I will never get use to that, nor will I ever get use to how ruff Jennifer handles me. Jennifer to my surprise bends down until I am eye level with her gigantic face. She just stood their looking at me with her blue eyes that seemed to be able to peer into my soul. I just stared back at her feeling uncomfortable. It seemed to last a hour until finally she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir has been a change of plains insect.\u201d Jennifer says standing up to her fool height and Turing around, giving me a fool view to her giant sized ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour training will not be held here, you will receive your training somewhere else. Jennifer said still having her back turned from me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, now where am I supposed to go.\u201d I said a little attitude evident in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer turns quickly turns around and stairs at me from high above. The wind generated from her simple action knocks me off my feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind your tone when you talk to me insect.\u201d Jennifer says with a voice that vibrates not only the marble counter that I\u2019m on, but also my soul as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was back, the feeling of anger appeared in my chest. I was tired of this, tired of people deciding things for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been watching my tone, no more, I\u2019m tired of being your toy!\u201d I yelled, not caring who I was talking to. I stood on my feet like a man and walked towards Jennifer. The kitchen counter only came up to Jennifer\u2019s exposed belly so I wasn\u2019t as intimidating as I believed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it Jennifer had snatched me up in her hand again. Only my hapless was visible so I couldn\u2019t move, and if Jennifer kept on tightening her grip then soon I wouldn\u2019t be able to breath ether. Jennifer slowly brings me up to her face, which wore a stern look, as her blue eyes where focused on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are stressed I understand that, but you will not talk to me like that again. Jennifer said in a low quit voice that made her seem even more scary than she already was. \u201cDo I make my self clear?\u201d She asked, her eyes not leaving my puny form, even for a second. I said nothing, because I was afraid and also because I could hardly breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR!!!!\u201d  Jennifer yelled almost destroying my ear drums and blowing a whole windstorm in my face, ruffling up my hair and draining all of the rage out of my body. Her breath smelled like alcohol, which let me know that she had been drinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes I understand.\u201d I said with a fearful tone. Apron hearing my answer Jennifer sets me back down on the kitchen counter, and bends down to meet my gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will be going to <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>1st PERSON (Olin)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Jennifer had left our little home in the desert, I wasn\u2019t happy to be moving so soon especially when I just moved in to that cheerless brick building, but Jennifer made it clear that my compliance wasn\u2019t a factor. In all truth and honesty I think that Jennifer was more upset than me, I could tell seeing how she would glare at me, and how she gave off a pissed off vibe, that made it clear to all who saw her, Lilliputian and Gulliverian alike, to stay away from her. I felt bad I mean Jennifer\u2019s place was a dump yes, but it was clear from the flat screen TV and the nice furniture that she had made a life their, and now she was going to leave that life to go to Brobdingnag with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Jennifer got on a Gulliverian plane that was set to fly us to Brobdingnag. Jennifer and I were wearing our navy uniforms and even though she really didn\u2019t want to Jennifer decided to carry me in her giant right hand, at least until we got to our seats. Jennifer didn\u2019t hold me tightly like she usually would, in fact she had her right hand open so that I could sit comfortably in the middle of her palm. I couldn\u2019t help but notice the details that made up Jennifer\u2019s hand. I could feel how rough Jennifer\u2019s hands was as I rubbed my hand up against hers, I felt the ridges that made up her finger prints and was amazed how small I was compared to her, and not just her but everyone and everything. I was in Gulliverian territory, in all my life I have never seen so many giant people, and now I am going to Brobdingnag were the people are even more gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing maggot?\u201d Jennifer asked as she looked down at me. I immediately stopped rubbing her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d I said with wide eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at our seats Jennifer drops me on the seat closes to the window. The fall wasn\u2019t that long but upon contact with the cushion I went tumbling. The back of the seat stopped my fall. I stood on my feet and looked at Jennifer who sat down in the chair next to me. Jennifer was looking down on me with a smug smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I said sarcastically, which caused Jennifer to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down in a chair that was hundreds of times bigger than me. Could this be anymore ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st PERSON (Jennifer) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hated this, I hated him. Ever since this insect, came into my life, everything seemed to turn bad to worse. Ever since the merging of the armed forces of the three great powers, which were Brobdingnag, Gulliveria, and Lilliput I had lived a life of simplicity. My Powers made me a valuable asset to my people, and of course a secret weapon to the Lilliputians. My powers gave me the ability to read the minds of my targets, with my powers I defended the treaty of the three great powers from all those who sought to do it harm, the treaty that was named the Trinity Accords. These accords embodied peace between the three races, peace for the world. It was my job to protect this peace with my powers, but now everything had changed. The powers that I had pride in, where nothing compared to this insect, that only made me hate him more. As I sat in my seat I couldn\u2019t help but think back to that day when this insect had almost killed me. I had to put up a force field to protect myself, doing so took a lot out of me. It took me days to regain my full strength. How, how could this 1 inch man be so powerful, a man who was smaller than my pinky, who I could swallow whole, I just couldn\u2019t understand it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Jennifer?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at the little maggot who dared to say my name so familiarly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want.\u201d I said with a stern tone that caused the little man to flinch ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I, I just wanted to say sorry.\u201d The maggot said with a soft tone as he looked down at his cries crossed legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for what, being a pain in my ass.\u201d I said looking away from the little maggot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, and for making you leave your home for me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but stair at the maggot with a gentler look. What was with this guy, I had treated him like dirt and here he was apologizing to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Olin, I\u2019m just doing what a solider must, I\u2019m just doing my duty.\u201d I said reverting my gaze once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was I being such a jerk to this guy. I had never treated anyone with such disdain like I treated Olin. I didn\u2019t hate Lilliputian\u2019s, in fact I treated them like they were my equals, in my line of work I was around Lilliputians a lot so why, was it this Lilliputian that brought out the worst in me. I kind of felt guilty, I had not acted like a  Professional solider. I had to be stern but I didn\u2019t have to act like a jerk. I wanted to apologize to him but when it came to feelings, I was not a expert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st PERSON (Olin) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid I hear right, did she just call me Olin, not maggot, or insect, I mean Jennifer rarely called me solider, but calling me by my name, mind blown. Maybe this was proof that our relationship was growing. I thought about our so called relationship, throughout the entire flight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 8 hours for us to reach Brobdingnag. Jennifer picked me up, gently which once again surprised me and we made our way off the plane. While i sat in Jennifer\u2019s hand I looked at my surroundings with wide eyes. I thought Jennifer was big but compared to a Brobdingnagian she was nothing. Brobdingnagian after Brobdingnagian walked by Jennifer creating seismic earthquakes with their footsteps. Earthquakes that shook me and Jennifer to our core. As a Brobdingnagian walked by they created raging winds that would have killed me if Jennifer hadn\u2019t shielded me with her hand. I didn\u2019t know she cared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer recovered our luggage and with me in her hands walked out of the airport. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that Jennifer was looking for something or someone as she walked out the airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you looking for Jennifer?\u201d I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe military was suppose to send someone to pick us up. A old friend of mine you could say.\u201d Jennifer said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh their she is.\u201d Jennifer said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer walked toward a unknown destination. I assumed that she had found her old friend. After a few minutes had passed she had finally stopped walking. I couldn\u2019t recognize anything Jennifer was moving to fast and everything was to big for my sense to perceive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie down here!\u201d Jennifer shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Jennifer who was looking up at something else. Connie? who\u2019s Connie? All of a sudden my body was struck with a huge amount of G-force that pined me to the ground which was Jennifer\u2019s hand. The G-force soon vanished and I was able to stand on my own two feet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d I shouted with a little bit of Panic in my voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, my friend.\u201d Jennifer said with a smile totally ignoring me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer\u2019s hand starts to shake and thunder echoes across the sky, which was weird seeing, how their were no clouds in the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea I got him he\u2019s right here on my hand.\u201d Jennifer says to a unknown person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho the hell was she talking to? I thought, then I notices something that caught my attention. Someone was watching me. I turned around and saw something that took my breath away, a 300 foot blue eye was staring right at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ!!!!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Olin 1st person)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave you ever wondered what you would do if you stood before god, what you would say, I ask because I was standing right in front of one and I needed ideas. I standing in front of 300 foot giant blue eye, is to afraid to move even a inch. The eye seemed to be staring right at me with its intense gaze, a gaze that was to overwhelming for me to comprehend. The eye not only dwarfed me but also completely dwarfed Jennifer as well. Well ma I was no longer in Kansas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you scared him.\u201d Jennifer says giggling, creating small vibrations that lightly shook me back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to Jennifer and see her staring at me with a smile on her face. It was always good to see that Jennifer found pleasure in my torment. I soon realize while looking at Jennifer, that on top of her head she was wearing a headset, which explained how she was able to converse with a Brobdingnagian. I remembered that I had also packed a headset in my luggage, and with great hast took it out and put on so that I could hear Connie\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH NO I HOPE I DIDN'T SCARE THE LITTLE GUY.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was powerful and filled with enough force to shatter my body a thousand times over, this was Connie\u2019s voice. To think that a few days ago I honestly thought that Jennifer was the strongest being on the planet, compared to this girl Jennifer was nothing but a bug, and me, less than dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI CANT SEE HIM, IS HE ALRIGHT?\u201d Connie asks sounding generally concerned. Which was a good change of pace, from the usual hate and wrath that I get from Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine, I bet he\u2019s just scared of your gigantic size.\u201d Jennifer says with another giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH IM NOT THAT BIG AM I.\u201d Connie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie your ginormous, especially to a Lilliputian.\u201d Jennifer said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looks at me with a stone cold look that warned me that she was about to give me a nonnegotiable order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up and introduce your self soldier.\u201d Jennifer demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately stand up straight and salute the gigantic 300ft eye right in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrivate Olin Kane reporting for duty ma\u2019am.\u201d I say into my headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH I CAN HEAR YOU.\u201d Connie says in a surprise voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cITS NICE TO MEET YOU PRIVATE OLIN, IM PRIVATE FIRST CLASS CONNIE PIERCE.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie Pierce so that\u2019s her name. I thought as I continue to look into her gigantic blue eye. She was a Private First Class the same as Jennifer, that meant that she was one rank higher than me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie what are you doing?\u201d Jennifer asks above me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSALUTING OF COURSE, TO SHOW RESPECT.\u201d Connie says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know he can\u2019t see you saluting right, he\u2019s to small to make out your entire eye let alone your entire face.\u201d Jennifer said, not trying to spare my feelings even a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH RIGHT, OLIN IS THIS BETTER?\u201d Connie asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she mean? I thought not sure as to what she was talking about. Then I notice something. My surroundings were moving, slowly but surely. I soon realized what Connie was doing she was moving her hand away from her face. Connie\u2019s massive eye began to shrink as I grew further and further away from it. I soon was able to make out two eyes, then a nose, a mouth, and soon her whole entire moon sized face, with her hand at the top of her hand performing the biggest salute I had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea that\u2019s much better.\u201d I said looking amazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGLAD YOU THINK SO, WELL WE AHOULD GET GOING, CAPTAIN JANE WANTS TO HAVE A WORD WITH THE BOTH OF YOU TWO.\u201d Connie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath my feet began to abruptly shake. It shook with such a ferocity that I could no longer stand on my own two feet. I somehow knew from instinct that this earthquake was not coming from Connie. I look behind me, and notice Jennifer, who had a scared look on her face. Sweat big enough to  soak me was running down her forehead, Jennifer looked like she had seen the scariest monster in the world. She seems to be terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have to see the captain right now?\u201d Jennifer asked with a shaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSORRY JENNIFER SHE ORDERED ME TO BRING YOU BOTH TO HER AS SOON AS YOU GOT OFF THE PLANE.\u201d Connie said with a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to look at Jennifer who continued to wear a look of worry, who in the world was this captain  that had Jennifer terrified of her very name. Usually this would have been the greatest day in my life, seeing Jennifer scared shitless, by someone more powerful than her, but I didn\u2019t feel happy, because I had to meet this so called captain as well. I could barley survive Jennifer who was a Gulliverian, I doubted that I could survive a Brobdingnagian, who made Jennifer look like a scared child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take us long to reach Brobdingnagian HQ, which was the biggest building I had ever seen. Brobdingnagian HQ rested in the middle of Brobdingnag, Connie told me that it was 50 floors high, and also that their where even bigger buildings in Brobdingnagian. I had to admit it, Brobdingnag was a outstanding place, even the smallest building totally dwarfed our Tallest Lilliputian skyscraper by miles, the same could be said for the people as well who were bigger than our tallest mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie brings Jennifer and I inside the humongous building. Connie gets inside a elevator that brings us to the top floor of the whole building. Apparently the captains office was on the highest floor. I simply sat in the palm of Jennifer\u2019s mile long  hand, who sat in the palm of Connie\u2019s mile long hand. I took a glance at Jennifer and noticed that she was still sweating, still scared. I wanted to help her but I was scared as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Connie stood in front of a wooden door thousands of miles long. Connie knocks on the door three times, creating a deafening sound that echoes through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCOME IN.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud voice Emanates from behind the door. Connie without hesitation opens the door, revealing a office miles and miles long. The office was fairly clean, and smells rather nice. The Captains office had white walls with a few pictures decorated on each wall. In the middle of the room was a tall glass table with 4 chairs surrounding it, and at the back of the office was a mile long wooden desk with a women sitting on top of it with her legs crossed. The wall behind the women wasn\u2019t a wall at all but a long glass window, revealing the night city in all its glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the gigantic women, and I could tell without a doubt this was captain Jane. Captain Jane had brown hair which was held together by a brown hair clip on top of her head, she had white skin, and on her right cheek rested a scare 100s of miles long, from my  perspective, but to her it seemed to only be a few inches, so not a big deal. Captain Jane wore a long sleeved military button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to her elbows, she also wore military terrain pants, which had a lot of pockets, but it went well with her military boots. Captain Jane radiated leadership and confidents. Captan Jane also wore a headset on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Jane  looked right at Connie, Jennifer, and I with a smile on her face. Her brown eyes seemed to be staring at me with great intensity. But that couldn\u2019t be possible I was to small to be spotted that far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELCOME TO BROBDINGNAG.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author notes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope you liked the story, their was not much action in this story but I promise their will be action soon. Please help me continue this story can\u2019t do it by myself. Thanks again for reading <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the Prophet <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Olin 1st person) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir I was surrounded by three titanic women, Jennifer who was a Gulliverian, Connie who was a colossal Brobdingnagian, and captain Jane herself, who was also a Brobdingnagian, but a Brobdingnagian that made Connie and Jennifer utterly terrified, and these were women who totally had dwarfed me in size, and power. As I sat in Jennifer\u2019s hand, who in turn sat in Connie\u2019s hand, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of women was Captain Jennifer. Gazing upon the captains mile high form, I couldn\u2019t help but think that the captain was a very beautiful women, just like Jennifer, and Connie, but I still didn\u2019t let my guard down, because even a beautiful rose had thorns, and a Brobdingnagians thorns would utterly impale me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE HAVE A SEAT.\u201d Captain Jane said as she walked over to the glass table with earth shaking footsteps and seats in one of the monolithic chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy surroundings once again started to become blurry as Connie moved towards the glass table, and without warning Jennifer\u2019s hand started to wobble and shake, as Connie sat down at the glass table. I soon realized that Jennifer had fallen down, and that was the cause for the sudden quakes that kept me on my ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie puts Jennifer down on the table, and Jennifer puts me down on the glass table as well. In my eyes the glass table went on for miles and miles, I could barley see the edge. Looking forward  a few hundred miles away I saw captain jane who\u2019s upper body towered over me with great ease. Her eyes where really fixed on my location, could she really see me? I looked behind me to see Jennifer who\u2019s right foot was a few inches away from me. She wasn\u2019t looking at me, she was looking at captain Jane with nothing but  fear. Right above Jennifer I saw the towering form of Connie who cast both me and jennifer into her shadow. The table came up to both Connie\u2019s and captain Jennifers  stomachs, so I got a good view of both of their breasts that were their own mountain ranges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJENNIFER, ITS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN LITTLE ONE.\u201d Captain Jane said looking at Jennifer with a giant smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see her teeth, teeth that were bigger than the whole Lilliputian base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s g, good to see you again Captain Jane.\u201d Jennifer stuttered like she was a lost for words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Jennifer I could tell that she was embarrassed, especially when she shot me a look that pretty much said \u201cif you ever mention this to anyone, I\u2019ll devour you whole.\u201d When me and Jennifer lived together alone I had got that look a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Jennifer 1st person) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the last situation  I wanted to be in, being surrounded by Brobdingnagian. People who dwarfed me entirely. It was in this kind of situation that aloud me to understand how a Lilliputian felt when they came face to face with a Gulliverian. I looked down at Olin and wondered how did these people, who were gigantic to me, look to someone so small like him. I would have to ask him later, after I leave the  presence of the devil herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO LITTLE ONE, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?\u201d Captain Jane says as she looks down at me with a amused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hated how she called me little one, so demeaning, captain Jane always knew how much I hated that nickname, that\u2019s why she always made sure to call me, little one,  when ever she got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been well.\u201d I said with a little irritation in my voice, looking away feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow have you been captain?\u201d I ask, even though I really didn\u2019t care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH IVE BEEN WELL, ITS BEEN GETTING BUSY OVER HERE, BUT STILL NOTHING I CANT TAKE CARE OF.\u201d Captain Jane says still looking at me with that smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s just great.\u201d I say with a fake smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAND YOU MUST BE PRIVATE OLIN KANE.\u201d Captain Jane said turning her attention away from me and to Olin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Olin 1st person) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great now the gigantic goddess was talking to me directly. That was the last thing I wanted. From captain janes conversation with Jennifer I could tell that she was a playful type of person. But what did that mean when it came to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am private Olin Kane at your service.\u201d I said trying to prevent my voice from cracking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT IS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU PRIVOT.\u201d captain Jane says with a sexy voice that almost turned me on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD YET MY NAME IS JANE, JANE CRAWFORD, BUT EVERYONE JUST CALLS ME CAPTION JANE.\u201d Captain Jane says in a ground shaking voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you ma\u2019am.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIF THEIR IS ONE THING I LOVE IS A TINY MAN WITH MANNERS.\u201d Captain Jane says with a little moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh thank you ma\u2019am. I said blushing a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel the table start to vibrate, turning around I see Jennifer staring at me with a irritated look, tapping her giant foot with her arms crossed. Was she pissed with me. Looking passed Jennifer I see the mile long face of Connie with the same irritated look on her face, as she brought her moon sized face closer to the table. Connie\u2019s face filled up my whole entire sky, I could feel her breath blow through my hair as she breathed. What was her problem now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL I GOT TO SAY, IT IS SURPRISING TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE WITH THE SAME POWER AS JENNIFER, ESPECIALLY SOME ONE WHO IS AS HANDSOME AS YOU.\u201d Captain Jane says leaning closer to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can see me?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I would look like, less than a speck of dust to someone as big as you guys. I stayed a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH YOU DO, BUT YOU LILLIPUTIAN SUPERIORS SENT OVER A PICTURE OF YOU A FEW DAYS AGO.\u201d Captain Jane said showing me a picture of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to say the picture that captain Jane showed me of myself, was the biggest picture of myself I had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI GOT TO SAY YOU ARE A HANDSOME MAN, DON\u2019T YOU AGREE CONNIE?\u201d captain Jane asked looking towards Connie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes including mine, where on Connie. I could see Connie look at captain Jane with a little surprise, than she fixed her titanic eyes in me. Her white skin soon turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI,I,I THINK THAT HE IS QUITE A HANDSOME MAN.\u201d Connie says to my surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie soon turns her mile long face away from my direction. Was she embarrassed? Once again I glance at Jennifer, damn she looked more pissed off than before. The hell was her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thank you captain Jane, and you to Connie, but I\u2019m not that handsome.\u201d I say into my headset rubbing my head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH DON\u2019T BE SO MODEST.\u201d Captain Jane says with a little laugh that shakes the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when it comes to my powers, I was surprise to see that i had powers as well, powers a lot stronger than Jennifer\u2019s.\u201d I said looking at Jennifer who gasped at my little comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little!\u201d Jennifer says stomping towards me, I could practically smell the anger coming off of her, and her booming foots steps always made it impossible for me to stand up and run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJENNIFER CALM DOWN, DON\u2019T HURT THE LITTLE GUY.\u201d Captain Jane says,  Imprisoning Jennifer in a mile long fleshy prison, that was her hand. Captain Jane was also laughing at my commit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH I LIKE THE SPONK IN THIS ONE.\u201d Captain Jane said in between laughs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL LITTLE MAN HOU WILL BE ABLE TO PROVE YOURSELF DURING TRAINING, I FOR ONE HOPE THAT YOU SURVIVE THE EXPERIENCE.\u201d Captain Jane said with another gigantic smile, as she still held Jennifer in her right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was staring at me with a angered look, the kind of look that told me that she wanted to take me apart. I let out a little sigh because I knew I was going to have to deal with her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this was what I was dealing with, Captain sexy Jane the Brobdingnagian who seemed to love to mess with me, Jennifer the Gulliverian who wanted to kill me and Connie the other Brobdingnagian who was also irritated at me for some reason. I swear the giant women in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever figure out the mystery\u2019s of giant women. \ud83d\ude09<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as we where done talking to Captain Jane Connie picked both me and Jennifer up in her mile long hand and walked out of Captain Janes office that seems to stretch all the way to infinity. Before Connie completely walked out the door, I turned and looked at Captain Jane, who in turn was looking at me with a smile on her moon sized face, and as a final farewell gave me a  seductive wave. It never ceased to be amazing, how she could see my minuscule form from such a distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a women.\u201d I said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say something private?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI break away from my train of thought and look up at Jennifer, who\u2019s hand I was currently in right now. Jennifer\u2019s eyes where like daggers, daggers that pierced my very flesh as she stared at me. I, having lived with Jennifer for quite a while could tell that she was pissed at me. I was going to get it tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you little bastard you think you can beat me do ya.\u201d Jennifer said closing me in a fleshy grip that kept on getting tighter and tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind for our next training session.\u201d Jennifer said bringing me up to her gigantic face as she smiled at me with threatening eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK CONNIE GO EASY ON THE LITTLE GUY.\u201d Connie says from up above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHES GOING TO NEED ALL OF HIS ENERGY FOR THE TRAINING THAT AWAITS HIM.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t like the sound of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer soon opens her hand back up, allowing me to breath again as I was on all fours gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW, what training what am I going to do?\u201d I asked feeling a little bit worried as I looked at Jennifer\u2019s face from up above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer stairs down at me and lets out a little giggle that vibrates the very landscape which was her hand. Whenever Jennifer was happy it was never good for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets just say that the training you are going to go through here is nothing compared to the training you are going to experience here.\u201d Jennifer says with a smile that showed her building sized teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran up my spine as both Jennifer and Connie where giggling with so much earthshaking glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL I WONT LIE TO YOU OLIN THE TRAINING WILL BE HARD, BUT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER YOU WILL BE LIVING WITH GIGANTIC WOMEN WHILE YOU ARE HERE TRAINING.\u201d Connie says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome again?\u201d I ask not sure I heard what I heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU WILL BE LIVING WITH THE OTHER BROBDINGNAGIAN WOMEN, SICE YOU ARE JENNIFERS RESPONSIBILITY YOU WILL HAVE TI BE WITH HER AT ALL TIMES WHILE YOU ARE HERE.\u201d Connie says as she lifted both me and Jennifer towards her mountain dwarfing blue eye, which once again completely toward over me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please don\u2019t remind me.\u201d Jennifer said looking down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Connie\u2019s words I couldn\u2019t help but think that maybe, being here wouldn\u2019t be to bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie soon walks out of Brobdingnagian headquarters and gets in her black Honda Accord, and after putting me and Jennifer on the passenger seat, drives towards the Brobdingnagian women barracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie seemingly drove for around 4 hours and by the time we made it towards our destination it was 11:30 pm at night, and I was tired \ud83d\ude13. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sitting in Jennifer\u2019s right hand I feel the car stop. I turn towards my left to see Connie\u2019s gigantic form exit the car. This was the first time I had seen Connie in all of her glory. Connie was wearing black business pants and a white short sleeve blouse and miles and miles above I could just make out her whole entire face instead of small sections. She truly was a goddess and as she exited the car raging winds hit both me and Jennifer in our face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie upon exiting the car picks bot me and Jennifer up carefully. I looked around our surroundings. It looked like we were in the middle of a large lush jungle, were the trees where bigger than any Lilliputian and Gulliverian skyscraper. In the middle of this large forest stood the Brobdingnagian barracks, which looked almost like summer camp bunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this really the women Brobdingnagian barracks?\u201d I asked. Honestly I would\u2019ve preferred Jennifer\u2019s rundown building home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI KNOW ITS NOT MUCH BUT THIS WHOLE ENTIRE OPERATION IS TOP SECRET SO IT HAS TO BE IN A AREA UNKNOWN TO ALMOST EVERYONE EXECPT A SELECT FEW.\u201d Connie says from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh stop complaining Pivot you will get what you get and like it.\u201d Jennifer said looking at me with irritation in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW IF YOU DON\u2019T MIND HOW ABOUT YOU MEET THE OTHER WOMEN HERE.\u201d Connie said as she looked down at both me and Jennifer with a mile Long smile in her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOLDIERS FALL IN!\u201d Connie yells, forcing me to cover my ears. I wasn\u2019t the only one as Jennifer quickly covers both her ears, dropping me 100s of feet to the ground which was Connie\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI land on The fleshly surface which was Connie\u2019s hand still grasping both of my ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon my ears stop ringing, standing in both of my feet I look up to see Jennifer bend down to slowly and carefully pick me up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang Connie can you please give us a warning before you yell.\u201d Jennifer says holding me in her hand. An<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH SORRY YOU GUYS I FORGOT HOW POWERFUL MY VOICE WAS.\u201d Connie says from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground soon began to shake with a great fury. Soon the front door of the barracks flew open and 10 gigantic girls ran out and lined up miles away from Connie and me and Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOLIN I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET THE BROBDINGNAGIAN SECRET OPERATIONS PSI-LOCK.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight here, right now was the beginning of my training, training on a Brobdingnagian level, training to join Psi-lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Olin 1st person)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid on a pillow a thousand times to big for me, on a bed that stretched out like a never ending landscape. The covers to the bed where unruffled, I wouldn\u2019t need to use them seeing as to how they where to big for someone as small as me, as well as to heavy, all I had to cover my whole entire body was a ripped piece of a napkin that in truth was also to big for me. This was one of the things I would have to get use to when it came to living with towering giants. I turn my head to the right to see the towering figure of Jennifer laying right next to me on the pillow with her eyes closed. It in many ways was amazing to see that the pillow dwarfed even her with its huge size, but in the end it all made me realize how small I was, how hopelessly small I was to a Gulliverian, as well as a Brobdingnagian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraining would be tomorrow so both Connie and Jennifer advised that I got some much needed sleep, especially after such a hectic day, but it didn\u2019t matter how much I tried I just couldn\u2019t fall asleep, and soon my mind drifted to what it always drifted to when I was alone. The vision that I had when I first lost control of my powers. The vision of the strange man that I saw, the man that the younger version of me called father, as well as the incident at my old preschool, the incident that involved flying books and desks. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder was their another time in my life that I had activated my powers and if their was why didn\u2019t I remember it? That man couldn\u2019t really be my father could he, no I have a father as well as a loving mother, therefore in the end I came to the conclusion that I was just seeing things, and yet I still couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that, that so called vision was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon purged my mind of the mysterious vision and soon begin to think about the events that transpired as soon as I came to the headquarters of the top secret team call Psi-lock  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood in the middle of Jennifer\u2019s giant sized palm who in turn stood in the middle of Connie\u2019s giant sized palm. Both me and Jennifer looked at the ten monolithic women who stood miles and miles away from our location, but I had got the impression that I was the only one in complete shock as well as terroir. You might be asking how could I tell, well Looking up above I could see that Jennifer\u2019s face was completely calm with out even a little bit of fear, heck she even seemed to smile a little bit as she saw the gigantic girls who were all standing in a straight line. It was already common knowledge to me that This wasn\u2019t Jennifer\u2019s first time in Brobdingnagia, in fact if I new anything about Jennifer\u2019s work than this wasn\u2019t even her second time in Brondingnagia, but even if that were the case I still couldn\u2019t understand how she could be so calm especially when it came to such gigantic beings. I soon turn my attention back to the living goddesses and I see almost everyone smiling back at Jennifer as if she were a old friend, except one of the gigantic women that stood at the very end of the line. The giantess had long black hair that cascaded behind her back and she had pure white skin that seemed to glisten in the moon light. Even thousands of feet tall she along with every women in line was beautiful but unlike the others I felt danger emanating from that girl in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAT EASE GIRLS.\u201d Connie says from above, and as soon as she does the Towering girls become more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I BELIEVE YOU ALL REMEMBER SERGEANT TOLERANCE.\u201d Connie says with a voice impossible for any Lilliputian to ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cYES MA\u2019AM!!!!!!!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d All the girls shout with such furry that I am blown off my feet. I once again found that my ear where ringing from the loud thundering Booms that came from the Brobdingnagian women\u2019s earth shattering voices. Looking up at Jennifer I could see that she wasn\u2019t effected as much as she was when Connie shouted since this time she wasn\u2019t that Close to the giant women but for a brief second I did see her wince in pain. I place my arm around Jennifer\u2019s thumb and carefully return to my feet rubbing my ears to ease the pain. Now to get one thing straight I really couldn\u2019t understand what the Brobdingnagian women where saying, Lilliputians could only barley understand Gulliverians without a headset, Brobdingnagians on the other hand are another larger story. The only way a Brobdingnagian could understand a Lilliputian and the other way around, was by using a headset, which none of the girls had on at the moment. So the only ones I could communicate with was Jennifer and Connie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCAREFUL GIRLS, LOWER YOUR VOICES WE DON\u2019T WANT TO HURT OUR TINY FRIENDS.\u201d Connie says noticing our pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW GIRLS TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A NEW TEAMMATE JOINING US TODAY.\u201d Connie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Connie said those words my heart began to speed up, and sweat appeared on my forehead, as I saw the 10 gigantic girls look at each other with curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHIS NAME IS OLIN AND FROM TODAY ON WORD HE IS PART OF PSI-LOCK.\u201d  Connie says with a happy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all let out a collective gasp, each gasp had  enough wind to start a class 5 hurricane. I could tell that the idea of a boy joining their team wasn\u2019t something everyone was looking forward to, and yet their where a few individuals amongst the giantesses that had a smile on their face, which intern gave me a little bit of hope. Soon after a little bit of whispering amongst themselves, which wasn\u2019t whispering to me, one of the girls finally razed her hand \ud83d\udd90. The girl had long curly blond hair with eyes so blue that they looked like the sky on a beautiful summer day. The girls skin was also white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSERGEANT CONNIE?\u201d The blond haired women said trying to get Connie\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES NICOLE?\u201d Connie said looking at the giantess who\u2019s name was Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIF THIS MAN IS TO JOIN OUR TEAM MA\u2019AM THEN WHERE IS HE?\u201d Nicole asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHE REASON AS TO WHY YOU GIRLS CANT SEE HIM IS BECAUSE HE IS A LILLIPUTIAN HE AT THIS MOMENT IS STANDING ON JENNIFERS HAND.\u201d I heard Connie say in my headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon remembered that the monolithic women could not actually see my form standing at the distance they were currently standing at. I was just to small. But as soon as Connie explained to them what I was almost all of the girls let out a excited shriek, and almost every girl broke ranks to get a closer look at Jennifer\u2019s hand which had me inside of it. It almost seemed like a avalanche of skin as the Brobdingnagian girls moved closer with footsteps strong enough to shake the very world. Once again I felt afraid and deep down I just wanted them all to stay away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!\u201d I yelled as I put my arms up to defend myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole area goes quite. I open my eyes and see why. Both me Jennifer and even Connie where surrounded by a blue barrier. I could tell that I was the cause of this phenomenon. Jennifer couldn\u2019t help but let out a little gasp as she looked at the barrier that stood in between both her me and Connie and the 10 Brobdingnagian women on the other side. My whole body glowed with power, a power a lot stronger than last time it was unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon without warning the Barrier disappears and far off in the distance I could see the ten Brobdingnagian women looking at my minuscule form in shock. They must have been close enough to see me because their eyes where locked on me. I soon look up behind me to see that they where the the only ones. Bothe Jennifer and even Connie\u2019s eyes where looking at me with complete shock. No one spoke a word and soon the salience made me feel a little uncomfortable \ud83d\ude23. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh sorry.\u201d I said in to my headphones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer soon lets out a sigh \ud83d\ude14 as if she was excepting this outcome to happen and turns around to look at Connie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie I think you should start to explain.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little while for Connie to shake out of her daze, but as soon as she did she told the Brobdingnagian women the situation. Everyone was sitting down in a circle \u2b55\ufe0f I believe they did this for my benefit to calm me down so that I didn\u2019t unleash my power on accident like I did before. The story soon ended and once again everyone\u2019s eyes where on me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that everyone had mixed emotions about me, but their was only one person who made me feel a little uncomfortable. It was the girl with long black hair, who was giving Jennifer the devil glare. I soon found out her name was jasmine, Jazz for short. The way she looked at me when she spotted me in Jennifer\u2019s hand before anybody sent chills down my spine. It wasn\u2019t a look of hate but a look of desire of want. Other than her everyone else was pretty cool about me living with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201c\u201cWELCOME TO PSI-LOCK!!!!\u201d\u201d\u201d Everyone said in unison, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(End of flashback)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI layer on my back just thinking of the future. Soon light flooded inside of the once dark room signaling to all the dawn was soon approaching. I sat up and smiled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk time to begin the day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeffery laid on the floor, holding his throat as he tried to take in wheezing, heavy breathes. It felt like someone was strangling him but there was no one else in the room but himself and her. Tears ran from his eyes as he stared at her standing on his coffee table, a smile on her face as she stared back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me more about how cute I am, handsome boy,\u201d Annie giggled as Jeffery let out a stifled gasp. He really was a handsome man, young, roughish good looks, a chiseled body and looking around his apartment she could see he was rich. He had the latest Gulliverian plasma television, fine art, and a leather sofa, all so nice, all new. All Annie had was a small three-bedroom apartment for her family. She grew up sharing a room with her younger sister while her brother got his own room. She had always resented that, until she learned what real suffering was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Please\u2026\u201d He wheezed, looking at Annie pleadingly as he struggled to lift his hand. He let out a garbled scream as the pressure around his neck increased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the big tough Gulliverian needs help from the wittle, helpless Lilliputian?\u201d she mocked in a baby voice, her smiling growing wider and sinister as Jeffery\u2019s jerked around, his body shutting down from lack of oxygen. Annie relaxed the pressure around his throat, not wanting this to end too soon. She hadn\u2019t had this much fun in such a long time. She hadn\u2019t been this focused when she took the last one, she had put too much pressure on his heart and he died too fast. This one was going to know suffering before she put him out of his misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing this\u2026\u201d He gasped out; able to take a shaky breath with the psychic hands around his neck relaxing. He pointed at her, his hands uncontrollably shaking as he spit out one word. \u201c\u2026Monster.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the playfulness vanished from Annie\u2019s face. Suddenly the adorable girl that had been messing with Jeffery was replaced by a hateful demon, glaring poison at the down human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you call me, you fucking hypocrite?\u201d She hissed, her hold on his neck returning just as hard as ever. She started panting, not from any strain from choking Jeffery, rather her internal struggle not to tear his skull from his neck. Where did someone like him come off calling her that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffery Donner, a young handsome, well of Gulliverian that posted online listings for Lilliputian roommates that offered a safe, cheap home for anyone that wanted to live in Gullveria. He seemed kind and gentle when he first meets his roommates until he gets them alone. The men he likes to toy with, either stomping them or eating them. The women he uses to pleasure himself, often crushing them against his member. Annie wasn\u2019t sure how many of her people he had killed; dozens, hundreds, it didn\u2019t matter to her. He deserved to die for every single life he took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might have never found out about his hobby if he hadn\u2019t boasted about it online. Annie still remembered the picture he posted with a tiny, naked Lilliputian woman lying on his tongue, crying her eyes out before she was swallowed. A monster is someone that kills for no reason but his own enjoyment. Jeffery only cared about his own sick power trip, not the victims he killed, not the families he left behind, the family\u2019s who had nothing left but bitterness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to hear a story, Mr. Donner? It\u2019s the kind of story you like, it\u2019s about a Gulliverian killing and torturing an innocent family.\u201d Annie spoke in a completely deadpan voice, her eyes going vacant as she lost herself in a nightmare she kept reliving every night. Even though her mind was elsewhere, she maintained her hold around her victims neck, giving him just enough air to stay awake, but not enough to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a mommy, daddy, big brother, big sister and little sister. They were poor, but happy because all they needed was each other. One day mommy decided to take everyone for a picnic near a Gulliverian town. It was such a nice day, everyone was so happy and laughing. Then the Gullverians showed up. Two of them, lets call them bastard and bitch. At first mommy and daddy weren\u2019t afraid, but then bastard stepped on daddy. No one was laughing anymore except bastard and bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up off the coffee table, Annie hovered above Jeffery staring down at him with her wide, soulless eyes, not seeing the handsome man that murdered her people with promises of shelter, but the man that had destroyed her life. Gritting her teeth, she willing Jeffery to lift off the ground, joining her in the air. Only he was being held up by his neck, the strangling hands around his neck became a noose, tightening slowly as Annie continued her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy ran to daddy but he was nothing but a smear on the ground. Bitch picked up mommy and laughed at her, finding her tears funny. Mommy screamed at bitch and then mommy went into her mouth and was all gone, poof,\u201d a jarring giggle escaped Annie as she found herself shaking. She was able to maintain flight, but she couldn\u2019t control her own shaking as the memory flashed past her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig brother grabbed little sister and tried to run, but the Bitch caught them. She lifted them up high into the air, hundreds of feet over big sister\u2019s head, and the dropped them. They went splat right in front of big sister, very messy, very messy. Big sister was all alone, no mommy, no daddy, no big brother, no little sister. But then big sister found something inside her, something that had always been there but she\u2019d never used before. Big sister looked at bastard as he reached for her and he made his fucking head explode. Brains and blood everywhere. Now only big sister was laughing. She laughed and laughed and laughed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffery made a death rattle as his eyes rolled back into his skull. He was fading fast, Annie had put too much pressure on his neck and he was going to black out. Not wanting thing to end like that Annie concentrated on his neck, she focused her every iota of her rage and hate on Jeffery and let it all out in one blast of telekinetic force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffery\u2019s head twisted to the side violently and he creased breathing. Annie let him fall to the ground as a lifeless heap, leaving him there to rot until the smell of his corpse alerted his neighbors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been good, very good; it would keep her satisfied for at least a week. She needed to keep doing this, not just because they deserved it but also because it was the only thing keeping her from losing her mind. She had gotten the male Gulliverian that killed her family, but not the woman. She had escaped after the man died, running away as Annie laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie had been searching for her, practicing on monsters like her so when they meet she can do more then kill her. Simply murdering the woman wasn\u2019t enough, she wanted to destroy her happiness, tear everything she loved and cared about away and make death seem like a sweet release. It was only fair; she had done the same to Annie.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were in Alissa\u2019s room playing with makeup and picking the perfect outfit, when the portal formed out of nowhere. It was accompanied with a twangy electronic sound and constant breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that Alissa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s in your room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa had a comb in her hand. Without putting much thought into her actions, she tossed the comb at the swirling green portal. The portal jiggled like gelatin as it swallowed the comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa got closer to the portal. Her dress and light-brown hair flowed back with the breeze emanating from the portal.Her barefeet padded across the shaggy carpeting in her room until she was a step away from the portal. It was amazingly detailed. It looked like a flat, 2D portal at first, but now that she was a step away, she could see that the center of the portal extended back for an infinite distance. It was like looking down the funnel of a tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me something.\u201d Alissa demanded from Jackie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latina noticed only then, that she was paralyzed with fear. She was still clutching to two bottles of nail polish. With only a slight moment of hesitation, she padded across the room and handed her friend the bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa had her hand extended back, and without turning away from the portal, she felt for the bottles and promptly tossed them at the portal. Again, it jiggled and absorbed the bottles. This time, Alissa could see the bottles getting smaller and smaller as it was pulled through the vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Alissa had to raise her voice, as the ambient sounds of the portal increased. \u201cThis is like that thing from that one show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRick and Morty?\u201d Asked Jackie, also raising her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Sliders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do think it goes?\u201d Asked Jackie. She felt the breeze coming from the portal changing. Instead of blowing out, it felt like it was sucking in. At first, she didn\u2019t feel any need to be alarmed. The breeze was probably only like 10 mph at most. Nothing to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t freaking know Jackie. But I kinda want to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it Alissa. What if it shreds your body in a million pieces? What if you end up in the middle of space?\u201d The sucking winds started picking up. Both girls\u2019 hair were now flowing in front of their faces, obstructing their views.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d Alissa was nearly shouting at this point. \u201cMaybe we should throw a mouse in there or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s stupid. How would we know it surv--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of wind knocked both girls forward. Their small bodies didn\u2019t stand a chance to the wall of wind that struck their backs.

Jackie hadn\u2019t got her bearings and was still disoriented from the trip through the portal. She landed face first on the flat ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip through the portal was unlike any experience known to humankind. It felt like she was skydiving, but she also felt her body distort and pull itself in all directions as if she was made of putty. She felt no gravity or free fall sensation, instead she felt like she was being sucked through a straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Jackie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackie, how in the hell should I know.

It felt warm and a little dry. The ground was hot. It felt like there was a fine film of sand on top of a hard, compacted ground. As Jackie planted her hands on the ground to push herself up, she felt the ground give-in just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was was wearing a long, plaid skirt with simple v-neck black t-shirt. Her friend was in a modest dress, that was cut in the front to show off her leg as she walked. Both girls were barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place looks really flat.\u201d Alissa shielded her eyes from the sun with one hand. It looked like a lazy salute. \u201cWe\u2019re in desert it appears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie could feel the compacted-ground sink under her bare feet. She looked down and moved her right foot and stood a little wide. Where her right foot was, she could see a perfect footprint in the light-sanded color ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this, \u2018Lissa. We are in a desert with no water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I guess we should start looking for water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat portal thingy is gone.

Then we\u2019ll see if we can find anyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls pick a direction and proceed to walk. They hope their decision leads to fresh water or civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walk, Jackie couldn\u2019t help but notice how fragile the ground felt. Something felt off but she couldn\u2019t pinpoint it. Jackie walked slightly behind her taller friend and kept close. The sun stayed high above and warmed their skins, causing them to slightly sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere look!\u201d Alissa pointed off into the distance.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sand dunes didn\u2019t necessarily look like dunes to the girls. They more or less looked like gentle little slopes of sand that rose up level with their shins. Their feet kicked up the powdery sand and left compacted footprints in the wake of their walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie kept studying her environment. Everything felt so familiar, yet it all felt alien. Slightly off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot sand warmed their bare soles but it wasn\u2019t anything painful. The warm sand actually felt nice under the arches of their feet. The fineness of the sand also felt oddly comfortable to walk on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! It didn\u2019t get far.\u201d Alissa pointed at another dune, about 4-steps ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like a car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like an RC car. Look! It\u2019s moving away from us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we follow it?\u201d Asked Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. The owner isn\u2019t probably too far off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe RC car sped away from the girls. It raced up the little hills of the dune, only to catch air at the apex, before crashing down on the other side. Though it took the dunes effortlessly and sped at top gear, the girls caught up with the 2-inch long buggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa reached the toy first and bent down to pick it up, but it quickly drifted right beyond her grasp. Jackie acted and stomped her left foot in front of the toy. The dune buggy took a hard right turn, but the drastic change in direction was enough for it to flip over once, landing on top of Jackie\u2019s right foot. The little toy was stunned long enough for Jackie to pluck it with her thumb and index finger. She stood back up and brought the toy to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie noticed how fragile the toy felt. She could feel the outer piece bending and crumpling within her light grasp. Secondly, the toy looked incredibly detailed. The engine to the rear of the buggy was hot and had visible moving parts, so small, she could barely make them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Jackie said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s up?\u201d Alissa walked over to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa moved in closer to see the little toy. \u201cHoly shit. Is that...it\u2019s moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like a little person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither this is some kind of super detailed toy or\u2026\u201d Jackie\u2019s mind wondered off as she continued examining the one-inch figure in the driver's seat of the buggy. The little figure moved its arm and proceeded to take off its full-face helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa gulped. She couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. She looked up to her friend and noticed, she too, was looking up at her with mouth wide-open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little figure started yelling at the girls and even shook a fist in the sky. The little thing didn\u2019t see scared of the girls. Rather, the little thing seemed pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s real.\u201d Jackie finally said. \u201cA real, tiny person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s trying to say something to us.\u201d Alissa moved her ear close to the little figure. (Later, they would learn the little thing is a Lilliputian.) \u201cI can\u2019t understand what it\u2019s saying. It doesn\u2019t sound like a language I recognize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe little person isn\u2019t a thing.\u201d Jackie cocked her head. \u201cStop saying \u2018it.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what else should I call it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle...man, I dunno.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think there are more of him?\u201d Alissa looked up excitingly at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe they can help us and get water or figure out where we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Jackie thought for a second while looking at the irate Lilliputian. \u201cWell, yea. He wouldn\u2019t be way out here by himself--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c--right! Which means there should be more of him around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so eager to find more of him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d Alissa was busy looking around her immediate area, looking for clues or evidence of more little people. \u201cLook. I see a lot of tire tracks heading that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they headed toward the direction of the tire tracks, Alissa gently took the dune buggy from Jackie\u2019s hand. Alissa was transfixed on the little man. Jackie thought it was cute how her taller friend was so interested on the tiny man. Jackie was too, but Alissa looked at the man with intense, rapt interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa. It\u2019s a whole campsite, filled with little people.\u201d Jackie crouched down and marveled at the sight. There were RVs, a bonfire, BBQ grills, dune buggies, ATVs, 4 trucks parked in a circle. And at least 15 little people ranging in ages, male and female. They looked very human (except for their size) and wore clothes similar to what was found on Earth. All the Lilliputians looked back up at the girls and were motionless. Jackie noted that the little people didn\u2019t look fearful. They looked up at them as if they crashed a party -- the fact that they appeared 400-feet tall didn\u2019t seem the phase them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want them all.\u2019 Alissa said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jackie could respond. The portal materialized out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s back, Alissa. Quick, let\u2019s go through it and get back home before it disappears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn\u2019t know for sure if the portal went back home or not. But jumping through seemed like a great idea. Better to go through the portal than be stuck on a desert as giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d Alissa looked at the campsite, unsure what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is incredibly intelligent, good-looking, and she has the Earth equivalent of several doctorate degrees in many of the advanced sciences. However, her mentally unhinged, cruel, and perverted personality has made her a renegade when it comes to most of the great scientific minds of her world. However, she found a good paying job with other, twisted, like-minded, mad scientist types on a former Brobdingnag military base now run by the Brob mega corporation Acme. Their goal is to find new lands to plunder, and new resources to exploit. Maria has a slender, yet curvy body, with a nice, firm, round ass, and large, perky breasts. She has smooth, milk chocolate colored skin, lovely black hair, and haunting brown eyes. On Earth, this bisexual woman would be considered model material, or an incredibly hot milf. However, she would stand out on Earth, because she would stand over 400 of their feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Currently, Maria is at the base getting ready to go through a movable, vortex like wormhole portal. There are advanced computers, advanced robots, other scientists, military security personnel, company personnel, and technician all around her, as she stands there dressed in an armored, dark colored space suit. \u201cWhat data is the remote probe sending us,\u201d Maria yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThe new target planet is remarkably like our world, only their atmosphere is slightly thinner than ours, and so is the gravity, perfect for a Gullivarien, but still not lethal or even burdensome for our people,\u201d the tech told her. \u201cIn addition, the plant life, and some of the animal life is nearly the same as one would find on the Gullivarien homeland.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNearly,\u201d Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, the life forms on this world are just slightly bigger than one would find on the Gullivarien homeland,\u201d the tech tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAny sign of human or intelligent life?\u201d Maria asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNone so far,\u201d the tech tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat a shame, nobody will be there for me to play with,\u201d Maria responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Maria puts on her helmet, just in case the robots readings are wrong. She grabs a large bag filled with various kinds of equipment, and walks through the wormhole. She quickly emerges on the other side, and checks her instruments. For a few minutes, she believes she is still on her home world. However, after checking the configuration of the stars in the night sky, she realizes that she is really on another world. Maria removes her helmet, and gloves, placing them near the advanced, squid looking robot, which runs on bio-fuel that is standing next to her. The robot is designed to collect, and store living specimens for the return home. It can also use living creatures as a fuel source. It can easily suck them up, or grab living specimens with its long tentacles, without harming them. Both Maria and the robot can become invisible at will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Maria orders the robot to stay around this area, and collect any living specimens it deems interesting. Meanwhile, Maria activates her portable cloaking device and walks even farther away, in order to have a good look around, in the search for interesting specimens. Maria comes across what kind of miniature structure?</span></div></div>",

In only a hundred years, the Prodigians adopted the cultures of the three original races. They took in the fashion, language, and laws of the little people. Fortunately, for the world, the Prodigians hold little aggression and are compassionate towards the little people. Yet, there are those that let their size get to their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <b><span class=\"crose\">Microputians</span></b> lived under the noses of the three original races for centuries. Knowing their limitations in stature and seeing how the bigger people treated the Lilliputians, the Microputians opted for a life of subterfuge.

A Lilliputian woman had captured her, along with fifteen others. This Lilliputian woman was about 420 feet tall to her perspective, making Emily appear to be an inch tall. The giant Lilliputian was looking into the ceramic bowl where the Microputian captives shivered in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a pig Kelly.\u201d Another Lilliputian woman (who was out of sight) said. \u201cYou really think you can do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>know</i> I can do it.\u201d Kelly said, still looking down at her catch. \u201cReady for me to start Adrianna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, yea.\u201d Adrianna sat opposite of Kelly, leaving the bowl between them on the table. <br>\r\n\u201cHurry up and do it already. I don\u2019t want to be late for the movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly reached in a pudgy finger into the bowl and pulled out a sobbing woman in her forties. \u201cPlease don\u2019t this.\u201d She cried. \u201cI have children.\u201d Kelly dropped the woman on her pink tongue and savored the Microputian. Kelly moaned as the tiny thing thrashed in her mouth. Kelly opened her mouth for a second to lick her lips and as she did that, the screams of the Microputian woman resonated outwards. Kelly sealed her lips again, muffling the tiny woman\u2019s squeals. Then there was silent, preceded by a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small lump traveled down Kelly\u2019s throat. The Microputians inside the ceramic bowl renewed their frantic screams and futile attempts at escape. Their little bodies slid down the smooth walls of the bowl. Katy grabbed a man in a grey suit. She tried to strip him, but it wasn\u2019t working out as she placed too much force on his frail body. She only managed to pull of his jacket and then dropped the man in her mouth, not wanting to waste any more time. She gulped down hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s body refused to move. She starred at the giant Lilliputian\u2019s hungry eyes. One by one, the bowl became more vacant and empty as Kelly gobbled up the Microputians. It was down to Emily and two other women. They huddled together under Kelly\u2019s shadow. Kelly\u2019s breasts were gigantic and bulging out from her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Kelly complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cCome on let\u2019s go already. The movie is going to start soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wait.\u201d Kelly tapped her chest with a fist. She let out an enormous belch strong enough to shake Adrianna in her seat. \u201cOkay, that made some room. Only three left, I got this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly\u2019s fingers reached into the bowl like lightening and grabbed all three women, each between her dirty fingers. The women begged and cried but Kelly didn\u2019t pay any attention to them. She dropped one of them in her mouth and swallowed right away. Without moving, Kelly loosened one more finger and dropped the second screaming woman in her mouth. Emily was now alone. Kelly and Emily exchanged glances; Kelly smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Kelly.\u201d Adrianna butted in on the staring contest. \u201cLet that one go. You don\u2019t have to eat them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d Kelly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sliver of hope appeared on Emily. \u201cThank you.\u201d Emily almost cried in relief. \u201cThank you, thank you so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly moaned. Then loosened her finger. Emily screamed as she fell in the wet cave that fourteen other already went through. Kelly played with Emily\u2019s body, shoving her to the sides of her cheek. Emily felt herself being cut up by Kelly\u2019s molars. The giant pink tongue then scooped up Emily and rammed her against the roof of Kelly\u2019s mouth. Emily could only whimper like a kitten, as she lay battered on Kelly\u2019s tongue. Kelly then angled her tongue like a slide, causing Emily\u2019s body to slip down into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly gulped and then looked at her friend. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a pig Kelly,\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly stood up with a smile. Her soft stomach protruded outwards a little more after starting her Microputian feast. A wet blotch had appeared on Kelly\u2019s shorts in front of her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might want to change clothes.\u201d Adrianna pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops.\u201d Kelly mocked embarrassment. \u201cYou know how I get when I eat those micro jerks.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kelly let out a quiet burp while the previews went by. \u201cCan I have some of your popcorn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrianna looked at Kelly with bewildered eyes. \u201cYou can still eat after eating fifteen people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere not real people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Here have some, but aren\u2019t you afraid that you are going to pop? Your belly is showing.\u201d Adrianna was right. Kelly\u2019s soft midriff was poking out from under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYum,\u201d was all Kelly said as she stuffed her hand into the popcorn bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large crashing sound exploded near them. The girls, along with everyone in the cinema, looked around but didn\u2019t see anything. Was it the movie? They heard what sounded like steel groaning and concrete crumbling. The ceiling lifted upwards, revealing the clear blue sky. Three Lilliputians seated towards the front of the cinema disappeared under a steel beam that collapsed on them. The Lilliputians screamed and headed for the exits only to find them blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly and Adrianna were still seated and holding onto each other. It took a minute for their eyes to adjust to the bright day light. When it did, they were able to see the source of the ceiling destruction. A Gulliverian woman with long hair stood smiling above the packed cinema. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are so fucked.\u201d The giant Gulliverian woman reached in and grabbed a panicking man. She opened her mouth and swallowed him whole. \u201cDon\u2019t worry little ones. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman reached in, grabbed a handful of Lilliputians, and tossed back, one by one. She moaned as she sent Lilliputian after Lilliputian down her throat. The Gulliverian woman saw Kelly and Adrianna still seated, cowering like children. She grabbed them and lifted them to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are your names?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls quacked in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are your fucking names?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Adrianna and she\u2019s Kelly.\u201d Adrianna said crying. Kelly was frozen and holding her belly that was working on digesting fifteen little people. The irony was not lost on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d The Gulliverian woman exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m Samantha. I hope you two enjoy the journey to my stomach.\u201d Samantha swallowed Adrianna. Kelly shrieked as she saw the bulge form in the Gulliverian\u2019s throat. The bulge moved down and faded away. \u201cOh, that\u2019s good. She\u2019s a fighter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly cried to herself as the full realization that her best friend was gone. Samantha was a pretty Gulliverian and skinnier than Kelly if they were the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky for you, I\u2019m full.\u201d Samantha said as she stepped into the devastated cinema. Her bare feet came down upon a few hapless Lilliputians. She then jumped and down on top of Lilliputians and several rows of seats. She paused and picked on a Lilliputian man who was clawing on the emergency exit. She pulled the man down onto his back with her toes. The man didn\u2019t have time to react before Samantha brought her large toe over his head. She applied pressure until he popped like a grape. \u201cThis is so much fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha reached down and lifted a teen girl who was hiding under a few seats. The girl was wearing a skirt, which flipped up, revealing her pink panties. \u201cMaybe I am still hungry.\u201d Samantha tossed the girl in the air and caught her in her mouth. She toyed with the girl before swallowing. \u201cI think I have room for more after all.\u201d She looked down at Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly could still feel the struggles of the fifteen people she ate in her stomach. Samantha sucked on Kelly\u2019s feet before lowering her whole body into her mouth, Samantha moaned as she tasted Kelly\u2019s soft body. Kelly tried to claw on Samantha\u2019s tongue but it didn\u2019t do much. Samantha swallowed Kelly and rubbed her crotch as she felt the little thing enter her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha made quick work of the cinema, leveling into the ground. She got out and started walking down the Lilliputian streets, stomping on cars and any fleeing Lilliputians she spotted. A heavy boom startled her, causing her to freeze. She turned just in time to see a gigantic Chuck Taylor shoe land on top of a dense Lilliputian neighborhood. It was a Brobdingnagian woman maybe in her thirties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha turned, only to trip over her feet and land on top of a row of houses. The Brobby was gigantic; tall for even a Brobdingnagian. Samantha felt like a bug between the black and white sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell look at what we have here.\u201d The Brobdingnagian woman said. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it a little Gulliverian bitch terrorizing helpless Lilliputians?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha rose to her feet and started running down the streets. She stepped and crushed on countless fleeing cars as she tried to escape the Brobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry my Lilliputian friends.\u201d The Brobby said. \u201cI\u2019m here to rescue you from the Gulliverian bitch.\u201d The Brobby lifted her foot and stepped down on another Lilliputian neighborhood. Compared to the Lilliputians, the Brobby stood over six mile feet tall. Her nearly mile long foot killed thousands. Without rushing or acting fast, she sauntered towards the running Gulliverian. The Brobby knelt down, lifted Samantha, and held her up to her face. \u201cI saw what you did to those helpless Lilliputians. How about I give you a taste of your own medicine?\u201d The Brobby dropped the Gulliverian into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobby rose to her feet and continued her walk through the Lilliputian metropolis. Thousands more were killed with every uncaring step she took. She walked towards a large Lilliputian train station and got a little evil plan. Without wasting any more time, she swallowed Samantha. The screams of the Gulliverian faded into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobby woman tore the train station a part with her pink finger. Swarms of little black dots scurried to the corners of the station, trying to hide from the giga-sized giantess. The Brobby lowered her face to the ground until her nose touched. She then started sucking in air through her pursed lips. The Brobby woman swallowed hundreds thanks the hurricane force winds she created.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobby couldn\u2019t taste the Lilliputians and lost interest in them. She opted for crushing the dots under her sneakers. The tallest tower barely reached her ankles. The Lilliputian metropolis extended for miles on either side of the Brobby woman, causing her to smile as she contemplated on all the fun she was going to have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slender bare foot landed in front of the Brobby woman. But this foot was gigantic even for the Brobdingnagian. To the Lilliputians, this foot was 62 miles long, and just finished crushing over five million Lilliputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobby woman fell on her ass in shock. Her own ass killed thousands, but nothing close to the amount of devastation caused by the pinky toe of this mysterious giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, my name is Alice.\u201d The giantess said. She looked like an older teen, only wearing an orange bikini. \u201cI\u2019m kinda lost; can you tell me where I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobby woman could only look back up, steamrolling over the Lilliputian city. Being lucky to be born a Brobdingnagian, she never knew what it was like to be small. She was always the biggest of the big. But here she was\u2014only an inch tall to this younger teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Do you know where I am?\u201d Alice knelt down, her shadow enveloping the tiny Brobdingnagian. After waiting a moment, she got frustrated and lifted the Brobdingnagian like a bug. \u201cAre you deaf? Where I am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re in Lilliput. You\u2019re stepping on one of their cities right now.\u201d The Brobby woman shouted, hoping her voice would carry to the Prodigian teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really,\u201d Alice giggled. \u201cI guess that explains the grey floor. Wait, what are you doing in a Lilliputian city? Aren\u2019t you huge to them or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brobby remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you were being naughty to the Lilliputians. I should teach you a lesson.\u201d Alice lifted the Brobdingnagian woman to her mouth and dropped her in. She toyed with the six-mile tall giantess in her mouth before swallowing. Alice moaned at the feeling of swallowing another person whole. She looked at the grey around her feet and got a naughty thought herself. She undid the strap from her lower bikini and tossed it off to the side, crushing millions of buildings. She then leaned forward and let her clean shaved pussy land on the microscopic city. Her labia plowed and decimated the city into powdery nothingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice knew it was wrong, but fortunately, for her, she was a Prodigian. There was nothing bigger than she was. She was on top of the food chain and she knew it. Alice was wet quick and coming to an orgasm in no time. Her juices flowed from her pussy and drowned the entire remaining part of the city under her viscous liquids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice patted her belly as she felt the Brobby woman renew her struggles. Little did Alice know that inside the Brobby woman\u2019s stomach was Samantha. Inside Samantha\u2019s stomach was Kelly. Inside Kelly\u2019s stomach was Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sat inside Kelly\u2019s stomach unaware of the outside world. Emily thought to herself about how much life sucked as a Microputian. Alice on the other hand was loving life. She decided to explore more of Lilliput in the nude. Millions perished under her cute feet as she sauntered on. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was 8:25. He had the whole thing planned. Hit up the bowling alley to break the ice, get some snacks, head off to the 10pm showing of \"Sleeping with Other People.\" Kind of a chick-flick, but Brian was selling himself as a sensitive, sweet guy. And it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Brian, you've gotta look at this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZNN was reporting a major disaster in the Lilliputian city of Atlanta. Millions dead, millions injured. ZNN rolled some satellite was on station in Lilliputian orbit. The footage was uncensored as the older teen's orange bikini stripped off. Dust billowed as her the top flew hundreds of miles into the next state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scale was mind blowing. Like two heaving meteors, the teen's perky 30 mile-wide breasts easily surpassed the size of the major city. Brian watched as her pussy ground Atlanta into dust and her liquids submerged much of Appalachia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that - \" Brian and his friend nodded in agreement: Alice was a Prodigian. \"Jesus, dude, why didn't you tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Alice were a perfect 100% match on PlentyOfFish and hit it off immediately. Most nights, they spent hours texting and video calling. Brian had never really had much luck with women, but Alice was button-cute. Brian was immediately attracted to her petite frame: from her tiny cute feet and slender hips to her small, tiny nose. Her breasts were sizable, but proportional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they had apparently neglected to discuss size. And Brian was approximately the size of a microbe compared to his young lover. Not even dust size, Brian thought. Dust would be visible to her. No, he was literally nothing compared to Alice. And what were her intentions? Alice had known he was a Lilliputian-sized man in a Lilliputian-sized world the minute he gave her his address. She had already wiped out most of the southeastern US with her lewd show. Would he be next? Brian shuddering thoughts were interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8:30. His cell phone started vibrating. Alice's cheery voice was on the other end, \"I'm here!\" Brian's whole existence rumbled with the reverberation from Alice's giggly voice. \"Hehe, sorry about the rude arrival, I wanted to keep it a surprise!\" Well, at least she's going to wait before crushing my existence under her 62 mile feet, Brian thought. \"Look up! What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like someone blew out the sun like a candle. A weird shadow enveloped Brian's city. Alice, of course, was thrilled. Finally she was going to meet the love of her life - well, sort of. So what if she couldn't actually <i>see</i> him? He could see her, and that would just have to be good enough if this whole thing was going to work out. Brian's complement took Alice to the moon: \"Uhhh, you're gorgeous. Wow.\" Alice's mind raced with thoughts of the future. \"Finally, I've found a guy who sees through to the real ME and really appreciates ME. I'm so lucky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Brian couldn't actually see Alice. In fact, Brian couldn't see anything in the dark. But, when your girlfriend is 424 miles tall, her feet are the size of metropolitan areas, and, should she be offended, she could effortlessly wipe you and your entire race, you have to make compromises. He felt bad lying to Alice, but his mind floated back to that ZNN footage. All those people, millions probably, crushed into paste by a teen's lusty labia folds. Probably still parts of Atlanta up there, Brian mused, smashed and compacted into her intimate parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do first?\"</span></div></div>",

They themselves where not the only ones, everyone who lived in that city and everyone who lived in the city miles away from that exact destination looked at Alice with eyes field with mixed emotions. Brobdingnagians where like gods compared to Lilliputians and yet Alice with her prodigian might, was beyond a Brobdingnagian, she proved that for a fact as everyone including Brian saw her eat a Brobdingnagian whole, on tv. Brian couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Brobdingnagian\u2019s where gods than what was beyond a god? Brian\u2019s soul mate was a prodigian, he still couldn\u2019t believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do we do first?\u201d Alice asked into her phone with a booming voice that rocked the minuscule city to its core, breaking every glass window and causing a lot of car crashes, injuring a lot of people and killing a few more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian\u2019s feelings where complicated, it didn\u2019t take a genus to know that he was afraid, but deep down, even though Brian knew that Alice was a prodigian he still loved her. Brian couldn\u2019t help but think back to the times when they texted each other on their phones, all the times when they talked, when they got to know each other. Without a doubt this girl was the girl of his dreams her massive size would not change that. It is because of this love, that Brian found the the strength to do what was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice.\u201d Brian says into his phone. \u201cI love you, so very much.\u201d Upon saying this Brian could feel the whole city shake, people where struggling to keep their balance. Little did anyone know that these so called earthquakes where the result of Alice shaking from the excitement she felt when she heard Brian confess his love towards her. \u201cBut you have to leave.\u201d Brian said with a low voice. Brian\u2019s friend Cole was shocked and scared. \u201cDude what are you thinking.\u201d Cole said grabbing his friends shoulder. Brian just ignored Cole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was taken back and quite frankly confused, and then she understood, Brian was afraid of her. Alice wasn\u2019t angry, how could she be, Forgetting that she was a prodigal for a second, she had already caused a lot of damage to not only a few Lilliputian cities but to whole Lilliputian countries. These people where nothing compared to her less than dust molecules, but to Brian they where his people, his equals. Alice felt bad, but still despite her feelings she refused to leave things like this. Brian was the man of her dreams she would not let him go so easily. Alice knew that if this relationship was going to work she knew that fear could not be part of the equation. Alice gets on her hand and knees (one hand still holding her phone to her ear) straddling the whole micro city. She could not see Brian but deep down she knew that he could see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrian please don\u2019t push me away. I know that you're scared of me, and I know that I\u2019m big.\u201d Alive said. Calling herself big felt awkward. \u201cBut I do love you, and I want to make this work, I mean just think of the possibilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of earthquakes that Brian felt today was more than what most people feel in their life time. Alice getting on her knees caused the most powerful earthquake ever recorded by any Lilliputian. Her voice causing just as much harm to the Lilliputians, who could not even understand her word let alone withstand it. The ground underneath the Lilliputians feet started to crack  and break apart, huge cracks that swallowed up many Lilliputians and even a few microputians. Many skyscrapers and many more building started to collapse from all the shaking that Alice caused. It grew darker around the city, looking up Brian and his fellow Lilliputians could see Alices planet sized face come even closer to the city. Alices face was so big that no Lilliputian could see the whole face entirely, her face was so big that Brian could see every detail that was usually invisible to the human eye. Brian shifted his glance to the outskirts of his city. Brian saw a pussy that was thousands of times larger than his very city. Alices pussy was so big that clouds surrounded it, it could swallow millions of Lilliputian cities and still devour more. This women this titanic force of nature loved him, wanted him. Brian couldn\u2019t help but feel flattered. Suddenly with out warning Alice stands on her feet causing everyone including Brian and Cole to fall down on their behinds. Brian could no longer see Alice, her shadow blocking out her visage. Raging winds blew through the city, blowing away countless buildings and people (some flying beyond the cities borders) all of this caused by her standing up so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c just think of all of the things I could be to you.\u201d Alice said with a smile on her face. Alice grabs one of her boobs and bends her knees slightly just enough so that every Lilliputian in the city could see her. \u201cBoobs such as these could be yours.\u201d Alice says into her phone, moaning slightly. \u201cIt gives me goosebumps thinking of you climbing my nipple, a nipple bigger than any of your so called mountains.\u201d Alice starts to stroke and rub her nipple, as it starts to get larger and harder. Alice turns around. \u201c you could traverse the surface of my planet sized ass, a ass which would welcome you entirely.\u201d Alice said slapping her ass, which caused a sonic boom that burst the ear drums of a lot of Lilliputians. Alice starts to turn around again. \u201cOr you could go on adventure in my pussy, you could explore its depths for as long as you want, this is the pussy that you would own, and look who it belongs to.\u201d  Alice said putting her left hand on her chest. \u201cI would be yours Brian, and I would never hurt you.\u201d Alice said gently. \u201cI would do anything for you Brian, anything. I could make you the ruler of every Lilliputians if that is what you wish. Country after country would bow down to you and you alone. All I ask is for your love.\u201d Alice said with a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was on edge, she hoped more than anything that Brian would except her offer. She was basically offering him the whole Lilliputian world, so how could he not say yes. Deep down every word Alice spoke was true, she would make good on her promise, she was so  desperate for Brian\u2019s love that if he where to ask her to wipe out a whole Lilliputian country she would do with out a little bit of hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian stood in a city of ruble with his mouth open. He had his phone in his ear so he heard and understood ever word that Alice said. Could this. Relationship really work? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice I.....\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The lab was a typical lab, desks and instruments neatly arranged around the room. Four large tables dominated the room, each of the tables was twenty feet long and five feet wide, though there were some variations, smaller tables pushed up and joined with the longer tables to add more space. The tables were not bare or stacked with instruments. Each had a clear plastic border around their edges, five inches high; between the plastic it looked more like a landscape then anything with fields of green, brown, a vast expanses of golden brown, and then blots of grey with grey lines running between each of the blobs, with multi-colored areas along these grey lines. One might think they were looking at maps were they to view the tables, and they would be almost correct. Each of the tables was just what it seemed, an expanse of terrain of all sorts, thei<br>\r\nr own little worlds really. Each table had what looked like a tablet plugged in on a little holding-rack, with information displayed on each one. These tables were the observational experiments of a well-respected Prodigian most simply knew as Kelly. Each of these tables had all the smaller sizes in them, intermixed and allowed to \u2018roam free\u2019 as it were, with machines observing their progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer frowned as she sat on a hill; down below in a long valley shone the concentration of lights usual of a medium-sized town. The 43 year old Brobdingnagian woman would never had guessed she would be in such a situation. She had been \u2018collected\u2019 by Kelly almost a year ago, and dropped into this walled off social experiment. The Brobby woman shifted a bit as she sat, hearing a \u2018crack\u2019 as her shifting rump cracked a tree and knocked it over. That brought a smile to her face. She had actually grown to like it there, no holier-than-thou neighbors shooting her judging looks as she ate a Gulliverian by the poolside, no news reports of \u2018size appreciation\u2019, or stupid laws meant to cater to the insects below her. She knew she was an insect to the Prodigians, but they didn\u2019t care what she did to the even smaller insects. \u2018Not like Kelly was one to judge either.\u2019 Jenn thought and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had been a mother of three, typical middle class mom who worked for a living. Her life had been fine, until her daughters had all started taking an interest in Gulliverians. Jenn could understand having Gulliverian friends, she had a few herself, but her girls had been romantically interested in Gulliverians, and not in the \u2018use them as toys and stimulation\u2019 way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t right. She must have killed a dozen of her girl\u2019s boyfriends, finding them in their bedrooms while her daughters were at school. She had kept one alive since he had just been so polite and respectful. The older woman rewarded manners, after all. Still, it had been unbearable. Then Kelly had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered it so well, the tremors that shook her as she stood by her car. She remembered feeling\u2014excited by it, and then she had seen her, the Prodigian woman standing over her suburb like a goddess, a grin on her lips. Jenn remembered the huge woman\u2019s clothing, black business slacks that hugged her hips and thighs loosely, a white undershirt that also hugged her form, her trim belly and her rather massive breasts. Moreover, she wore a blindingly white lab coat, which shimmered under the sun\u2019s rays. She remembered how it had contrasted with the woman\u2019s dark colored skin. Jenn then looked at the Prodigian\u2019s face. She was remarkably beautiful, full lips, a youthful appearance, her brilliant green eyes and her short hair like a buzz cut. Her lips had been moving but Jenn was memorized, before the booming voice shook her from her daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I said, pack your things.\u2019 Kelly\u2019s commanding voice said as she took a step toward Jenn, her sneaker covered foot crashing down on a house with the family still inside. Jenn had never liked them anyway. The rest of the day had been a blur, she remembered packing a bag, hugging her daughters for a final farewell. She willingly stepped onto Kelly\u2019s hand before being taken away. It had been a fun year since then, all told. Jenn had been the first Brobby Kelly collected, and they actually formed a decent friendship. Jenn was like a goddess here, able to do as she pleased to those smaller then her with no repercussions, since she knew when her goddess, Kelly, wanted one area not touched in a bad way. Jenn had grown a liking to watching Kelly deal with Brobbies who displeased her. She suspected Kelly was doing this experiment just to have fun, and hell, it was a brilliant idea, entire little worlds for her to lord over and do as she wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn was brought back to the present as she heard the delightful screams coming from down in the town, there was a fair in town. The Brobby smiled and stood up, brushing remains of trees and other things off her jean covered rear, before she started walking down the hill, grinning as she could now, truly imagine what she looked like to the Gulliverians, it made it so much more exciting. Then, just before she crossed over the highway that was between her and the town, the night vanished and the \u2018sun\u2019 came out. Kelly had come to work.</span></div></div>",

Each screen displayed needless statistics about her captive cities. She had Gulliverian towns, Lilliputian cities, and Microputian continents set atop of tables throughout her lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach civilization served their purpose to the scientist in one way or another. Kelly experimented on her cities with no remorse. Her actions were always clinical and her emotions absent of empathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's stomach rumbled as it worked to digest Jennifer. Her usefulness to Kelly had ended. To Kelly, it seemed like poetic justice to eat the Brobby that had wrought so much horror to the smaller race\u2014though Kelly was no saint herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little burp escaped between Kelly's plush lips. The one-inch Brobby had ceased its struggles within her taut stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly lifted her large frame from her seat and sauntered between the tables of her civilizations. <br>\r\nThe Gulliverian towns looked like tiny models used by architects to plan metropolitan expansion. The Lilliputian cities were almost in indiscernible to Kelly's eyes. The cities looked more like a zoomed out satellite picture of a city with wispy grey lines and pepper sized bumps. Then there was the Microputian table. It contained an entire continent complete with a forest and desert biome. A one-millimeter deep layer of water surrounded the continent, which represented a deep ocean for the Microputians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilliputians and Microputians had a soft spot in Kelly's heart. She worked all hours of the day trying to develop technology that would protect the Lilliputians and Microputians from the Jennifers of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail entered the lab carrying a clipboard in front of her petite breasts. She wore a white lab coat like Kelly, but went with conservative clothes underneath--similar to something she\u2019d wear to the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly on the other hand knew loved showing off her body by displaying a lot of her dark brown skin. She also liked wearing spaghetti-strapped heels that added several inches to her already tall stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got good news,\" Abbie said in her quiet tone. Never did Abbie think of one day becoming a Prodigian. After all, she was born a Lilliputian. \"The test results came in--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, out with it,\" Kelly was smiling hard as she walked up to Abbie. The top of Abbie's head didn't even reach Kelly's underboob. Kelly enjoyed throwing her size around, especially around little Abbie. \"Did we finally find a winning combination?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking up high at Kelly's excited face, Abbie nodded. \"You did it! The ceramic compound works better than expected.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it,\" Kelly said, bringing Abbie against her body in a tight embrace. Abbie stretched her arms around the large woman and pressed the left side of her face against Kelly's belly. \"This was a team effort, and you deserve equal amount of credit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two broke off their hug. \u201cThanks Kelly. For everything, I mean. Like hiring me, inviting me to this special experiment, for growing me from a Brobby\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get all sappy on me.\u201d Kelly turned her attention to the Lilliputian cities on a nearby table. \u201cI know how I want to test the compound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-One Year Later-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought Atlantis was going to be some kind of a Utopia.\u201d Manny said with a heavy alcoholic breath. \u201cThey told me to move to Atlantis for opportunity and adventure. They promised me an easy job, a fat salary, and a big apartment. You know I was one of the last groups of immigrant before Atlantis was sunk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d A man in a sharp suit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the city was sunk, I got my job assignment: exterior window cleaner. One of the most useless fucking jobs someone could have, oh and let us not forget the small paycheck it comes with every two weeks. To make things worse, they gave me the smallest apartment they could find. I\u2019ve been to truck stop restrooms that were bigger than my shithole apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, it can\u2019t be all bad.\u201d The suit said. He was drinking a fine dark wine in the dimly lit bar. It was nearing three in the morning, and only pathetic drunks were present. However, the man in the suit did seem out of place. \u201cYou\u2019re not a farmer after all. Their accidental death rate is through the roof and at least you got an apartment where you live alone. Some unlucky folks are stuck in the barracks. Imagine sharing a warehouse with a hundred cots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? Some kind of shrink?\u201d Manny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a concerned citizen, brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny blinked a few times, but wasn\u2019t able to rid of the double vision he was seeing. \u201cYou must have an easy life in the city. You\u2019re probably some executive that sits behind a desk all day. You don\u2019t have to scrape shit from the <i>outside</i> while wearing a diving suit that could leak any second and kill you. Fuck, I hate this place so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful what you say, brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, I mean it. I fucking hate this place. I hate being at constant risk of death. I hate not being able to see the sky or true outdoors, I hate my job, I hate my life\u2026I hate the fucking bitch I\u2019m inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in the suit took one last sip of his wine. He placed it down on the bar and adjusted the cufflinks at each of his wrists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny\u2019s drink did its job of numbing him all over. He was standing at the bar with only one ass cheek on the bar stool. His body struggled to stay still and instead wavered back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, brother,\u201d the suit said turning to Manny. \u201cTo watch what you say. You know the penalty for blasphemy against the Order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d The drink in Manny\u2019s belly was on the verge of traveling back up his throat. He was too drunk. \u201cWhat, are you going to report me? This is just guy talk. Besides, I don\u2019t see any Enforcers anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about undercover Enforcers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goddamnit.\u201d Even drunk Manny knew what this meant. \u201cSo, what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n-Two Days Later-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cManny?\u201d Abigail asked. \u201cWhere have you been? I\u2019ve been trying to call you for days now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJail,\u201d he said, sitting beside her on the bench at the botanical garden. An enormous dome was right above their heads, allowing some of the taller trees ample space. The thick acrylic windows around the garden let in an eerie yellow hue from the <i>outside</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, god why?\u201d She caressed his shoulder as he slumped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor making disparaging remarks about our so-sigh-ity.\u201d He said in a tone mimicking the mayor and his accent. \u201cThe court said they\u2019ll let me off easy since I have a spotless record. Fucking assholes. They reassigned me as a farmer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as good as dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t say that. Maybe we can file an appeal or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get it Abbie? You can\u2019t win with these people. Shit, I should be watching what I say right now otherwise they\u2019ll eject me out the city without a suit.\u201d Manny looked around the immediate area and didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary. Only other Lilliputians in suits enjoy another day in paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a police state, honey.\u201d Abigail said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have cameras and microphones everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not them I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s the undercover Enforcers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail swallowed a lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I have you babe.\u201d Manny reached in and gave Abbie, his girlfriend, a kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple walked around the gardens for an hour before heading to the cafeteria. They talked about light topics and ate their foul tasting food\u2014they didn\u2019t consider it food, but the rest of the city seemed content with their meal options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple called it a night and headed back to their respective domiciles. Manny headed for his hole-in-the-wall apartment and Abbie went to her upper-class suite. Transportation in Atlantis consisted of fast moving train cars, interconnected throughout the city via a series of acrylic tubes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail swiped her transport card through the slot adjacent to a tube entrance. She had to wait a minute for a private train car to show up. Abbie sat down alone and waited for the train to get moving. It was quiet inside the train car as it zipped through the clear tubes. Abbie placed a call on her private phone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing she had on was her black lace panties. Between her long legs were several firm pillows. White silky sheets draped over her luscious buttocks and spilled over her hips. \u201cHow are things going in Atlantis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe usual.\u201d Abbie said. \u201cListen, I got a friend here who got into a lot of trouble. I was wondering if you can help him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbbie, you know there\u2019s nothing I can do. Remember, I\u2019m totally hands off. The people govern themselves, the way they want to govern themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, but come on. I really like him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbbie, darling, I told you before you embarked on this experiment not to get attached to anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Kelly.\u201d Abbie sighed. \u201cI just thought. Ugh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d Kelly slowly rose from her bed. She swung herself off her extra-large bed and headed for the bathroom for her morning pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m heading home for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s funny.\u201d Kelly relaxed her bladder and continued talking to her lab assistant. \u201cI forget you guys are on a different time than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie looked out the train as it hurled itself through the cylindrical tube. The city lit the liquid that was on the <i>outside</i> but there wasn\u2019t a whole lot to see. Just a vacant ocean devoid of life. Atlantis was the sunken city surviving under a harsh ocean. It was considered the last safe haven for the Lilliputians; safe from the much larger and terrorizing races. Abbie didn\u2019t feel safe in Atlantis, and neither did Manny\u2014which was probably why she liked him. All the Lilliputians in the city were there by choice and never questioned the status quo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny challenged them. All the time. His big fat mouth and liberal mind had gotten him in trouble many times in the past. And now he was assigned as a farmer, which meant almost certain death. It was a dangerous job no one wanted, yet the entire city depended on farmers for food and survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason the job was so dangerous was because he had to go on the <i>outside</i> in a flimsy wet suit. A ceramic compound, that Abbie and Kelly developed a year ago, would protect him from the harsh ocean. The same compound also protected the sunken Lilliputian city from the the <i>outside</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a view of the ocean?\u201d Kelly flushed her toilet and walked to her kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, I\u2019m taking the tube home. All I see is dark ocean around me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was still wearing only her panties. On her kitchen counter were three square pieced crackers, each half the size of a postage stamp. Kelly\u2019s mouth watered as she looked at the three tiny crackers on her clean, white counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crackers didn\u2019t look like much; in fact, it looked like left over crumbs. But there was something about the crackers that made Kelly excited. Each cracker was teeming with life. Kelly wished she could see herself from the perspective of the Microputians occupying the crackers in their miniscule cities. She always wondered what she looked like as a 30,700-mile tall giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach cracker occupied anywhere from 70 to 90 million Microputians. There buildings were coated and treated with the ceramic compound, but the city and its people were out in the open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding her phone to her ear, Kelly picked up one cracker as carefully as she could. \u201cGood, look outside because I got a treat for you.\u201d Kelly said with a husky voice as she brought the tiny cracker to her plush lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Kelly, please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to\u2026\u201d Abbie\u2019s voice trailed off as she looked out into the absent ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly placed the cracker on her tongue. The cracker soaked up the saliva on Kelly\u2019s tongue and the city on the surface began to crumble under the uneven surface. Like dominoes, buildings collided with other buildings as they were shaken off their foundation; the buildings did not disintegrate or break away as expected thanks to the compound they were coated with. The people in the cities cried out for mercy but they knew their voices wouldn\u2019t carry all the way out to the giantess. Kelly swallowed the damp cracker and the millions of Microputians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie\u2019s train car was still swirling around the various tubes that connected Atlantis together. The tubes left the confines of the building and traveled out in the open. She looked outside and could see distant buildings lit up with their neon and halogen lights of all color. It was weird how the lights interacted with the Kelly\u2019s stomach acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first parts of the Microputian city started to enter Kelly\u2019s stomach. For the most part, the ceramic compound held up the integrity of the Microputian structures, but gradually melted in Kelly\u2019s stomach. Abbie looked on and could see one inch Microputians enter Kelly\u2019s stomach, only to be digested painfully within the vast ocean. Their tiny writhing bodies didn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly grabbed another cracker and ate it like the one previous. Kelly moaned at the thought of consuming some 180 million little lives with two little swallows. Hundreds of thousands of Microputians adhered to Kelly\u2019s esophagus, only to drown on the slimy interior of her throat. Though many perished in her mouth and throat, millions made it to her stomach were they would suffer a far more painful death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freefalling Microputians looked out their office buildings in terror as they entered the vast open stomach. They could see many lights illuminated under the sea of stomach acid. Their little heads couldn\u2019t comprehend what they were seeing\u2014or why a Prodigian would eat so many of them even though they wouldn\u2019t provide much nourishment to her gigantic body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Microputians broke through the stomach acid and dove deep, deep into Kelly\u2019s stomach. Some Microputians were able to figure it all out in the moments before their death. It was a Lilliputian city built inside the Prodigian\u2019s stomach. Somehow, the Lilliputian city was anchored to the slimy walls of Kelly\u2019s stomach. The city withstood the harsh environment of the stomach and wasn\u2019t eaten through thanks to the ceramic compound. However, the ceramic compound that was treated on the Microputian city wasn\u2019t strong enough to withstand the violent acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly\u2019s stomach acid digested the Microputian city little by little. Kelly digested the Microputians by the millions. Their collective bodies providing barely a calorie to her enormous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly lifted the last cracker. Lust was written all over her face. She parted her lips and showed off her white teeth\u2014one tooth was large enough to support an entire Microputian county and then some. Kelly chewed on the last cracker. Her diamond hard teeth shredded apart countless structure and millions of people. Entire neighborhoods lodged themselves within the valley of her molars, only to be crushed seconds later. Even though she chewed the cities in her wet mouth, millions were still alive and clinging desperately for higher ground. Kelly swallowed, and then moaned. There were still hundreds of thousands alive in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly felt up her large tits. She patted her taut belly that was both home and hell to millions of people. She loved eating. Every time she ate, her breasts grew larger and her legs longer. It only took hundreds of millions of lives for her body to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was the show?\u201d Kelly said into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbbie could see the last structure sinking by the tube where she was. The skinny office building was about four times her height and filled with panicking Microputians. She could see their one-inch bodies scrambling for dry floors, but the violent stomach acid found its way into the building and was mercilessly eating away at anything it met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after another, the fast moving acid took Microputian lives by the hundreds. Their bodies dissolved into nothingness as Kelly\u2019s stomach worked on digesting every morsel. Soon, the structure broke in half by the acidic ocean. The Microputians didn\u2019t stand a chance. In little less than three seconds, the thousands occupying the city were digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScary.\u201d Abby managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry honey. Nothing bad will happen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

True she was meant to stay out of the business of the people beneath her notice. But it couldn't have been possible without Abby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right honey. Give me some time.

If it weren't for me, you'd be dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby put down the phone and looked out the tube at the sickening ocean outside. It was true. She remembered seeing Kelly for the first time. Still a Lilliputian staring up at a landmass, not a person. She didn't know how she made her out amidst all the specks at her feet. But somehow she took an interest in her. From there she found herself under various experiments by the goddess. She underwent numerous tests, eventually growing from a Lilliputian to a Gulliverian, then to a Brobdingnagian and finally a Prodigian. Even at that size, Kelly still overshadowed her in every way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she was, back on the bottom of the food chain only second to the Microputians, literally within the belly of the beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure how this would turn out. She knew Kelly cared for her, but that care was not spread evenly throughout the rest of the subjects of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed something else out in the vast sea. It appeared to be a massive piece of toast. It would soon be refuged by the farmers for consumption by the locals. Many would not be coming back sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got back to her flat and fell down on the bed. She had noticed throughout her time her that there was no such thing as true silence here. If you listened hard enough, you could hear the sounds of the stomach all around. The groaning and gurgling. A constant reminder of how close they were to being dinner at every second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Manny might very well be that dinner if Kelly couldn't get through to the leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a call just then.

This terrifying and desolate wasteland was actually the marble counter top in the house of a Prodigian family, the Helners.  The family includes Julie, the middle-aged wife; Mark, the husband; and Jennifer, the college-age daughter.  This family is actually quite progressive, and have just as many Brobby and Gulliverian friends as others their age.  Jennifer also knows a few Lilliputians and even Microputians online.  However, none of them are aware of the colony in their own kitchen: the only people with a hope of noticing the tinies are Gulliverians, and they tend to stay in the safe zones inside the house.  Meanwhile, the Helners remain unaware of the devastation they cause every time they place something on the kitchen island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood and water is surprisingly difficult to come by.  The occasional bread crumb or water drop was a miles tall obstacle, crashing down like a meteor.  Even if you survive, you have to quickly grab supplies and run for cover.  At any moment, a massive wall will sweep the small mess away, returning the vast landscape to its bare form.  During her travels, Alicia has found villages that disappear overnight, with not a single trace left.  She's even reached the World's End, a massive drop that supposedly surrounds the world.  And of course, the landscape changes constantly with monolithic objects crashing down and flying away.  The ground regularly rumbles, but Alicia doesn't know that this is from the movement of beings that are larger than planets to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the sunlight returns to show that the land is empty today.

And if she's not there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, focus</i>.  Shaking her head, she hears the distant sound of thunder.  Time for the daily storm.  As massive clouds roll overhead, the heavy wind was mixed with large boulders.  Alicia quickly found a small cave and hid.  The white rocks pounded the landscape, each one bigger than a house to her.  She even watched a poor Lilliputian getting pelted by the debris, slowly succumbing to the bludgeoning wounds.  The clouds retreated for a moment before returning, much larger this time.  The off-white cloud descended toward the ground.  As it neared, Alicia noticed that it wasn't a cloud, but a sprawling blob of gunk!  The amorphous mass plummeted to the ground, landing with a massive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...plop.  Julie was humming to herself as she kneaded the dough.  She's never tried making bread on her own, but so far the recipe was working great!  Just a bit of work on the counter top, then let it sit and rise for a few hours.  After that, a short bake in the oven and voila!  Fresh bread for dinner!  She finishes working the dough, and tosses it into a nearby metal bowl.  Covering the top, she places it beside the fridge, and heads to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia was trapped in an endless mass of food.  She was lucky enough to be caught in an air bubble, but she still screamed as she was tossed about.  After a few minutes of terror, the movements cease.  Alicia claws through the thick mixture, and arrives at the summit of a mountain of dough.  She looks up just in time to see a massive shape stretch a thick sheet across the roof, sealing the container shut.  She needs to get out of here.</span></div></div>",

She pulls out her map and tries to find her location, but nothing looks familiar.  However, she notices a similar drop off right in front of her.  This place must be beyond the void, a world away from her home!  Suddenly, the monolithic bowl rises into the air, leaving behind a confused and terrified Microputian.  She looks around for signs of shelter.  Peering over the edge, she can see a massive cliff just below her, filled with enormous metal shapes.

This was a human being? She gaped in awe as the plane walked away, causing a rumbling sound that shook her to her core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia hugged her knees to her chest and cried. She was out of her league here. Surrounded by people taller than mountains. Surely her sister was dead. She should have stayed home.

Though Julie was a friend of hers, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy whenever they did this. Mark was a tall, gorgeous, well-built man with dark ebony skin and silky hair that went down to his shoulders. If they were only the same size... but alas she was just a speck to him and besides she didn't want to get on Julie's bad side. She owed her life to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells great. You've worked on this for some time haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Julie smiled. \"It just needs a little time to cool down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Well then,\" he smirked and leaned in. \"Jen's out tonight. How would you like to spend the time while it cools.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie giggled and turned on her earpiece. \"Sandy. Mark and I have some. matters to attend to. Can you watch the bread for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure I guess.

She tried to pull away and found herself caught up in it. She smelled a strong masculine musk permeating the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mark and his wife began to undress. He pulled off his sock, which unknown to him had a passenger aboard and tossed it away not noticing where it landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia saw a large expansion of black skin surround the fuzzy surface she was trapped on and pull it away.

She walks through the town square, over to a skytram.  The door closes behind her, and she sits on the blue seats as she rides towards a massive structure in the center of town.  The enormous mansion, standing at 50 miles tall, is big even to Sarah, who is used to being at the top.  Nervous, she notices a stray group of hairs, and reaches up to fix them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world shifts, as Adam watches the table float away.  His view begins swinging back and forth past the titanic woman, as distant booms echo from the abyss below.  Adam quickly gets nauseous, but manages to keep hold of the massive thread he is on.  After an agonizing minute of swinging, the brobby sits down again.  Vibrations still shake the land underneath him, but nothing like the walking did.  Unfortunately, this moment of relief is short-lived.  Soon after, Adam's world flips upside down.  His view of an endless plain of blue cushions is replaced with a much closer auburn forest of cables, each as wide as a house.  The air is filled with the smell of strawberries, a result of the woman's shampoo from that morning.  With the sweeping movement of her hand and the sleeve being upside down, Adam finally loses his grip and plummets to the dark forest beneath.  He lands near the root of a hair, and takes a moment to catch his breath.  Standing up, he watches the hand above him move out of sight, leaving him on the warm head of the massive woman.  Sighing to himself, he picks a direction and starts walking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tram finishes its journey at a small station on the side of the mansion.  As Sarah steps out, she notices the much smaller Gulliverian transits, and can almost make out the even tinier Lilliputian airport.  Supposedly this is also where the Microputians arrive, but she'd never be able to see one, even if it was right in front of her!  She follows the carefully designated walkway to the entrance.  A pair of double doors slide open, and Sarah walks into the only house that could make her feel small.  Looking to her left, she sees a properly sized tram, with tracks that follow the walls of the enormous palace about her.  She steps inside, and finds a small control panel, with buttons for each room of the mansion.  She selects the main office, and takes a seat as the tram follows the spiral staircase up.  She pulls out a small computer pad, and reads the latest article in the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam could tell the woman was walking again: the booms may have been further away, but they were still plenty loud, and still shook him to his core.  After a good bit of travel, he finds himself...still in her hair.  This woman was bigger than New York: her head could probably house an entire Microputian metropolis.  To make matters worse, the ground was covered in a sheen of oil: not enough for her to notice, but enough for Adam to see the puddles and fall down on occasion.  A few minutes later, he feels the ground shake again, and the booming stop.  He silently rejoiced the newfound silence, until the ground underneath him starts rotating.  It's not too long until the floor becomes the wall, and Adam finds himself almost in free fall.  Panicking, he reaches for a hair and grabs on.  The slick cable slows his fall, but not before he exits the safety of the forest.  Now swinging out in the open, he looks to see a monolithic...</span></div></div>",

There was an elevator in Amy's desk for any race to use to get to the top, but when Amy dealt with Brobdingnagians or Gulliverians, it was just easier to pluck them from the floor and put them on her desk.  Her assistant had placed a desk that was about an inch tall on her desk for Sarah to sit at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt pressure around her waist as Amy grabbed her from the floor.  Amy brought her up to eye level to examine Sarah and liked what she saw.  She gave her ass and little rub when she put Sarah down on her desk.  Amy thought Sarah was very pretty and was going to play with her.  She wasn't going to take no as for an answer this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah said that before we get down to business, I want to let you know that a Microputian named Adam went looking for an adventure and ended up in my ear, unbeknownst to me until a few minutes ago.  I know what we are talking about is sensitive, so I think it would be best if we removed him from my ear canal before proceeding.  Neither Amy or Sarah would be charged if Adam died during the extraction or any future interaction between the three of them as violated Sarah's space and had trespassed into Amy's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Adam, Amy, as Prime Minister, had the necessary tools to extract Adam from Sarah's ear.  Sarah put Adam on her hand which stretched for miles.  He looked around at his surroundings and saw everyday objects tens of thousands of miles large.  He thought Sarah was huge, but Amy was larger than a continents when compared to him.  He could see her breasts in the distance above him standing proudly out from her chest for a thousands of miles.  Her nipples were as big as Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah put ten thousand ear pieces on her hand near Adam for him to put on one so he could communicate with Amy and Sarah.  Sarah and Amy both had an eye piece on that allowed them to see Adam as if he were a few inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy asked Adam if he had ever seen another race before this adventure.  He said that he had see some Lilliputians, but not other bigger race.  He said he was in awe of Amy's size and couldn't believe anyone could be that big.  Amy said she couldn't believe anyone could be as small as him so they both had to readjust their beliefs.  Amy asked Adam if he would like to be placed on her hand.  Adam said yes as he always loved taller women and Amy took the crown.  Sarah gently placed Adam on Amy's hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam could feel her heart beat and the warmth coming off her hand.  He saw her index finger in the distance and realized that she could crush Microputian states with just her finger.  He wondered how his race, or for that matter, any race, fight the Prodigian if they decided to fight.  Amy asked Adam if he liked women and he said he did.  Amy asked if he liked taller races and Adam said he did (although, what was he supposed to say if he did not).  She then handed Adam back to Sarah and took off her blouse and was standing in front of Sarah and Adam with a short black skirt and black bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam, you probably won't have the opportunity again, but would you like to see and play on my titanic breasts?</span></div></div>",

Fortunately he found himself somehow end up on the top with his face stuck upwards but his body stuck in the ocean of cream cheese. He tried to move. Tried to break free, but to no avail. He was too small. Too helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a sudden lurch as the Brobdingnagian lifted the crater of bread up towards her face far above. She didn't even look down as her mouth opened and took a bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam gaped in awe at the cavern he now found himself in. No. Cavern didn't really cut it. It could have been the center of the Earth in terms of size and heat. The top of the mouth looked over a mile above and the teeth were the size of cities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam paled at the sight. This was not how he had intended his journey to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like this,\" he started to weep, overwhelmed. \"Not like this. I just wanted to see the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by the tilting of the maw around him as the giantess tilted her head back and sent the food towards the abyss at the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he said softly, aware of his own powerlessness. He took one look back at the opening to the mouth at what might be his last glimpse of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman gulped and sent him down towards his fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would that fate be. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This interactive story takes place in the Lilliput / Gulliver / Brobdingnag universe* where three civilizations with drastic size differences live side by side. Each civilization appears to be one inch tall in comparison to the above tier. (Size chart below). The three civilizations attempt to live in cohesion and have laws in-place that recognizes all three races of people as equals\u00e2\u0080\u0094though this is easier said than done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this universe, the Lilliputian population hovers around 5 trillion; Gulliverians around 1 billion, and only 1 million Brobdingnagians. The Lilliputians are the brightest and most technologically advanced race. The Gulliverians are primarily interested in making friends, building strong families, and being the bridge between Brobdingnagians and Lilliputians. The Brobdingnagians tend to be wealthy and live lazy lives; due to their size, they could get a lot of physical work done with relative ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman trafficking exists in this universe but is strictly illegal. An underground black market feeds the needs of a few who love to torment the smaller ones. Dating and marriages between races exist. Conservative individuals detest inter-race marriages whilst liberals encourage inter-race relationships. It is common to see relationships one step up or one step down\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is not common to see Lilly and Brobby relationships because the size difference is too great. Communication exists through the use of headsets. The little ones can hear the big ones, but not vice versa\u00e2\u0080\u0094be sure they are using a headset or some other means of communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cplum\">Brobdingnag POV:</span></b><br>\r\nA Gulliverian looks to be one inch tall (25.4mm)<br>\r\nA Lilliputian looks to be .35mm tall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cplum\">Gulliverian POV:</span></b><br>\r\nA Brobdingnagian appears to be 432 feet tall (132 meters)<br>\r\nA Lilliputian appears to be 1 inch tall (25.4mm)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cplum\">Lilliputian POV:</span></b><br>\r\nA Brobdingnagian appears to be 5.9 miles tall (9.5 km)<br>\r\nA Gulliverian appears to be 432 feet tall (132 meters) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisual graphic of this universe:  <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/f3rPwVG.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/f3rPwVG.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\"><b>Themes:</b></span><br>\r\n-Pretty much anything goes.
