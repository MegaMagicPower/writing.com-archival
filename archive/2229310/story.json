He\u2019s out in the city by himself when he\u2019s enjoying his night out break from having to spend a lot of time with his 10 year old brother, named Liam.  There were a couple of reasons why he needed to catch a break.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was that his parents spend their days going to business trips, causing his to babysit his brother.  The second thing is that Liam is actually the fattest kid in the world, and he weighs at a massive 1,000lbs!  Of course Gavin is still baffled on how did the kid went from being skinny to massively obese, and it all came from an incident which he cane to regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a couple of months ago, Gavin wanted to make a chemical potion for the science project, and his aim was to use the liquid onto the food, so it would caused to swell and getting larger in the process with more fat inside.  By the time he had finished, his younger brother would come down and grabbed a glass to take a drink, unaware that he was drinking the chemical liquid.  Gavin was too late to stop him, and this is when Liam beginning to swell up and gotten a lot fatter right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite some shocks in great concern, Liam seems to love it so much, and it was the first of many things that he would hug Gavin by squeezing so much, and even squashing and other that changed the lives of both of them.  Of course his parents can be thankful that he worked so hard to look after Liam for the past couple of months with that size, and so it was a well earned treat he was getting by heading spending a lot of time in the city, and just simply enjoying the atmosphere for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s a shame I had to go by myself, leaving my brother in the house with my parents.  But I needed my own time to enjoy myself, while taking it easy myself at the end of the day.  I wanna come back fresh when I get to look after Liam, even though he\u2019s a fatter kid, I just love him to bits.\u201d  Gavin feels so sorry to himself, but it is what it is he needed to take some time away for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he\u2019s in the city, he would have to figure out where should head over first to start his well earned break.  But just as if he was going to get away with it, it wasn\u2019t to be, when there was the ground beginning to shake which it caused the booming sound coming from its distance.  Gavin stopped to his tracks along with everyone else, looking around to see what was happening and where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW..What\u2019s going on here, and where it\u2019s coming from?\u201d  Gavin could only ask in great concern, like everyone else who are asking the exact same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors keep on going, which Gavin\u2019s first initial thought was some kind of earthquakes in all.  But that\u2019s when he hears the screams coming from its distance and the booming noise sounded like footsteps that made himself realised how can this happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, did I accidentally left my growing chemical potion in the kitchen before I went out?\u201d  Gavin can only wonder which he also made another project that is able to increase its size, going as far as grown into gigantic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it wouldn\u2019t be long to get answer when he saw a obese figure, now looking like a giant in all, waddling through the streets, causing many to scream and run away from it.  Only some including Gavin stood in awe and he he had to look up realising that that giant obese figure is actually his 10 year old brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Liam who gets to be Fatzilla for a change, and Gavin knew he\u2019s gotten himself screwed for it.  When he takes a look at his younger brother\u2019s face, that tells him that Liam is looking a lot... </span></div></div>",

It was something he had thought of it from the past week or so, and it took place when he sat beside his 10 year old cousin, named Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam is not your every normal kid you would expect, but in fact because of the previous projects Gavin had done, the youngster had grown to become the fattest kid in the world, weighing at a massive 1,000lbs!  Liam was a bit shaken at first, but he definitely loved being so big, that he decides to stay this size, no matter what anyone says to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were sat in the living room together, though Liam had to take up the whole length of the couch, because of how huge his butt is, and they watched the movie called Godzilla.  It was the creature that is towering over the city, taking rampage or more, and so much so that Liam was loving it, and he always told his cousin Gavin that he would love to be massive like Godzilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that is when Gavin had an idea and started to work on a project which he\u2019s able to finished it off a week later.  Right now, he couldn\u2019t wait to use it on his younger cousin, though he wanted to keep it a secret on what it actually does until it comes to full contact on Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope he likes this for sure!\u201d  Gavin can think about that, when he wasted no time but to head out and visit Liam\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier on, he was told to go round the back of the house, and that\u2019s because Liam will be relaxing himself outside on a hot sunny day.  So Gavin did just that, and he can see his cousin in the hot tub in speedos, relaxing himself for the time being.  So he would come closer and gives Liam a greeting with a wide smile and a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cuz!  I see you\u2019re enjoying yourself so much, right?\u201d  Gavin wondered when greeted his younger cousin by the hot tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure am enjoying it, Gavin!  Let me climb out, so I can meet you face to face.\u201d  Liam smiled and wouldn\u2019t take long for the obese youngster to climb out of the hot tub and waddled towards Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind you, this kid weighs at 1,000lbs and he\u2019s only 10 years old, though he doesn\u2019t mind about being so infamous in public, and neither does Gavin, when he would decide to make a surprise for a youngster right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019see Liam, I\u2019ve got a surprise I wanna show you, but I\u2019m not gonna tell you what it\u2019s for yet.\u201d  Gavin says which he has something in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to see what it is.\u201d  Liam being so curious with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can only watch Gavin taking an item out from his bag, and it was what item he\u2019s showing it to Liam?</span></div></div>",

Although he\u2019s only 15 years old, but he\u2019s very good looking after his lil brother when his parents went away for a night out.  What\u2019s good is in fact he\u2019s about to look after his mother\u2019s friend\u2019s son, named Liam.  He\u2019s 10 years old, and already he\u2019s considered a scientific genius, thanks with a help with his own parents, who of course are real life scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much so that they had to be away, and they asked Gavin to come over and take care of the boy for a week until they get back.  Apparently, this is the most important event they\u2019ll ever have, so they wouldn\u2019t want to miss a moment, hence the reason otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Gavin was already at Liam\u2019s house, where the kid\u2019s parents left him with few things in hand, but also they wanted to inform the teen that he expects to have a couple of huge surprises in store.  Something which Gavin expects it could be something Liam have successfully made and wanted to try it out.  Alas, he was fine with it and he and Liam\u2019s parents exchanged their farewells, leaving just him and the 10 year old kid in the house for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, now all I need to do is meet the kid, and get myself settled.\u201d  Gavin wondered with his first idea comes to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, he was getting curious to see what surprises does his parents told him about, not even giving him a hint which he would have to make a guess for himself.  So he knew where the garage is, since it\u2019s the only room to have space for Liam to work on.  Gavin went over there by the door and he would give it a knock, hopefully not to disturb the kid\u2019s important work, though feeling relieved when he heard the response which he\u2019ll be glad for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, come on in!\u201d  Liam\u2019s voice can be heard from the garage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the teen opened the door and able to make a smile to his face by getting into the room, only to realised there was a very large figure, like an obese-shaped person standing with its back being turn.  What he\u2019s watching is seeing the size of that figure\u2019s butt and and thighs that are so huge, it can take up the whole length of the couch easily.  It was the sight he never thought about seeing and even when the figure turned around and saw the face on who it was, and it made Gavin looked so shocked in surprise to see who\u2019s this fat belongs to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa.... Liam?  Y...Y...You\u2019re so much fatter!\u201d  Gavin was speechless, it was only the first thing he had to come up with the words within the short space of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey Gavin!  Yeah, I\u2019ve always wanted to feel what it\u2019s like to get a lot fatter, and it worked and I\u2019m now weighed at half a ton!\u201d  Liam smiles with a giggle, which he saw the look on Gavin\u2019s face in full surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even more surprise to hear how much the kid weighed that cussed the teen to astonished in awe.  He can see that the kid has a bottom heavy-shaped body as mention, but he can see Liam has got the bigger belly, so much that his shirt rides up to let it being shown, and even his moobs are much bigger than it stuck out through the shirt.  The rest of his body is so thicker, though his face looked even cuter like any typical 10 year old would look like in such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that, kiddo!  I guess your parents already told me about the surprise, and I never excepted that to happen like ever.\u201d  Gavin stares in awe, realising that\u2019s the kid he\u2019s looking after for a week, despite he already knew Liam when he was skinny about a week ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too!  Besides, I think I would like to stay being so big whenever I want to.  It looks nice when I can see and feel the jiggles of my body, don\u2019t you think?\u201d  That grin look from Liam\u2019s face tells that he really wanted to start life as a 1,000 pound obese boy in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least you made the choice there I suppose.\u201d  Gavin simply shrugged which he\u2019ll be hoping the kid knew what he\u2019s doing anyway.  \u201cSo err... what kinda of stuff are you working on today, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure, I can show this to you just now!  I\u2019ve just finished it just before you went in, so you\u2019ve came in the right place at the right time.\u201d  Liam smiled as he turned towards the table and picked up something that looked like...</span></div></div>",

Yesterday, he was out walking to have some fresh air, when he saw a 10 year old boy, that looked a lot fatter, no more than 1,000lbs, and he thought it would be a good idea to make fun of the boy\u2019s massive girth, since he\u2019s the joker at times.  That however would be his downfall from here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy named Liam didn\u2019t take the jokes very kindly, and even so that he wanted to give Gavin a drink, which unknowingly was actually the shrinking potion he would use just in case.  Liam is nothing but a prankster himself, who was unfortunately gotten fatter by one of the tricks that backfired, but at least he was enjoying being the fattest kid there is.  He would thought it would be a good idea to let Gavin trying out and it only worked when he see\u2019s the teenager passing out in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last time Gavin had remembered, and even so that he was some kind of dream land when ends up in the obese kid\u2019s house, shrunk down to size and getting tormented by Liam mercilessly like a toy in all sorts.  It was like a nightmare he wasn\u2019t able to up so long, as if everything he feels is somewhat real or something.  And that brings to the next day, when Gavin would wake up, but something\u2019s not right about the place than he last remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t on the pavement when he mocked the obese kid before, nor was he in his own house as a matter of fact.  What he saw was so many posters, video games, and other stuff that certainly belong to a 10 year old.  But the worst part is the room looked a lot gigantic than any other rooms Gavin has ever seen.... or so he had thought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality when he looked around the room itself, it made him feel something\u2019s wrong and he knew by the horror look to his face.  That nightmare is too good to be true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!  I\u2019ve been shrunk down to size, haven\u2019t I?\u201d  Gavin felt the worse when he see\u2019s himself now standing at 3 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst part was he was place at where at Liam\u2019s gigantic-sized bedroom?</span></div></div>",

He was always slim and building up to himself muscular, but it was during the school experiment when he had to work on a project, when one chemical from above knocked off from the shelf and it spilled all over him.  That had caused Gavin to grow a lot fatter instantly, looking so worried that he may never ever to be the muscular guy ever again after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now weighs at 1,000lbs, which is half a ton for his age.  He had the look of the bottom heavy-shape body, which makes his butt and thighs much bigger than the rest of his body, even his belly is noticeably fatter too.  Gavin is so distraught from this, whenever he goes to town or school, he feels embarrassed that many people would just stare, either in shock or by laughter which he gets that all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin is so upset, he wished this should never happened and wanted to get some revenge on anyone that teases his massive girth, especially his 10 year old brother, named Liam.  He\u2019s a little joker so much, he\u2019s somewhat began to admire the look on Gavin\u2019s obese body ever since on the day of an incident.  Liam would take pictures and filming at his brother, showing off to his friends on purpose, and he even gives Gavin\u2019s massive rump a slap and a rub, which made the teenager blushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse that it all happens every day when his brother able to see Gavin\u2019s girth whenever he\u2019s in the room or not.  Unfortunately though, Gavin had been asked to look after Liam, after his parents went away for the trip that is so important, he didn\u2019t get a chance to know where they\u2019re headed.  As of right now, he couldn\u2019t be bothered by any means and can be seen playing with his cellphone, sitting on the bed when he heard the knock on the door, and a high-pitched voice can be heard from the other side of the room, which Gavin knew who it was to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Gavin, I\u2019m lonely!  Can I come in and see you, big brother?\u201d  That was Liam standing by his brother\u2019s bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine!\u201d  Gavin had paused before made a sigh to let the kid in.  \u201cBut don\u2019t touch anything while you\u2019re here and don\u2019t make fun of my fat body, alright?\u201d  The half-ton sized teenager warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!\u201d  Liam sighed, but smiled as he went into Gavin\u2019s bedroom to see him.  \u201cBut it\u2019s fun seeing you looking so big.  In fact, I like having you so fatter than you\u2019ve been muscular before.  It fits you well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t get a choice to get myself fatter.  Besides, it was that stupid chemical that caused this, and stuck here like a blob.\u201d  Gavin sighed before looking down himself sadly.  \u201cI wish I was normal again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell too bad that\u2019s not gonna happen, when I can jiggle your fat butt all over.\u201d  Liam shrugged with a grin, since he didn\u2019t seem to care about Gavin\u2019s feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lead to Gavin taking a long sigh and continued to play with his phone, ignoring his little brother in the process.  Liam in the other hand was too busy admiring the teen\u2019s fatness so much, he spotted something that looked very unusual.  Even so despite he\u2019s been told not to touch it, he would come closer to the table and looked at the item to see what it was.  Even by asking his brother Gavin if he knew about anything that was laying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay bro, what\u2019s that thing you got?\u201d  Liam wondered curiously, as he picked it up and see\u2019s it was a _______ he\u2019s holding.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s a 10 year old boy, who can be classed as a bookworm, trying to be so smart and giving best advices as much as possible.  That was the case when the day before, he was approached by a bully named Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin is 5 years older than Liam, and at 15 years of age, he\u2019a the fattest teenager, who he can still move with that pear shaped body of his.  And this is despite the fact that he weighed at a massive 1,000lbs, which is gigantically huge for his age!  Plus, he\u2019s nothing but a bully, and each time he see smaller people, he would make threats to them, by giving him lunch food and money, and the obese teen seem to enjoy it so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Liam had to fight this to save any kid from Gavin\u2019s bullying spree, and even so by telling him that being so big and fat is not good for his health and needed to lose a lot of them.  That didn\u2019t take Gavin very kindly and warned that he was gonna make Liam suffer for body-shaming his weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later on when Liam felt rather strange for some reason, as if to say he was getting cursed or something?  He was at the front lawn when he was suddenly beginning to feel tired and that\u2019s when he had to lay on the grass and catch some sleep so sudden, which is unusual for a kid like Liam to be in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the longest sleep he ever had, Liam had this weird dream as if he had shrunk down to size and gets confronted by a giant obese Gavin, showing how good his fat really looks.  It was like the kid felt like something real it seems and he hoped that it could be some dream that could go away.  Well thankfully, Liam had begun to open his eyes, though feeling groggy from that faint earlier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to stand himself up to get his focus into full version, and when he did, something wasn\u2019t right, and he felt like he was not in the front than he fell asleep at before.  Whatever the case is, it looked a lot different so much, Liam can only wonder in great concern by looking around the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW..Where am I?  And why am in here?\u201d  Liam can only ask in a worrying tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he had his vision in full view though, it was the worst feeling he ever had, and Liam knows it.  So much so, he looked around the place, realising he\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright, so I had this idea based on the roleplay I tried to attempt, but hopefully I will explain to you as much as possible, just to give you the understanding from what I want for this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two boys, one is a 15 year old boy named Gavin, and 10 year old boy named Liam, who in different scenarios based of one of them would start of weighing at 1,000lbs!  He would either grow into a giant, or have another skinny boy shrunk down to size and get encountered by obese boy as such?  Though I will explain in each chapter as it goes along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I like for the rules is that there should be no sex, nudity, or scat by any means.  Plus, I want a very long length of the chapters, which I would not accept it you add chapter only by a sentence choice question.  Otherwise, it would be a waste of a chapter within that limit.  Also there should be no deaths in the scene, though the giant obese boy could squash a smaller boy by sitting on, laying in, or stomping on in any way.  No immobile when the boy is obese please!   No ending the story please, or this can be edited to make it as a choice or deleted by any means.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only transformation that can happen in here is growth and shrinking, so the growth can only go as big as the city buildings, and the boy can shrink down to 3 inches, though can make change the size slowly before reaching its limit if you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, please add the chapters whether you can.  It helps to figure it out easily, so yeah!  I do have a Discord to rp with as well.  So if you want have to have a go, either let me know by email me here, or on Discord pjc-fc#4186 and I\u2019ll see what we can come up for this plot.  Thanks! <br>\r\n</td>",
