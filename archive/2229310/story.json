He\u2019s out in the city by himself when he\u2019s enjoying his night out break from having to spend a lot of time with his 10 year old brother, named Liam.  There were a couple of reasons why he needed to catch a break.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was that his parents spend their days going to business trips, causing his to babysit his brother.  The second thing is that Liam is actually the fattest kid in the world, and he weighs at a massive 1,000lbs!  Of course Gavin is still baffled on how did the kid went from being skinny to massively obese, and it all came from an incident which he cane to regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a couple of months ago, Gavin wanted to make a chemical potion for the science project, and his aim was to use the liquid onto the food, so it would caused to swell and getting larger in the process with more fat inside.  By the time he had finished, his younger brother would come down and grabbed a glass to take a drink, unaware that he was drinking the chemical liquid.  Gavin was too late to stop him, and this is when Liam beginning to swell up and gotten a lot fatter right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite some shocks in great concern, Liam seems to love it so much, and it was the first of many things that he would hug Gavin by squeezing so much, and even squashing and other that changed the lives of both of them.  Of course his parents can be thankful that he worked so hard to look after Liam for the past couple of months with that size, and so it was a well earned treat he was getting by heading spending a lot of time in the city, and just simply enjoying the atmosphere for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s a shame I had to go by myself, leaving my brother in the house with my parents.  But I needed my own time to enjoy myself, while taking it easy myself at the end of the day.  I wanna come back fresh when I get to look after Liam, even though he\u2019s a fatter kid, I just love him to bits.\u201d  Gavin feels so sorry to himself, but it is what it is he needed to take some time away for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he\u2019s in the city, he would have to figure out where should head over first to start his well earned break.  But just as if he was going to get away with it, it wasn\u2019t to be, when there was the ground beginning to shake which it caused the booming sound coming from its distance.  Gavin stopped to his tracks along with everyone else, looking around to see what was happening and where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM...*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW..What\u2019s going on here, and where it\u2019s coming from?\u201d  Gavin could only ask in great concern, like everyone else who are asking the exact same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors keep on going, which Gavin\u2019s first initial thought was some kind of earthquakes in all.  But that\u2019s when he hears the screams coming from its distance and the booming noise sounded like footsteps that made himself realised how can this happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, did I accidentally left my growing chemical potion in the kitchen before I went out?\u201d  Gavin can only wonder which he also made another project that is able to increase its size, going as far as grown into gigantic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it wouldn\u2019t be long to get answer when he saw a obese figure, now looking like a giant in all, waddling through the streets, causing many to scream and run away from it.  Only some including Gavin stood in awe and he he had to look up realising that that giant obese figure is actually his 10 year old brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Liam who gets to be Fatzilla for a change, and Gavin knew he\u2019s gotten himself screwed for it.  When he takes a look at his younger brother\u2019s face, that tells him that Liam is looking a lot... </span></div></div>",

It was something he had thought of it from the past week or so, and it took place when he sat beside his 10 year old cousin, named Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam is not your every normal kid you would expect, but in fact because of the previous projects Gavin had done, the youngster had grown to become the fattest kid in the world, weighing at a massive 1,000lbs!  Liam was a bit shaken at first, but he definitely loved being so big, that he decides to stay this size, no matter what anyone says to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were sat in the living room together, though Liam had to take up the whole length of the couch, because of how huge his butt is, and they watched the movie called Godzilla.  It was the creature that is towering over the city, taking rampage or more, and so much so that Liam was loving it, and he always told his cousin Gavin that he would love to be massive like Godzilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that is when Gavin had an idea and started to work on a project which he\u2019s able to finished it off a week later.  Right now, he couldn\u2019t wait to use it on his younger cousin, though he wanted to keep it a secret on what it actually does until it comes to full contact on Liam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope he likes this for sure!\u201d  Gavin can think about that, when he wasted no time but to head out and visit Liam\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier on, he was told to go round the back of the house, and that\u2019s because Liam will be relaxing himself outside on a hot sunny day.  So Gavin did just that, and he can see his cousin in the hot tub in speedos, relaxing himself for the time being.  So he would come closer and gives Liam a greeting with a wide smile and a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Cuz!  I see you\u2019re enjoying yourself so much, right?\u201d  Gavin wondered when greeted his younger cousin by the hot tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure am enjoying it, Gavin!  Let me climb out, so I can meet you face to face.\u201d  Liam smiled and wouldn\u2019t take long for the obese youngster to climb out of the hot tub and waddled towards Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind you, this kid weighs at 1,000lbs and he\u2019s only 10 years old, though he doesn\u2019t mind about being so infamous in public, and neither does Gavin, when he would decide to make a surprise for a youngster right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019see Liam, I\u2019ve got a surprise I wanna show you, but I\u2019m not gonna tell you what it\u2019s for yet.\u201d  Gavin says which he has something in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to see what it is.\u201d  Liam being so curious with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can only watch Gavin taking an item out from his bag, and it was what item he\u2019s showing it to Liam?</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s a 10 year old boy, who can be classed as a bookworm, trying to be so smart and giving best advices as much as possible.  That was the case when the day before, he was approached by a bully named Gavin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin is 5 years older than Liam, and at 15 years of age, he\u2019a the fattest teenager, who he can still move with that pear shaped body of his.  And this is despite the fact that he weighed at a massive 1,000lbs, which is gigantically huge for his age!  Plus, he\u2019s nothing but a bully, and each time he see smaller people, he would make threats to them, by giving him lunch food and money, and the obese teen seem to enjoy it so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Liam had to fight this to save any kid from Gavin\u2019s bullying spree, and even so by telling him that being so big and fat is not good for his health and needed to lose a lot of them.  That didn\u2019t take Gavin very kindly and warned that he was gonna make Liam suffer for body-shaming his weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later on when Liam felt rather strange for some reason, as if to say he was getting cursed or something?  He was at the front lawn when he was suddenly beginning to feel tired and that\u2019s when he had to lay on the grass and catch some sleep so sudden, which is unusual for a kid like Liam to be in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the longest sleep he ever had, Liam had this weird dream as if he had shrunk down to size and gets confronted by a giant obese Gavin, showing how good his fat really looks.  It was like the kid felt like something real it seems and he hoped that it could be some dream that could go away.  Well thankfully, Liam had begun to open his eyes, though feeling groggy from that faint earlier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to stand himself up to get his focus into full version, and when he did, something wasn\u2019t right, and he felt like he was not in the front than he fell asleep at before.  Whatever the case is, it looked a lot different so much, Liam can only wonder in great concern by looking around the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW..Where am I?  And why am in here?\u201d  Liam can only ask in a worrying tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he had his vision in full view though, it was the worst feeling he ever had, and Liam knows it.  So much so, he looked around the place, realising he\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright, so I had this idea based on the roleplay I tried to attempt, but hopefully I will explain to you as much as possible, just to give you the understanding from what I want for this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two boys, one is a 15 year old boy named Gavin, and 10 year old boy named Liam, who in different scenarios based of one of them would start of weighing at 1,000lbs!  He would either grow into a giant, or have another skinny boy shrunk down to size and get encountered by obese boy as such?  Though I will explain in each chapter as it goes along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I like for the rules is that there should be no sex, nudity, or scat by any means.  Plus, I want a very long length of the chapters, which I would not accept it you add chapter only by a sentence choice question.  Otherwise, it would be a waste of a chapter within that limit.  Also there should be no deaths in the scene, though the giant obese boy could squash a smaller boy by sitting on, laying in, or stomping on in any way.  No immobile when the boy is obese please!   No ending the story please, or this can be edited to make it as a choice or deleted by any means.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only transformation that can happen in here is growth and shrinking, so the growth can only go as big as the city buildings, and the boy can shrink down to 3 inches, though can make change the size slowly before reaching its limit if you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, please add the chapters whether you can.  It helps to figure it out easily, so yeah!  I do have a Discord to rp with as well.  So if you want have to have a go, either let me know by email me here, or on Discord pjc-fc#4186 and I\u2019ll see what we can come up for this plot.  Thanks! <br>\r\n</td>",
