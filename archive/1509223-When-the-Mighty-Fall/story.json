Exhausted from a long day\u2019s workout, he threw his gym bag on the floor, and plopped himself down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s home?!\u201d he barreled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg, one of Sam\u2019s three roommates, was the first to answer. Running down the stairs, the 5\u201910\u201d lacrosse player replied, \u201cI\u2019m here, bud! You back already? How was your workout?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude,\u201d Sam replied, \u201cI gotta stop going to that school gym of ours, and start working out at a real man\u2019s gym! Can you believe I had to ask the gym managers again for more weights? That gym\u2019s only built for weaklings! Don\u2019t they know I\u2019m too big for their puny weights!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the third time this year their gym had to order new weights for Sam! Yet, Sam just kept on getting stronger and stronger and, Greg thought as he watched Sam bend his Herculean arm, bigger and bigger. Greg smiled at the thought of Sam growing even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at, runt, with that goofy smile?\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou see the gym bag there; my workout clothes need some cleaning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg picked up the bag, and said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll get right to these!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fuckin\u2019 better!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg ran off to the basement, Sam smiled to himself. He could only imagine what dirty thoughts Greg had been thinking behind that smile. Sam enjoyed being an object of desire; and he enjoyed the power he had over everyone he knew, especially his roommates. Seeing them lust and slave over him only increased his desire to be bigger and more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg was down in the laundry room, another roommate, Brian, entered the room. Sam had known Brian for four years, ever since both men played on the college football team together. Sam was in his third year of college back then, and he took the young 6\u2019 freshman under his wing. Sam was kicked off the team for poor grades soon thereafter, but the men remained friends. It was then Sam turned to bodybuilding, and soon Brian\u2019s football career took off. A first-string quarterback, Brian led his team to a division championship title his junior year, and looked to be having similar success this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I heard your voice,\u201d Brian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, fucking took you long enough, runt, to get here. Where\u2019s my food?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re home an hour earlier than usual. I\u2019ve only just started cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grumbled to himself, then said, \u201cWell, it better be ready soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian nodded, knowing not to argue with his giant roommate. Instead he changed the subject, \u201cWhere\u2019s Zeke?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke, the other roommate, was a junior, and was Sam\u2019s lifting partner. Like Sam, Zeke was into bodybuilding, and he also sported a phenomenal physique. At just 5\u20191\u201d, though, he looked more like Sam\u2019s shadow then competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe dropped me off first, and drove off to get our supplements.\u201d Sam looked over at Brian, \u201cDude, I\u2019m going to go nap for a bit, but you better wake me up when my dinner\u2019s ready, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, boss,\u201d Brian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam lumbered up the stairs, he thought how good his life was. Three of the hottest men in school waited on him hand and foot, and that was just at home. At the gym, on campus, in town \u2026 there was no shortage of guys intimidated and/or attracted to him that he easily controlled. Life indeed was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he lay in bed, drifting into his nap, he had no idea all that was about to change; his days as Biggest Man on Campus were about to come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich story branch do you want to take?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he awoke, he found Zeke at the end of his bed, nudging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re finally awake!\u201d Zeke said, seeing Sam\u2019s eyes slowly open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d Sam muttered, half awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBud, but what about your dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam lay a little confused, but remembered he hadn\u2019t yet eaten dinner that night. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke responded, \u201cIt\u2019s past 8. We\u2019ve been trying to wake you up for over an hour!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sat up, real groggy. \u201cDammit! It\u2019s fucking past 8!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you really napped,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve kept your dinner warm. I\u2019ll go down and tell Bri that you\u2019ll be down in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Zeke left the room, Sam struggled to stand up. Man, was he exhausted! He looked around the room. He felt odd. Not just tired, something else was wrong, but he couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. Somehow the room looked different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now it\u2019s rather loose.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to his drawers and pulled out another shirt, only he noticed the same thing, as another once-tight shirt was loose on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam,\u201d Brian called up from the bottom of the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ve reheated your dinner! It\u2019s all ready for you now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook his head after trying yet a third shirt on with similar results. What was going on? He left his room, and headed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHERE\u2019S GREG?\u201d he yelled out, as he entered the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg ran into the room, after hearing his name called out. \u201cWhat is it, Sam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, what the fuck have you been doing to my laundry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stammered, clearly seeing Sam was mighty upset, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 Nothing. I mean, I just did laundry like I always have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsshole, you\u2019ve totally stretched out my shirts. Look at this!\u201d he said, pinching the shirt he had on him showing the extra room. \u201cI wore this shirt yesterday and it was skin tight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sam,\u201d Greg tried to apologize. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you even stretched the shirt I was wearing just before going to bed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, I haven\u2019t even touched that shirt. I only washed your dirty gym clothes today, and that stuff\u2019s still in the dryer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook his head, and grumbled to himself. However, deep down, he realized Greg was speaking the truth. If he did stretch out his shirts, it probably wasn\u2019t on purpose. He also knew what a kick Greg got out of seeing Sam in tight shirts. But even if Greg had accidentally stretched out his clothes, what happened to the shirt he had had on earlier that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething seemed wrong, something was definitely off, and not just his shirts. He didn\u2019t like it, and he felt unsettled. So much unsettled, he didn\u2019t even finish his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, you ok?\u201d Brian asked, seeing his plate with food still on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I guess I\u2019m just not particularly hungry tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the dining room, and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What\u2019s with all this jibberish?</i> \u201cLet me feel your forehead,\u201d Greg asked. He raised his arm up, and put the back of his hand against Sam\u2019s head. But Sam couldn\u2019t seem to be still; Greg's hand kept sliding up as Sam\u2019s forehead kept dropping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, can you stop bending your knees while I\u2019m trying to feel your forehead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arriving downstairs, Sam received another unsettling surprise. The furniture looked larger. Cushions on the sofa and chairs had plumped to larger sizes. The cabinet of the entertainment center loomed larger than usual in the room. One positive aspect of the changed perspective was the wide-screen television, which now looked even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be cool to watch games on a screen that size,\" Sam muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wandered into the kitchen, with still no sign of the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell are they?\" Sam growled irritably as he tugged on the waistband of his boxers. The underwear, like all his other clothing, was far too roomy on his downsized frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still felt thirsty, so he decided to grab a bottle of water from the fridge. He opened the door and noticed the shelves looked higher. Fetching one of the bottles, he noted that the plastic container felt odd in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was unscrewing the lid on the water bottle when he heard a loud ringing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned and walked across the room to the wall-mounted telephone. The house still had one land-line, although he and all the guys had their own cell phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered the phone. \"Yeah? Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was hopeful that one of his erstwhile roommates might be checking in with him and he could order them to get their ass back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he heard a strange voice, which was obviously modulated by some artificial means. The voice sounded like one of those strange computer voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAM?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, who the hell is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DID YOU GET YOUR SURPRISE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peal of artificial laughter sent chills down Sam's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T PLAY DUMB, BIG GUY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt a surge of anger. \"Who is this? Are you the one who did, uh, who caused me to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, Sam refused to state in words what he knew was happening. Fortunately, the mysterious caller didn't hesitate at all. \"DID I CAUSE YOU TO SHRINK?\" The voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, damn you! How did you do it? If you think you are going to get away with this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU ALONE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam cut off his tirade. \"Are you spying on me, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL COME FOR YOU SOON ENOUGH.\" The person on the other end of the line ended the call with a sharp click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam screamed curses at the phone. Once he spent his anger, he felt the unfamiliar sensation of fear settle into his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment, as he still held the phone receiver in his hand, his shorts slid over his hips and fell to the floor. Sam cursed again, and slammed the phone back into its cradle on the wall before bending to retrieve his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his dismay, he was still shrinking... not by much, but the process was mercilessly persistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost screamed when he heard someone coming in the front door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was an awkward moment when Sam encountered his roommates, who were returning from some time away from Sam and his constant demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three housemates, Greg, Brian and Zeke, stopped laughing and joking with each other when they laid eyes on the once proud and mighty Sam, who had managed to pull his too-big boxers back onto his frame when he heard them entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most unsettling aspect of the change in Sam's height was the new necessity of having to physically look up to his mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at him, Brian, the tallest of the roomies, made a whistle of astonishment. \"Would you look at Sam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Zeke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dude,\" Greg entered the conversation. \"You are downright puny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam bristled. \"It's not that bad,\" he said. \"You guys are just wanting to yank my chain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shook his head. \"Man, it is sort of bad,\" he insisted. \"You're short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even shorter than me now,\" Zeke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Sam protested. If he was shorter than 5'1\" Zeke, that meant he must be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd say you are not even five feet tall!\" Greg exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam got nervous. He had already lost almost two feet of height. He still had his muscular build, but he had the body of a freakin' munchkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this happening?\" Greg asked. Of the four guys, he was always the problem-solver. \"Have you done anything out of the ordinary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe someone is playing a prank,\" Brian suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you might have pissed off the wrong person,\" Zeke suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sam snapped. \"What could I have done to make someone make me shrink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke rolled his eyes. \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian laughed. \"You can come across as...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sam protested angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are demanding, dude,\" Brian dared to tell Sam. \"And you are a little arrogant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam wanted to put Brian in his place, but the six-foot Brian had now grown out of Sam's reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys seemed curious and interested in this bizarre change, but they didn't seem upset in the least. Sam began to wonder if one of his own roommates might be the cause of his shrinking. Could one of them have disguised his voice and made that mysterious phone call from earlier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg took charge. \"We need to stay calm and consider every possibility,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy for you to stay calm!\" Sam shouted. \"You aren't the one who's a midget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked down patiently and waited for Sam to cease his tirade. \"First, we should look for a pattern. The shrinking seems to be progressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Brian agreed. \"I wonder how small he could get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tried to hide his shivering. He hadn't really contemplated that the shrinking might do more than make him a very short guy. What if he kept dwindling down to the size of a doll? Or to the size of a bug?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone must be responsible for this,\" Greg said. \"Maybe we ought to make a list of suspects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Brian said. He looked down at Sam, who was struggling to keep his boxers around him. \"Got any idea who would be out to get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no one with the balls to do this to me!\" Sam declared hotly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of his mind, however, he kept hearing the voice of that strange caller, the person who had promised to come for him soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sam decided he didn't want to let the guys know how the caller had him frightened. His pride wouldn't let him admit that the strange call had gotten to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke yawned. \"It's really late,\" he said. \"Let's sleep on this and tackle it fresh in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Sam said. He led the way toward the stairs, but as he stepped on the first of the series of steps, his boxers dropped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the guys laughing behind him. Reaching down and grabbing them again, pulling them back to his waist, he shouted a curse over his shoulder and stomped toward his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in his own room with the door shut and locked, Sam let the boxers drop to the floor once again.  As much as he tried to put on that macho show for the rest of the guys, he was really starting to panic at this point.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What am I gonna do?  What am I gonna do?\" he quietly asked himself over and over again.  Even his voice was starting to sound different, a little less bold, not purely masculine sounding as it had been.  It was as if it was a pitch or two higher than before.  But Sam didn't have the time to settle very far into that thought.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Greg's idea of figuring out how this happened only seemed to elevate Sam's paranoia.  Greg could have easily been the one who did this to him, Sam knew full well how much the guy obsessed about him.  Zeke too, that little bastard had always been jealous of how big Sam was.  Even Brian, though the least likely of the trio, could have been holding some deep seeded grudge over all the things Sam had that he himself did not. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSam sighed as the wheels turned in his head.  Pacing nervously around the bedroom in the nude didn't seem to calm him down.  The guys seemed to think that the whole world would have loved to see himself get taken down in one way or another.  Could he really have that many enemies?  The whole world seemed to worship the ground he walked on, well most of the world.  His mother hadn't approved of his lifestyle, having cut him off financially about a year ago.  There would be no way in the world she'd do THIS to him though.  Coach Franklin didn't seem to appreciate when Sam had to quit the football team, but the team seemed to be doing just fine without him.  Besides, the guy was way too busy  and probably not apt to come up with this sort of a thing for revenge.  Shrinking Sam wouldn't get him back on the team by any means.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSam's thoughts were interrupted by a growing hum of voices out in the hallway, maybe one of the other rooms.  Sam imagined the guys discussing a conspiratory plot against him.  He wasn't ready to storm out there in his usual fashion, but he was still annoyed enough to do something about it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"KEEP IT THE FUCK DOWN YOU SHIT-BATS!!!\" he yelled, attempting to artificially deepen his voice by the third word.  There was no response to his demand.  Instead, the voices increased in volume and were punctuated by giggles and chortles.  \"COME ON ASSHOLES, I'M TRYING TO SLEEP HERE!!!\"  It didn't do any good, the chatter failed to cease.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSam was beyond frustrated.  He couldn't even figure out how to manage the way he was feeling.  He felt small, insignificant, ignorable.  But that was impossible, at least in his previous experience.  He tiptoed to the door in an attempt to listen closer to what the guys were talking about.  When he got to the door though, he stopped suddenly, catching his reflection in the cheap tall and narrow mirror mounted onto the door.  He had been so used to checking himself out in it on a daily basis, as if all the attention from others wasn't enough to feed his massive ego.  He would turn and pose, making sure to admire every group of muscles in his body in that mirror that only reflected back a portion of his wide body.  It was hanging from the top of the door and at 4 feet in length stopped just short of mid thigh.  Now, though, the top of his head came about halfway up the length of the mirror and the bottom of it chopped off his reflection around his pubes.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe seethed at the pathetic size of himself.  He'd never even met an adult man who was under five feet in stature, and now for whatever reason he had become just that!  With his mouth agape, Sam's right hand went on autopilot, feeling up his cobbled abs, massive (well at least proportionately) pecs, impressive traps, and the his left bicep.  It was almost as if he was looking for reassurance that although in a smaller size he was still all there.  The fleeting moment of examination turned bitter and Sam's face tightened into an angry visage.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Shrinking....\" Sam began slowly, \"I'm fucking SHRINKING!!!\"  Quick as lightning, he punched the mirror with an animalistic force, causing it to crack and shatter.  Had he been at his full size, his fist may have well gone straight through the door.  It relieved a little tension, as if the mirror had anything to do with the cause of his predicament.  Dimming the lights and stomping toward his bed, he had at least for a while shut out the persistent voices in the hallway.  He struggled a bit, climbing into the bed that was set high in order to fit some of his belongings underneath.  Sam positioned himself in the middle of the bed, ample space in all directions as once again the chattering housemates began to get the better of him. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSam didn't yell back at them again, what was the use of it?  Instead, he rolled over to access his nightstand, turning his alarm clock radio on and cranking the knob to full volume.  Loud rock music filled the room, drowning out any outside noise.  Sam began to relax a little after a few songs, but he was nowhere near tired enough to sleep.  His mind was way too occupied with everything going on.  Grunting, he decided to resort to a sure fire way of wearing himself out enough to sleep.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSam fumbled with his smaller hand, pulling open the drawer of his nightstand and fishing around for his lube.  Finally managing a grip on it, he knew instantly that the familiar bottle felt much bigger than it should have been.  Trying to ignore it and force himself into the mood, he squirted out a generous amount into his palm and slid his hand over his still limp dick.  He actually had to work this time to get an erection, the stress seemed to hold back his overactive libido.  He groped his balls, smacked his cock, pinched his nipples and even fingered his asshole before he managed an erection.  Before long, Sam got lost in the way his body felt, no one knew how to get him off like himself.  Laying on his back, his moans were drowned out by the blaring music.  For a while, he escaped from feeling so small, the rapturous sensations making him feel all man once again.  His body writhed and snaked about on top of the sheets as he massaged and smacked around his dick.  Sweat dripped from his body smearing wet marks across the bedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he had gotten himself to the point of orgasm.  With clenched teeth and a fist balling up a wad of sheets, his toes digging into the bed, a powerful jolt overtook him and propelled a fountain of cum out of him and onto his prized sculpted torso.  Heaving and red-faced he relaxed his entire body, staring at the ceiling and slowly catching his breath as he began to drift off into sleep, the music still blaring in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam wasn\u2019t asleep for too long until he woke up with the urge to piss.  He groggily turned over in bed and after 3 tries managed to slap down the off button on his alarm clock radio.   Clearing his throat, he looked at the led display that read 2:01 with a small \u201cam\u201d off in the bottom corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d he grumbled as he stretched out on the bed, it seemed a little bigger than it had just a few hours before, but not by that much luckily.  Making his way off the bed and cursing a little bit more, he stopped at the door to listen for anyone awake at this hour.  It didn\u2019t seem so.  Gingerly, he opened the door to the hallway and padded in the nude over to the hall bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toilet was big, the sink was big and Sam was once again feeling just as midget sized as he had become.  As he pissed, his balls hung just an inch above the rim of the toilet, and when he washed his hands he felt as if he were some small child who could have used a booster step to get up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe again and back in his room he wasn\u2019t tired anymore.  In fact, he felt as if he had just shot-gunned a series of energy drinks.  His suspicions of his housemates were growing exponentially at this point.  He imagined all sorts of nefarious plans they may have in store for him.  But with them asleep, now was his chance to get out of the house and try to figure out a way back to his tall hunky normal self.  He would need to get some clothes on first.  He walked right past the discarded boxers, figuring he\u2019d need something tighter fitting that would stay on his smaller body.  He dug through his underwear drawer, making a mess of the neatly folded pairs, finally producing a pair of tight bikini briefs.  Well, at least they had been tight.  Putting them on now, the waistband sagged and felt a little loose, and the fabric draped a bit and showed ample space inside instead of constricting on his package and showing off the detailed outline of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down with disapproval, Sam next laid his eyes on the row of size 16 shoes Zeke had neatly arranged alongside the wall of his room.  \u201cNone of these are going to even come close to fitting me now!\u201d he thought, and it would be true for his pants and shirts.  Maybe he could manage to rig something together though.  As Sam opened his closet, he was stopped short by the sound of laughter out of the cracked open window.  His interest was piqued and for the first time in his life, he automatically assumed that the laughter was directed at him.  The shade was open and the lights were on so anyone could have been looking in there at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying low and sadly not having to try very hard to do so, he crept up to the window, peering out onto the main road the fraternity was on he saw a small masses of people moving about without having too much of a sense of direction.  The bars were closing and drunken students were heading back to their respective dwellings.  Sam stayed at the window, observing them for a while and wishing he was having as blissful of a time as they all were.  It\u2019s kind of hard to let go and have fun when you are shrinking though.  His eyes followed groups of women and men stumbling and laughing and talking too loudly.  He heard clear recollections of all the rabble rousing that went on at the bars.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned the street from left to right, and when his line of sight came to the streetlight not far from the front doors of the frat house, he spied something out of the ordinary.  There was a figure standing underneath the artificial light and not moving a bit.  It was wearing a wide brimmed hat that shadowed away its face.  Sam couldn\u2019t tell right away, but the figure looked like it was facing him, watching him.   And then it waved at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s first reaction was to duck out of sight.  But as he crouched, he realized this was his chance.  This had to be the fucker who was shrinking him.  Sam may have been a lot smaller, but he was still a strong guy.  And with the way things were going, if he got much smaller he would be no match for anyone.  He had to confront this asshole now!  It was now or never.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sprung up, pushing the window open in a fluid motion and climbing up onto the sill.  He paused to see that the figure had remained in place before stepping out onto the narrow roof over the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fucker!!!\u201d  Sam yelled with a fury in his voice, \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking kill you!!!\u201d  But as he yelled, he lost his balance and fell forward, and just as suddenly was lurched back by his bikini briefs getting caught on the window frame.  His body see-sawed back and forth a few times until the underwear gave way, tearing apart and sending Sam plummeting over the roof and into the hedge of shrubs below.          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam looked around him. He was in an odd room. It was dark, though a few columns of light streamed in through some holes in the ceiling a couple feet above him. He then noticed the room he was in had no doors. There was no furniture either. Just him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around the room. The floor felt odd yet familiar. It was of no recognizable material he could think of. He pushed his hands against the walls; the walls seemed to be the same material as the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to worry. Where was he? How would he get out? He pounded against the walls, surprised that they seemed to shake a bit as he did so. The walls seemed flimsy, yet he couldn\u2019t break them. \u201cHelp!\u201d he screamed. \u201cI\u2019m trapped in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heard some pounding, and the floor began to shake. Suddenly, the roof seemed to rise up and disappear, and bright sunlight burst in, blinding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little fucker complaining in there?\u201d a familiar voice called from the heavens above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked up, his eyes adjusting to the light, when he saw the gigantic face of his roommate Greg. Shit, Greg was a giant; his face above seemed to fill the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you you were shrinking, dumbass!\u201d Greg bellowed. Sam cowered as Greg lowered his Mack truck-sized hand into the room, which Sam suddenly began to realize was just a shoebox. Backed into a corner, Sam had nowhere to go, as Greg\u2019s index finger rubbed against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow toy, let\u2019s you and I have some fun!\u201d Greg said, laughing, as he began to wrap his hand around Sam\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go, let me go!\u201d Sam yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you okay?\u201d Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam opened his eyes and looked around. He was in his bedroom, lying in his bed. He had just been dreaming. And there was Greg, standing at the side of his bed, staring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Sam asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I was just checking in on you. You were really upset last night, and I wanted to see if you had cooled down, and to see\u2026 to see\u2026\u201d Greg couldn\u2019t continue. He hadn\u2019t been able to get out of his mind the sight of Sam shrinking last night. He wanted to believe his housemates were right, that his eyes had been playing tricks on him. But then again, he also wanted to be right, as the thought of Sam shrinking had sparked an undeniable erotic charge in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo see what, asswipe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Greg gulped, hiding the tape measure he had grabbed from Sam\u2019s desk. He had hoped to measure Sam as he was sleeping, and hadn\u2019t been expecting him to wake so suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that behind your back?\u201d Sam growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing my ass,\u201d Sam barked, sitting up in bed. \u201cGive it to me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam reached out to grab Greg, but Greg had stepped back just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it to me!\u201d Sam cried, jumping out of bed, tripping on his sheets as he did so, landing on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that my tape measure?\u201d he said, clambering  up on his feet. \u201cThat fucking bet\u2026 ter\u2026 not\u2026\u201d But Sam went silent, as he rose to his feet, and found himself staring right at Greg\u2019s chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d Greg, noticeably taller was ecstatic. \u201cYou really are shrinking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror clutched at Sam\u2019s heart as he began stepping backward into the corner of his bedroom. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening!\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cThis must be some trick.\u201d He looked over and up at Greg, and saw his roommate had a rather mischievous look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sam, what happened to you? You\u2019re short!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked up at Brian, who was nearly a head taller than him now. But before he could say anything, Greg called out, \u201cBri, you didn\u2019t believe me last night. But look, Sammy really is shrinking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not shrinking!\u201d Sam yelled. \u201cThis is all some bad dream!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish this was a dream,\u201d Zeke said stumbling into the bedroom bleary-eyed. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the shouting?

Sam was still taller than his workout partner, but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, dude!\u201d Zeke said, \u201cLook at you! You shrunk! How tall are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood question,\u201d Greg said, pulling out the tape measure. \u201cLet\u2019s just see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the tape measure, and not wanting to know the answer to Zeke\u2019s question, Sam attempted to run, but Brian and Zeke blocked his exit. Despite his shorter height, he was still a powerhouse of muscle. He could easily take either man down on their own. But together, he was no match for the combined strength of both men. Still, it was quite a struggle for Greg to measure Sam, as arms and legs thrashed against. But in the end, Greg got his answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive-foot, five inches!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck, that\u2019s over a foot shorter than my normal height!</i> Sam thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh shit\u2026\u201d Sam grumbled as he had to stand on the tips of his bare toes to reach the milk on the top shelf in the door of the refrigerator.  This breakfast was going to be a monumental task for three reasons.  First of all, Sam had never cooked a thing in his life, unless making a peanut butter sandwich counted.  Even his idea of scrambling eggs was a stretch, but he had seen people performing the task enough that he thought he could handle it.  Secondly, his new smaller size was really going to put a wrench in the whole process.  Lastly, and definitely the most nerve wracking piece of the equation, was the fact that he had been put on the level of servicing the desires of his roommates.  Sam wasn\u2019t used to even doing favors for others, let alone being forced to do work as if he were an indentured servant.  The other two parts seemed manageable as Sam was used to physical and skill challenges, but the way his roommates were making him do this was crushing.  He would definitely have to plan his revenge.  After he grew back\u2026..if that was even going to happen\u2026.Sam didn\u2019t bother completing the thought as he fumbled with the milk.  He misjudged how heavy it was going to be, had gotten a little preoccupied with his thoughts and had gotten a bit off balance with the reaching.  He lost his grip and the full gallon of milk came plummeting to the ground \u2013plunk-.  Most of what was in the container was splattered across the cheap linoleum floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s a chorus of laughs that follow from the other room and Sam hears Greg warn that he better not be making a mess.  Zeke muses about the hard time Sam must be having.  Brian says something Sam doesn\u2019t catch, but they all seem to belly laugh in response.  Sam moans and grumbles a few choice words as he picks up the jug, just a bit of milk still left in it, tossing it onto the counter and not bothering to clean up the milk splayed all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he removed more groceries from the refrigerator and the cabinets things didn\u2019t go any better.  A few broken eggs ended up on the floor.  A fountain of flour puffed out of the bag when Sam squeezed too hard on it, leaving a coating of white powder all over him and a good portion of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed a cookbook.  The eggs and toast seemed intuitive enough, but pancakes and waffles?  That was another story entirely.  Only the cookbooks some of the guys had gotten from their families were all on top of the fridge.  Sam slid a chair over to the fridge and climbed on top of it, watching his footing and being as careful as he could be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the other room, Brian lays back in the recliner, putting his hands behind his head and stretching his legs out.  With a yawn and a sigh, he mused, \u201cAhhh, this is great, isn\u2019t it guys?  I mean now that Sam has been cut down to size, this house has been turned upside down in the best possible way.\u201d  Greg flipped on the tv and propped his feet on the cocktail table.  \u201cYeah man, as long as he\u2019s gonna prove himself to be useful.  I mean, I\u2019ve never seen Sam do much of anything but work out, eat, sleep and make everyone else do the rest.  If he can\u2019t contribute, we can always kick his ass out of the house.  It isn\u2019t as if he pays rent or is technically on the lease or anything, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian laughed in response and then seemed lost in thought, probably imagining that scenario out.  Zeke took a break from tapping at his smart phone, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious Greg.  I know Sam can be an ass, but underneath all that crap he\u2019s a good guy.  We can\u2019t just kick him out!  Where would he go?  And besides, who knows if he is still shrinking or if and when it\u2019s going to stop?  He could end up doll sized, or microscopic or something.  I really think after he finishes breakfast we should try to help him find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d  Zeke glanced back down at his phone, \u201cI\u2019ve been googling people shrinking and I can\u2019t find anyth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg cut Zeke off abruptly, \u201cZeke, give it a rest man!  There\u2019s no way I\u2019m lifting a finger to help Sam.  If any of us had a problem like he\u2019s having now, I guarantee he\u2019d do nothing but spend all the time he could rubbing it in and making things worse.  Just consider this some sort of karmic justice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian nodded and chimed in too, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you are so worried about Sam.  What the hell has he ever done for you?  He only gives you any attention when he wants something from you or maybe if he wants to make you feel like shit.  It\u2019s like you\u2019re in love with him or something.  Fuck Sam dude, move on with your life, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some guy out there for you.\u201d  Brian sniffed the air a bit, \u201cHey, you guys smell something burning?\u201d  Just as Greg got up from the couch, all three of them heard another loud crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the kitchen Sam was frustrated enough that he was ready to cry.  Sitting in the middle of the floor, his shorts knotted and tangled around his ankles, he was mired in various food products that pooled out around him.  A tipped over stool lay not far from him, an upside down frying pan smoldering the floor near some burnt pieces of bacon tossed outside of it.  Sam\u2019s face and chest were covered in pancake batter, the cracked dripping bowl of batter was rolling to a halt on the floor with him.  Right behind him, Sam heard a heavy footfall.  It was is someone had snuck up on him and then stamped a foot down as if to announce his presence.  Sam turned and looked up at the figure just as the toaster popped out 4 pieces of blackened toast.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He got a mild thrill out of tantalizing his roommates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it felt different, as if it made him more vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing almost two feet shorter than usual made for some awkwardness with even the mundane task of cracking open eggs. He stood at the kitchen sink, cracking the eggs into a glass bowl, but the sink was now almost level with his chest. He missed once, and the accident caused the egg yolk to disappear down the drain instead of into his bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard laughter and turned to see Zeke had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having difficulty?\" Zeke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Sam lied, but he moved the bowl down to crotch level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, let me help you out,\" Zeke said. \"I do owe you a lot for helping me in the gym and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can,\" Zeke said, but he grabbed the bowl. As he moved across the kitchen, he glanced back at Sam's great ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are still gorgeous, just more compact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke about this! I look like a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're about the same height. Does that mean you have always thought I look like a freak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's mouth opened, but then he closed it. He didn't know what to say. \"It's not the same,\" he decided. \"You are used to being short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and now maybe you'll have to learn the same lessons.\" Having finished with the eggs, he handed the bowl back to Sam. \"I think the deal was you would make breakfast for us, so I will not stand in your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam groaned. If he hadn't antagonized Zeke,  this would have been a much simpler task. But old habits die hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he figured that,  based on Zeke's attitude, he could rule him out as a suspect. That left Greg or Brian, or both of them. Had they done this to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept pondering on his dilemma as he finished the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also learned one  other important lesson. Frying bacon and working naked do not go well together. Several times he got splattered by hot sizzling grease splatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppealing aromas announced when he was nearly finished, and the guys all gathered at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks good,\" Greg announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian, standing next to Sam, reached down and rubbed his little buddy's head. \"You did good, runt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam pushed away Brian's hand, but the bigger guy just laughed and had a seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey demolished all the food in just minutes that had taken Sam nearly an hour to prepare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, can we do something about me?\" Sam asked, trying to sound calm and reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys stood from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll discuss it in the living room,\" Brian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam started to follow, but Brian turned. \"I said that we... the three of us... would discuss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Sam began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your job is to clear the table and wash the dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam swallowed hard, and declined to argue.

Think you can get all our wash done by lunchtime?\" Brian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys gotta be fucking kidding me,\" Sam glared back. \"I don't do laundry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Greg said, stepping somewhat menacingly toward Sam until there was barely an inch between them. Greg peered down at his nearly foot shorter housemate. \"I'm sure what you really meant to say was that you didn't use to do laundry. But today we're gonna change all that, hunh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't help but feel somewhat intimidated by the towering Greg. Even though, truth be told, Sam still had the strength to house Greg if need be, the strange feeling of having to turn his head so high up to look into Greg's eyes made him feel small, weak, vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gulped, \"I \u2026 I \u2026 \" Then, collecting himself, and in an effort to look a little tough, responded. \"Yeah, sure! I got this laundry thing! Today! But just this once, guys! I'm sure soon I'll be back to my old height, and then\u2026.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a threat, pipsqueak?\" Greg quickly cut him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um \u2026 umm\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think so! Now, shut your trap, and get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam didn't need to be told twice. Still clasping his ridiculously oversized boxers, he hurried out his bedroom door, leaving the guys behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo freaked out was Sam that he didn't hear the conversation he left behind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we being too rough on him?\" Zeke asked. He knew what it was like to be picked on for being short, and was beginning to feel some pangs of guilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah!!\" Greg responded, \"Just think what a prick he's been to us! I don't how this shrinking thing has happened, but dude, I feel like it's Christmas morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian had been quiet a bit, but then responded, \"Jeez, just think \u2026 if he ever regains his size, he's gonna be an even bigger asshole to us, guys! Maybe, Zeke's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Greg was quick with the response, \"Yeah, well, we'll just have to really teach him a lesson about how it feels to be picked on by others\u2026. Freak him out real good, so he never treats us like shit again, no matter what size he is.\" He paused, and then smiled, \"Besides, what if he doesn't grow back to his old size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" Zeke added, asking the question that was on all their minds, \"What if he gets even smaller?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sam was down in the basement, having collected baskets of laundry from each of the guys' rooms upstairs. In his efforts to carry the surprisingly heavy loads down the stairs, he had realized he had to give up the additional burden of carrying his own boxers. Somewhere upstairs he had left his boxers on the floor. Now, standing naked in front of the washing machines, he felt absolutely vulnerable, too vulnerable to face his huge housemates naked. To think that just days before, clothes had been no big issue to him. Man, how he loved parading around half or entirely nude to show off his superiority to his housemates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at the baskets in front of him, and wondered if any of his housemates' clothes would fit. He bypassed Brian's pile, realizing that the 6' quarterback's wardrobe was likely to be too big on him. He instead looked through Greg's pile first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a relatively clean T-shirt, he slipped it on over his head. The shirt fell loosely over his body and way past his waist. \"Fuck!\" he uttered to himself, as he realized just how much he was swimming in \"puny\" Greg's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ripped off the shirt, and reluctantly turned to Zeke's pile. He had remembered shopping for gym clothes with Zeke in the past, and how he used to chuckle at all the little clothes Zeke had to purchase. Now, it was he rummaging  through the Smalls and Extra Smalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a pair of shorts first, and slipped them on. As he realized he had to tug a little to get the shorts over his massive quads, he smiled with a strange sense relief. Yeah, these were going to do just fine. As he buttoned the shorts, he looked down. The shorts were a just a tad loose around the waist, and were longer on his leg than what he had remembered how they appeared on Zeke. But, how snugly they fit around Sam's legs, outlining the powerful muscles underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had always wondered how he and Zeke fared in terms of their proportions. If both men were ever to be the same height, who'd be the more muscular? He returned to Zeke's pile, and found one of Zeke's tanktops. He grabbed it, slipped it over his head, and soon had the answer to his question. He had struggle a little, stretching the fabric just to fit it over his immense chest. He even needed to breathe in deeply, so that he could roll the rest down over his abs. On Zeke, he remembered that the tanktop still hung loosely. But on Sam, though he was now two inches shorter, it was an remarkably tight fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, realizing that he truly was the most muscular of his housemates, he regained his old sense of power and hugeness. But that moment was brief, as he heard footsteps on the stairs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was Zeke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke continued his way down the stairs. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d check in, and \u2026 um \u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam retorted. \u201cGo on, finish what you were going to say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, I just wanted to see how you were doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please. I\u2019m sure you came down here to look at the carnie freak? Hunh, you were probably hoping to see if I shrank some more, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was quiet. He really had been worried about Sam, and had come down to check on him. At the same time, though, there was a feeling inside him he couldn\u2019t deny \u2013 how turned on he felt knowing that the big Sam he always admired and who always seemed emotionally distant to him was now smaller than him and perhaps more approachable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sam continued, \u201cI\u2019m the same size as when you last saw me. So, you can leave me alone now. I got work to do, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned back to the piles of laundry. He had originally considered starting with Zeke\u2019s clothes, since they seemed to be a good fit on him too. But, with Zeke down here now, no doubt keeping an eye on him, he decided to start with Greg\u2019s clothes instead. He grabbed an armful of shirts, and walked over to the top-loading washing machine. He was surprised how high the top was, though it was still quite manageable to toss the clothes into the machine. He returned to the pile and grabbed another arm load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, Zeke stood watching, somewhat dazed and speechless. Eventually he snapped to, and headed over to Sam, \u201cHey bud, how can I help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grunted, but he could tell that Zeke was being sincere. \u201cUm, sure. Why don\u2019t you start sorting some of Brian\u2019s clothes while I finish with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke did as he was told, separating Brian\u2019s whites from his darks. All the while, he looked over at Sam, who was busy putting the last load of wash into the machine. Sam looked up at the shelf above the machines, where the detergent bottle was kept. <i>Damn, that\u2019s pretty high\u2026</i> Sam stretched as much as he could, but couldn\u2019t reach the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling frustrated, he turned and grunted to Zeke, \u201cUm... some help here, please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke stopped what was he doing and immediately joined Sam by the machine. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you \u2026 um \u2026 get the detergent for me?\u201d Sam flushed with embarrassment. \u201cI can\u2019t \u2026 er \u2026 reach \u2026 it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked at the detergent container, and began to snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny, asshole? Jeez, I thought you were here to help me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, calm down, bud,\u201d Zeke said, trying to suppress laughter. \u201cI\u2019m just laughing because I\u2019m not used to being the only one not able to reach things on the upper shelves. Here, check this out.\u201d Zeke stretched his arms up, and sure enough, he just barely missed the shelf. Zeke then walked to the side of the machine, and grabbed a stepstool. \u201cWhenever it\u2019s my time for laundry, I need to use this.\u201d Zeke stepped onto the stool, grabbed the detergent, and handed it to Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Sam said, then hastily added, \u201cand I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke smiled, as he stepped off the stool. \u201cHey, no problem. I\u2019m just glad I have a partner now to battle those big jerks upstairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re such assholes,\u201d Sam agreed, suddenly feeling somewhat more relaxed having Zeke around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke could also feel the tension between each other begin to fade. \u201cHey boss, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you. Are those my clothes you\u2019re wearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUm, yeah. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d He stood there for a moment staring at Sam. Zeke always thought he was a mighty huge guy at his size, but Sam looked enormous, stretching his clothes out to their limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you looking at now?\u201d Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. Just \u2026 my clothes fit you so much better than they do me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam said smugly. \u201cI may be a foot and half shorter, but I\u2019m still pretty huge, hunh?\u201d He puffed out his chest a bit, exaggerating even more the tight fit of Zeke\u2019s tanktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was a bit speechless. He had always been a little turned on seeing Sam flex and strut. But seeing the more compact Sam now, still so cocky despite his reduced size, caused Zeke to suddenly feel overwhelmed by desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this was lost on Sam, who had noticed Zeke lust after him during their workouts. \u201cSomeone\u2019s quiet all of sudden,\u201d Sam mocked. He gestured to Zeke\u2019s shorts, which couldn\u2019t hide the hard-on underneath. \u201cWhat? Little fag turned on by my hugeness?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had had dreams of feeling the power of those incredible arms and the force contained in that powerful chest.

But Zeke had always been afraid of making a move himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was stopping him?</i> Before, when Sam towered over him by over a foot, he had seemed like an unapproachable god. But here he was, reduced down to mere mortal size, with all those majestic proportions intact. As Sam continued to preen about, flexing while jabbering on about his \u201chugeness,\u201d Zeke\u2019s felt he could no longer control himself as a new confidence began to stir within. Now, with his height advantage, he had his chance. He swelled up his own chest, and began to advance toward Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched as his now-taller workout buddy approached him. There was an undeniable look of hunger or perhaps rage in Zeke\u2019s eyes. Sam wondered if he had gone too far in teasing Zeke. He stepped back, but found himself up against the washing machine.

Yet at the same time, the return of Sam\u2019s cocky attitude was reminding Zeke what a jerk Sam could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Sam, preening and jabbering on about his hugeness. <i>\u201cHugeness\u201d? Jeez, the guy\u2019s not even five feet tall!</i> Zeke had been sorry for the poor guy, but Sam\u2019s oversized ego had returned in full force, and it was just too much. Zeke had long tired of being picked on for his short height, especially by Sam, the man he idolized. And he was suddenly flooded with memories of all the times Sam referred to him with such names as Shorty, Pipsqueak, and Shrimp. But that wasn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be the case anymore after Sam\u2019s shrinking today. Perhaps it was time to remind Sam of his new pecking order in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke folded his arms across his chest, and stepped toward Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched his now-taller workout buddy approaching him. There was an undeniable look of anger in Zeke\u2019s eyes. Sam wondered if he had gone too far in teasing Zeke. Should he apologize? He stepped back, but found himself up against the washing machine. Feeling trapped, Sam worried about Zeke\u2019s intentions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke continued advancing until there was barely an inch between them. The close proximity between them emphasized their height difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Zeke barked while looking down at Sam. \u201cWho you calling a <i>little fag</i>?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had never seen Zeke angry before. And from his current height and viewpoint, seeing Zeke so angry sent chills down his spine. Sam may have been the stronger of the two, but Zeke was no slouch and would put up a good fight. And right now, all of Zeke\u2019s muscles seemed all tensed up, ready for a good thrashing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of <i>little</i> Zeke being such a potential threat freaked Sam out. He felt nervous, and vulnerable, and downright small. He hated looking up into Zeke\u2019s eyes, and he cowered back against the washing machine. The size of Zeke continued to overpower him, as if he were getting even bigger, wider, taller with each second. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">TALLER?</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s mind raced to earlier in the day. After his last shrinking spell, he had been eye-to-nose with Zeke, but now he was staring right at Zeke\u2019s mouth, and then watched as Zeke\u2019s mouth rose up higher. He could feel Zeke\u2019s tight clothes begin to slack, and the top of the washing machine rise up his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for answer!\u201d Zeke\u2019s voice seemed to boom. \u201cWho are you to call me <i>little</i>?\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he had better say something to Zeke, Sam looked back up. He had to bend his neck even more now to look into Zeke\u2019s eyes. \u201cZeke, I\u2019m sorry!

Where was all this pent-up anger coming from? Zeke had always been a sweet guy. He never dared raise his voice to him. He had always worshipped the ground he walked on \u2026 happily, at least Sam thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke continued, \"All those times in the gym you'd humiliate me, joking in front of everyone about how light the weights I lifted were. And all those the times with the guys, in which you'd tease and get everyone to laugh at me. Making everyone call me Shorty. Jeez, you even had all the women at school treating me as if I were a little boy\u2026. And all along, I just stood around and taken it. Well, no more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was feeling the washing machine behind him continue to rise. He realized he had already shrunk another inch, maybe two. Sensing Zeke's anger continue to rise, he knew he was going to have to make a break for it, get away, until Zeke had time to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the washing machine buzzed, and Zeke's eyes diverted to it. Sam knew this was his chance, and quick darted to Zeke's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sam was not fast enough, as he felt Zeke's arm grab him round the waist, and with surprising force push him back against the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going? We're not done here!\" Zeke growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was surprised by Zeke's gruff turn, yet the act of being pushed back against the machine triggered his own feelings of anger. He forgot about his shrinking. Nobody pushed Sam around. Nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's breathing intensified, and the muscles throughout his body tensed, preparing for fight. He raised both his arms up, and shoved Zeke back, sneering, \"Don't you dare fucking push me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam may now be the shorter of the guys, but he was still quite the powerhouse, and Zeke felt the full impact of Sam's blow, teetering back a few steps and nearly falling on his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled, realizing he still had some force to him. Unafraid, now that his first move had had such an impact, and forgetting their height differences, he lunged toward Zeke, desiring nothing more than to take down this Pipsqueak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was still recovering from Sam's shove, when he saw Sam rushing straight toward him, then\u2026 BAM! Sam was on top of him, as the two men tumbled to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was no stranger to the wrestling mats, and his arms remembered moves from years ago. He grappled around Zeke now, quickly taking the offensive, and seeking to pin him down. He needed to prove once and for all to Zeke that he was still boss around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke struggled against Sam's might, doing what he could to deflect Sam's moves. It was a tough struggle, but he found he was able to hold his own, at least for the moment. And so, the two men continued to tumbled about, Sam the constant aggressor, Zeke in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moves later, and Sam had wrapped his legs around Zeke's torso. Zeke felt his air supply restricted at the pressure building against his chest. Gathering all his strength, he stretched both his arms, unlocking Sam's hold, and causing Sam to fall backward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke then leapt onto Sam's body, ready now to take on the offense. But Sam was ready for him, deflecting Zeke's, holding off all attacks, while also recuperating from the recent blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam kept on holding off Zeke, but he could feel the force of Zeke's moves increasing. Zeke seemed stronger now, and in more control. Likewise, Zeke noticed Sam was getting easier to manipulate and move. Zeke could feel his confidence build, and continued to build on his attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam burned inside, grouping what anger was left inside him, to motivate his strength to release himself from Zeke's grasp. Sam was able to briefly slip from Zeke's hold, but moments later Zeke was back on top of him, stronger than before. Zeke's  impossibly long arms now wrapped around Sam, flipping him face down, and then \u2026 whoosh \u2026 Sam felt the pressure of Zeke flopping down on Sam's back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tried relentlessly to escape from Zeke as got in position of his final hold, Sam's exertions were to no avail. Zeke's hold was too strong for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke began to cackle, enjoying his victory over his onetime torturer. How good it felt to defeat the mighty Sam! To have biggest guy he had ever known now helpless beneath him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUUUUCCKKK!!!\" he yelled triumphantly, \"That felt awesome!\" He could feel Sam wriggle helplessly beneath him.

In fact, he felt downright pathetic, especially as the top of his head began to dip below Zeke's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke snickered, and began to laugh. \"Man, look how small you've gotten. I know children who are taller than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Sam was feeling awfully like a child, swimming as he was now in Zeke's clothes. In fact, he was reminded of a time many, many years ago, when he was just a little kid, and enjoyed trying on his father's clothes, and how his dad's shirts just hung on him. Back then, he dreamed to be as big as his dad. Naw, actually he wanted to be even bigger. And he worked his way up to dwarfing his dad. But now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez, he was so small back then as a child. Small. Just thinking of that word caused his body to spasm, and then a couple more inches suddenly melted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked away from the clothes on, up and there in front of him was the large expanse of Zeke's chest. God, Zeke was huge! Sam had never seen a chest so large, so wide. No one's body had ever even compared to his own! Yet at his height, Zeke's chest appeared well over 70 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke laughed at the sight of Sam leering at his own chest. \"Hah, yeah boy! That's what a real man's chest looks like!\" he said, repeating the exact words Sam had said to him just days before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nZeke punctuated this by taking a deep breath and puffing out his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stared in amazement, as the chest in front of him grew and grew, expanding, while also rising higher and higher. He was speechless. So much so that he hadn't realized Zeke's shorts had fallen off him, and his tanktop shoulder straps were nearing the tips of his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke continued to flex, feeling incredibly powerful next to his dwindling housemate. Sam was at least a foot shorter than him now, and continuing to shrink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam knew he was tiny, downright puny, and felt ridiculously small next to the towering Zeke. As an attempt to comfort himself, he looked down at his own body. The magnificent portions were still there, but they looked odd in the tanktop tent that draped down his thighs. Still, pathetically he flexed his guns, knowing their proportions far excelled most other men, no matter what his height was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"How cute!

Sammy, you want some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, noticing that Greg\u2019s vindictive side was beginning to chill, smiled and accepted Greg\u2019s offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg headed into the kitchen and soon came back with beers for all the guys. He handed Sam the bottle first. Sam couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how huge the bottle was. \u201cMan, this is the biggest beer I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Then, for the first time since his shrinking began, he laughed. \u201cHa, guess there\u2019s some good to come out of all this shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg cracked a smile and patted Sam on the head, before heading over to Brian and giving him his beer.

Yeah, I\u2019ll join you.\u201d He took another big chug then put beer down. He was feeling wobbly, and lightheaded, a little drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d Zeke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys went downstairs to where they kept their weights. Sam looked at all the giant weights. They looked so big and heavy. He tried to lift a 100-pounder, but it was too heavy. He felt so weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sam, looks like you need to try some lighter weights,\u201d said Zeke. Zeke picked up the 100-pounder with ease, and began curling it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked up at Zeke, and at the giant weight going up and down. Zeke was so strong, Sam thought. Just look at that giant bicep pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked down at Sam, and sees him staring. \u201cYou like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded, \u201cI had no idea how big you are!\u201d Sam wouldn\u2019t normally say such nice things to Zeke, but he was feeling the beer, and couldn\u2019t hold back his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I am pretty big! I am glad you finally noticed! But, you\u2019re Sam. You\u2019re huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I used to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just look at that arm of yours. It\u2019s incredible.!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so.\u201d Sam felt confident enough now to pick up a 50 pounder. It didn\u2019t feel as heavy as he feared, and he begin curling, feeling the pump.  Now it was Zeke staring at little Sam. He always admired Sam\u2019s big body, but was afraid to show it. Now, he didn\u2019t feeling nervous staring at Sam. And Sam was liking the giant Zeke staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam finished his set. \u201cNow what?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sam then got up, and headed off to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, stop right there!\u201d Greg said to Brian suddenly, after Sam had left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? This is just some old black-and-white movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it looks familiar.\u201d Greg stared at the screen for a couple moments, then yelled out, \u201cOh my God, the irony!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Brian asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s <i>The Incredible Shrinking Man</i>, dude!

Sam meanwhile climbed back onto the couch, and looked up at the television set, \u201cWhat\u2019re you guys yakkin\u2019 on about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked down at Sam, \u201cSee that guy, Sammy! He\u2019s just like you. He\u2019s also shrinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched the man Greg referred to in a scene talking to a doctor. He sipped his beer in fascination as the doctor told the man what might be the cause of his shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sammy, maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to you! You been near any toxic chemicals lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook his head no, and continued to watch, occasionally sipping more beer. A few scenes later, the man\u2019s wife and his brother were in a conversation. Then suddenly, they spoke to the man, who was revealed to be child-size and sitting in a large armchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sammy, that\u2019s just like you!\u201d Brian taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam continued to watch. It was just like him. That guy looked so small, meaning that must be what he looked like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took another swig of beer, marveling again at the bottle\u2019s size and heft. He hadn\u2019t realized that the tight child-size shirt he had been wearing was now a little loose on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had a hard time watching the scenes that followed. Though soon the man had found a way to stop shrinking, he looked so small and vulnerable around his large furniture and his large wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stopped watching the movie and instead looked at his beer bottle. He realized how funny it looked at his size. So huge, so tall, so thick. He needed to hold it with both his hands. But, there was something awesome about it, too. He thought to himself that after he gets back to normal size, he would start his own brewery, making super-oversized bottles like these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, and almost thought he saw the beer bottle get even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more scenes in the movie passed, and the man had now begun having an affair with a sideshow midget. Then suddenly, the man realized he was shorter than the midget. He was shrinking again. Sam sat up a bit, alarmed, not noticing the straps to his overalls tumble over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen, in the next scene after a commercial break, the man was revealed to be living in a dollhouse, Sam screamed out. \u201cStop it! Stop this! I can\u2019t watch this anymore!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Greg had been rapt into watching the movie, and hadn\u2019t paid Sam much attention.  They were a little shocked to hear him screaming so loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian quickly turned off the television set. \u201cDude, what\u2019s your prob\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian stopped in shock. Greg quick looked over at Sam, and his jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam asked, feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg then smiled weakly, and said, \u201cI dunno how to tell you this, but you\u2019ve shrunk some more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Sam was now just:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since when were Zeke's feet so huge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant Zeke's calves balooned out as he squatted down to get a better veiw of shrunken, two foot tall Sam. \"Alone at last lil' Sam.\" Zeke rumbled ominously.</span></div></div>",

There was no telling what kinds of torture his housemates had planned for him next. He better get back to laundry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he returned to the piles, Sam had nearly forgot about his most recent shrinking episode. That is, until he quickly realized how much looser Zeke's clothes were on him now. And how much bigger, taller, higher everything was around him \u2026 the washing machine and dryer, the laundry baskets,  and the shelves \u2026 man, would he even be able to reach those shelves now, even with the help of the step stool?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, though, the shrinking seemed to have stopped. He looked around him, and tried to gauge his new height. He had loss at least a few inches. He dreaded to think that he might be just 4 and a half feet tall, maybe less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe washing machine buzzed the end of the cycle, and Sam walked over to it. Sam could continued to see the changes in height, as he struggled a little to raise the lid of the top-loading machine all the way up. Even worse, after he started to unload the wash, he realized it would be quite tricky for him to reach the clothes on the bottom of the machine. With a tinge of sadness, he grabbed the step stool and used it to prop him enough to reach the final clothes.  As he leaned in, though, he could feel Zeke's loose shorts travel down his leg.... He was going to have to do something about these clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started the dry cycle for Greg's clothes, he had an idea. He could do his best to shrink some of Zeke's clothes. So, he grabbed a couple of Zeke's T-shirts and a couple pairs of shorts, tossed them in the washer, and started a hot water cycle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour and half later, Sam reviewed the results. They had been somewhat disappointing.Most of the shirts had barely changed. Though one tanktop at least fit a little snugly on him. Though not quite as tight a fit as Zeke's clothes had been before, it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for shorts, he had experienced less success. They remained loose, and draped his legs. But, he was able to find a rope in the basement that he could use as a makeshift belt. And the length, though not ideal, was okay. Though Zeke's short shorts looked more like board shorts on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam loaded the final wash containing Brian's and the remains of Zeke's clothes into the dryer, and as the cycle began, he began to think about his next moves. It had been awfully quiet upstairs. <i>What were they planning up there?</i> He shuddered to think what would happen to him after he brought up the wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what else could he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He smirked slightly when he heard the bed-springs groan with relief from his titanic weight. Standing up straight he stretched his aching back muscles. The beds in the frat house weren't exactly what you would call comfortable. Sam scratched his rippling abs contentedly; that was a nice nap he'd had, but damn was he hungry. Sam went over to his closet. Inside were various muscle shirts and general workout attire, all were neatly folded and piled. It was great having servants; Sam thought, scratching his washboard abs again, smiling as he started to caress them gently. Feeling each and every rise and fall of their magnificently sculpted perfection. With a small amount of regret he stopped, and quickly wrenched a pair of boxers and sweat pants out of the closet. Sam liked to sleep naked; a habit that greatly excited all three of his housemates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled on the sweat pants he noticed that the felt a little off, but he dismissed the thought, and thundered down the stairs to the frat kitchen. His house mates were waiting for him, food still sitting on their plates. Likely out of respect, or outright worship. Sam walked and took his seat at the head of the table, he took his time, forcing his housemates to notice that he didn't have a shirt on. Not that it would make much of a difference, his shirts were already skin tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys should have woke me up earlier.\" He said, the depth and volume of his voice produced quite an echo. Greg turned his head away, his face noticeably redder than usual. Brian covered his eyes in a vain attempt to keep Sam from seeing his lustful gaze, following the ripples of Sam's titanic muscles longingly. Zeke just looked down, as if he was locked in a life or death staring contest with his food. Sam started pounding down his food. Sam noticed again that something looked a little off...Greg looked bigger. In fact everything looked slightly bigger. Sam just shoved the thought aside, as he did most other problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zeke!\" Sam hollered, despite the fact that Zeke was only a few feet away. Sam smirked at how Zeke flinched at the sound of Sam shouting his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Zeke replied quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!? I can't hear you from all the way down there.\" Sam said, raising his voice as if Zeke was at the bottom of a cliff. He liked making other people feel tiny, and Zeke who only came up to Sam's bulging pecs was the easiest target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Sam!?\" Zeke replied, raising his voice slightly so the behemoth sitting across from him wouldn't become angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get the supplements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Sam said, leaning back in his chair, which creaked as his weight shifted on it. \"You know, it'd be good if you started taking them too, shrimp. Maybe then I might not step on you by accident as much. \" Sam continued as he cleared his plate. He tossed the empty plate in the direction of Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want seconds big guy?\" Brian said, but Sam just waved his servant of with a muscular arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke shifted uncomfortably in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They help, I just take them now 'cause I wanna get even bigger!\" Sam flexed to accentuate his point. Greg exhaled audibly as he watched Sam's powerful bicep bulge outward. Zeke just gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an odd feeling came over Sam, he felt a little dizzy, he steadied himself using his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you, uh, feeling okay Sam?\" Greg asked. Sam's head quickly cleared. Okay, something was up, now everything looked bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

He stopped on a channel showing a bodybuilding competition. \"Ha ha, this oughta be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched as a lightweight bodybuilder was being interviewed. On the screen, the bodybuilder's height flashed: 5'5\". \"Look at that Zekey! That shrimpboat's bigger than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke huffed a bit in his chair. \"Yeah, well I got more muscle on me than he'll probably ever have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that straight!

Sam guzzled his beer, and handed the bottle to Brian. \"Bri, you hold this for me in between swigs. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a commercial break, it was time for the superheavies to take the stage. First up was one guy who stood at 5'10\", and weighed in at 240 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the puny man!\" Sam cracked at the TV. \"I swear, I got more than 100 pounds on him, and half a foot, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian shifted awkwardly on the couch. It had been awhile since he had last heard about Sam's stats. Well over 300 pounds! Fuck, was he huge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian wasn't the only guy shifting on the couch. Sam was feeling a little queazy. He tried to dodge the odd feeling and instead concentrated on the TV. \"Fuckin' shrimpboats! They don't know the meaning of the word HUGE! Superheavy, my ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke perked up, and asked his buddy, \"Hey boss, just how much you weighing anyway these days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam laughed, and smiled, raising his titanic arm up and flexing. \"345 pounds, dude!

But despite his exhaustion, he wasn't going to say No to this opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, big guy!\" Greg said, his voice slightly cracking, as he stared at the muscular bulk on the couch. Man, he couldn't wait to get his hands on that body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam lumbered to his feet. Greg's head immediately looked up higher than he needed to as Sam rose. That's funny, Greg thought, why'd he think Sam was taller.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you looking at?\" Sam asked, noticing Greg behaving oddly, staring at his forehead. Sam turned around, as if he half expected to see someone taller behind him, but no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I \u2026 don't \u2026 know. I \u2026 oh, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grunted. \"Good. Well, I'll meet you in your room.\" Sam then waddled off to Greg's room, where the massage table lay in wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg meanwhile ran to the bathroom, and grabbed his oils and massage gear. He then joined Sam, who was already lying face down completely naked on the table. Sam felt there was no need for a towel. Greg couldn't help but gulp, as he looked at Sam's tight round bubble butt, which seemed to rise quite perkily. Greg held his breath for a few seconds, before advancing toward Sam to begin the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started by pouring a little oil on Sam's back. All of Sam's massive muscles suddenly tensed as the cool oil settled on his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, that's a little chilly,\" Sam mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg took another deep breath, realizing that he was already hard. He slowly rubbed some oil on his hands, and then it was time to dig in. He spread the oil across Sam's upper back, needing to pour some extra on to cover its full expanse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Greg prepared to start on Sam's shoulders. Those shoulders were regularly loaded with knots, especially after a full day's workout. On some days, working those kinks out would wear Greg out completely, leaving him little to no energy to work on the rest of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg began kneading into Sam's muscles, starting with his left shoulder. He kept his calm, and tried not to concentrate on how turned on he was to have such awesome muscle in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grunted. Greg's hands had taken on a stronger touch than he had remembered, and seemed to be covering more area of his back. But this seemingly new intensity and increased pressure brought about a new sense of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg meanwhile had discovered something rather surprising. Unlike previous massages, tonight he found that there were very few knots he needed to work on. Sam's shoulders were incredibly relaxed, perhaps moreso than ever before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you must be feeling pretty chill today. I can hardly find any knots on you\u2026,\" Greg said, as he moved much earlier than usual to the other shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm\u2026,\" Sam quietly groaned. \"Yeah, I'm feeling real good today\u2026\" he quietly uttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's extra-strong massage was having a powerful effect on Sam. He found himself feeling light headed, like he was losing a little touch of reality, as if his whole body was getting lighter, and he were beginning to float. Yet for some reason, he was also finding his body completely stretched out, and he often needed to shift his legs slightly to pull them in to return to a relaxed position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg continued roaming Sam's back, and quickly finished with the right shoulder. He then moved down to Sam's lower back. As he did so, he could feel Sam slightly arch his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it Sam's imagination, or were Greg's hands getting larger? Greg's pressure continued to build, and those fingers seemed able to cover more area than before, all the time feeling more intense and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg meanwhile was fighting a battle with his libido. Sam's surprisingly super loose body was resulting in a massage like none other he had given before. The large, relaxed muscles felt more and more incredible as they seemed to flow like water through his hands, yet had such weight and density to them. Had he held such an amount of meat so effortlessly before? He was having a hard time keeping his arousal unnoticed, and found himself struggling to hold back his erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot helping matters was Sam's ass. For some reason, today Greg was more enamored then ever with that perfectly rounded, beef bubble. On occasion he'd look down and see Sam's buttocks slightly clench. At those times, Greg felt so tempted to take a hold of them and feel the power coursing there. Yet, his fear of Sam's reaction kept him focused on the task at hand. But was it Greg's imagination, or was that ass creeping closer and closer toward him? Until... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg has paused from his massage, lifting just off of Sam. He was breathing slowly in and out, trying to keep his raging hard-on at bay. When, boom. Somehow Greg's hands grazed against Sam's bum. Greg paused, shocked. He hadn't move. It was if the ass came to him. And then he stood stock still, realizing that his hands had taken a life on their own, and rubbing now Sam's firm cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was sure Sam was prepping to beat the crap out of him. They had never had a massage turn that way before. But Sam surprisingly wasn't angry. In fact, he felt this was something he wanted very much. Sam almost needed to feel those strong hands on him down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg paused for a sec, and then heard Sam whisper quietly, \"No, keep it going\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you want to \u2026 go ahead \u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg could have creamed right then and there, but he held himself in, as his hands returned down to each buttock, cupping the gluteus maximus underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shuddered, then flexed those muscles, causing Greg to squirm as the smooth cheeks suddenly tensed, revealing awesome striation. Feeling almost possessed, Greg couldn't help but squeeze those tense muscles hard, while his own cock  began throbbing inside his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Sam was also breathing pretty hard, as his dick rose to full full attention against the friction of the massage table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had begun to rock back and forth. He wasn't letting those hands for a second release themselves from Sam's still flexed ass. Greg could hold himself no longer; his cock erupted, soaking his pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam could hear Greg moaning, and realized that his roommate was creaming over his own rock solid ass. Knowing he had had such a hold on Greg caused Sam likewise to spew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so both men remained relatively still, letting their individual orgasms run their course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was done, Sam relaxed, and Greg released his grip. Sam shuddered and shivered, and felt as if his whole body were contracting inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, <i>what was that</i>?!\" Sam laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck man, I don't know what got into me!\" Greg said elatedly, yet feeling slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What</i> got into you? These fuckin' huge muscles are <i>what</i> got into you,\" Sam retorted teasingly. He added, \"Yeah, and feeling you get off to my fuckin' huge muscles \u2026 damn, did that get into <i>me</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled sheepishly, glad that Sam was taking this all so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then turned around and said, <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You better stay in here and clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hopped off the table. He was the same height as Greg now, though neither of them seemed to realize any change. Sam looked Greg in the eyes, \"That was one helluva massage, dude!

But I'm dying of thirst!\" Sam headed over to the cabinets, where he stretched to reach up to the top shelf where he kept all his glasses. Unfortunately, most of his glasses were pushed toward the back of the shelf and he just couldn't reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian saw Sam struggling, and walked over. \"Here, let me help!\" Brian reached up and grabbed one of Sam's glasses. \"This what you looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is!\" Sam said. \"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam headed over to the sink, he stopped and said, \"Bri, who the hell in this house decided that my stuff should be on the highest shelves?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrian paused for a second, confused. \"Yeah Sam, that doesn't really make much sense, does it? I'm the only one in the house that can really reach that shelf\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Bri, do me a favor, and move my stuff down. You can put your shit up there from now on. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian quickly got to work moving everything, as Sam filled up his glass then proceeded to chug its entire contents down. He was refilling the glass, as Brian peered over from his work and whistled, \"Sure are thirsty there, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, Greg gave me one major rubdown!\" Sam snorted, as he thought back on the experience. Brian looked wistfully at Sam, momentarily jealous of Greg. How he would like to have some of his own Sam time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished moving the last bit of glassware, he spoke to Sam, who was now downing his third glass of water. \"Sam, do you think you can help me out? I was thinking about rearranging some of the furniture in my bedroom. Some of the stuff is pretty heavy, and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you could use a strong ox like me to help you out,\" Sam said, finishing Brian's sentence. Sam then broke out into laughter. This wasn't the first time Brian had suddenly needed help rearranging his furniture. He knew what Brian was up to, and that he enjoyed watching his muscles at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam swelled his chest, as Brian watched intensely, biting his lip. \"Yeah, you'd need a big guy like me to move your stuff around, wouldn't you?,\" Sam boasted. \"But tonight? Hmmm\u2026.\" Sam was feeling pretty tired. Plus, he had been tempted to return to Greg's room for a second round of massage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something to cut him down a size, well almost word to word actually... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess what.... the gym manager wasn't the man everyone thought they knew. Long time ago, he was some kind of scientist who felt in disgrace towards the international scientific community because of very questioning researches into forbidden quantum physic. It was absolutely illegal to disintegrate a living being molecules to do some kind of morph or size shift. But anyway,  he got caught performing those experimentation on a horse, got judged and jailed during 10 years long been bullied by other prisoners much bigger he was.

Like usual, he went to the college GYM for his daily hard bodybuilding training. But something was bothering him... He didn't like the way Carl Brown, the GYM manager was acting like. He was much more generous with the energy drink he gave him away to everyone in the GYM saying it was a free trial promotion from the manufacturer. But it was more the grin he did giving Sam a full rack for him to bring home.

From inside, those millions of little things was able to fix them self to any organs, bones, blood stream etc to analyze the living being where they has been assimilated and on stand by to theirs purpose. They were programmed to wait for a remote signal to initiate theirs program to change the size of anything living or even a human being having them inside his body.

Looking down, he sees a massive pink continent, obviously nothing more than an ordinary urinal cake at normal size. He splashes onto the surface with the torrent. The surface itself has seen better days and now has eroded into a spongy nature with some mini-Sam-sized valleys. The piss flows freely down these valleys while with all his might, Sam refuses to get sucked down into the plumbing with it. Then, the cascade lessens and looking up, Sam sees the jock shake off the last drop from his bladder and tucks it back into his jock strap. Then with thunderous footfalls, he leaves. As Sam rights himself on top of the mighty urinal cake island, he finds himself in deeper trouble...</span></div></div>",

He looks up to see two giant bodybuilders -  one with messy wet hair (possibly straight from the shower) and naked; the other with a closer cut, slight stubble, and wearing a spandex suit from which his muscles could not be contained. The first giant turns to the other and says \"How the hell you gonna pee in that?\" The second one grunts and struggles out of the suit. Now exposed and sweaty, he asks to his partner \"Wanna try and sink the cake?\" The first one smiles and laughs. Then, smacking palms together like a crack of thunder, he responds \"Let the best dude win...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watches and sees both monsterous jocks prime their bladders for competition. He dives for one of the furrows in the urinal cake as in the toast to competition both count down. \"3...2...1...\" Sam grabs hold of a spongy pit, but his grip could be better improved as he gets bombarded by two streams of piss striking down on the cake with full force. This is not random pissing. This is delibirately aiming. Sam can not hear their laughter over the falling thunder of urine. But one sound does show itself. Beneath him, the erosion becomes so severe that a large fragment of the urinal cake cleaves from the main block like an iceberg. More pieces crumble away like debris from an avalanche and lands in the flood of urine. Now the small bit of cake left bobs like a kite in a storm. If Sam stays like this, he will be doomed.

Brian scatted and laid his hands both side of Sam on the cushion. He was laid on his back still like peacefully sleeping. He was cute to see so quiet, laid on his back wearing his tight jeans and white t-shirt that revealed all his muscled shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen brain gently open his tiny legs with his index finger and thumb. But Sam didn't move any muscle. Even touching his tiny muscle pectorals did nor awake him.

I\u2019d a been here sooner if you hadn\u2019t sent me off to get those supplements you wanted. Jeez, I had to drive out nearly an hour away to get them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, you did get them, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I picked up all they had at the store. You should be set for some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. Thanks, bud!\u201d Sam said, \u201cNow, we gonna do some lifting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sure boss. You sure seem energetic today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, good ol\u2019 Carl Brown gave me this new energy drink he\u2019s testing for some company. Since I had it, I\u2019ve felt real pumped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say good ol\u2019 Carl Brown? You mean, the creepy owner of this place?\u201d Zeke asked, a little confused. As long as Carl Brown had been managing this place, Sam hated on the guy. Of course, Carl didn\u2019t help matters by constantly nosing about, staring at Big Sam, muttering strange things under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, that\u2019s what Carl Brown was doing right now, smirking while holding some strange device in his hand. \u201cNo time like the present,\u201d Carl muttered to himself, pushing a button on the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam meanwhile had laid down for a bench press. He had just begun a set, when he felt a strange buzzing sensation within his body. Unbeknownst to him, the nanobots were swimming round and round about his body, attaching themselves to his muscles and his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt a bit lightheaded. Damn, he could swear the bar was feeling really heavy. Zeke meanwhile noticed the bar shaking in Sam\u2019s hands. \u201cYou okay? What are you doing? This is an easy weight for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrr\u2026.\u201d Sam growled, then pushed his body as hard as he could, trying to overcome his lightheadedness. He concentrated on the bar, the weight seeming heavier by the second, until suddenly he felt his arms pumping, pumping, pumping. A burst of energy radiated from them, as he lifted the bar up, then down. Up, then down again. Man, what a pump he was feeling, as if his arms were swelling with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam finished his set, feeling mighty large. Dropping the bar down against its rest, he twisted around and jumped up to his feet. He quick looked over at the wall mirror, and began flexing those massive guns of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, just look at those fuckers!

He couldn\u2019t explain it, but he felt stronger and bigger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the locker room afterword, he spent extra long in the shower.

Fuck, you look huger than ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh, you finally noticed? What was I telling you? I swear, I was really growing out there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam walked over to his locker, and started grabbing his street clothes. As he slipped his underpants on, he couldn\u2019t help they seemed slightly loose.  \u201cFuck, more clothes ruined in the wash\u2026\u201d he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put on his shorts, which also felt oddly large. He made sure to put his belt on extra tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Zeke asked, as Sam started to slip on his sweatshirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Sam said sliding the sweatshirt down over his extreme torso. But the hem dropped much further than his waist. And, as Sam slipped his arms into the sleeves, the sleeves fell past his sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Sam yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich one of you fuckers is doing this? This is may seem like fun and games, but I can\u2019t handle this shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, what\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2026 just play innocent\u2026 Fuck\u2026\u201d Sam then proceeded to put on his sneakers, only the shoes were a couple sizes too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, fuckhead, laundry doesn\u2019t fuck up shoes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, what are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour practical joke.

Zeke was jealous of Sam's height. Sure he was built too, but no one took him seriously because of his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was their chance to get back at Sam. Zeke WAS out picking up supplements, but he was getting different ones than the ones they usually take. These were supplements meant to take Sam down a peg or two. They all had to take them in order for it to work properly. They'd drain height and muscle from Sam, and it would go to Zeke, and Brian. How it worked exactly, Zeke wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Brian was cooking a meal to hide some of those supplements in Sam's food, just in case. They wanted to be sure he got enough to teach him a lesson! This was the last time they would be bossed around by Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke came back with the supplements. He bought powdered so it would be easier to hide in Sam's food. Once Brian was finished cooking, Zeke added the powder to the food for Sam. Just as they finished adding the powder to the food, Greg walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fella's, \" he said as he sat down at the table. \"Supper smells good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, go wake Sam up,\" Brian spoke. \"Tell him supper is finally ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both knew they could count on Greg to wake up Sam. They never wanted to do it themselves, as it frightened them. It was like waking a dragon up after a hundred years sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg loved to go into Sam's room. He was head over heels for the guy, even though he was treated like dirt. It was those bulging muscles that did him in. As Greg walked in Sam's room, he noticed the clothing and underwear strewn about the room. He went over to Sam, laying down on his bed and woke him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam, Sam!\" Greg raised his voice a little. \"Brian said to wake you up cause your supper is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg gave Sam a little shove. Just a light one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Sam mumbled. \"Ok, I'll be there right away. It's about time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam woke up and made his way to the kitchen.

He closed his eyes to make the dizziness stop, and in no time at all was fast asleep. He tossed and turned during his sleep. Maybe  it was because he was sleeping on the couch. But it never happened to him before on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian looked over at Sam and noticed him sleeping. He saw Sam toss and turn while he slept. He appeared to be sweating quite a lot. Brian noticed that Sam's clothes appeared looser on his frame now. Man this stuff worked fast! He thought. Brian noticed his own clothes felt tighter on his body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke came into the living room to sit down now that dishes were done. He noticed Sam sleeping away, and Brian smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's working already,\" Brian spoke quietly. \"Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Sam, Zeke noticed what Brian had noticed as well. Zeke looked down and noticed his jeans looked a bit too short for him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam started to wake up. Brian and Zeke pretended they weren't looking at him. They turned their heads to the TV instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, am I tired!\" Sam said, yawning. \"I think I better hit the sack. This couch is no good for sleeping on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gets up off the couch. Zeke and Brian notice that Sam doesn't look as big as before. They didn't notice it as much before while Sam was laying down. But when he sat up, they noticed he seemed to take up a bit less space on the couch. His head was about level with the back of the couch now. Normally he was a few inches higher than the back of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both look like you're gaining some muscle! Good for you!\" Sam joked. \"You'll never catch up to me though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke and Brian noticed that Sam's jeans seemed slightly longer on him than usual as he walked to his room to get some shuteye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure breakfast is ready for me on time tomorrow morning!\" Sam scoffed and slammed his bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke and Brian look at each other and smiled as Sam's door slammed. Soon Sam wouldn't be bossing them around any more. Zeke and Brian waited until Sam was for sure out for the night. They had to see Sam lose more. Do they wait until morning to see how much Sam has lost, do they try and watch more of his changes while he's sleeping, or do they see if the supplements are affecting Greg?</span></div></div>",

There were huge guys all around him, powerlifters and pro bodybuilders \u2026 some Mr. Olympia competitors as well. Though few guys there were as tall as he, many were bulked out much huger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam lay on the bench, preparing to do some presses. All these massive muscle dudes around him energized him. Plus he had taken some of those pills his new buddy Dr. Mark Rice in the college labs had given him to test. \u201cIf my calculations are right, these\u2019ll really pump you huge,\u201d Dr. Rice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, he could feel that pump already! Like his arms were on fire! \u201cDamn, these weights are too light!\u201d he called out, causing a nearby trainer to rush over with more weights. While waiting for that trainer, his arms felt swole, his chest felt swole, his legs felt swole. All over, he could feel them muscles swelling. He was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the trainer came back to him, Sam took to the heavier weights like a madman. \u201cMore! Too light!\u201d he barked. A couple other trainers started running over with even more weights, loading them on, as Sam continued to lift, and lift, and lift then with easy. By now, his arms had split his sleeves; and with each rep, his shirt lost extra seams, until just rags lay across his pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore weights were added, and everyone in the gym had turned to watch Sam lift. When he finally finished and sat up, gasps were heard around the place at seeing his swollen gargantuan muscles. \u201cThink this is something?\u201d Sam said, lifting his arms up, flexing them, pumping them up huger. He stood up, and continued flexing, all his muscles now growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd of fellow behemoths surrounded him, awing and drooling over his growing body. \u201cFuck, you all look so tiny to me now!\u201d He watched as a couple previous Mr. Olympias began pawing at his muscle. Sam sneered down at them, flexing more, and laughed. \u201cWho\u2019s your muscle god now, eh? I\u2019m the biggest fucker you guys ever gonna see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026,\u201d a voice growled from the other side of the gym, interrupting Sam's posing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of musclemen parted to the side at hearing the challenge, and Sam called out, \u201cYEAH! Who the fuck do you think you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peered across the gym, where he saw a big guy, shirtless, curling weights. Though the dude was facing the opposite way, and though his back muscles looked expansive, he seemed no match for titan Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 aren\u2019t you gonna answer me?\u201d Sam called across. But the guy kept curling, his silent back to Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mighty paws, Sam knocked his admirers to his side, and he stormed across the gym. His eyes were locked on his detractor, as he stepped closer and closer\u2026 and closer\u2026 and closer\u2026. Damn, just how long was this gym!  Surely, he should\u2019ve reached the other side by now. His mysterious critic after all seemed closer\u2026 seemed\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wasn\u2019t right, though. Suddenly, not knowing why, Sam wanted to stop, but his legs kept moving him forward against his will. He felt like panicking, as he realized getting close to his competitor, the dude was really beginning to look big. Not just muscular, but tall. Sam already was needing to bend his neck back to look up to the guy's head, and he still wasn\u2019t near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy just loomed higher and higher, as Sam's legs kept moving him beyond his will. When Sam finally reached him, Sam\u2019s head was not even as high as the dude\u2019s waist. As if on cue, the dude swung around, laughing. Through his magnificent pecs high above Sam, the giant smiled and continued laughing. \u201cHello, Sam!...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gasped, it was his training buddy Zeke!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He found what he had been looking for, a simple tape measure he usually used to check out his pumped arms. Now, he grabbed one end, and rested his head against a wall, dropping the rest of the measure to the ground. He used his foot to mark the measurement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped the tape and bent down to look. \u201cNo!\u201d he barreled out loud. His foot had marked 6\u20192\u201d.

His body began to feel warm all over, not feverish, but rather as if someone had wrapped their arms all around him. It felt good, comfortable, relaxing\u2026 His muscles felt at first relaxed, but then, despite no exertion, they began to feel charged, pumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, feels like one of the best workouts I ever had\u2026</i> All his muscles felt gently alive now, and Sam found himself feeling almost half drunk, flexing his muscles, admiring the peaks of his biceps, the girth of his quads. His chest felt amazing, and he quickly tore off the loosened T-shirt he had been wearing to get a good look at it. His pecs were fully swollen, engorged, and\u2026 getting bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, he was growing! He had completely forgotten about his recent shrinking spell, instead he was too enraptured by his swelling body. Even after the growth seemed to subside, he was rapt in the afterglow of it, admiring his extra thickness, his extra width. Flexing his guns, he admired their higher peaks. He had to at least gained an inch in just those couple minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reverie was interrupted as there was a knock at his door. \u201cSam, buddy, you coming to dinner?\u201d It was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pulled it over his head, and then, breathing in, slowly squeezed it around his bulbous pecs. Once beyond them, the rest of the shirt dropped easily across his narrow waist. Brian noted that even though his roommate was shorter, the shirt hem didn\u2019t hang quite so low as he\u2019d expected; so much fabric was needed to support Sam\u2019s upper torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, so fucking tight!\u201d Sam said, staring at himself in the mirror. \u201cJust look at this muscle cleavage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shirt on, Sam\u2019s muscle gains seemed even more pronounced, especially as he began walking toward the hallway, his muscles bouncing and lunging with him.

He told them about Dr. Rice\u2019s special pills and how he got involved in taking them. He talked about the growth he had experienced, and then about the shrinking. Greg and Zeke looked incredulous, so Sam got up and stood next to Brian to give them a visual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, boss\u2026 4 inches, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Zeke said, realizing that if he were 4 inches less, he\u2019d be under 5 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, though, it may sound crazy, but I kinda getting used to it.

Maybe something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, seriously? What would be the chances of that?\u201d Greg scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sam had other things on his mind. He couldn\u2019t get over his muscle gains. 3 inches on his chest in one day! He began clinging to a fantasy, wondering what gains he could have with more pills. \u201cMaybe we should test the pills, see if it happens again?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now you\u2019ve really lost it, buddy\u2026\u201d Brian started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sam was already brushing Brian to the side, and bounding up the stairs to his room. His roommates stared at each other for a few seconds, confused, a little shocked, then ran up the stairs and into Sam\u2019s room just in time to see him swallowing another pill down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam!!\u201d they barked at him, but already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you pussies? Before we start making any assumptions, someone\u2019s gotta test this shit out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the roommates knew how to react, instead just staring at Sam. Would he change? If so, when?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam could read their minds. In fact, he had also been wondering/hoping the same thing. \u201cFuck, you think this shit is insta\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped himself, as all of a sudden, he could feel each of his muscles tingle, getting warmer and feeling pumped. \u201cOh fuck yeah,\u201d he murmured to himself, staring down at his pecs, already looking a little plumper. \u201cFuck, this feels good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis roommates stared in wonder at their expanding roommate. They gathered around him, wanting to feel the growing muscle. Sam put on a show for them, flexing for his buds, pumping those muscles more and more, barely noticing he was getting shorter. But his height loss wasn\u2019t unnoticed by his roommates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, buddy\u2026 You\u2019re shrinking!\u201d Greg cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I?\u201d Sam said, feeling increasingly intoxicated by his growth especially as his tank top began to tear a little\u2026 \u201cFuck, does it matter?\u201d He flexed his pecs a little, causing the tank to tear a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter?!\u201d Brian started, incredulously. \u201cDude, we\u2019re the same height!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s shrinking had now stopped, and he looked eye-to-eye at his tallest roommate. \u201cDamn, we are!\u201d At first a little hesitant about this, he then began laughing, accepting this new reality, and surprisingly enjoying it. \u201cFuck, dude, I must make you look like a twig!\u201d he said, comparing himself to Brian. \u201cJust look at these guns next to yours. How thick my pecs look next to your skinny chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, linebacker Brian was no slouch, having gotten pretty big himself through all his years of powerlifting and playing football. But his 18-inch guns were no match for Sam\u2019s now 24-1/2 inchers. And his just-shy-of-50-inch chest looked measly next to Sam\u2019s mighty 58-inch rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam meanwhile looked at Brian as if with new eyes. \u201cDamn, I gotta admit,\u201d Sam said, eyeing Brian up and down, \u201cyou do look nice and beefy now. Beefier than I ever imagined you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian gulped, realizing Sam was making quite an advance on him. Sam smiled mischievously back at him, then\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His roommate sauntered over to him, his bulk looking more massive with each step. Sam placed a hand under and up Brian\u2019s sweatshirt to feel his meaty chest. \u201cWhy do you always hide yourself in such bulky clothes, bud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam brought his hands back out, and grabbed Brian\u2019s shirt collar.

He pulled tightly, ensuring both men\u2019s chests pushed against each other and taking pleasure at how much his engorged chest pushed aggressively against Brian\u2019s meaty but much smaller pecs. The feeling of Brian\u2019s chest itself was incredible, but knowing his own pec dominance sent a rush through him, motivating him to flex his pecs some, and push tighter against Brian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian got more aggressively into their kiss; Sam could tell he was enjoying the sensation of such nearness to his massive pecs. Sam leaned in even more, pushing up hard against Brian\u2019s chest. He imagined his pecs pumping up even huger, breathing in, huffing his chest out\u2026 and out\u2026 and out\u2026 Oh fuck, he was expanding again. His chest was feeling like a balloon as it was puffing up harder against Brian. Damn, he had to lean up a little now to reach Brian\u2019s lips. But damn, it was worth it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brian opened his eyes, a little bleary and a little confused where he was. He scanned his surroundings, and realized he was in Sam\u2019s room. The memory of last night flooded back to him, and he smiled seeing his torn sweatshirt on the floor. Last night wasn\u2019t a dream\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had gotten into him last night? Sure, he had crushed on his massive roommate for ages, but he had never before so much as hinted to Sam such feelings, he thought. And certainly, he never imagined acting on them. Then, suddenly, in that moment, when Sam began aggressively seducing him, Brian lost control. Giving in to Sam\u2019s kisses, feeling those massive pecs rub up against his own chest\u2026. Fuck, those massive pecs then began inflating against him\u2026. Brian felt his cock re-stiffen at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was more. He remembered that Sam had shrunk some more and was now shorter than him.  Was that what caused that boldness to arise in Brian like never before. Brian took the lead now from Sam, shoving him onto the bed, tearing off his clothes, jumping on top of him and on top of that magnificent chest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian\u2019s reverie was interrupted by a shuffling next to him in bed. He rolled over and saw just that magnificent chest, rising unbelievably high, as Sam lay on his back beside him, seemingly still asleep. He watched Sam\u2019s log-like arm slowly rise up, flex and rub his pec. Then a smile crept across Sam\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you looking\u2026\u201d Sam whispered teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you blame me? You\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 mountain!\u201d Brian responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Sam growled. Then, suddenly, he sat up, got on his knees and straddled himself across Brian\u2019s waist. Brian stayed lying down, staring up at the extraordinary pecs above him. He could barely see Sam\u2019s face, so much muscle was in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike the view, sport?\u201d Sam said from above, bouncing his pecs. \u201cI know you love this chest, after seeing the way you fucked it last night, ha ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian reached up, grabbing a handful of meat. He cupped Sam\u2019s nipples, feeling the heft of each pec, Sam continue to bounce. Then Sam pulled off Brian\u2019s arms, and leaned forward more and more until his chest came crashing down on Brian\u2019s face. Brian could barely breath, surrounded by such muscle, as Sam began to rock his chest up and down. Brian could only unleash his tongue to lick the passing muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue bath was interrupted as Sam\u2019s alarm clock started to buzz. \u201cSorry dude,\u201d Sam said, leaning over to turn the alarm off. \u201cBut your big dude\u2019s got to hit the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian recovered from his dreamstate, looked at the alarm, then jumped up. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m running late for practice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I been practice enough for you?\u201d Sam teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian laughed, \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t think Coach\u2019d see it that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Sam laughed, rolling over, allowing Brian to sit up and get up from the bed. Brian looked the room, wondering what happened to his underwear.  He heard a loud thump as Sam\u2019s feet landed on the floor, and then \u201cWhoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian turned around, expecting to see Sam\u2019s face, but instead barely saw the top of Sam\u2019s head. Sam looked up at Brian\u2019s face, and gulped. \u201cGuess I got smaller\u2026\u201d For a moment, he felt unsure of his emotions and a little freaked out. But then, he surprised Brian and himself, as he burst into laughter. \u201cHow fucking weird, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was pretty freaked out himself, seeing Sam so short, but Sam\u2019s strange laughter gave him some ease. \u201cUm, yeah boss, fuckin\u2019 weird,\u201d he said, trying to join in on the laughter, though uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunniest part is, I don\u2019t feel any smaller. Fuckin\u2019 feel huge!\u201d Sam said, while sauntering toward his mirror. \u201cOh, fuck me! No wonder I feel huge. Look at this chest. I\u2019m enormous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Brian, and barked, \u201cMeasure me!\u201d Brian jumped, feeling a bit nervous. He grabbed the tape measure, and instinctively wrapped it around Sam\u2019s chest. \u201c60.5 inches. Dude, that\u2019s fuckin\u2019 incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say. Heh, imagine what this would fuckin\u2019 be if I were my old height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Sam\u2019s stats were just as impressive. 24-inch arms, 32-inch thighs, 33-inch waist. Brian was about to put the tape away, when Sam scoffed at him. \u201cWhere you going with that, dude? Aren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian shrugged. Then Sam barked, \u201cMy height, silly! Fuck, just how tiny am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know, but he proceeded to measure Sam anyway. 65 inches\u2026.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWow, more than a foot shorter than my normal height!\u201d Sam said. Brian thought he noted a strange sense of glee in Sam\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men were startled as there was a knock on the door. \u201cHey Sam, you coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After I arrive, there\u2019ll be no competition, except for second place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian nodded his head, before Sam motioned authoritatively to get out of the room now.

You got small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmall???\u201d Sam barked. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? You call these cannons small?\u201d He flexed his guns, way out-measuring Zeke\u2019s own impressive arms. \u201cYeah, I may be a shortie now, but I\u2019m still much more massive than you bud, not to mention still taller too, runt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke nearly creamed when Sam lifted up his guns. Sam noticed Zeke's reaction and grabbed Zeke\u2019s hands, forcing them on his pecs. \u201cYou think those arms are incredible, feel this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke, zombie-like, began rubbing Sam\u2019s chest, losing track of time, until Sam snapped him out of his reverie. \u201cFuck boy, we got a competition, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke snapped to, \u201cYes, boss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on down and get the car started. I\u2019ll grab some things and meet you down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke hurried out, as Sam scrambled to find clothes to wear. He's have to ask Zeke to stop on the way to the competition and pick up new posing trunks. For now, he'd have to go commando, though none of his own shorts would fit him. He looked down at the clothes Brian left behind. Though way too long on him, he was at least able to squeeze the stretchy fabric of Brian\u2019s shorts to just fit over his massive legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian\u2019s shirt would no way fit on his huge chest, so he grabbed an old workout tanktop of his own. Formerly, it had been incredibly roomy on him, but now he could just barely squeeze it over his pecs. But once past those huge hurdles, the rest of the tank draped down his still-tight abs, below his waist, and even below his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, looks like I\u2019m wearing a tanktop dress!\u201d Sam laughed to himself. He grabbed some scissors, cutting the hem to waist level. \u201cMmmm\u2026 Not bad,\u201d he said admiring himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke honked the horn, and Sam barked out the window. \u201cI\u2019m coming\u2026.\u201d He turned to get his wallet, then saw the jar of pills on his bedside table. \u201cCan\u2019t forget these,\u201d he said, pouring a few into his hands.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then pocketed the other pills in his hand for potential use later. He headed out to meet with Zeke, who had been growing increasingly impatient waiting for Sam in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam slipped into the passenger seat. In the past, he had to duck and squeeze his way just to fit through the door, but at his current height he was able to get in without any work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was still in shock, seeing his lumbering, now even more massive but much shorter roommate join him.

I\u2019ll grow back soon, and when I do, fuck, they\u2019ll have to create a new weight class for me\u2026 Mega heavyweight, I think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam liked that word\u2026 Mega\u2026 Fuck, the mere thought of the word made him feel so fucking powerful. Mmmm, he could feel his pecs growing against the seat belt. Who the fuck cares if he could also feel his head slipping a little lower on the seat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to his passenger\u2019s changes, Zeke kept on driving, wondering why Sam got suddenly got quiet. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was meanwhile rubbing his own growing pecs. \u201cFuck, everything\u2019s amazing, dude. Fuckin\u2019 amazing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were getting close to the venue, when Sam remembered he still needed posers for the competition. \u201cDude, stop over at the gym for a sec. I need to get me some new trunks\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke pulled into the gym parking lot and the two guys hopped out of the car. As Sam walked around the car toward Zeke, Zeke whistled at how massive his gym bud was. But as Sam got closer, Zeke\u2019s jaw dropped, seeing that both men were now equal height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not lost on Sam either, and the confidence he\u2019d had with all his gains wavered. It was one thing to lose a few inches. But now he was tied for shortest in their house, and he always saw Zeke as super short. Now he was super short too. As the two men awkwardly walked into the store next to the gym, they both couldn\u2019t stop taking stolen glances at the other, the strangeness of the two being eye-to-eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the store, Sam felt even more uncomfortable. Everyone was so fucking tall! And they all were looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the posing trunks,\u201d Zeke called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hurried over, grabbing a small pair, and ducking away from the crowds into a changing room. The trunks were tight, but Sam had a frightening thought\u2026 What if he shrunk more? He decided to stick with these, rather than risk shrinking out of them on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out and walked to the mirror; once there saw an absolute god stared back at him. Christ, that was his reflection. He looked unreal. Like one of those Photoshopped photos of fantasy bodybuilders he\u2019d seen online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke wandered into the changing area, wondering what was keeping Sam. He found him there, posing in front of the mirror, transfixed. \u201cDamn, Sammy, you may be me-sized now, but you are massive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHenh, I\u2019m only you-sized in height. Flex those guns of yours and let\u2019s compare.\u201d Zeke did as requested, and it was no comparison. Sam\u2019s guns dwarfed Zeke\u2019s in a major way. Despite his own well-toned body, Zeke looked scrawny next to Sam\u2019s bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then stood behind Zeke, and looked at them in the mirror. \u201cHa, look how much wider I am than you! You can see my shoulders and traps behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffed his chest, his full confidence restored and then some. \u201cFlex those pecs!\u201d he commanded Zeke. Zeke followed suit, and Sam laughed some more, \u201cDamn, look how much further these muscle tits stick out than yours! I\u2019m a frickin\u2019 muscle monster!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stared down at them, and from his view, they looked even bigger, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to his mirror, and stared at his reflection. He looked massive. No doubt about it. Doc\u2019s formula was a success. He flexed his arms, watching those peaks rise up higher than ever before. He breathed in, and pushed out his chest, watching those mountains of pecs explode with size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heard Zeke call him from downstairs: \u201cYou coming to dinner, buddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, he couldn\u2019t wait to show off to his buds. He grabbed his shirt and was about to pull it on, when he stared at the label \u2013 \u201cXXXL\u201d. Triple-extra large? His head felt foggy, confused. When the hell did he wear XXXL? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I was that big\u2026\u201d he murmured to himself. He wondered which of his buds was pulling a joke on him. Who snuck in while he was napping to replace his shirt with a size larger? But then, laughing, he decided to go ahead and put the shirt on anyway. He was more than impressed\u2026 The shirt fit snugly over his enlarged chest, and his biceps pushed against the sleeves. Sure, the hem hung pretty low on him. But that was to be expected with a shirt size so large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared again at his reflection, taking in his entire body, all 6\u20194\u201d of it. Mysteriously, and unknown to him, erased from his mind was his old life at 6\u20196\u201d. Perhaps somewhere in his mind\u2019s recesses he remembered that time, but now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, you coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled, and headed toward the door\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On his way into the dining room, he ran into Zeke almost literally. \u201cSorry, pipsqueak, didn\u2019t see you down there, ha ha!\u201d He laughed, never tiring of that old joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, it\u2019s okay, buddy,\u201d Zeke responded, feeling a little intimidated by the giant lug.

Thought this was funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, what are you talking about?\u201d Brian said, sounding a little nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwitching out my shirt with a XXXL! What, trying to make me look small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke, who tended to do Sam\u2019s laundry, was now confused. \u201cBut buddy, you\u2019ve always worn XXXL\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, are you in on this, too?

Sam wasn\u2019t flexing now, yet his pecs looked like they were puffing up. Sam just smiled, looking a little demonic and feeling incredible. \u201cShhh\u2026. Listen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys quieted, and they heard it\u2026 a sound of skin and fabric stretching. \u201cOh yeah, really swelling up now, boys\u2026\u201d Sam whispered. He stood up from the table, raising his arms up. The biceps were so tight around the sleeve, no one noticed how that sleeve now hung a little long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck this shirt!\u201d Sam then roared, eager to see full progress. He pulled at the hems, and tore the shirt in half, exposing his growing pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke leapt up now from his seat, stepping up close to Sam, to gain a better view of that meat. \u201cThis is unbelievable. You\u2019re fucking growing!\u201d But as his eyes were focused on Sam\u2019s torso, Brian stared at something else. He noticed Zeke seemed to look taller than usual. But then, looking at the two men, comparing them, he saw something even more shocking\u2026 Sam\u2019s head was getting lower\u2026 and lower\u2026 and lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam\u2026\u201d Brian started. \u201cAre you like squatting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, now flexing in front of Zeke, showed off his increasing gains.

The behemoth looked like he was just a little taller than him now. \u201cWhoa, did you shrink?\u201d He echoed Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShrink? Are you guys high or something?

Brian and Zeke were already down there, eagerly waiting for Sam. They tried as hard as possible to not hide their curiosity as Sam lumbered in and joined them by the free weights. His buddies had already started on some curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you curling there, Bri? Dang, is that just 60 pounds? Looks like you struggling a little, too\u2026 heh heh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how about you shrimpy?\u201d Sam continued, as Zeke glared up at him. \u201cYeah, boss\u2026,\u201d Sam continued. \u201cYou may be tiny, but looks like you curling 75 pounds there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam picked up a couple 100-pounders, but then immediately put them down. \u201cDamn, too easy\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed over and grabbed a couple 120 pounders he normally used for preacher curls and showing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing them, he raised them. It was a bit of a struggle, but his arms held on, as he lifted, held, then relaxed. Christ, what a pump that was! He could feel the blood rushing to his arms already, and with each rep, the struggle seemed to lighten. Damn, he was getting strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Zeke had now stopped their routines, and were watching Sam go. They were beginning to get used to these changes, the shock having now turned to curiosity, and perhaps something more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian found himself getting incredibly turned on by his massiver roommate, and tried hiding his boner with one of the weights he had been curling.

Almost instinctually, Sam lifted them up, tightening the drawstring. He then lifted his arms up, into a double bi. As he flexed hard, his shrinking momentarily sped up, dropping him below 5\u20198\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s these fucking huge arms that\u2019s turning you on?\u201d Sam said, receding further still. \u201cGo on, buddy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sorry, Sam, I didn't catch that. Did you have something to tell me?\" Zeke commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam didn't respond. He couldn't respond. What would he say? Zeke had a body that was everything Sam had dreamed of becoming, an imposing, dominating ideal. Every muscle, every inch of his frame held a gentle but firm definition that radiated a smooth strength from every swell, every curve, every side. He was sitting on a bench of his own, bending slightly as he did curls with one arm, but he still easily loomed over Sam. The position only seemed to compact his frame, making him look even more intimidating and powerful as his forearm tensed, his payload casually lifted, crested with a firmly bulging bicep, then slowly lowered back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wasn't just using a dumbbell. He wasn't even using a curling bar. Sam realized with a pang of dread that Zeke was curling, with one hand, a loaded barbell- one that looked a lot like the same weight Sam had been using moments before for his bench press. Zeke's curls were hardly giving him trouble, either; every rep he did caused him to do little more than exhale, barely a grunt, at almost no visible strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, getting so big...\" He purred with contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeke... what happened?\" Sam asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Zeke replied in an eerily calm, smooth voice. He spoke with with a relaxed and casual nature he typically didn't even use in everyday life- he could have been smoking a joint, or waking from a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... big. Bigger than me. Bigger than everyone, anyone I've ever known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous,\" Zeke replied with a chuckling smile. \"Brian and Greg are both bigger than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sam became aware of the panting, clanging noises on either side of Zeke, and saw he was flanked by Brian and Greg... though not as Sam had ever seen them. Each of them was a meter larger than Zeke, and somehow even more developed; whereas Zeke's enormous build had still kept his proportions fair and balanced, Brian and Greg were nothing short of well-toned monsters. Brian was doing his own bench presses on a super-sized gym pew, but his bar was easily twice as long as the Olympic standard, and considerably more thick. Greg, meanwhile, was doing leg lifts on a proportionately massive machine. Every time Greg's massive legs went up, the soles of his feet leveled with Sam's face; and every time it hit its rest at the bottom, a sharp CLANG! filled the air, with a tiny tremor running out alongside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Zeke, can you pass me another plate? I'm done with my warm-ups,\" Greg rumbled with a final CLANG! as he dropped his calves and released pressure on his thighs. His legs were as thick as tree trunks, and as such were prominently hale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Greg,\" Zeke answered, unceremoniously dropping his curling weight with a massive CLUNK on the rubber floor. He turned around, grabbed hold of a plate the size of a dinner table, and pivoted his torso in the other direction to give it to Greg. Suddenly, the weight was passing -over- Sam's head. The iron disc was every bit as wide in diameter as Sam was tall, and completely overshadowed him as it passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was reeling. Zeke was bigger than he was? Brian and Greg were bigger than him? He was supposed to be the Big Deal. That was his job. Heck, that *was* him. But now he was the shortest of his flat-mates, no contest. Sam could only look at Zeke's absent-minded face from on high, never feeling more vulnerable or weak in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right,\" Sam murmured softly in disbelief. \"None of this is. It can't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it can,\" Zeke continued as he sat down, picked up his bar with his other arm, and started curling again, oblivious to Sam's reaction. \"You always said so. I'm a runt. A shrimp. The smallest in our house. As a matter of fact... I'm the smallest person in the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Zeke finished talking than the noise of the trio expanded to all around him, the clamor of weights and voices of their lifters now all around him. He was in the center of a gym full of lifters just as huge as his three friends. These were the group that had been admiring him just a few minutes ago. Now they bantered, talk, groaned, shouted encouragement, but none of them were looking at him. They didn't even seem to know he existed. Sam watched with awe as a bodybuilder that had to be twenty-foot tall flex in a full-length mirror, when suddenly a thigh enveloped his vision- a lithe, towering athlete and his mate had passed through, nearly body-checking Sam. They paid him no notice- they'd been completely absorbed in their conversation and lumbered away, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Sam became aware of a constant, tumultuous rumble trembling through the floor from the direction of the gym entrance. He turned around just in time to see a mob of new behemoths enter the already-crowded gym, but as he stared up in frightened wonder at them-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK. He hadn't been paying attention, and had been hit in the head with a gym duffel bag like a cloth torpedo. The force knocked him on the ground... then he was lost, being pushed to and fro by over-sized beefcakes in a stampeding forest of legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the throng, Sam heard Zeke's sonorous timbre resonate through the gym air around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I'm the smallest.. then what does that make you, Sam?\"</span></div></div>",

A 6th-year college senior, he makes up for his lack of smarts by bullying and dominating his fellow classmates, not to mention his housemates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis primary domain: where else but the gym. When not working out, he\u2019s usually at home (who needs classes?). Home is a house he shares with 3 frat brothers: Brian, Greg, and Zeke. All four men, including Sam, are gay. Like everywhere else on campus, Sam rules the house, and his housemates manage all chores, including feeding and cleaning up after Sam. All three perform such tasks, partially out of terror, but also out of lust for their at-home musclegod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sam\u2019s reign of bullying terror is about to end, as one day he begins to find himself inexplicably getting smaller\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Please note the following rules:</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are now four branches to this story: <b>Slow Shrinking</b>, <b>(Almost) Anything Goes</b>, <b>(Almost) Anything Goes (version 2)</b>, and <b>Sam's Not the Only One Shrinking</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <b>Slow Shrinking</b>, Sam\u2019s reduction is more measured. At no branch in the story should he lose more than 1/5 of his then height. Transformation should be limited to Sam, and only consists of shrinking; no transformations into animals, inanimate objects, or women. His age (24) should remain the same, as should his height-weight proportion (ie., no muscle loss).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn both versions of <b>(Almost) Anything Goes</b>, as the titles imply, just about anything can happen--to Sam, to his housemates, to visitors of the house, other gym rats--have fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor <b>all</b> story branches, the following additional restrictions apply: No underage sexual contact; that said, children can be added as minor side characters, and in the <b>(Almost) Anything Goes</b> stories, main adult characters can regress to childhood (though as children, they shall not engage in sexual contact). Also, this is a gay storyline; don\u2019t turn the characters hetero. Finally, please keep all chapters at a substantial length--a minimum of 50 words per chapter is required (though more than that is appreciated). Any chapter less than 50 words will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
