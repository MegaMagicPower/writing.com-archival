While the girls would normally be gathered to either study or celebrate Chiyo's birthday, Chiyo thought it would be nice to give Osaka a birthday celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka was slightly spaced out at the moment, thinking about what she normally thinks about, which really could be anything or nothing at all. All of a sudden, she says something. \"Ahh...birthdays are nice, even though each one means you're getting older. It would be nice if we could just have the birthday part without the aging part.\" she says with the kind of smile she usually has on her face after making such a comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tomo could agree and make a comment on how staying young would keep Yomi from getting fat, the door opens up to reveal Chiyo and Sakaki with lots of party supplies. \"Sorry we're late, everyone, but we ran into Kaorin on the way down here and she wanted to celebrate Osaka's birthday too!\" Chiyo says. Sure enough, the girls also see Kaorin with them, though 'celebrating Osaka's birthday' was the last thing on Kaorin's Sakaki-filled mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nod as the other three start bringing things in, with Kaorin helping Sakaki carry things in regardless of whether Sakaki actually needed the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls are setting up, Osaka gravitates towards an object in the room. Namely, the large air tank they are using to fill the balloons up with. \"Ah...you'd think these would be more common.\" she says while looking at the tank. Chiyo, who had just finished taping some balloons to a corner of the room with Sakaki's help, walks over to the tank and hears Osaka's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah? You mean the air tank? Well, they are very common, actually. Me and Sakaki saw like five at the party supply shop, but they're only rentals. Nobody really needs their own and the ones that do are ones that inflate balloons on a regular basis.\" Chiyo comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka nods. \"I see. Well...they remind me of this thing I saw on TV. The thing with the helium...want to watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiyo giggles and nods, assuming Osaka means that she was going to use the helium in the tank to make her voice high pitched. \"Hehe, sure, go for it. There's plenty of helium in the tank so using a little bit of it wouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Osaka was thinking about was something she saw on a cartoon show from America. Namely, the character in the show being inflated like a balloon and floating into the air because of the helium. Osaka was determined to do that to herself now that she was presented with the opportunity. Osaka takes the hose in  her hand and jams it into her mouth. Chiyo's jaw drops a little as Osaka cranks up the flow on the tank. Nothing really seems to happen for a moment, but after that Osaka's middle begins to bluge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the girls stop what they're doing and watch Osaka. Even Kaorin focuses her attention on the inflating girl in the middle of the room. Chiyo, Sakaki, and Kaorin, being the timid girls of the group, look on in shock. Yomi and Kagura simply raise an eyebrow while Tomo looks thrilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo's the first to speak up. \"Haha! Go Osaka! Show Yomi who's boss!\" she shouts, which results with Yomi smacking her upside the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls keep quiet until Osaka pulls the hose out of her mouth. Osaka has made herself as wide as she is tall, and now floats a foot off the ground. She smiles in a satsified manner. \"Ahh...so this is what it's like to float...very relaxing.\" She says before giggling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura, Tomo, and Yomi are the first to walk up to the bloated girl. Kagura still has an eyebrow raised while Tomo laughs and pokes Osaka. \"So, how exactly do you move around like that?\" Kagura asks, noticing that Osaka's arms and legs are nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsaka wiggles her feet a bit. \"I still have feet, so I bet I could manage a waddle.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo, meanwhile, has located the tube that Osaka used to inflate herself. She looks over at Chiyo for a moment, who's eyes are still wide at the sight of her best friend filled up and floating like a balloon, and then she looks at the tube itself, wondering if she wanted to inflate herself instead.</span></div></div>",

They don't even know she's about to be inflated until they hear a yelp in Chiyo's voice followed by a hissing noise. What they find is Tomo holding the tube in Chiyo's mouth while she gets filled up. Because of her smaller body, she rounds out much faster than Osaka did. Now everyone's attention is on Chiyo, particularly Yomi and Sakaki's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi is busy trying to wrestle the tube out of Tomo's grasp. Sakaki, however, is looking at the situation from a different persepctive. Now that she's gotten over the shock of watching someone blow up like a balloon, she finds that Chiyo being in the same prediciment is rather cute. This causes Sakaki to blush a little, and she blushes more as she imagines Chiyo swelling up even larger than she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the chaos caused by Tomo and Yomi's fight over the tube Chiyo is being inflated with, no one has noticed that Kaorin is no longer shocked as well. Well, about Chiyo, anyway. What's now gotten her attention is Sakaki's blushing, which she quickly figures is the result of Chiyo inflating. An idea begins to formulate in her head as Tomo has managed to get the hose out of Yomi's grasp at the moment. Tomo prepares to begin inflating Chiyo again, who is too dazed and confused to even realize what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo grins and lunges at Chiyo...</span></div></div>",

The confusion causes Tomo to let go of the hose. \"Eh? Why are you keeping me from inflating Chiyo?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi rolls her eyes. \"That's not what she's doing.\" she says as she points to Kaorin, who is now blissfully inflating herself while holding onto the hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason or probably no reason at all, this irritates Tomo. \"Hey! You're keeping me from forcing people to get big!\" she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaorin doesn't seem to notice though, and is paying more attention to Sakaki, who is now looking at her in the same way she was looking at Chiyo. Kaorin couldn't be happier. <i>\"Heeeeee...I finally have Sakaki-san's attention!</i> She thinks, only stopping when the tank finally runs out of air. Despite this, Kaorin is rather pleased since she's still bigger than Osaka and Chiyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles. \"Hehe, what do you think now, Sakaki-san?\" Kaorin asks, which makes Sakaki blush furiously. After a few moments, she finds herself being hugged by Sakaki, who's still blushing and now has a smile on her face. Kaorin giggles and hugs back, much to Sakaki's delight, since she gets pushed a little deeper into Kaorin's soft and cuddly body. \"How nice...\" Sakaki says as she gently rubs Kaorin's sides, which greatly pleases Kaorin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo grumbles a little as she holds the hose in her hand. \"Now how am I going to force people to bloat up?\" she asks, while Yomi slaps her hand against her own forehead while sighing. \"You won't.\" Yomi replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, I was going to make you big next.\" Tomo says with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't involve me in this!\" Yomi shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo grins. \"It's not like anyone would notice.\" she says, which causes Yomi to lunge at Tomo, which in turn causes the two of them to wrestle with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

We have a bigger problem right now: Namely, there's not much room in here because of our size.\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, there's only around a 2-3 foot wide space left in the room, with Yomi, Tomo, and Kagura occupying the whole space. Sakaki is content with clinging to Kaorin and occupying the small space between the three puffed-up girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo laughs. \"Let's knock out the roof and let 'em float out!\" she says, which causes everyone but Sakaki and Kaorin to sweatdrop. Sakaki and Kaorin instead blush at the thought, imagining themselves floating away together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should do something that DOESN'T involve destroying Chiyo's house or sending our friends into the upper atmosphere.\" Yomi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say we wouldn't tie them down first...\" Tomo mutters as Chiyo begins to speak. \"Yeah...maybe we can try to deflate first. I doubt we'd be able to squeeze ourselves out through the windows at the size we are, but even if all we could do was make ourselves somewhat smaller, we'd have a chance of getting out of this room and trying to figure out what to do from there.\" Chiyo explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo is silent for a moment. \"How about just taking out the wall instead?\" she eventually suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi sighs. \"Can you think of something that wouldn't be a last resort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see you thinking of anything!\" Tomo exclaims, laughing a bit. \"Besides, with you around I'm sure we'd have no trouble taking out a wall!\" Yomi looks very irritated for a moment, but calms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...anyway, let's see what we can do.\" Yomi says, as she, Tomo, and Kagura start by attempting to force the air out of Osaka by squeezing her. They keep trying until they realize that they'd end up popping her before the would ever be able to force any air out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a nice hug.\" Osaka says, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo chuckles a little from what Osaka said. \"So...now can we knock out a wall or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiyo sighs. \"If that's the only way to get out of here, then I guess we have no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo laughs. \"Haha, alright. I have just the thing, too!\" she says as she runs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hope she doesn't have something excessive in mind.\" Yomi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo soon comes back with another helium tank. \"Alright, so my idea is that one of us will be inflated to the point of making the wall burst out due to the pressure! Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaorin jumps at the opportunity to make herself bigger. \"Ooh, I'll be that girl!\" she exclaims excitedly.</span></div></div>",

She grins around the hose as her hands are forced off of it, as if she's thrilled that she'll only stop inflating when there's no more helium in the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tank actually does run out of helium, Tomo looks a little disappointed, dispite that she's inflated even bigger than Osaka. She's so big that her head would still be touching the ceiling regardless of whether she was actually floating or not. \"Hehe, now there's no denying that I'm the best when it comes to puffyness!\" Tomo says, with a wide grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiyo, Kaorin, and Sakaki are still shocked, although it seems that Tomo inflating herself only shocked them to the point of them being as shocked as they where when they first saw Osaka inflate herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi grins a little as she pokes Tomo a little. \"Hehe, what an ironic situation we have here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not ironic at all. I'm just big and puffy, and besides, I don't care. You're the one who has an inner fatty waiting to bust loose and gorge herself until she's as fat as I am puffed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi blinks for a moment. For the first time ever, Tomo making a comment about her weight didn't make her want to hurt Tomo. She was just silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, all that consern over your weight is just to keep yourself from thinking that deep down inside you want to get as fat as possible!\" Tomo says, not realizing what she is saying might just be true.</span></div></div>",

Hehe, you've come to the right stand, then. Just one of these pills will fatten you up with around a cubic foot worth of fat.\" says the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo and Yomi are silent for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that'd be around 35 centimeters. I think a meter would be like three point something here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomo and Yomi shrug. \"I guess that works out.\" Yomi says. \"But do these actually do what they say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl grins and hands Tomo and Yomi a pill. \"See for yourselves. You'll find the fat you gain really will be instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both take the pills, and sure enough, less than a second after they swallow, their midsections quickly bluge out with soft, squishy fat. The girl giggles. \"So, will that be a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the girl managed to sell her whole supply to Tomo and Yomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, the Yomi looks over the bottles. \"Well, at least we don't have to worry about the fat wearing off or anything, and plus it doesn't have any negative impact on the body...\" Yomi says as she reads from the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo laughs. \"Hehe, so that means no heart failure for these two fatties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi nods, and keeps looking for anything of particular interest. \"Let's see...there's at least 250 pills per bottle, and she had like 20, so that's 5000 pills all together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo grins. \"So 2500 feet between the two of us...what exactly would that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that we'd flatten a decent-sized chunk of the city, which is why we're not taking all 2500 pills while we're in the city.\" Yomi explains. \"So...\"</span></div></div>",

I guess we should just get it over with.\" she says, as the pair makes their way out into the outskirts of the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, Yomi. Take a few moments to reflect on what it's like to be skinny, because we'll never be that way again.\" Tomo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi laughs. \"We've had 17 years for that, Tomo. I doubt that not waiting a few more moments will make us regret this.\" She says, as she picks up one of the large jars they got to hold each share of pills. Tomo does the same and they start dumping the contents into their mouths at the same time. In a second, the girls go from 4 feet tall to 100 feet wide, and the rate pretty much remains the same, with the girls ending up 2500 wide in less than half a minute. Dispite being filled with fat, the girls appear to be completely round.

It's kinda like when I was puffed up, only instead of air it's lots and lots of squishy fat.\" Tomo says, as she gets cozy next to Yomi. \"I feel a lot lighter than I expected too...hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi nods. \"Yeah, let's like we have the softness of being fat with the shape and lightness of being puffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best of both worlds!\" Tomo exclaims. \"Woudln't it be interesting if we were fat and ligther than air?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi nods. \"Yeah, it would...but would it even be possible to get that light while still being fat?\"</span></div></div>",

With the last sylable pronouced of good, Kaolla Su's belly bulged outward just enough to keep her dress and shirt from even touching in front of her with the knot she kept tied in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaolla, are you playing a game?\" Sarah asked, wondering how/why Kaolla's belly was so full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i'm playing a game, see who can push out their belly the furthest.\" Kaolla announced as she patted her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's start...wait i'll be back in a minute, haven't gotten anything to eat all day.\" Sarah said, leaving the room with five or six cupcakes on a plate, heading for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinobu, you're up first.\" Kaolla Su said with a grin. Shinobu pulled her shirt up a bit, right below her bra, and revealed a pretty normal belly with only a few \"new\" curves. She started sucking in a slight bit of air and pushing with a good deal of effort, her belly reached the size of half a decent sized soccerball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad!\" Shinobu exclaimed, \"yet it's my turn next, victory shall be mine!

In a matter of minutes her belly resembled that of an entire basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i've got you beat!\" Su said with a cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but you haven't seen me yet,\" Sarah said storming in. Her body looked even skinnier than usual, this was very odd indeed. With a burst of air Sarah opened her mouth and a jet stream of air poured into her belly making it tight and restraining. She wasn't done there, her sheer size was increasing, soon her girlish figure was enhanced to the point where voluptious was an understatement. In only 6 minutes time, her belly went from a size 2 to a size 26 and at that size she looked like herself...but extremely puffy as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concede, this power is too strong.\" Shinobu said with a defeated hunch to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fight you for the title, don't you know? These cupcakes that Kitsune bought make you feel and act like a balloon for a good amount of time, but she did warn of some side affects,\" Kaolla Su said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that's my problem...\" Sarah said in a pretending to be ditsy voice.</span></div></div>",

Once her belly was big enough, the rest of her body followed, slowing forming Sasami into an orb shape. Within a minute, Sasami was a round ball, with just her ends sticking out. Ryoko continued to inflate Sasami until she was around eight feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done with Sasami, she turned the device on herself and pressed the blue button. In a short amount of time, Ryoko was back to her normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko laughs a bit. \"You were right, Sasami, that was fun.\" she says. \"Nothing like a bit of revenge to cheer someone up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...now I'm big...oh well, this is actually kind of neat.\" Sasami says, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko raise an eyebrow. \"Well, I guess some people just get kicks out of being like that.\" she says. \"So, Sasami, since you seem to be with me, who do you think we should pump up next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasami thinks for a moment, then comes to a decision. \"How about...</span></div></div>",

As for me, I'm having a blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Since I'm lazy, and to avoid boring all 5 people who are reading this, I'm going to skip to when Washu and Sasami walk in after dinner.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu look around her lab. \"I can't seem to find that remote control that I need to inflate you with, Sasami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasami seems a bit disappointed. \"Can't you just conjure one up or something.\" Sasami asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu nods. \"I know, but it's more rewarding if I hunt around for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasami notices a that a panel that she saw before was now flashing. \"Uhm, Washu, what does this mean?\" Sasami asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu transports herself next to Sasami. \"I think I found that remote, and Mihoshi and Ayeka for that matter. This panel points me to one of the cargo bays.\" Washu says, as she heads toward the cargo bay Mihoshi and Ayeka were in, while Sasami follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the cargo bay, Sasami and Washu see that Mihoshi has been playing around with the remote. Of course, the only way they can tell that they are Mihoshi and Ayeka is by the clothes they are wearing. They are now around 500 feet each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyeka and Mihoshi see the two standing right outside the door. \"Help me! She's insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihoshi just giggles. \"Hum, who should I go for first? Ayeka said that Sasami got a kick out of it, but then again, I want to give Washu a chance to enjoy this too...\"</span></div></div>",

From what she could gather, the stone was from a civilization predating known history. When the civilization collapsed, the stone was hidden away to prevent thieves from taking the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name of the gem was \"Windstone.\" It was said to have power over air and was created by a powerful wizard as a gift to his wife, as she always loved the summer breezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the wizard's wife died before she received the stone. She was buried not too far from their house, so the wizard left it at her grave. He also put a curse on it, so that no one could steal it as long as the grave existed. Rogue reasoned that the stone was picked up when the civilization ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is that stupid rock?\" Rogue asked herself. She had been searching at the presumed site too long for her liking. Finally, she found a hidden passage in a crack in the cavern wall. Squeezing through, Rogue walked to the center of the room. And there, on a little stand, lay the Windstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there you are.\" Rogue said, now pleased. The sapphire wasn't too large, just large enough to be a handful, but it was very beautiful. Rogue just picked it up and left the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was easy. Rogue thought once she got outside. She was feeling quite good; usually her searches don't go nearly this well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue started to wonder what she would do with the stone. She thought about using it in a necklace. So, she placed it on her chest and began to look for a pond to catch her reflection on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, no sooner then she started looking, Rogue felt a strange tingling within her body.</span></div></div>",

She occasionally needed some time to herself, so she sometimes took a walk every so often to clear her head. The walk was uneventful until Sally accidentally kicked something in the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What do we have here?\" Sally uttered, bending over to pick up the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was small metal container, measuring 6x6 and two inches thick. It was sealed by a small clasp. Sally opened it up the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne side of the container were two sheets of thirty-six capsules, the other had one extra capsule, and two folded pieces of paper. One was labeled \"map.\" The other paper wasn't labeled. Sally read the unlabeled paper first. It was some type of shortened lab report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genetic enhancement capsule. Dermal strength increase by ten. Unsolvable side effect: dermal elasticity increase by ten, eventual spread to whole body.\" Sally scanned. She put the paper back and took the map out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter following the map, Sally found herself at a cave somewhere in the middle of the forest. The mouth of the cave was sealed off by a door with an old, computerized lock. In took a minute for Nicole, Sally's minicomputer, to pick said lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder why this place wasn't marked on the maps at Knothole.</i> Sally thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Sally followed a path into a large hangar of some sort. There were also numerous gas tanks, as well as hoses, even numerous valves, which probably accessed a water source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crept up across Sally's face. She took out the lab report again and read the whole thing. She always wanted a talent that was unique to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what she read, who ever swallowed a capsule would have the ability to inflate themselves for one week, as well as more resilient flesh. There were a few problems though. If a person took more than one capsule per day, they risked they change being permanent. Also, each new capsule multiplied the effect of the previous capsule. The maximum number of pills that could be taken with guaranteeing permanent change was four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downing five capsules, Sally walked to a tank of oxygen, connected a hose, and put the free end into her mouth...</span></div></div>",

How?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot gestured to the other tanks. \"I can set up the air tanks to open simultaneously, and to vent through a single hose into you.\" The robot answered. \"Do you wish to alter the setup?\"</span></div></div>",

The main hose, which was ten time larger than the others, was plugged into Sally's navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All remaining 18 tanks are ready for use.\" The robot answered. \"Do you wish to continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Sally answered.

Dagger grins even wider as she grabs a few of hoses and cranks the tanks they're attached to full blast. She then climbs up the hose and stuffs the other hoses in, which makes Eiko giggle a little each time. Eiko was already 15 feet wide in a minute's time, so adding three more hoses makes the little girl swell at a very impressive rate of a foot per second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the look on her face, Dagger could tell that Eiko was having the time of her life. Dagger grined and decided to climb on top of Eiko. By the time she gets to the top, Eiko's body was almost as wide as the bay door opening. Both girls giggle a little as Eiko's sides squish against the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside, it looks like a giant flesh-colored balloon is being inflated on top of the castle. At her rate of expansion, it doesn't take long for Eiko's body to begin rivaling the size of the castle. Fortunately for Eiko, being rubberized meant that she no longer had private parts, so all that made up the bottom of Eiko's body was a nice, smooth spherical shape with a couple of wiggling feet sticking out, which were soon absorbed by the rest of Eiko's body. Dagger noticed her feet wiggling just before they sunk in and wondered if it was a sign that Eiko was anticipating the moment she would burst or that she was done.</span></div></div>",

Just past the spell for mending burst balloons, and turning balloons into humanoid balloon people, was another enchantment spell that made Dagger\u2019s eyes go wide with excitement.  Carefully but quietly chanting the spell, purple light began flowing from Dagger\u2019s hand, into her balloon friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko was aware something else was being cast on her, but was not sure what.  What she WAS certain of, was that Dagger was smiling, and that the princess was taking in a VERY large breath right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe summoner turned balloon was not going to last much longer.  At least, that is what the two intended anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore!  Faster!\u201d cheered the gigantic red balloon.  \u201cHurry!  I\u2019m almost ready to burst!  You're gonna pop me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen shut-up and POP for me, you cutie balloon!\u201d giggled Dagger, in between breaths.  She playfully kicked Eiko\u2019s over-stretched side, making a big *BOINGINGING!* noise.  \"I'm not holding anything back, so YOU better do the same!  Here it comes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing in enough that her own lungs might as well have been balloons themselves, Dagger pressed her lips tightly against Eiko\u2019s nozzle, and emptied all of the breath she could, hoping this would be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko knew that it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh YES!  I\u2019M POPPI-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KA-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDagger let out a joyful moan, bringing in needed air to her lungs, as her Eiko Balloon finally exploded for her, the red rubber shards quickly turning to glittery pink mist, as the explosion continued to echo all over the place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko, still \u201calive\u201d and fully engrossed in her popping, was only vaguely aware that her remains were now circling her popper, instead of falling snow-like to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading her arms &amp; legs invitingly, Dagger let the rubber-scented cloud of Eiko encircle her body . . .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hrum...I know of only one girl who would try to inflate me in my sleep.\" Dagger says, as she turns to the inside of the front cover to find Eiko's name written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, figures...but that means she must have been inflated when the spell reflected off of me. Since she left the book behind, she must have either made a hasty retreat, or floated off somewhere. The Poor girl must be lost somewhere in the upper atmosphere by now...but just in case, I'll see if she got stuck somewhere.\" Dagger says, as she heads out of her room with the book in tow.</span></div></div>",

Positioning herself so she faced away from Gaia, she began drifting back down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey.. wait a minute.  How does this kind of thing work in a vaccum?\" Eiko watched as the release of air propelled Dagger downward.  \"Oh well.  After you've been blown up to the size of a moon, some things just shouldn't faze you, I guess.\"  Eiko's monolouge was cut off when Dagger yelped slightly.  \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nothing...\" Dagger said, though there was doubt in her voice.  \"My other side is just getting a little warmer... OW!  Ohhh, this isn't good!  Hold on tight, Eiko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dagger felt the intense heat on her body as they slowly reentered the atmosphere of Gaia.  Though she had felt a slight change in temperature as she rose up, it wasn't like this.  She made a mental note that her speed might have something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The heat began to take it's toll on Dagger and her rubber body.  She began to squeeze together as the skin on her rear side weakened, giving into the pressure.  Soon she became dome shaped, then bell shaped as she compacted in on herself.  Finally, a mere hundred feet above ground, all that was left was a flat mass about 30 feet in diameter, with Eiko still holding on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n SPLUT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eiko opened her eyes.  Looking around, she saw the castle in the distance.  They were in a large field just outside of Alexandria.  \"We made it, Dagger!  That was scary... Dagger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Down here.\" Dagger said.  Eiko looked down, and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dagger was now a flesh colored blanket on the ground.  And yet... there was something else about her.  Pinching a piece of her, Eiko easily stretched out a part of Dagger as far as her arm could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow, Dagger.  You're all... gummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, it looks like that reentry softened me up a little... so, what should we do now?\"</span></div></div>",

When I press the three smaller buttons, the devices in one of you will start filling you with air. When I press the main button, you all will inflate at once.

It's impossible to pop you by overinflating you, and your skin is unbreakable. That's because you three are infinately stretchy. Get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri nods. \"Ok, just wanted to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika slaps her hand on her forehead. \"I can't believe you two.

I'll be back when I think of something to do to you three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 9 minutes have passed, and the girls have almost completely filled up the tanks. Their feet and hands had completely sunk into their bodies. The top of the tanks push their heads down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute passes, and the girls finally fill up every inch of the tanks. For a while, there is nothing but slilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri giggles, finally breaking the silence. \"You were right, Suzie. This is cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you so.\" Suzie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika sighs. \"What am I going to do with you two?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back, girls!

But sadly, my work with you is done.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe presses a button on his remote that reads 'deflate all'. Within seconds, the girls quickly deflate, and are teleported out of the tanks. They appear right in front of Inflamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you three like it?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri and Suzie nod. Rika shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInflamon chuckles. \"Well, two out of three isn't bad. Anyway, I have some remotes that control the devices in your bodies. Of course, you can use other stuff, but the remotes allow you to inflate without an external source.\" Inflamon explains, as he hands the remotes to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now, you girls are on your own. Do whatever you want. And remember to have fun.\" he says. Suddenly, he vanishes in a white cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri and Suzie look at Rika. \"Hum...you know, if you were inflated a few more times, I'm sure you would get used to it.\" Jeri says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie giggles. \"Maybe a day or to of us all being stuffed in a room together may change her mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri grins. \"True, but maybe a little time floating in the air with us will persuade her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika gulps. \"I don't like where this conversation is going.\" she says.</span></div></div>",

Rika and Suzie are blown up like balloons, with only their heads, feet, and hands sticking out. Jeri suddenly returns to being calm, then causally walks in, and sits down near the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remains slient for a few moment. \"What on earth is going on here!?\" Jeri yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie giggles. \"We're balloons, Jeri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika nods. \"Yeah. Let me explain. You see, Suzie happens to have this thing for blowing herself up like a balloon.

How do you wanna be blown up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri raises an eyebrow. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika chuckles. \"Well, Suzie brought several sets of three tanks filled with different gasses in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie nods. \"Yeah. I brought over tanks filled with normal air, helium, and...uhm...laughing gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri chuckles. \"You really have laughing gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie nods. \"Yea, so, what do you want?\" Suzie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri thinks for a second. \"Hum...helium sounds nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie nods and hands Jeri the hose. \"Ok, put that in your mouth, and don't take it out until I say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri does so. Suzie turns the dial on the tank. Suzie and Rika watch as Jeri's body looks more like an orb with each passing second. Within about 10 minutes, Jeri is filled up as much as the other two girls are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie turns of the tank. \"There, how's that?\" Suzie asks, hoping for a positive answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri lets out a contented sigh. \"I don't know why I didn't discover this sooner.\" Jeri says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie smiles. \"Good.

Jeri was hooked up to a helium tank. Rika was hooked up to a N20 tank (That's laughing gas), and Suzie was hooked up to plan air.

All three girls turned the dials on their tanks as far as they could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the girls are a little suprised when they quickly swell into completely round orbs in less than a second, but their suprise tuned to joy just as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, their spherical bodies begin to press against the ceiling, so their bodies begin to fill in the space around them more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes from when they started, the tanks run empty.

Suzie and Jeri both come very close to touching the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jeri, what's it like?\" Suzie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeri giggles. \"Nice. Every inch of my body feels great.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika chuckles. \"Now what should we do, girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie smiles. \"Why don't you join us? It's nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika nods. \"I know, and I'm tempted. But then you won't have a set of hands.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking around the hangar, the Gundam located a compressed air tank and placed the tank's nozzle in Sayla's mouth. Sayla was too scared to react as Gundam turned the valve on, causing Sayla's stomach to fill up with air.

As she lifted off, the Gundam automatically shutdown, since it was on White Base, and it had completed the test, the Gundam deduce that there was no reason to stay activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, helium.' Sayla thought. As she was lifted higher up, she was able to move somewhat, and ended up being upside down as she bumped into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayla let out a yelp. Since her feet were spaced so far out, she hit the ceiling butt first. Plus her inflation stretched her suit's material out to the point where it wasn't any good as insulation from the cold the hull had picked up outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder how Amuro, of all people, could've missed whatever malfunction made Gundam do this.'

Kai, White Base's resident smartass, would never let her hear the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayla looked around the MS deck. At 18 meters, the Gundam was the tallest MS on White Base, but the decks themselves weren't much taller than the MS themselves. They were twice as wide as the MS though. With this in mind, Sayla couldn't wait at the ceiling for the gas to wear off. Especially since at twenty feet, or six meters, she was a third of the Gundam's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is great.\" Sayla muttered. But things weren't too bad. The White Base wasn't under attack and the repair crew was concentrated at the other side of the ship. It was then that Sayla noticed something; being inflate wasn't too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she thought about it, the more she enjoyed it. Being inflated took a little getting used to, but to Sayla, it was a pleasant feeling.

Looks like it worked.\" He said out loud, before leaping in, shattering the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What?\" Peach's body wobbled slightly as she tried to turn.  \"Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why, it's your Romeo, my perfectly pneumatic Juliet.\" Bowser said, flashing a fanged smile.  \"And I'm here to sweep you away...\" His eyes narrowed. \"Or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You... You did this to me!\" Peach fumed. \"You sick lizard!  What reason could you possibly have to turn me into some kind of party favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Easy.\" Bowser said, batting Peach with the backside of his claw.  She rolled backwards.  \"You're much easier to keep track of this way.  You can't move around.  And if Mario tries to take you back...\" He lightly pushed a claw into Peach's backside, making her whimper.  \"I just threaten to pop you like the balloon you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Peach whimpered again.  \"...And am I stuck like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fear not, my beautiful balloon bride.  I just need to let the air out.\" Bowser assured her.  But first, we need to take care of some things...</span></div></div>",

Dr. Light and Megaman left early to go attend a two week conference on advancements in robotic energy systems, and Dr. Light wanted to showcase his prototype micro-fusion generator. But having a tidy home for them to come home to wasn't Roll's motivation. Not by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tidying up some of Dr. Light's notes when she came across some of his notes from when he upgraded Megaman when Dr. Wily first tried to conquer the world. According to them, Dr. Light was planning to install an emergency floatation system into some of his robots. But due to his upgrade, Megaman couldn't use the system. Roll had both a certain interest and a curiosity for inflation, so naturally, she would let this chance go to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little effort for Roll to hide her purchases, but she was able to make and install a floatation system, and even a few improvements. All she was missing was an internal gas cartridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Roll had a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see.\" Roll said. \"I installed the little plug-in where I would have a navel, and enough helium tanks to last me for the whole two weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll attached one end of a long hose into a tank, and plugged the other end into her own nozzle.

She decided to wear a pink robe that Megaman had gotten her for Christmas last year. She never thought of any use for it, but she thanked him all the same. Since the robe would be easier to move than her dress, Roll decided to switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll couldn't help but giggle. Even with the helium that wore off, she was still too large to wear the robe, so all she had on were her panties. But since she was a robot, she didn't have any \"noticeable features\" that humans do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only bad thing about this is that I have to get rid of the gas I already have.\" Roll spoke as she opened her valve and vented the helium from yesterday. It was as new a sensation as inflating was. Roll put her robe on and plugged the hose inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here I go!\" She cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll felt the helium enter her body via the hose, where it moved through a system of tubes that ran all over her body. Roll looked down at her breasts as they started to fill up with helium, growing widder and rounder by the moment. She also felt the same happening to her butt and thighs. Roll giggled again because it almost felt like the two areas  were competing to be the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Roll took in what she felt was satisfactory, she turned off the tank, disconnected the hose, and ran over to the bathroom to see herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I  never thought I could make some areas of my body so big.\" Roll said in awe. Her breasts had become perfectly round, each one the size of a volleyball.

Roll felt the water flow from her belly, and then was divided into her now plumping breasts. Soon, Roll had regained half of her previous figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder if I can make the water flow both ways if I laid down or something?' Roll thought as she stood back up. She closed off her breasts, making her belly start to fill up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll first tried just laying down on the floor, but the water inside of her just spread out. Next she tried a crabwalk position, but arched her back by ten degrees. Now the water moved where she wanted it to go. What water was still in her belly Roll simply drained into her lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" Roll cheered as she regained her figure. Standing back up, she turned off the valve, but kept the hose in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Roll did was hop a few times. The sensations Roll felt throughout her body were fantasic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" Roll exclaimed, rubbing her breasts with her left hand and her butt with the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Roll remembered when she emptied the helium tank earlier. She also realized that if parts of her could become that big, she could become just downright huge if she filled her whole body up. The only problem either way was how would she turn the valve off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could program a voice command into the valve.\" Roll said. Most of the equipment in the lab was built to be automatic, so Roll just programmed a few comands into the computer to run the valve, so all she had to do was clear the lab so she would have enough room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a half hour, Roll had cleared out the lab, and was ready to fill herself up.

Okay, so Alia has a thing for inflating her stomach; big deal I've seen stranger things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean that she can just use our stuff.\" Douglas rebutted. Being a mechanic, he had different ideals about equipment than X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSignas leaned back in his seat. His chair made an annoying squeak sound.  \"You're both right.\" He said. \"But still, it's not a good habit. If she becomes addicted to it, it'll eventually interfere with her work. I suggest we try and break Alia's habit.\" Said Signas. \"Since Reploids aren't built with an inflation ability, she obviously modified herself using some of the repair equipment here. Find what equipment she used, then change it so that when she uses it again-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX got up from one of the chairs in front of Signas' desk. \"I'm sorry, but I don't  see why we should do anything about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better not tell Alia about this.\" Signas said warningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX sighed. \"Oh, I have a year's worth of vacation time built up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX walked over to the door. \"If you need me, I'll be in the bahamas.\" He then walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, what excuse should we use to get Alia back inside the repair equipment?\" Douglas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia crept back into the storage room. A wall had strangely collapsed, flooding all of the quarters in the west wing, her wing, with slight radiation. Now that she had gone through the de-contamination, she went back to the room. She picked a fresh tank, and sat down in her chair like usual. But what she didn't know was that, thanks to Douglas, her armor had been modified to come off so that it wouldn't limit her inflation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eagerly started the airflow.</span></div></div>",

From her first mission with the Federation to nearly every contract she accepted, she could be certain the pirates were involved somewhow. Her now deceased mark was a scientist for these pirates, which Samus found hard to wrap her mind around. The space pirates were so barbaric, it was hard to think that any of them would have intelligent thought, let alone any advanced cognitive function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat mattered was that her target was finished, but she would need proof of her kill. Samus switched her visor to scan the body. She hoped she wouldn't have to take a part of the body; it was far easier to find a unique trinket or artifact as confirmation. With her reputation, nobody really questioned her claims, but Samus usually preferred to keep things by the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer visor illuminated a small disc attached to the pirate's belt. Picking it up, it immediately displayed a projection of the now deceased pirate, along with some information written in the pirate's own language. A quick translation showed the information to be an identification and access permissions. \"That's enough to claim the bounty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to leave, Samus' scan visor picked up some information on the nearby computer. She approached the terminal, reading what the visor had translated as she walked. Before she could even make it to the console, however, she froze in her tracks. \"No...\" she muttered. \"That's... they can't be doing that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing its scan, Samus' visor sent the information to her logbook. She quickly accessed the logs, hoping that she misread what she had just seen moments ago. Unfortunately, her suspicions were confirmed. \"Shit...\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounty would have to wait. There was no way Samus could let the pirates continue...</span></div></div>",

As a child, she witnessed the death of her parents at the hands of Ridley and the Space Pirates. Hell, she had even infiltrated their headquarters, with minimal intel, and slayed Kraid, Ridley, and their leader Mother Brain. She was an unstoppable force.

Logic would dictate that, in the absence of a leader, their organization should have been falling apart. Yet, here was an entry, in the space pirate's database, that showed the pirates continuing their experiments and efforts as if Samus' interference had done nothing to hinder them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bastards are stubborn, I'll grant them that. Still, I need to figure out what these experiments are about. There has to be some way to access the redacted elements of this entry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood in thought, Samus eyes fell upon her dead bounty mark. It was at that moment she had come up with an idea. She pulled out the identification disc, the hologram reappearing as it was brought into the open. \"C'mon, where is it... there!\" Apparently, her target <i>had</i> BETA level authorization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInputting the pirate's credentials code, Samus scanned the now complete entry. Though the pieces were coming together, rationally it made no sense to the bounty hunter. \"What are they trying to do? Why would they experiment on...?\"</span></div></div>",
