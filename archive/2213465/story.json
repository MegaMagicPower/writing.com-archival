You will encounter many different people, places, creatures, and experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVault 73 is located a few miles outside the edge of Kansas City, somewhere along the Kansas-Missouri border. The area wasn't directly hit by nuclear bombs, but two landed east of the area and one landed west of the area. Luckily, you were a control vault, you think. Nothing too life changing if there was an experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease do not reuse material that appears in other fallout games, however I will leave a list of factions that are allowed to exist in this area. I strongly urge that you make you own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowed Canon Factions:<br>\r\n1. Brotherhood of Steel (Must be a Branch)<br>\r\n2. Raiders (Common)<br>\r\n3. Enclave (Must be a Branch)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, try to keep everything lore friendly. </td>",
