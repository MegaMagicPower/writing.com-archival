            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I took a quick look at my watch as I stepped out of one of the bathroom stalls; sighing when I realized I had 10 minutes before I had to meet my mom out front.  Holding my dirty gym clothes in one hand, I started back towards the locker area.  On my way I stopped by one of my teammates as she was icing her ankle.  \u201cSorry again for what happened, Amber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and I were among several girls practicing a routine for the upcoming Homecoming game.  She had just finished her part of the routine, which involved doing a flip in midair, when I slipped on a patch of wet grass while trying to catch her.  I ended up on my back while she landed awkwardly on her ankle.  \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, Cass; none of us knew that patch of grass was wet.\u201d Looking up at me, holding the ice pack in one hand, Amber said, \u201cBesides it\u2019s just a twisted ankle, I\u2019ll be fine before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still feel bad about it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWhose bright idea was it to practice on the field right after a thunderstorm, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust than another squad mate, Kelsey Rogers, came walking over to us.  After exchanging a look with Amber, she turned to me and said, \u201cA few of us are heading to the mall to look at Homecoming dresses, you in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at my watch to see that I now had 5 minutes to get out front, I said, \u201cI\u2019d love to, but my parents are forcing me to see a therapist and my first sessions in like 20 minutes.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll probably go shopping with Kat and Melanie after school tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and Kelsey exchanged looks again, before turning back to me.  With a curious look on her face, Amber said, \u201cWhy are your folks sending to therapy?  Does it have something to do with your accident?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a particularly life-altering experience a month ago, just prior to the start of school; one that changed my life in a very profound way.  I quickly bounced back but I guess my parents and, to a lesser extent, my older brother thought that happened too quickly.  \u201cYeah, they\u2019re worried I\u2019m still in denial about the whole thing.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIs it bad that I\u2019ve already come to terms with what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly; it\u2019s more weird than bad.\u201d Looking at me, Kelsey said, \u201cIf I were in your position, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d have moved on this quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then my smart watch started vibrating, I looked down and saw a text from my mom \u2013 <b>Where are you? We\u2019re going to be late.</b>  Walking past them, towards my locker, I said, \u201cYou sound a lot like my mom; but I\u2019ll tell you what I told her \u2013 I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; it sounds to me like you\u2019re in denial about this whole thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing my things from my locker and putting on my <i>Greenville Cheer</i> jacket, I said my goodbyes and left the locker room.  No sooner had I left the locker room when I heard a familiar voice calling my name.  Turning around I saw my best friends Kat and Melanie Maddox approaching me. Despite being identical twins, they were total opposites in terms of personality; Kat was feminine while Melanie had a more masculine energy.  No one at school knew this; but Melanie was a lesbian and dating a girl from a neighboring town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew from the look on Kat\u2019s face that she had something to say; being short on time, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk, Kat; I\u2019m running late for an appointment I didn\u2019t want in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to catch up with me, Kat said, \u201cI know; I just wanted to make sure we were still on for tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d looking at them both, a smile on my face, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not passing up the opportunity to see Mel in a dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the years I\u2019d known them, I\u2019d only rarely seen Melanie wear anything remotely feminine.  It was as if she had an aversion to them.  \u201cYeah, about that.\u201d Sighing as she looked at the two of us, Melanie said, \u201cI was thinking of wearing a tux.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kat and I stopped in our tracks; looking at her sister, surprised, Kat said, \u201cSis, you promised both of us you\u2019d wear a dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Mel; even I\u2019m going to be wearing one.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to kill you to wear a dress for one night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around to make sure the hallway was empty, Kat leaned in and said, \u201cBesides; don\u2019t you think a tux would be a bit of a <br>\r\ngiveaway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie looked at the two of us for a moment; eventually realizing that we weren\u2019t going to back down.  \u201cGod you guys can be so annoying sometimes.\u201d Sighing, Melanie said, \u201cIf it\u2019ll shut you both up, I\u2019ll wear a damn dress to homecoming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d reached the main entrance at that point; I could see Mom\u2019s car out front.  Rushing out the door, I looked back and said, \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll text you guys later on.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once I got into the car, I wasn\u2019t surprised when Mom started lecturing me.  \u201cYou better hope we don\u2019t run into traffic, young lady.\u201d Turning to me as we left the parking lot, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky we were able to get you an appointment at the last minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think lucky is the correct word, Mom; I didn\u2019t even want this appointment in the first place.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t everyone just believe me when I say that I\u2019m fine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how anyone can be <i>fine</i> so soon after experiencing what you did.\u201d Glancing at me as she turned into traffic, Mom said, \u201cEven if you turn out to be fine, what\u2019s the harm in having a little therapy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention was momentarily focused on the sight of a familiar boy walking down the street holding his football equipment.  Jeff Anderson was the same age as my brother Glenn; and as you no doubt figured out, he was on the football team.  From the first time I saw him, I felt giddy every time I ran into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched him until we drove around the corner, turning back to find Mom looking at me.  \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sincere smile on her face, Mom said, \u201cIs that the boy you\u2019re interested in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t want to admit it, but she was right. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe seems like a nice boy; why don\u2019t you ask him out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said that thought hadn\u2019t occurred to me; but, as far as I was concerned, the chances of him saying yes were non-existent.  \u201cPlease; like he\u2019d even give me the time of day.\u201d Looking at Mom, scoffing, I said, \u201cBesides; a cheerleader dating a football player sounds so clich\u00e9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at Shoreline Family Therapy a few minutes later; I begrudgingly went in alone while Mom drove off to do some quick errands.  I\u2019d barely had a chance to check in before the therapist, a young woman in her mid-twenties, walked out of a nearby room.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou must be Cassidy Scott.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was the only one in the room apart from the receptionist; I couldn\u2019t help but look at her with a \u2018duh\u2019 look on my face.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m Cassidy Scott; what gave it away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore my comment, she said, \u201cCome on in and have a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed the therapist into the room and took a seat on her couch; noting with interest the way she was looking at my jacket.  I started to feel a little self-conscious, wondering if there was something wrong with my outfit.  \u201cWhy are you staring at me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to stare.\u201d Taking a seat across from me, she said, \u201cI went to Oak Grove High; I was on the cheer squad when we won regionals 6 years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ended up spending almost twenty minutes just talking; I learned her name was Grace Connelly, she was 24 years old and had been the captain of my squad her senior year.  \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, considering I didn\u2019t want to come here in the first place, but we\u2019ve spent the last 20 minutes talking about cheerleading.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d Grabbing a notepad, Dr. Connelly said, \u201cSo Cassidy, why don\u2019t you want to be here today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out of a heavy sigh, I said, \u201cBecause this is all big waste of time; my family just needs to move on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove on from what, exactly?\u201d looking at me, Dr. Connelly said, \u201cDid something happen recently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you could say that; I had an accident last month that changed my life.\u201d Looking up at the ceiling for a moment, I said, \u201cMy family seems to think that I\u2019ve adapted to everything too quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJotting something down on her notepad, Dr. Connelly said, \u201cYou seem in perfect health, so was the accident really as dramatic as you\u2019re making it out to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about broken bones, Doctor; I said it changed my life.\u201d giving off an exasperated sigh, I said, \u201cTrust me when I say it changed everything about me; even my name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d I could tell that Dr. Connelly was becoming more interested in what I was saying.  \u201cWhat was your name before this accident?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon realized there was no undoing what was about to happen; once it was out there, there was no taking it back.  Taking a deep breath, I looked at her and said, \u201cMy name was Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus?\u201d looking at me, confused, Dr. Connelly said, \u201cForgive me, but is that a family name?  I\u2019ve never met a girl named Marcus before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Doc; I wasn\u2019t a girl before the accident.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI was a boy; head to toe and all points in between.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Connelly was silent for a few moments as she tried to process what I\u2019d just told her.  Eventually she cleared her throat and said, \u201cAre you messing with me right now?\u201d looking me over, in disbelief, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way you used to be a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe me either; but I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d Digging my phone from my purse, I said, \u201cIt was, without a doubt, the single most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the photo gallery on my phone and handed it to Dr. Connelly.  The phone in her hand, she said, \u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are photos one of my classmates took; showing the initial stages of the transformation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking through the plethora of photos, Dr. Connelly handed the phone back to me.  \u201cForgive me, but how exactly did all that happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it all started about a month ago...\u201d</span></div></div>",

I woke up to the sound of my mom knocking first on my brother Glenn\u2019s door and then mine, sayings, \u201cWake up boys, we have to be at the doctor\u2019s office in 45 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was going to be a busy day for me; Mom was taking Glenn and I to the doctor to make sure we were up to date on our shots, then I was going to Freshman Orientation.  Groaning as I got out of bed, I said to myself, \u201cPlease let this be a stress-free day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out of my bedroom, I started walking down the hall as Glenn came out of his room.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cHey little bro, you excited to start high school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d Shrugging as we both entered the bathroom, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of going to Orientation; after all, you didn\u2019t go last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat on the toilet while I started brushing my teeth, Glenn said, \u201cI didn\u2019t go last year because I\u2019d just broken my leg, remember?\u201d looking at me, Glenn said, \u201cBesides, the point of Orientation is to meet new people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I going to meet new people, if I\u2019ve known everyone since the 6th grade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you got me there.\u201d Flushing the toilet, Glenn said, \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t hurt to expand your social circle beyond Kat and Melanie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Kat and Melanie?\u201d turning to Glenn, I said, \u201cThey\u2019ve been my best friends since we moved to the neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with them, Marcus; it\u2019s just I can\u2019t help think you\u2019re spending too much time with them.\u201d Gesturing to my waist, Glenn said, \u201cYou\u2019re even starting to use some of Kat\u2019s mannerisms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, I saw that Glenn was right; I\u2019d placed my hands on my waist in the same way that Kat loved to do.  Crossing my arms, I said, \u201cDoes this have anything to do with Melanie refusing to date you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn has had a crush on Melanie for the better part of two years; he\u2019d flirt with her every chance he got.  The three of us couldn\u2019t believe that Glenn had no clue Melanie was a lesbian; nothing short of her kissing her girlfriend in front of him would knock some sense into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d be absolutely perfect together; but she won\u2019t give me the time of day.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cAm I not her type or something?\u201d<br>\r\nIt was all I could do not to tell Glenn the truth, but I figured it wasn\u2019t my place to do so.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask her, once and for all, why she keeps shooting you down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us walked out of the bathroom, back towards our rooms, Glenn said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll ask her.\u201d Stopping outside his door, Glenn said, \u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll try to make some more friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I promise.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking at Glenn, I figured his was tender as well because of the way he was holding his arm.  There was a new vaccine regimen that involved injecting a person with several vaccines at once.  One of the possible side-effects was that the injection site would be sore for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we came to a stop in front of the school, I saw Melanie and Kat standing nearby.  After saying goodbye to Mom, Glenn and I got out to join them.

While I went to sign in with Kat and Melanie, Glenn went off to meet up with his fellow student guides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came as no surprise when we were split into separate groups; I stayed with Kat while Melanie was placed with another group.  Kat and I stood in the hallway with the 6 remaining members of the group, waiting for our guide to show up.  When he did, I noticed that Kat and the other girls instantly took an interest in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introducing himself as Jeff, we began the tour of the building.  It wasn\u2019t until we\u2019d been walking for about 10 minutes that it started to dawn on me why Kat and the other girls were interested in Jeff.  He was handsome in a rugged sort of way, not too muscular but not chubby either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orientation tour lasted about an hour; Jeff took us to every key area of the school.

By the time we caught up with them, Melanie and Glenn were already seated and eating their lunches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, what took you guys so long?\u201d Putting her sandwich down, Melanie said, \u201cI thought the tours were only supposed to take 45 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we took our seats, I gestured to Kat and said, \u201cEvery girl in the group, including your sister, was practically drooling over our guide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was practically rolling her eyes; saying, \u201cMy twin sister, ladies and gentlemen \u2013 a sucker for every attractive guy she sees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, perhaps I should tell Amanda how you were focusing on your guide\u2019s chest.\u201d Ignoring the death stare that she was receiving from Melanie, Kat said, \u201cBesides, can you blame me?  Jeff was pretty easy on the eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the middle of taking a bite of my sandwich, but that didn\u2019t some me from nodding and saying, \u201cHear, hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even process what I\u2019d just said, Glenn was standing next to me.  \u201cGuys don\u2019t talk like that about other guys unless they\u2019re into that sort of thing.\u201d Whispering into my ear, he said, \u201cYou definitely need to find some guy friends, you\u2019re starting to talk too much like Kat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hits just kept on coming at that point as I suddenly started feeling achy and feverish.  The closest one to me, Kat said, \u201cMarc, are you feeling alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m be okay.\u201d Wiping the sweat from my forehead, while clutching my stomach, I said, \u201cHopefully, they'll have the AC fixed soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at me in confusion, while Kat said, \u201cWhat are you talking about, the AC is fine.  If anything, it should be a little cooler in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I realized that I was the only one sweating.  I started to speak but suddenly keeled over as the pain in my stomach got 100x worse.  A large crowd started to gather around me as I screamed in pain.  Some people asked if I was okay as Kat and Melanie tried to clear people away while Glenn was on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could barely hear Kat as she yelled, \u201cLet him breathe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing wasn\u2019t a problem; it was everything else that seemed to be affected.  Having just gotten off the phone, Glenn knelt next to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, Marc; the EMTs are on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly someone in the crowd let out a shocked gasp, while Kat looked down at me, \u201cMarc, you look...different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I couldn\u2019t see myself, I had no idea what she was talking about.  Standing next to her sister, in shock, Melanie said, \u201cYour hair is getting longer, and your face...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t hear the end of that sentence because my attention was suddenly focused on a tightness in my chest.  Looking down, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing \u2013 my chest was swelling as two mounds of flesh start growing under my shirt.  <i>What the hell?  Am I growing breasts?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s the last thing I remembered before passing out from the pain.</span></div></div>",

My groans must\u2019ve alerted someone because I suddenly heard Glenn\u2019s voice nearby, \u201cLook who\u2019s finally waking up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy memory was fuzzy, so I couldn\u2019t completely remember what happened earlier.  I opened my eyes just as I felt an intense wave of discomfort.  Turning towards the sound of Glenn\u2019s voice, I was surprised to see him lying in a nearby hospital bed with an IV in his arm.  \u201cGlenn?  Are you all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I noticed was that my voice sounded different; it was higher pitched and sounded almost angelic.  The second thing I noticed was the look on Glenn\u2019s face; a mixture of horror and sadness.  \u201cI\u2019m fine, this is just a precaution.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was keenly aware of both the weight on my chest and my higher-pitched voice, but I couldn\u2019t explain any of it.  \u201cI don\u2019t know; the last thing I remember was doubling over in pain at school.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI must\u2019ve been dreaming because I swear that I saw breasts underneath my shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it wasn\u2019t a dream, Marcus.\u201d Sitting up in bed, his voice all serious, Glenn said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly overwhelmed with trepidation, I looked down and my jaw dropped \u2013 staring at me from underneath a hospital gown was a pair of large, and very real, breasts.  Before I knew what was happening, I blacked out and fell back onto the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, the room was empty save for me and my mom.  As she looked at me with concern in her eyes, I said, \u201cI-I just had this weird dream\u2026that I\u2019d somehow grown breasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctors aren\u2019t sure how it happened yet, sweetie.\u201d Moving closer, digging through her purse, Mom handed me something and said, \u201cTake a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked and saw the picture of a teenage girl.  Turning back to Mom, I was about to ask what was going on when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  Looking back at the photo, I saw that the girl suddenly looked confused \u2013 as confused as I felt.  Turing my attention to Mom, as reality slowly began to dawn on me, I said, \u201cM-Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly occurred to me that Mom had yet to call me by my name; instead, she kept calling me sweetie or honey.  A sudden itch brought my hand up to my nose.  It wasn\u2019t until I saw the girl scratching her nose that I realized this wasn\u2019t a picture in my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at mom in stunned silence as she nodded in understanding.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid it wasn\u2019t a dream, Marcus.  The doctors aren\u2019t sure what happened; but, somehow, you\u2019ve been turned into a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feel of losing my grip on mom\u2019s compact, and the sound of it hitting the floor, was the last thing I remembered before blacking out again.</span></div></div>",

Mom was trying her best to keep him calm, but it was a futile gesture.  Judging from the bags under her eyes, I figured the doctor had be on the clock for a while; the last thing she needed was to be berated by my dad.  \u201cMy son turns into a girl in front of 50 people, and you can\u2019t even give me an explanation for why it happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more of my memory started coming back, I remembered being in the cafeteria when I started to experience the worst pain of my life.  No one seemed to realize that I was awake again; however, before I could do anything about that, Glenn spoke up, \u201cHey guys, she\u2019s awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few hours, at most, had passed since the orientation; I barely had time to process what happened and my older brother was already referring to me as a girl.  I gave Glenn a pained expression while the others rushed over to my bedside.  I started squirming a little when Mom gave me a big hug, leading Dad to say, \u201cElaine stop, you\u2019re suffocating her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pained expression returned when I heard Dad call me \u2018her,\u2019 although it was soon replaced by a look of relief when Mom released me from her clutches.  While her hug had made it difficult for me to breathe, I didn\u2019t much care for the feeling of my breasts being squeezed.  Looking at everyone, while I moved to sit up in bed, I said, \u201cCan someone please explain what happened?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cLast time I checked, it wasn\u2019t possible for something like this to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad both turned to the doctor, who slowly stepped forward and said, \u201cWe\u2019re running every conceivable test we can think of, Marcus.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cFor now we\u2019re working on the assumption that you were injected with something when you were vaccinated earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn and I both went pale when we heard that; we were both thinking the same thing.  Turning my attention back to the doctor, \u201cWe both had the same shots, so why did I turn into a girl and Glenn didn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re unsure why Glenn wasn\u2019t affected the same way you were; for now, we\u2019re keeping him here for observation.\u201d  Trying her best to look reassuring, the doctor said, \u201cThe best case scenario is that you were unlucky, and your brother will be fine; worst case is that you\u2019ll end up with an older sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of us said a word while Mom and Dad turned to the doctor.  Looking justifiably concerned, Mom said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen now, Doctor Somers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s entirely up to your...daughter, ma\u2019am.\u201d Sighing, Dr. Somers said, \u201cWe can give her some time to process this, or we can take her for some tests to figure out what caused this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned their attention to me, which made me feel extremely uncomfortable.  I was never a fan of making major decisions, and this one certainly qualified.  After taking a moment to process everything, I sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019d like ______.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d be lying if I said the chance to examine a female body up close wasn\u2019t appealing.  Looking around the room at everyone, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I think I\u2019d like a few minutes alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost everyone was understanding, save for Glenn.  He glanced at me for a moment before turning to Mom, \u201cWhy does Marcus need to be alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at me for a moment before she turned her attention to Glenn.  \u201cGlenn, your new sister wants to have some privacy; just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019d want if this happened to you.\u201d Gently helping him from the bed, Mom said, \u201cNow let\u2019s give her some privacy, as she requested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn\u2019s face was blank as he slowly walked towards the door; only to turn and look at me once he realized what Mom was talking about.  Seeing the shocked look in his eyes made me blush even more; the last thing I needed right now was him picturing me examining my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shocked expression remained on Glenn\u2019s face as he left the room with Dad and Dr. Somers.  Mom stayed behind for a moment, sitting on the edge of my bed.  The way she was looking at me only served to make me blush even more.  Taking my hand in hers, Mom said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright sweetie, there\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say mom; you\u2019ve been a girl your whole life.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cI never figured the first naked girl I saw would be me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom leaned over and kissed me on the forehead before getting to her feet.  \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside if you need anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! This is embarrassing enough as it is, I don\u2019t want your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d say that; but thought I\u2019d mention it anyway.\u201d Giving my hand an affectionate squeeze, Mom said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be outside when you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was finally alone it took me a few minutes to get up the courage to walk into the bathroom.  When I finally got out of bed, I quickly noticed that I was somehow shorter than this morning.  I wondered what could\u2019ve affected my height when I realized there were more pressing matters to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly walked into the bathroom and closed the door; taking a deep breath, I turned to face my reflection in the mirror.  Even though I\u2019d already seen it through my mom\u2019s compact, seeing my new reflection in a larger mirror was still a shock.  My hair, which I\u2019d always kept on the short side was now down just past my shoulders; and I swear it had gotten just a little lighter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent a few minutes looking at my body from every conceivable angle before I finally got up the courage to strip naked.  Once I did that, I was faced with the realization that I looked like a younger version of my mom, down to the large breasts and curvaceous figure.  I had to remind myself that the girls on my mom\u2019s side tended to develop early, which explained why I was more developed than the average 14-year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fondling my breasts for a few minutes, I decided to turn my attention down below.  I slowly brought my hand down and started to explore; overwhelmed with a plethora of new, and pleasurable, sensations.  Due in large part to my inexperience with the female form, my exploration led to a sudden, and embarrassingly loud, moan escaping my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly covered my mouth in embarrassment, as I was certain it had been loud enough for people to hear it outside.  Not wanting to cause any more problems, I promptly got dressed and left the room.  As I walked into the hall, I noticed Dad and Glenn both had looks of embarrassment on their faces as they turned to look away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to blush from embarrassment as Mom and Dr. Somers both gave me sympathetic looks.  Placing a hand on my shoulder, Mom said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to be ashamed of, sweetie; what you did is perfectly normal for a girl your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling embarrassed, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cThanks Mom.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They took half a dozen vials of blood from each of us to run various blood tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Somers eventually had all the information she\u2019d need for the time being; while the assistant brought the vials to be tested, she walked over to us.  As if being a girl wasn\u2019t bad enough, I noticed myself watching the lab assistant as he left the room \u2013 especially his muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found myself briefly imagining those arms holding me tight; an image that I quickly pushed to the back of my mind.  If anyone noticed anything out of the ordinary, they didn\u2019t say anything.

Coming over to me, Mom said, \u201cThe good news, sweetie, is that it will be a while before you have to get another one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I relieved to hear that, I was also disturbed by the idea it was going to be a regular part of my life now.  \u201cI really don\u2019t want to think about that right now, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting in bed to get a better look, Glenn said, \u201cDid it hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Glenn, it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Trying not to give too much information, Mom said, \u201cIt just feels strange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Mom, as I went to put my pillow over my head, I yelled, \u201cI <i>said</i> I don\u2019t want to think about it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom finally got the hint, she turned to Dad and said, \u201cCome on, honey; let\u2019s let the kids rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mom and Dad left the room, Glenn turned to me and said, \u201cDid you really say \u2018daddy\u2019 when Dad and I left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear Glenn was more talkative now than he\u2019d ever been; right at the time where I just wanted to be left alone.  \u201cI guess so; I was probably tired from all the blood they took.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew deep down that wasn\u2019t the reason; it was a side effect of being such good friends with Kat and Melanie.  I spent a lot of time at their house on the weekends, when their dad was home and they both called him Daddy.  I figured it was just one more thing that had rubbed off on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, Glenn came over to me and said, \u201cSo what can you tell me about the exam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d looking at him, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re a boy, you don\u2019t get the exam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may not be a boy for much longer.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cI get that it was weird for you, so what\u2019s the least weird thing about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Glenn nodded, I held up an index finger on each hand and said, \u201cDr. Somers took two fingers; one went up my hoo-hoo, the other went up my hoo-hah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn started squirming a little as he went to lie down again.  \"Let's get some rest, Marcus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to get some rest, but I certainly didn't feel much like a Marcus.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two hours I spent trying to fall asleep were some of the most uncomfortable moments of my life.  My new breasts got in the way no matter what position I tried; my preferred position of sleeping on my stomach was by far the worst.  Eventually Glenn had enough of my tossing and turning, saying, \u201cWould you stop making so much noise?  Just pick a position already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m keeping you awake, your majesty.\u201d Angrily throwing my pillow at Glenn\u2019s head, I gestured towards my chest and said, \u201cBut you try sleeping with <i>these</i> things for the first time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please.\u201d Throwing the pillow back at me, Glenn said, \u201cBy my count you\u2019ve been asleep for almost three hours, what with all the times you\u2019ve been unconscious since lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting annoyed, with the pillow in my right hand, I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t have to worry about then; because I was unconscious, dummy.\u201d<br>\r\nThings soon devolved to the point where Glenn and I were bickering and having a heated pillow fight.  This went on for a good five minutes or so until I spotted something out of the corner of my eye \u2013 Kat, Melanie and Amanda were standing in the doorway looking at us in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn and I quickly calmed down as Kat rolled her eyes, \u201cI guess it\u2019s true; the more things change, the more they stay the same.  Even after turning into a girl, the two of you are still fighting with each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to me, Glenn said, \u201cSomeone couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position to sleep in, and it was bugging the hell out of me.\u201d<br>\r\nFrom the look on her face, it was obvious that Kat didn\u2019t appreciate Glenn\u2019s comment.  \u201cYou seriously need to learn to read the room, Glenn.\u201d Gesturing to Melanie and Amanda, both of whom were standing behind her, Kat said, \u201cWe may not be as endowed <br>\r\nas Marcus, but we\u2019re not immune to that problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but blush; I knew I was endowed but hearing my best friend say that was a little embarrassing.  For their part, both Amanda and Melanie nodded in agreement.  \u201cShe\u2019s only had breasts for a few hours, how do you expect her to be used to them already?\u201d with a tinge of annoyance in her voice, Amanda said, \u201cIf this had happened to you instead of her, trust me when I say you\u2019d have the same problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d looking at everyone, I said, \u201cGlenn could very well end up being affected same as me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looks on their faces changed once they heard that.  All three of them went to Glenn\u2019s bedside, where I listened as they expressed their sympathy.  Glenn tried to play it cool, putting on a brave front for the girls, but I knew he was terrified by the possibility of turning into a girl like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of them talking to him, Glenn climbed out of bed and walked over to me.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marcus.\u201d Bowing his head in shame, Glenn continued, \u201cI\u2019ll try to be more sympathetic to what you\u2019re going through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t really thrilled with Glenn\u2019s treatment of me since I woke up; instead of trying to help, he\u2019d been acting as though it was inconveniencing him.  But I could tell that he was being sincere in his apology.  With a sigh, I said, \u201cApology accepted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings settled down after that; to the extent they could under the circumstances.  Kat and the others were focusing most of their attention on me, which made me feel like I was under the microscope.  They seemed to be focused on my new physical appearance, with Kat commenting on my hair, saying, \u201cI wish I had that hair, Marcus.\u201d Running a hand through it, Kat said, \u201cIt\u2019s so soft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cThe only way you\u2019d get it is if you were related to my mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was, much to Melanie\u2019s annoyance, practically fixated on my chest.  At one point she said, \u201cDamn Marcus, you turned out look pretty darn good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned crimson when she said that, while Melanie looked at her in disbelief.  \u201cExcuse me?  Your girlfriend is standing right next to you, Amanda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry babe, but can you blame me?\u201d gesturing to me, Amanda said, \u201cMarcus is quite attractive.\u201d<br>\r\nMelanie turned to look at me again; after a moment she said, \u201cOkay fine, I admit that Marcus is rather good looking.  But she\u2019s kind of on the short side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of my sudden sex change, I\u2019d gone from being 5\u201910\u201d to just over 5\u20196\u201d \u2013 average height for a girl my age.  I was about an inch shorter than Kat and Melanie now, while being just about 5\u201d shorter than Amanda.  While everyone could tell they loved each other, Amanda and Melanie were a study in contrasts; Melanie was unusually masculine for a girl, while Amanda was almost as feminine as Kat.  Amanda had previously told me how she wished Melanie was less masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 30 minutes had passed; Amanda and Melanie were talking to Glenn about his feelings for Melanie, while Kat and I were talking about anything to keep my mind off what happened.  Suddenly I looked at her and said, \u201cI\u2019d really like it if you stopped calling me Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone in the room turned their attention to me, Kat said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?  That\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I look like a Marcus to you?\u201d indicating my body, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not a guy anymore and, unless by some miracle they find a way to reverse this, I\u2019ll never be one again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a fair point.\u201d Looking at me, Kat said, \u201cWhat do you want us to call you then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know; it\u2019s not like I gave it much thought.\u201d Sighing as a leaned back in bed, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Mom and Dad walked into the room with Dr. Somers; judging from the tablet in her hands and the looks on all their faces, the tests results had come in.  Turning to Kat and the others, Mom said, \u201cKatherine, sweetie, would the three of you mind giving us some privacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat hated being called her full name; my mom and her parents were the only ones who could get away with it.  \u201cWe should probably be going anyway.\u201d Hugging me, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you later, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone said their goodbyes and left the room, Dr. Somers turned to look at me and Glenn.  \u201cYour results are in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at me briefly, Glenn turned to Dr. Somers and said, \"Would you mind skipping to the part where you tell me if I'm going to change as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Glenn.\" sighing, Dr. Somers looked at her information and said, \"You're ______.\"</span></div></div>",

He let out a sigh of relief knowing that he was going to remain unchanged.  \u201cYou have no idea how it feels to hear that, Doc.\u201d Glancing at me, Glenn said, \u201cBut Marcus and I were both given the same shots; why did she changed and not me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone is different, Glenn.\u201d Holding the tablet in her arms, Dr. Somers said, \u201cThe two of you may be related on a genetic level, but your sister is an entirely different person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving Glenn a congratulatory pat on the back, Dad turned to Dr. Somers.  \u201cWhen will they be able to go home, doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like for them to spend the night here, just in case something happens.\u201d Making a notation in her chart, Dr. Somers said, \u201cBarring any complications, Marcus and Glenn will be free to leave tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now I was starting to get tired of people calling me Marcus.  I knew it was my name, but under the circumstances I didn\u2019t look or feel like one.  As Dr. Somers turned to leave with Dad and Mom, I said, \u201cBefore everyone goes, there\u2019s one request I\u2019d like to make.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned their attention towards me; with Mom going so far as to say, \u201cWhat is it, Marcus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, I\u2019m not exactly Marcus material anymore.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI-I\u2019d like a new name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly something we can work on.\u201d Exchanging a look with Dad, Mom said, \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been thinking about this for the last 30 minutes or so, and I think I came up with a good name.  \u201cI was thinking about Cassidy; after Grandma Blake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom\u2019s mother had died a few months before I was born; Mom once told me that she would\u2019ve named me Cassidy had I been born a girl \u2013 in remembrance of her mother.  I watched as tears formed in her eyes.  Coming over to hug me, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful choice, sweetie.\u201d Ruffling my hair, Mom said, \u201cCassidy Scott has a nice ring to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make a note in her chart about that.\u201d Looking at Dad and Mom, Dr. Somers said, \u201cBe sure to see a judge about legally changing her name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to that.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cHaving to explain why we\u2019re asking for a name change for our daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine, David.\u201d Giving me a kiss on the forehead, Mom turned to Dad and said, \u201cBesides, we should be glad that we still have our youngest child with us \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s a girl now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed since we got the news about Glenn\u2019s fate; we were eating dinner and watching TV.

So after saying their goodbyes, Glenn and I were left to look after ourselves for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse came by shortly after 6:00 to bring us our dinners.  As if to hammer home the fact that I was now a heterosexual teenage girl, I found myself enamored with the nurse as he placed my tray on the table next to me.  I had to work on being less obvious, because he realized I was looking at him and smiled as he left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door was closed, Glenn turned to look at me and said, \u201cI know this is all new to you and everything, but you\u2019ve got to get a handle on your emotions.\u201d Grabbing his food, Glenn said, \u201cUnless you\u2019re fine with the idea of staring at every guy you think is cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, like you wouldn\u2019t do the same if you were in my position.\u201d Reaching for my tray, I looked at him and said, \u201cMy bodies been overrun by a flood of new hormones, it\u2019s going to take me a while before I get things under control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking a fork into his chicken breast, Glenn said, \u201cYou better hope so; because boys will be all over you, for all the wrong reasons, if you act like that at school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out having your gender changed in a matter of minutes has quite an effect on one\u2019s appetite; I barely touched any of my dinner.

Assuming the worst, I said to myself, \u201cGreat, I peed myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to myself about how embarrassing it was to wet the bed at my age, I climbed out of bed and walked into the bathroom.  When I turned on the light and looked in the mirror, I realized that my assumption was wrong.  Rather then seeing a urine-soaked hospital gown, I saw a fairly large blood stain.

Looking at Glenn, seeing that he was starting to freak out, I said, \u201cCalm down Glenn, it\u2019s alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn was fixated on my blood-stained gown, which meant he was no longer fixated on my chest as he\u2019d been for the last few hours.  \u201cHow can <i>that</i> possibly be alright, Cass?  Did they hurt you, or something, during that exam?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, you really know nothing about girls.\u201d With an exasperated sigh, I said, \u201cI\u2019m having my period, dummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color slowly returned to Glenn\u2019s face as he looked at me.  \u201cA-Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure, Dr. Somers said I\u2019d probably have it within a day or two.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cMom and I didn\u2019t tell you because we thought it would freak you out; and, well, frankly I didn\u2019t think my menstrual cycle was any of your business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything you need me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel the blood starting to drip down my leg at that point. \u201cYeah, go find a <i>female</i> nurse and tell them what\u2019s going on.\u201d Sitting on the toilet, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be here waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn left and came back a few minutes later with a heavily pregnant nurse in tow.

But if that\u2019s all the nurse had; I wasn\u2019t going to complain.  As she handed one of them to me, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem very shocked about my case, Nurse...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me Rachel.\u201d Kneeling down, she said, \u201cYour situation is rather unusual, but I see my fair share of unusual all the time.  I\u2019m just used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter turning away long enough to gently insert the tampon, I turned back and said, \u201cCome on, a teenage boy turns into a fully functional teenage girl and you don\u2019t bat an eye?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, believe me, we all thought it was a joke when the previous shift told us about you.\u201d Handing me some toilet paper to wipe my legs, Rachel said, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around it; but I\u2019m not going to let that get in the way of my job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoin the club, I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around it too.\u201d Getting to my feet, I said, \u201cI\u2019m just glad I\u2019ve got a great support system; my family and my two best friends, who just happen to be girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the long wrong that\u2019s all that really counts.\u201d Opening the door, Rachel said, \u201cI\u2019m working this section of the floor, if you need anything just holler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I went to climb back into bed, I said, \u201cThanks Rachel, I appreciate that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rachel left the room, Glenn turned to me and said, \u201cAfter seeing that, I\u2019m really glad I\u2019m not going to change.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You're sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Somers nodded. \"The process that changed your former brother is at work in you. It's taking longer in your case, but you will become a girl, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May we have some time to talk, Doctor?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she said, then turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute,\" Glenn said. \"How... How long have I got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Somers consulted Glenn's chart. \"If you're still a boy when football practice starts, you won't be by the first game.\" With that, she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, Dad put his arm around Glenn. \"It'll be alright, Glenn,\" he said. \"Boy or girl, you're our child, and we love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so much,\" Glenn replied. \"It was weird enough to watch it the first time. Now, I know I'll have to go through it myself.\" He turned to me. \"It looked like it hurt you something awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't fun, that's for sure,\" I said. \"But you'll be okay. Look at me: I'm already used to my new voice, and I'm getting used to when I go to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Mom said. \"You'll be okay, just like your sister, Marcus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mom,\" I said, \"about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me Marcus.

Mom and Dad tried to get Glenn to decide on a name, but he didn\u2019t see the point just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mom and Dad left to give us some privacy, although neither of us was in a talkative mood.  We quickly settled on watching TV to pass the time, while the sedatives Dr. Somers had given Glenn started working.  After learning how painful my transformation was, she didn\u2019t want Glenn to experience that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was absentmindedly flipping through channels trying to find something to watch, when I heard Glenn say, \u201cWait, go back to that last channel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced at Glenn for a moment as I flipped back to an episode of <i>Supernatural</i>; the sedatives looked to be making him very drowsy.  Looking at the TV and then back to him, I said, \u201cWhy would you want to watch this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring an earlier attempt to curry Melanie\u2019s favor, Glenn had tried watching a few episodes of Supernatural solely because it was her favorite show.  But he gave up after a while because he couldn\u2019t get into it.  So, you can imagine my surprise when he took an interest in the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to me, with a peculiar smile on his face, Glenn said, \u201cPlease; are you seriously telling me you don\u2019t think Sam Winchester is cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked by Glenn\u2019s remark; I was going to call him on it when I saw something even more shocking.  With each breath he took, I swear Glenn\u2019s chest was getting bigger.  It didn\u2019t take long to realize what was happening \u2013 he was starting to develop breasts.  \u201cGlenn, you might want to look down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking confused, Glenn turned his attention to his chest; his confusion quickly replaced by shock.  \u201cOh God, it\u2019s happening.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Now, I was watching it happen. \"Are you okay?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't know,\" he replied, his voice higher than either of us were used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at his hands. They were becoming more slender, the nails lengthening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, his hair was growing longer, too, framing his softening face. His hair was darker than mine, with gentle curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in any pain?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he replied, his voice undoubtedly feminine. \"It doesn't hurt. It just feels weird. Oh, God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what he meant. He was feeling his genitals change from male to female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Glenn's breathing slowed, and I knew the change was complete. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wasn't awake for it,\" she said, \"I wouldn't know what happened. I'm sorry I made fun of you before, Cassidy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna take a look at the new you? I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it be weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have something I don't have, I promise to avert my eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and I helped her get up and walk to the bathroom. \"I like my hair,\" she said. \"It looks nice. Can you help me untie this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did, and my new big sister stood there in what would be called her birthday suit, if she had been born like this. \"Whoa,\" she said, turning this way and that. \"How come I'm smaller than you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked. \"You're at least an inch taller than me.\" Then, I caught on: my breasts were a full cup size bigger. \"I don't know. I take after Mom. Maybe you take after the women on Dad's side of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I spoke, Glenn explored her body, just like I did mine. And, just like me, she gave a squeal of delight as she let her fingers do the walking. \"I'd better stop that,\" she said, \"before I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tied her gown back on, and she walked back to bed. As she climbed in, I asked, \"Should we let the folks in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"If I was as loud as you were, they know something's up. May as well introduce them to Kaylee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, recognizing both of our grandmothers' names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kaylee tucked herself in, I went to the door. Seeing me, Mom asked, \"It happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Kaylee wants to say hi.\"</span></div></div>",
