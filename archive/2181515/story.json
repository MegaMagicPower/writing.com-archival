He took in the classroom and was still surprised that none of his classmates had shown up yet. As soon as he thought this, he noticed the door slide open, and Midnight walked into the room. His gigantic teacher walked over to her desk at the front of the room and set her purse down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow early did I get to class?\u201d Izuku asks himself before he begins sprinting to the giantess. After almost half an hour of running, he made it to Midnight\u2019s desk and formulated a plan to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Izuku begins climbing up her foot, but as he reaches her ankle Midnight\u2019s quirk starts affecting him. Before he can get off her foot, Midnight removes her shoe to allow her feet to breathe. Unfortunately, this causes Izuku to fall inside her open heel, with her foot being the last thing he sees as she puts her shoes back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Activating full-cowling, Izuku begins to climb up Midnight, only for her hand to smack him off her body. He lands on the chair behind her, right as she\u2019s about to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Rather than risk climbing the giantess before him, Izuku decides to wait in her purse until she reaches in to get something. Unfortunately, Midnight seals her bag and leaves him trapped inside for hours. When he\u2019s finally free himself, he notices his teacher met up with other female pro-heroes, and they\u2019ve been drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Izuku can make it on top of the desk and Midnight notices him right as his classmates begin to enter the room. Choosing to hide him, she pulls open her uniform and drops him between her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Midnight notices Izuku on the floor and picks him up. After studying him a bit and talking to him, she decides to show him to his classmates and let them hold him. They may need to watch over him, depending on how long this lasts.</span></div></div>",

Two of them were walking towards his desk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n As Midoriya finished his session, he was covered by a shadow; an enormous butt was descending upon him. Before he could dodge it, it'd already come on him. Midoriya could only wait for class to start, hoping whoever was sitting on him would go to their own seat at that point. After a few minutes, whoever was sitting on him had stood up; and to his horror, Midoriya was stuck between the cheeks of his unknown, unaware captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As said captor walked off, Midoriya heard someone call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"See you after homeroom...\"</span></div></div>",

He was between the buttcheeks of the invisible girl, and he had no way of getting her attention. While he was thankful to be held against her panties rather than being trapped directly in her butt crack, he was still worried about dropping to the floor below. Though, he wished he did try to escape after she arrived back at her seat and began to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Izuku said as he tried to free himself from his tight situation. His struggles were in vain, however, and he found himself trapped beneath her once again. \u2018At least I\u2019m durable at this size.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagakure calmly sat down, completely unaware of the tiny boy she had trapped beneath her. It wasn\u2019t until Aizawa walked in and began to call roll that she noticed Midoriya was missing. Everyone else was in class, and she saw him leave the dorm this morning. \u2018I wonder if he\u2019s okay.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she noticed the other students were also a bit worried about Izuku, but Aizawa didn\u2019t seem to notice as he began lessons. Midoriya also went unnoticed by his giant captor as he continued to struggle. The only response he got was a quick flex of her cheeks that removed any progress he made to escape. How is Izuku going to escape from this one? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Hagakure notices Izuku and frees him when no one is looking. Deciding that he didn\u2019t mean to get sat on, she decided to stash him somewhere to keep him safe before showing him to Jirou and Mina later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Aizawa decides to put the kids through a training exercise and sends them off to get changed. Hagakure arrives their first and begins to remove her clothing, during which Izuku falls free. Before he can celebrate, he realizes he\u2019s stuck in the girl\u2019s locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Izuku remains trapped until the class heads to the cafeteria for lunch. He\u2019s able to grab Hagakure\u2019s skirt and pulls himself free. While\u2019s he\u2019s climbing her, she bumps into someone and sends Izuku flying off among the students that are eating. Go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Izuku successfully escapes from the butt only to get knocked off of the chair and land under Bakugo\u2019s desk. When he finally comes to, he realizes that he needs to get the help of his childhood bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Izuku frees himself and falls to the floor, thankfully landing unscathed. He begins to wander around the room during lessons when someone along the way grabs him.</span></div></div>",

Last night things at the UA dorms got pretty hectic when the whole of Class 1-A decided to celebrate their success in gaining their hero licenses. Well except Bakugo and Todoroki, they had to try again next time. But they still joined the party all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a nonstop carnival of movies, chips, cake, and soda. It was honestly the most fun Midoriya had ever had since he and his class went to the mall. But now the party was over and Izuku was wracking his brain trying to figure out his current predicament. He obviously never made it to his room as he was in the middle of the UA dorms' living room. But why oh why was everything so huge?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coffee table stood above him like a skyscraper, the sofa was akin I-island in size, and the flat-screen T.V that sat on the wall was now comparable to the flat-screen in Times Square. Somehow he had shrunk. It was the compete reversal of Mt. Lady's quirk! Izuku was as fascinated as he was terrified. If he had to make a rough estimate of his size he'd have to be at least half a centimeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had this happened. It couldn't have been someone else's quirk could it? There was no one with a shrinking quirk in his entire class. Could it have been another class? Maybe? Or could it have been something else entirely. Was this somehow related to One-For-All? It had never done anything aside from break his bones before. Shaking his head, Izuku decided to put the 'how' on the shelf for now and focus on finding help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could get someone's attention without getting smashed on accident then he could most likely get back to normal. That is if what happened to him hadn't happened to anyone else. He prayed not. His worries proved to be unfounded though as what felt like an earthquake knocked him off his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that? There multiple in rapid succession, almost like a pattern. Wait a minute, could it be? Yes it was! Footsteps. Izuku regained his balance and turned to the source of the quakes. As the figure turned the corner Izuku's jaw dropped. He couldn't believe how small he was in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was none other than...</span></div></div>",

The trick was finding ways to keep himself busy or amused when there was no real work to do. But here in Tartarus, in this small cell, all there was was nothing. Just him, a bullet proof plexiglass window, and a gun set to turn him into swiss cheese if he tried anything funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small price to pay though in order to allow his own successor to flourish, but at the end of the day he was still human like anyone else. He craved a little excitement. The only problem was he wouldn't find any within these four walls. The only thing he had here was time. Time that was ever so slowly slipping away from him. Damn that cursed symbol of peace. Oh well, at least he could take solace in knowing All-Might's time in the limelight was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that still didn't solve his current dilemma. He was still bored out of his skull. He needed to generate a little excitement lest he go mad. He couldn't bust out as that would ruin things for the League, and he could kill time by fiddling around with his stolen quirks so blatantly, otherwise he'd be shot full of holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to think, it must be nighttime by now, the guard's shift changes happened just a few minutes ago. Everyone of significance to him in the outside world was probably fast asleep by now. Tomura, Kurogiri, All-Might, his precious students at UA, all of them. He did wonder what they were all dreaming though, the would be heroes especially. What did the next generation dream of? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd be lying to himself if he didn't admit he was quite curious. Perhaps a dream walk was in order? It was a relatively simple quirk, useless really. All it did was allow him to project himself into other's dreams. He didn't even remember why he took it. Probably to torture some poor soul no doubt. The only positive about it right now though was that it might be the only quirk he could use without getting shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain known as All-For-One lowered his head and nodded off. Before he knew it his astral form left his body, completely invisible to the gun overhead, and floated off into the night. His Target would be UA, after all, he couldn't help but find the idea of terrorizing the hero faithful amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to reach the UA dorms either as his ghostly form simply fazed through everything. Like this he was complete invisible and couldn't be heard unless he entered a dream. He slowly floated through the halls, peeking his head through each door. One was room decorated with music posters and instruments. Another a lavish room with a queen sized bed that took up majority of the space. Clearly the students had made this place their home away from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeked into a few more rooms until he came across one that really got his attention. A room that was decorated from head to toe in pink. Add to that, the room's lone occupant was also pink. Had it not been for the clashing color of her clothes he might've missed her entirely. \"Well what do we have here.\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll-For-One drifted closer to the sleeping student who had apparently kicked the covers off her bed in her sleep. She was also snoring really loudly too, indicating she was in deep sleep. Perfect. He might finally be able to have a little fun now. He placed his hand against the girl's head... and slowly disappeared into her dreams...</span></div></div>",

His Quirk fired up to its maximum, he scaled the wall that separated the male section of the baths from his treasured prize, despite the protests from his uninitiated classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mineta, stop this at once! This kind of behaviour is unbecoming of a UA Student! Mineta!\", screamed the frustrated class president, Iida Tenya, hoping to stop the purple-haired menace from sullying the honor of their class. Other boys soon joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had no effect at all. Mineta's hands were furiously moving up and down, and as he was closing the distance between himself and the wall's pinnacle, the blood flowing out of his nose was increasing in volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Just a bit more, and i will enter the forbidden gardens! All the hard work will finally be worth it!</i>\" Mineta practically drooled, both on the inside and outside. His eyes about to pop out of their sockets and the screams of his disgusted classmates crashing harmlessly behind him, Mineta braced against the wooden wall and made a final leap upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There's nothing that can stop me now! I will treasure this moment untill the day i DIE!</i>\". With his mental proclamation finished, the ultra-pervert crested the wall's top....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........only to be blinded by the brightest light he had ever seen. And then, there was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">As for the girl's perspective of what just happened....</span> </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did he go? I swear it sounded like he was about to jump over?!\" Kyoka voiced her concern, her Earphone Jacks prepared in a defensive position, while her hands covered her exposed, albeit small, chest. The rest of the girls were in similar stances, ready to fight off their fiendish classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuyu responded, her head barely peeking over the water-level: \"Yes, his voice was very close, kero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seemed to be the case, as far as i could tell. It's certainly strange that he did not try capitalize on such a degenerate act. He is Mineta, after all.\" Yaoyorozu joined in. The vice president did not try the hide the contempt in her words, while simultaneously shielding her considerable assets from the would-be invader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So why didn't he?</i>\", wondered Momo, not prepared to lower herself back into the warm water just yet. Something did not add up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka was next in line to voice her opinion, easing from her Gunhead Martial Arts stance: \"Well, the boys certainly wouldn't be okay with letting him do something like this. I know Deku-kun wouldn't....\", she trailed off, but quickly finished her sentence when she saw Mina starting to flash a grin \"...a-and the other b-boys too, of course! Right, Toru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, yep!\", came the chipper answer from the invisible girl, though her expression remained...well, invisible. \"Ojiro certainly would try and stop him, for sure.\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he ain't here, so everything's good, right?\" came Mina's cheerful input. The pink acid-user was already relaxed, submerging underneath the steaming water, letting it relax her aching muscles. \"We won't let that runt ruin our get-together, ain't that right girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded their heads in agreement, the tension already lifting from the young heroines, and one by one, they returned to their previous positions. Last one was Yaoyorozu, who threw a final, doubtful glance towards to wall's top, only to find nothing worthy of note, apart from the ever-present steam. Conceding to Mina's point, the vice-president let her toned body sink under the soothing waves, folding her arms and letting her eyes close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Back to our protagonist....</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, to Mineta, felt like the only justified reaction to what just happened. As he was about to enter the realm of true, absolute heaven, he shrunk. Yeah, it made no sense to him either. And not just shrunk, he was micro-sized. He deduced this from the fact that, despite being thousands of meters in the air, at least from his perspective, he wasn't falling. He was so incredibly light that he was basically floating like a crumb of sand, completely at the mercy of the air-currents, towards the steaming ocean below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ohshitohshitohshit, this isn't good, this ain't good at all! I must be, like, smaller than a milimeter! If i fall into the hot-spring, I'll probably drown before i even reach the shore! And there's no chance they'll see me either, no chance in hell! Oh shit, i'm dead, i am soo dead, this ain't-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before his rambling could turn him into a second Midoriya, the realization struck him like lightning. His original motivation. He came here to peep on naked girls. And now, they couldn't see him do it. Now, he could do it for as long as he liked. And to top it all off, he could even get a hands-on experience like never before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh.</i>\" Mineta realized, pieces finally falling together. \"<i>Well that ain't so bad.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw an inquisitive glance towards the body of water, thousands od meters below him, and as he peered through the thick layer of steam that was everywhere he looked, he saw titanic female figures, of all shapes and sizes, lazily relaxing in it's steaming waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This ain't bad at all.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw his classmates, huge beyond anything he could compare them to. And they were utterly oblivious and at his miniature mercy. He could do anything he wanted to them, and face no repercussions. Because they would never know. He already felt blood rushing to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH FUCK YEAH!\" screeched Mineta, already trying to speed up his fall towards the unaware beauties. Despite his best efforts, he realized his descent would still take a considerable amount of time. Time he would use to pick his first victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first gal that caught his attention was Kyoka. Unlike the other girls who were soaking themselves within the deeper centre of the hot-spring, the purple-haired girl settled for its shallow part, lying down on her back. Despite not being as well endowed as the rest of his \"friends\" , the simple fact that the entire lenght of her naked, glistening body was prepared for him on a silver platter made Mineta shiver with lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yeah,</i>\" decided Mineta, already trying to steer himself towards her naked form, as thousands of perverted ideas were forming in his mind.\"<i>She'll do just fine.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not. You get to decide.</div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jirou Kyoka exhaled, a deep, exhausted sigh escaping from her lips. She truly needed this. They all did. After everything their class has been through these past few months, the Earphone Jack-hero felt like she forgot how it felt to relax. To truly unwind, and let their problems slip away from their mind. And for the moment, that's exactly what she and girls were doing. Lazily swimming around in the hot spring, laughing, spreading the occasional gossip here and there. Just being teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's something she felt they didn't get to do as often anymore. They were heroes in traning now, and with the villain threat rising everyday, who knows what could happen tomorrow. But none of that mattered. Not now. For these couple of hours, they could let all of that go. And with the steaming water doing wonders against the stress that has pent up due to Eraserhead's training regimen, the young girl felt all her burdens slowly fade away, even if it was for just a fleeting moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched out her arms as she let out a gentle yawn, signifying how late in the day it was getting. But no one would make her give up this moment, no way. Letting her arms rest in the shallow water along her body, the young woman felt she was already getting lulled to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yeah,</i>\" admitted Jirou, deciding not to resist in the slightest as she let her eyes close. \"<i>I guess this isn't all that bad.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">However, up above....</span> </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the best thing that has ever happened me, holy craaaap!\" Mineta cried out, though his voice was snuffed out by the roaring winds around him. Well, \"roaring\" to him, anyway. Coupled with the fact that he was still floating towards his erotic destination, despite being shrunk some time ago, Mineta was now truly realizing how small he had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't bother him in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the other \"former classmates, now goddesses\" behind him, Mineta used the limited knowledge of skydiving he had acquired from watching Youtube videos to try and guide his descent. And as he was speeding through the steamy clouds created by the hot spring below, he was finally able to witness his destination in her true glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirou Kyoka was resting on her back, the waters barely reaching half-way up her body, and Mineta could see the miniature waves gentle carresing her skin. Her eyes, no doubt titanic orbs themselves, were covered by her eyelids. If she was sleeping or not was irrelevant to the miniature attacker. She would be his, whether she was awake or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face, which he considered to be rather average before, has transformed into an actual, rather serene-looking plain of skin, on which he could walk for hours on end. Her hair, now a forest of dark-purple trees, rested on her head, most of it partially submerged beneath water. Her formerly small breasts, unimpressive thighs and lanky legs were transformed into arousing monuments of skin and muscle, no doubt all worthy of Mineta's attention. Finally, he glanced over her petite feet. Mineta wasn't a feet guy, but even he had to admit that now, when they were the size of city districts, with each toe threatening to obliterate him the smallest twitch, there was something to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Perhaps i was missing out this entire time</i>\" the young deviant said, a devilish grin settling on his face. He might just make up for that tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some perverted soul-searching, the deviant decides to aim his descent towards....</div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>None of the aformentioned destinations came close to his desired prize. Not her titanic face, not her mountainous breasts, not even her now endless legs. No, the place that was making him throb was set squarely in his sights, even as he was still miles away. Below her flat stomach, between those glistening thighs, there was a titanic canyon of pinkish skin. It was her god-like vagina. Even from this high-up, he could make out the outline of her outer lips, the gaping abyss in between them, and the trimmed bush sitting neatly above it. Mineta couldn't contain himself for much longer. He had to touch her, and he had to do it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell closer. He couldn't see her entire body anymore. First, her far-away feet and head left his field of view. Closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expansive thighs and chest were next. Closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were now rising in height, becoming mountains, while her face became obstructed by the underside of her chin. Slowly, the rolling fields of naked skin stretched everwhere he looked. Even if, by some sudden miracle, he no longer wanted to intrude on her privacy, that wasn't possible anymore. Everywhere he looked, he was surrounded by the body of the girl. Jirou Kyoka, his new world, was all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the distance between him and his target kept shrinking, now at a very rapid pace, his perspective was starting to change. First, the sounds. He could no longer make out the idle chit-chat of the other girls, or the splashing sounds of the surrounding waters. Despite being closer to her lower side, the sound of her blood rushing through her veins now dominated his senses. The rhytmic <i>tu-tu, tu-tu, tu-tu</i> of her heartbeat surrounded him, and despite being deafening, it had a certain serenity to it. Falling asleep to the sound of a girl's heartbeat, who's said heart could probably provide housing for a small town, did not sound that bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the smell. He could smell <i>her.</i> All of her. The faintest stench of the sweat-droplets, which he could see were sprinkled along the fields of her skin. The aroma of her deodorant, which he could still faintly make out, despite the water's dampening effect. But the most promiment was <i>her</i> smell. The smell eminating from between the her legs. The heavy, feminime odor of her sex. It kept hitting him in waves, the closer and closer he got. He was pretty sure the shrinking must have amplified his senses, because if girls around him had this kind of aura constantly, he wouldn't be able to function. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jirou's aura was having it's effect. The heavy, pheromone-filled air was making him loose all the remaining self-control he had. If all of this was making him go nuts, he couldn't imagine the sensation when he was finally <i>on her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he wouldn't have to imagine for long. His descent was reaching it's zenith, the girls gigantic crotch was sprawling in front of him, filling his entire field of view like an orgasmic gateway. Though, truth be told, Mineta wasn't really there anymore. Mineta Minoru, for a lack of a better word, was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a span of 30 minutes, he went from trying to sneak a short peek at his female classmates nude bodies, to skydiving towards a Grand Canyon-sized cunt, belonging to one of the said classmates. Such a rapid change of scenery utterly engulfed the young deviant's mind, overwhelming him with the sounds, smells, and all the other sensations that came from flying towards gigantic, female genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few moments, Mineta, through the erotic mist, finally spotted his landing zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, i-is that her....OH! OH SHIIIIIIIIIIII-\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"OH SHIIIIIIIII-OW!\" Mineta's suprised scream was cut short as he collided with the top of a massive, purple tree. Smashing into it with his right shoulder, he felt an explosion of pain erupt in it. He slid across its silky surface of the tree, only to resume freefalling once he reached it's other end...and immediately fell on top of another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn i-OW! Gotta' grab one of th-OW! Maybe with my Quir-OW!\" was the only thing coming out Mineta's mouth, as he ungracefully descended through this strange landscape, as he hit every purple tree along the way. With a final \"OW!\", Mineta landed with a loud THUMP, hard on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww..... damn, i hope i didn't break anything.\" he lamented, stretching his legs and arms, searching for any fractures and other life-threatening injuries. He did the same for his chest and neck, and despite feeling like he was just hit by a bus, he let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up on his still shaky feet, he brushed himself off and took a look around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...holy cow....this is quite something.\" he silently commented, faling to find more suitable words. All around him, there were gigantic purple trees, stretching as far as the eye could see. Incredible in both height and thickness, they dominated the landscape around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground itself was of a cream-like colour, with dents and ridges, both small and large. Mineta knelt down, and ran his hand along the surface, shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...so warm. It's like the floor of a sauna. This must be her skin, for sure.\" A wide grin spread across his face, an idea already formed in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well mark her as mine.\" Proclaimed Mineta mentally, dropping down to his knees.....and smothering his face in the creamy, fleshy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt...like skin. Well, not exatly skin, but heavily enlarged skin. Clearly thicker and harder. Yet all of the smells from earlier stayed, some becoming even more amplified. The sounds were a little quiter though, the surrounding forest clearly having some sort of a dampening effect on the splashing of water and the chit-chat of the other, far-away titans. The heartbeat remained, the \"tu-tu, tu-tu\" still present all around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just about how it \"felt\", but what it represented. Not even in his wildest dreams would he get so close to a naked girl. And getting so close to come to physical contact with her, smothering his face, basically between her legs? Even his most erotic dreams were realistic enough to prevent him from doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now? This was no dream. He just landed near his colossal, unaware classmate's vagina, and no one could stop him. He didn't know what shrunk him, if he would ever reclaim his height, or survive, for that matter. But if he couldn't go back, he would at least die happy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of his unaware, colossal classmate, Mineta snapped back to reality, and looked around. Directly to the south, he could see two gigantic, meaty thighs, and beyond them rose, like hills of skin and bone, two knees. And even further than that, though they were starting to become rather blurry due to the extreme distance, he spotted a pair of titanic, bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp north, beyond the endless span of her flat stomach, rose two fleshy mountains, her breasts. He was unable to see her face, but the massive underside of her chin, and the hundreds-of-meters long streaks of purple hair cascading next to it were landmarks on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat cemented his suspicion. The sprawling purple forest that surrounded him? He was in the middle of her pubic hair. Mineta snickered, realizing that this confirmed his old theory: \"So the hair on her head has the exact same color as the hair in her.....other parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis curiosity concerning the color of Jiro's pubes sated, the Grape-hero started walking in no particular direction, the fleshy ground sinking under his feet after each step. His pace slow and steady, with shivers running down his spine, Mineta took his time to truly marvel at the place he found himself in, as well as the scale of his unfortunate host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes ago, when he was still falling towards this naked continent, the small bush of pubic hair he spotted above her vagina was just that: a small bush. Now, it became a musky, humid forest of purple trees. And her breasts and thighs, both of which he could and did describe before his shrinkage as lacking? Now they were mountains and valleys of meat, skin and bone. And all of that was his to explore and exploit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\", thought the young deviant, cracking his knuckles \"where to go next...\"</span></div></div>",

And the rest of his injuries? Well, they were no less worrisome. He could feel dozens of cuts and bruises all over himself, scarring his, untill now, germ-free body. He felt like he had just been with with a battering ram. And this, truth be told, was not far from the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning the last remains of his quickly diminishing strength, Chisaki tried to get back up on his feet. The wave of nausea that hit him almost threw the winded Yakuza back to the dirt. As spots danced in front of his eyes, he closed them shut and clenched his teeth to battle the new-found vertigo. After a few seconds of regaining his composure, Chisaki stood up, battered, bleeding, but still unbroken, in the middle of the destroyed underground room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This wasn't supposed to happen, damn it!</i>\" Chisaki cursed to himself as he surveyed the destruction around him. The beaten bodies of his comrades,the ruins of concrete and the spikes he himself created during the earlier fight littered the destroyed underground hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took a shaky step forward, he stepped on something slick, and instinctively recoiled in disgust. There was a circular bloodstain on his purple shirt, and the blood was slowly seeping through the fabric and dripping to the shattered floor below. He did not know if the blood was his own or not. He no longer cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he cared about was killing that green-haired piece of shit that ruined everything. And then killing his upperclassman friend that did not know when to quit. And for good measure, he'll tear their master, the bussiness-man looking bastard to shreds too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll kill them all\", he said, voicing his thoughts out-loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll kill them all and then i'll make Eri fix everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back to the briefing he had with his group just a few hours prior. Everthing was planned perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Eight Expendables and the League cronies will hold the Hero Task Force back, while he and Chrono make their escape through the tunnels. With Eri and the product, of course.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell happened? Did the Expendables loose too quickly? That wouldn't suprise him, they were all fodder anyway. Or was it the League? Did they do this? Did they betray him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're all worthless. They're all useless sacks of garbage. This was all their fault. They will all pay for this. THEY WILL ALL-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you hurt anyone else! I'll save them no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChisaki froze, mid-motion, at the spoken threat. He recognized that voice. As if struck by lightning, Chisaki's senses sharpened and vision was no longer blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain no longer mattered. Exhaustion no longer mattered. Overhaul narrowed his eyes as he spotted a familiar, despised green-haired figure moving towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's still standing, that piece of shit.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhaul raised his unbroken arm and tightened the straps on his mask. The leather dug deep into the wounds on his scalp and cheeks, sending a sharp wave of pain that shook him out of his earlier stupor. Oh yeah. Now, he was fully awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You youngsters really don't know when to quit, huh?!\", Chisaki yelled towards his newfound nemesis, his voice echoing across the entire hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how many times i tell you to piss off, you bastards just don't get the memo, do you?! The Hero Plague is rooted too deeply in your fucking heads!\", Chisaki spat out, each word dripping with pure venom. But his piercing gaze was met with another pair of eyes. Eyes filled with determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you who causes suffering to everyone around you!\" the young hero retorted. \"But this ends here and now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last words left his mouth, Deku powered up his quirk and lept towards the Yakuza, prepared to land the finishing blow. Overhaul was suprised of how quickly that bastard was moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Doesn't he have a hole in his leg? How is he still moving like that?</i> Chisaki wondered with a rising sense of unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his earlier challenge, he was in no shape to put up a fight. And even with the kid's wounds, if they fought now, Chisaki would loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frantically scanned to room around him, all too aware of the rapidly shortening distance between him and his would-be destroyer. He needed something, anything. And he needed it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he heard it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">B-boss, please. He-help me.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound, coming from underneath the rubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes focused on a pile of concrete next to him. Underneath it, a mangled torso of his underling, Shin Nemoto, was sticking out, like some sort of a decommissioned manequin. With his time window quickly closing, Chisaki analysed Shin's wounds. It did not look promising. His mask and clothes were torn to shreds, and the skin underneath them fared no better. Both of his legs were horribly bent, and his arms were no good either. He was in pretty bad shape, even worse than Overhaul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Similar or worse. He's useless to me like this. Shit, why is everyone around so fucking weak?</i>\"Chisaki silently raged under his mask. \"<i>There's no way out of this. No way out.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from his downed comrade, preparing to face an already lost battle head on, Chisaki was suddenly stopped as a hand gripped his ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, i k-know this looks b-bad. But please, don't j-just leave me here.\" Shin pleaded, his voice quivering with fear. \"Just fix me up, and i'll hold them off! I swear! Just please, help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhaul furrowed his brow, disgusted at the cowardly display that unfolded in front of him. Fix him up? And what good would that do? He couldn't do anything against that green-haired bastard. Not even slow him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then again, i'm not gonna' fair much better myself. I'd probably need a new pair of arms to even match that kids attacks and....wait.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes landed on the wimpering mess in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He's damaged, sure.</i>\", Overhaul considered, a gruesome plan already forming in his mind. \"<i>But he still has all of his limbs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlenty of material to make a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Nemoto.\" Chisaki said, as he lowered himself to his trapped follower. \"I'll fix you alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the downed Yakuza could even scream in protest, Chisaki smashed his hand on Nemoto's face, tearing his mask away and activating his Quirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Deku jumped over the last ridge of spikes separating them, and landing on his feet only a few meters from the young Yakuza and his minion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth to speak:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over for you, Chisaki! Give up, or you'll force me to-\" Deku did not get to finish his sentence, as he was shocked by the grisly display in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhaul's hands were melding with Shin's face, his body starting to tremble and intertwine with Overhaul's as the leader of Eight Precepts of Death began his final gamble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you won, you self-righteous piece of shit?!\" the transforming Yakuza screamed, his frame already changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well think again! The burial of you and your precious friends has just begun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Overhaul fully activated his Quirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidoriya quickly tried to jump out of the way as the entire room shook violently, but a piece of debris hit the back of his head, knocking him out. And then, for both Overhaul and Deku, the world went black.</span></div></div>",

For the past couple of minutes, he was silently drifting in and out of conciousness, loosing his fight against exhaustion everytime he thought he could finally stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What the hell happened?</i>\", Overhaul cursed to himself, as he was lying on the floor, the gravel biting into his back, unable to lift a finger. He was entirely unaware of what has transpired when he tried to merge himself with Nemoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Did that bastard knock me out?</i>\". No, that couldn't have have been the case. He remebered being close to the self-proclaimed hero when he made his move, but not quite within striking distance. He did not remember being knocked out. Nor he recalled succumbing to the overbearing weariness. No, the last thing he recalled was activating his Quirk before Deku could get to him and then, blackness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. That bastard, Deku. The Hero Raid. Trying to escape with Eri. It all came flooding back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Overhaul swore under his breath, quickly sitting up. The heroes are still coming! He has to get Eri and himself out of here, and fast! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>How long was i out? If reinforcements were on their way earlier on, that means that they're probably already here!</i>\" Chisaki realized, to his dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could not beat a single kid with his former injuries, a group of heroes would render him defenceless. That's not even taking into the acount his myriad of fractures and the major blood loss and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wait a minute, this ain't right.</i>\" Chisaki realized, slowly flexing the muscles on his left hand. When he recieved no push-back, he flexed it at his elbow. Then, the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's not broken. Holy hell, it's not broken anymore! And i no longer feel any of the wounds that the Green-haired bastard inflicted.</i>\" Even if he clearly failed to merge with Shin, he no longer felt any pain at all. Not the desired result. But one Overhaul welcomed. This gave him a small chance at, if not victory, a retreat which did not end in failure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BANG!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crashing sound made Chisaki jump to his feet, a decision he regreted almost straight away. Clearly, despite his Quirk treating all of his injuries, it didn't do anything against muscle fatigue. He quickly fought of the feeling of blood rushing to his head as he regained his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Think, think damn it. I gotta' gather all the remaning Precepts and fight my way out. I cannot fail here. I WILL NOT FAIL.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his deranged determination once again in place, he quickly scanned the nearby destruction. He instantly wished he did that sooner. Something changed, and drastically so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll arround him was, spreading in every direction was... devastation. Where previously were piles of destroyed conrete, he was now dwarfed by mountains of rubble. Massive blocks of debris the size of which he could not properly even guess and metal rods rising above him like skyscrapers were all around him, as far as he could see. A thick layer of dust, the density of which unnerved Overhaul greatly, covered the surrounding surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Where the hell am i?</i>\", Chisaki wondered, as he surveyed the unknown landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Did i accidently level the street above us? Even i ain't got that kind of raw power. What the hell happened here?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a wary step back, not knowing what to make of any of this, when his back bumped into something solid. Solid and large. Overhaul instinctively recoiled in shock, turning around to face the would be threat. What he saw made him question everything he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him towered a titanic hand covered in a white glove. It dwarfed him, utterly and completely. Every wrinkle and every imperfection in the leathery surface was transformed to ridges and cracks that could envelop the young villain. Pieces of dirt, previously too small for the hero to even acknowledge were now massive rocks, and small, miniature droplets of blood had become vast pools that that stained the white surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this, i cannot i-, what the fuck, this just isn't possible!\" Chisaki loudly cursed. He had seen shrinking Quirks before in action, but none worked to this extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And mine shouldn't have done this in the first place! It never has! Why the hell it happened now?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChisaki was starting to loose control. Why could things go his way just this once? Even when he had the slightest chance of escaping with that cursed child, the fucking universe decided to screw him over. Why? Why now of all places for fuck's sake?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yakuza forcufully clenched his teeth and closed his eyes shut.\"<i>Count to four, inhale. Count to four, exhale.</i>\". He repeated the proccess four times, just like his old man taught him to. Falling to panic and despair would help no one here. He needed a plan. A way out. But first he had to know the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhaul's followed the massive glove, glancing over the larger-then-life bicep that was covered by the green jump suit, over the his city-sized torso and neck, finally stopping on his humongous head, on top of which sat a forest of green hair. Specifically, his gaze rested on the massive wound on the back of his head, from which, in Overhaul's perspective, poured vast rivers of blood, that slowly slithered across the wasteland-like floor. Just imagining getting caught up in it's scarlet current made Chisaki's germophobic skin crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snickered nonetheless. The kid that threatened to ruin everything was unconscious, lying on the ground, and possibly haemorrhaging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for sticking your nose in other people's bussiness, mister hero.\" , taunted the Yakuza. \"Enjoy bleeding to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Schadenfreunde satisfied, Overhaul's bravado quickly dissappeared as the reality of his situation hit him. He certainly wasn't out of the woods yet. He was alone, abandonded by his allies and cut off from any source of communication that could provide help. The more pressing matter was his size. Comparing himself to the titanic finger he bumped into, he made a rough estimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can't be larger then a milimeter.</i>\", he alarmingly realized. \"<i>Fucking hell, it's probably less then that!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ant would be larger than him. And if the lying, bleeding body of that hero-garbage had any near-death twitches, he could smear him like a flea without even realizing it. That made Overhaul furious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is the end for my you piece of shit?\" yelled the micro Yakuza, his eyes piercing through the collossal hero's comatosed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not die here! You won't fucking stop me, you hear?! Not you, and none of your hero-trash friends! My name is Chisaki Kai, and i'll rid the world of the Hero-Plague everyone's infested with these days! I'll cure every single on you bastards!\" Chisaki spat out, poison oozing from his every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wenting his rage, Chisaki recomposed himself and quickly fixed his ruined tie. Turning around on his heel, he started to jog as fast as his winded muscles would allow him to, intending to get as much distance between him and the green-haired thug as possible. Because if he wakes up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>......i'm finished</i>\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scrambled over the a rocky ridge (which was actually an almost invisible crack in the floor) and started scaling the pile of super-sized rubble that stood in his way, slowly trekking towards one of the walls where he wanted to make his escape. He will retrieve Eri when it suited him. It sure as hell wasn't suitable now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not when her pinkie toe is a dozen-times my size.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Chisaki set-off towards a possible salvation, at quite literaly a snail's pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not even 10 minutes after he began his journey....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<b>Nejire, is everyone okay back there?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragoon Hero, Ryukyu, was hardly satisfied with the situation she put her teammates through. For the two newcomers, this Raid was a real trial by fire, in the truest sense of the word. They were still inexperienced students, still rookies. Putting them through so much danger so early on will probably have reprocussions. Probably from the Hero Assosiation, and definitely from the media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd honestly, crashing through 3 floors of reinforced concrete was not her favourite method of travel, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seems like today would put all her learned stereotypes to the test. To say the raid went poorly would be an understatement if she ever heard one. The teams were scattered all over, some already reporting casulties, with many heroes and sidekicks MIA. To top it all off, there was nothing coming from Lemillion, who rushed so brazenly ahead to cut off the escape of that up child-abusing bastard, Overhaul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragoon hero was starting to fear for the worst. That's why she chose such a reckless form of entry. They had to catch up with them. They had to help, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But apart from that ,</i>\" the dragoness thought to herself, glancing over her scaly shoulder to check on her cargo. \"<i>I have to make sure the Interns are uninjured</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice, changed to a reptilian hiss by her Quirk, cut through the lingering noise of falling debris, made by their entry: \"<b>Have you all made it in one piece?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all good, Ryukyu!\", came the answer from her veteran intern, the Shock-Wave Heroine, Nejire-chan. It still managed to amaze her how ,even when they were in the middle of a life-or-death situation, the young woman still managed to sound so bubbly and cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wonder-duo is holding up great, wouldn'tcha' say girls? Uravity? Froppy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're okay!\", came the unified answer from her back, added with a silent \"kero, kero\" from the Frog hero. Though the unease that accompanied their response was hard to miss. And Ryukyu could not blame them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Alright, keep your eyes peeled! If you see anyone, let me know!</b>\", ordered Ryukyu, her tone starkly changing. Turning with her wings, she circled above the ruined make-shift arena, trying her hardest to spot someone, anyone they could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I hope we're not too late</i>\", the dragoness thought, a feeling of dread gripping her heart. If only they didn't waste so much time with that villain on the surface, they-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, right below us! I see someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyukyu quickly turned, her eyes settling on the area Nejire called out, and despite having to squint to spot it, she recognized a green-figure, lying on a pile of rubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Hold on, we're coming down!</b>\" Ryukyu yelled out, folding her wings and nosediving towards the downed Hero. The closer she got, the more worried she became. Even from this far away, she could clearly make out the large gash on his head, staining the cracked floor. The closer she got, the more grim her expression became. The wound was terrifying to look at. Clearly, her fears were not only her own, as she felt her interns jump from her back before she could land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deku-kun! Deku-kun! Please, say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midoriya-chan! We need an ambulance here, kero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear god, that desperation in their voices made her blood boil. They were still children. They shouldn't have been involved in something this dangerous. Transforming to her human for, kicking up dust and other , smaller and unseen objects into the air, Ryukyu knew she needed to act fast to save the young man. Switching back to her human form, she analyzed the situation in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUravity was on her knees by the young hero's head, frantically trying to stop the bleeding. Trusyu was on all fours, right next to her, assisting her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyukyu grabbed the First-Aid kit on her belt, instructing her veteran intern as she did: \"Nejire-chan, fly back to the surface and get the paramedics in here, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second's hesitation, the older teen activated her Quirk, propelling herself towards the opening in the ceiling. Within 5 seconds, she was gone without a trace. With medical help hopefully on the way, her attention focused on the young man in front of her. They had to act. She opened the First-Aid kit, and grabbed the supplies inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uravity, use these bandage to stop the bleeding! Try not to put too much pressure on the wound, we don't know the extent of the damage! Froppy, slowly turn him and move him onto his back! We need to slow down the flow of his blood. I'll check the pulse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their credit, and despite seeing their friend and classmate so badly hurt, the would-be heroines followed he instructions almost immediately. She felt a rising sense of pride at the way the two girls conducted themselves in spite of such a horrible situation, but she quickly dissmissed it. There was no time for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some manner of order restored, Ryukyu got down to her knees, preparing to administer CPR, should she fail to find pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't worry young man. We'll make sure you'll be alright.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">However, while all of this was happening....... </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pieces of trash!\" swore the Yakuza, absolutely livid at what was happening. Not even 5 minutes after it seemed like things were picking up, these 4 cows had to ruin everything. Again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how small his form was, when the Rescue team came crashing through, Overhaul was tossed to the air like a dust mite by the updraft they created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's what i've fucking become A crumb of dirt beneath their notice. When i find out who's responsible for the bullshit, i'll skin then alive!</i>\", raged the young Yakuza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his anger, he was utterly at mercy of the newly created air-currents, and being the size of a dust particle, he had no control over his trajectory. Unrecognizable, titanic objects moved in the distance as he drifted aimlessly, screaming and trashing all the way. As he tumbled through the dust-filled air, he was unaware that he was heading..</span></div></div>",

Well, as much as he could see given her considerable chest size. She appeared to be wearing her school uniform, which was odd since they were still at the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Mandalay said there would be more supplies in here for tonight's dinner. So, where would they be located?\" Momo wonders aloud before stepping into the room. Kota barely dodges out of the way of her feet when she comes to a stop at a box behind him. Kota looks up at her as she bends over, giving him a good view up her skirt in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I have to get her attention somehow.'</i> Kota thinks to himself before noticing Momo beginning to pull various food packets out of the box and set them down on the ground in front of her. <i>'Perfect!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. As Kota runs forward to get Momo's attention, he is gathered up with the food supplies and carried off to the cooking area. It looks like he'll be joining the students for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kota can get Momo's attention, and Momo brought him to his aunt and the other Wild Wild Pussy Cats. Predictably, they find him to be quite adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

So, I\u2019m adding this so that others can bring their ideas to this story. Feel free to write whatever you want as long as you follow the rules and guidelines listed out below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  Keep the My Hero Academia characters in character. What I mean by that is if someone like Mina finds a shrunken boy in her cleavage, she isn\u2019t going to crush them immediately. She may tease them a bit, but she isn\u2019t going to hurt them, unless they deserve it, intentionally. Unless it\u2019s Mineta, do whatever you want to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I\u2019m perfectly fine with giant males in this story, please don\u2019t make them the sole focus. I don\u2019t want this to become like the other shrinking stories for this anime. Saying again, I\u2019ll allow it, but please don\u2019t make that all that\u2019s added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep the farting and toilet stuff nonexistent; I don\u2019t want any of that here. Same with psychotic torture. <br>\r\nEdit: Surprised I'm only adding this now but no giant animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No child characters interactions, like Eri and Kota. They can talk to whoever is shrunken all they like, but they can\u2019t do anything to them. They can be shrunken though, that is something I've decided to allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Chapters need to be at least a paragraph long. Only adding this in so it will still be interesting to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditions are encouraged. Please use correct spelling and grammar, and I hope you enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShips are welcomed.</td>",
