Two of them were walking towards his desk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n As Midoriya finished his session, he was covered by a shadow; an enormous butt was descending upon him. Before he could dodge it, it'd already come on him. Midoriya could only wait for class to start, hoping whoever was sitting on him would go to their own seat at that point. After a few minutes, whoever was sitting on him had stood up; and to his horror, Midoriya was stuck between the cheeks of his unknown, unaware captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As said captor walked off, Midoriya heard someone call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"See you after homeroom...\"</span></div></div>",

He was between the buttcheeks of the invisible girl, and he had no way of getting her attention. While he was thankful to be held against her panties rather than being trapped directly in her butt crack, he was still worried about dropping to the floor below. Though, he wished he did try to escape after she arrived back at her seat and began to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Izuku said as he tried to free himself from his tight situation. His struggles were in vain, however, and he found himself trapped beneath her once again. \u2018At least I\u2019m durable at this size.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagakure calmly sat down, completely unaware of the tiny boy she had trapped beneath her. It wasn\u2019t until Aizawa walked in and began to call roll that she noticed Midoriya was missing. Everyone else was in class, and she saw him leave the dorm this morning. \u2018I wonder if he\u2019s okay.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she noticed the other students were also a bit worried about Izuku, but Aizawa didn\u2019t seem to notice as he began lessons. Midoriya also went unnoticed by his giant captor as he continued to struggle. The only response he got was a quick flex of her cheeks that removed any progress he made to escape. How is Izuku going to escape from this one? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Hagakure notices Izuku and frees him when no one is looking. Deciding that he didn\u2019t mean to get sat on, she decided to stash him somewhere to keep him safe before showing him to Jirou and Mina later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Aizawa decides to put the kids through a training exercise and sends them off to get changed. Hagakure arrives their first and begins to remove her clothing, during which Izuku falls free. Before he can celebrate, he realizes he\u2019s stuck in the girl\u2019s locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Izuku remains trapped until the class heads to the cafeteria for lunch. He\u2019s able to grab Hagakure\u2019s skirt and pulls himself free. While\u2019s he\u2019s climbing her, she bumps into someone and sends Izuku flying off among the students that are eating. Go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Izuku successfully escapes from the butt only to get knocked off of the chair and land under Bakugo\u2019s desk. When he finally comes to, he realizes that he needs to get the help of his childhood bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Izuku frees himself and falls to the floor, thankfully landing unscathed. He begins to wander around the room during lessons when someone along the way grabs him.</span></div></div>",

Last night things at the UA dorms got pretty hectic when the whole of Class 1-A decided to celebrate their success in gaining their hero licenses. Well except Bakugo and Todoroki, they had to try again next time. But they still joined the party all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a nonstop carnival of movies, chips, cake, and soda. It was honestly the most fun Midoriya had ever had since he and his class went to the mall. But now the party was over and Izuku was wracking his brain trying to figure out his current predicament. He obviously never made it to his room as he was in the middle of the UA dorms' living room. But why oh why was everything so huge?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coffee table stood above him like a skyscraper, the sofa was akin I-island in size, and the flat-screen T.V that sat on the wall was now comparable to the flat-screen in Times Square. Somehow he had shrunk. It was the compete reversal of Mt. Lady's quirk! Izuku was as fascinated as he was terrified. If he had to make a rough estimate of his size he'd have to be at least half a centimeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had this happened. It couldn't have been someone else's quirk could it? There was no one with a shrinking quirk in his entire class. Could it have been another class? Maybe? Or could it have been something else entirely. Was this somehow related to One-For-All? It had never done anything aside from break his bones before. Shaking his head, Izuku decided to put the 'how' on the shelf for now and focus on finding help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could get someone's attention without getting smashed on accident then he could most likely get back to normal. That is if what happened to him hadn't happened to anyone else. He prayed not. His worries proved to be unfounded though as what felt like an earthquake knocked him off his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that? There multiple in rapid succession, almost like a pattern. Wait a minute, could it be? Yes it was! Footsteps. Izuku regained his balance and turned to the source of the quakes. As the figure turned the corner Izuku's jaw dropped. He couldn't believe how small he was in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was none other than...</span></div></div>",

The trick was finding ways to keep himself busy or amused when there was no real work to do. But here in Tartarus, in this small cell, all there was was nothing. Just him, a bullet proof plexiglass window, and a gun set to turn him into swiss cheese if he tried anything funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small price to pay though in order to allow his own successor to flourish, but at the end of the day he was still human like anyone else. He craved a little excitement. The only problem was he wouldn't find any within these four walls. The only thing he had here was time. Time that was ever so slowly slipping away from him. Damn that cursed symbol of peace. Oh well, at least he could take solace in knowing All-Might's time in the limelight was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that still didn't solve his current dilemma. He was still bored out of his skull. He needed to generate a little excitement lest he go mad. He couldn't bust out as that would ruin things for the League, and he could kill time by fiddling around with his stolen quirks so blatantly, otherwise he'd be shot full of holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to think, it must be nighttime by now, the guard's shift changes happened just a few minutes ago. Everyone of significance to him in the outside world was probably fast asleep by now. Tomura, Kurogiri, All-Might, his precious students at UA, all of them. He did wonder what they were all dreaming though, the would be heroes especially. What did the next generation dream of? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd be lying to himself if he didn't admit he was quite curious. Perhaps a dream walk was in order? It was a relatively simple quirk, useless really. All it did was allow him to project himself into other's dreams. He didn't even remember why he took it. Probably to torture some poor soul no doubt. The only positive about it right now though was that it might be the only quirk he could use without getting shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain known as All-For-One lowered his head and nodded off. Before he knew it his astral form left his body, completely invisible to the gun overhead, and floated off into the night. His Target would be UA, after all, he couldn't help but find the idea of terrorizing the hero faithful amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to reach the UA dorms either as his ghostly form simply fazed through everything. Like this he was complete invisible and couldn't be heard unless he entered a dream. He slowly floated through the halls, peeking his head through each door. One was room decorated with music posters and instruments. Another a lavish room with a queen sized bed that took up majority of the space. Clearly the students had made this place their home away from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeked into a few more rooms until he came across one that really got his attention. A room that was decorated from head to toe in pink. Add to that, the room's lone occupant was also pink. Had it not been for the clashing color of her clothes he might've missed her entirely. \"Well what do we have here.\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll-For-One drifted closer to the sleeping student who had apparently kicked the covers off her bed in her sleep. She was also snoring really loudly too, indicating she was in deep sleep. Perfect. He might finally be able to have a little fun now. He placed his hand against the girl's head... and slowly disappeared into her dreams...</span></div></div>",

Kota then tried to remember what happened the previous night,  but it was all a haze.

Well, as much as he could see given her considerable chest size. She appeared to be wearing her school uniform, which was odd since they were still at the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Mandalay said there would be more supplies in here for tonight's dinner. So, where would they be located?\" Momo wonders aloud before stepping into the room. Kota barely dodges out of the way of her feet when she comes to a stop at a box behind him. Kota looks up at her as she bends over, giving him a good view up her skirt in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I have to get her attention somehow.'</i> Kota thinks to himself before noticing Momo beginning to pull various food packets out of the box and set them down on the ground in front of her. <i>'Perfect!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. As Kota runs forward to get Momo's attention, he is gathered up with the food supplies and carried off to the cooking area. It looks like he'll be joining the students for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kota can get Momo's attention, and Momo brought him to his aunt and the other Wild Wild Pussy Cats. Predictably, they find him to be quite adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Before Kota can do anything, Momo leaves the storage area. This means that he will have to go around the camp and try to get someone's attention.</span></div></div>",

So, I\u2019m adding this so that others can bring their ideas to this story. Feel free to write whatever you want as long as you follow the rules and guidelines listed out below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  Keep the My Hero Academia characters in character. What I mean by that is if someone like Mina finds a shrunken boy in her cleavage, she isn\u2019t going to crush them immediately. She may tease them a bit, but she isn\u2019t going to hurt them, unless they deserve it, intentionally. Unless it\u2019s Mineta, do whatever you want to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I\u2019m perfectly fine with giant males in this story, please don\u2019t make them the sole focus. I don\u2019t want this to become like the other shrinking stories for this anime. Saying again, I\u2019ll allow it, but please don\u2019t make that all that\u2019s added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep the farting and toilet stuff nonexistent; I don\u2019t want any of that here. Same with psychotic torture. <br>\r\nEdit: Surprised I'm only adding this now but no giant animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No child characters interactions, like Eri and Kota. They can talk to whoever is shrunken all they like, but they can\u2019t do anything to them. They can be shrunken though, that is something I've decided to allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Chapters need to be at least a paragraph long. Only adding this in so it will still be interesting to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditions are encouraged. Please use correct spelling and grammar, and I hope you enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShips are welcomed.</td>",
