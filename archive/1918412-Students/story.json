It was a luck that you, the middle class boy, to be here. The only reason why you got to this school is because back in your middle school days, the principle have some how convinced the principle of the Ootomi to take you in. As you walked into the school ground, you saw many students in good suits as male wore an black top and good pants with the school emblem on his shoulder while the ladies wore a navy blue top and a long skirt with a school emblem on her chest. You were excited for a new class and once you got into the building, you changed the shoes into indoor shoes and walked through the hallway. You noticed some students whispering each other and you overheard one of them talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, do you see him? that's the middle-class boy that were accepted here in Ootomi.\" Male student whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hell, I don't even know why a guy like him were accepted.\" Female student whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You really didn't care about what they say: you were in the prestigious school! the school that both your parents and your big sis who went to america to go to there collage. You went to the principles office and meet the principle. It was a women in good blue shirt with white shirt inside, and had a long blue skirt. Her name was Sachiko Hanamichi, 45 years old and she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, you're hear mr....Kondo Ayakami.\" Sachiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, at present!\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She giggled and told you to come with her. You slightly knew Ms.Sachiko since she was your mothers colleague during her days. You wondered maybe that was the reason you got into this school. As you two walked, the students and the teachers greeted her and she greeted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How is this school, young man?\" Sachiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, it's great! I cant wait for my freshmen year to start!\" You replied in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She giggled again and then both of you went to the main gym area. You departed with sachiko and once you got to the freshmen line, you saw sachiko go to the podeium. She coughed and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good morning, students of Ootomi. I am Sachiko Hanamichi, your principle. Students from sophmores to seniors already know me, and I do hope you seniors graduate from this school successfully while juniors learn hard to take place, and sophmores continue to smile and study while freshemn have a new experience.\" Sahicko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and the rest of the students clapped there hands. Sachiko spoke some news and before it was over, sachiko spoke up to the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then. Students from sophmores to seniors, you can go home since today is just an entrace speech. Freshmens, please stay put for moment.\" Sachiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You wondered why she said that, and after all the sophmores, juniors and seniors left, two other teachers came to sachiko and she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Freshmens, listen up. This school is not an ordinary school that you know. This is a school where you have your own shikigami as your partners, who will help you with study and so forth.\" Sachiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The students mumbled as you and them were surprised to hear that. Sachiko continued to talk that she will take students one by one to give them the specific shikigami to own. As the line were made, you were the last. You sighed but didn't care as you liked to wait. As you came to the principle, she gave you a paper with four picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then, you have a choice: an bakeneko, tanooki, inari, or an oni. Bakeneko is very friendly and always keep you away from being sad. Tanooki is laid back so when your stressed out, you can always lean on her. An inari have morals so if you need help with study, you can count on her.

Ms.Sachiko congratulated you for getting accepted here in the academy and told you the egg will hatch in the midnight. You understood and was about to leave until you felt the egg start to move. You looked at the egg and it wiggled more and then suddenly the egg started to make some crack. You turned to ms.sachiko and she noticed it as well and the egg made more crack and it burst the whole gym with the light. You and others covered the eyes as the light faded away everyone lowered the arm only to realise the egg was nothing more then the scattered shell on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh? what happened to the egg?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then suddenly felt something soft on your arm. You turned around and saw the wavy brown haired teen girl with tanuki ears, tail and had both good rack and plump stomach. You blushed as she was also naked and tried not to be too embarrassed as she smiled toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You must be the one who chose me as the shikigami. I thank you.\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-no problem.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You introduced yourself to her and she nodded, continuing to hug your arm. You were still embaressed by this and ms.sachiko came to you. She was astonished to see such thing and then thinking about trying to find out what caused this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hm....anyway, congradulation on your new shikigami Mr.Kondo. Now why don't you name your new shikigami?\" Ms.Sachiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Name huh?...how about.....shiro?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I love it master. I hope we'll be best of friend.\" Shiro replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and ms.sachiko told the employee to give the tanuki a cloth. Once they did, you and shiro bid farewell to the principle and left the scene. You and Shiro talked while walking and once you arrived at your home you were greeted by..<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her name was Kusanagi Tomoko, your childhood friend since kindergarten. You knew her as she did always looked up on you as she was not a popular girl. Once she found out that you were accepted to Ootomi academy, she cried a lot since she was not accepted by the school. You were surprised to see her again and she smiled and came to you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hi Kondo kun.\" Tomoko greeted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hey Kusanagi san.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You can call me tomoko, you know?\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you and your shikigami passes her, tomoko looked at shiro. Tomoko didn't know who she was as shiro lightly bowed to her, she asked you that she could help. You gave her your bag and told her to take it to your room as you gave direction, she saluted and went upstairs to drop off the book bag. Tomoko looked at shiro walking up the stairs, her tail looked comfy to her and then turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Kondo kun? who's she? is she your new friend or something?\" Tomoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's my tanuki shikigami.\" You responded as you got to the kitchen and getting the bottle of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sh-shikigami!!??\" Tomoko said with surprised tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You explained to her about what's behind the campus and what they do as you took out the pamphlet of the Ootomi academy, you gave it to your childhood friend.  She looked through the pamphlet and you gave her the light book on the rules and conducts of the academy and its shikigami. After she looked through, she closed the book and gave it back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You are so lucky, kondo kun. I truly wished I could come along with you.\" Tomoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hey, who knows? Maybe you can ask the principle to be transferred.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you kidding? the rate of the transfer from normal high school to such extravagant academy as Ootomi is less then 5%!\" Tomoko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That was surprising to you even though you know that the Ootomi Academy was an elite high school for rich and powerful. You wondered if you were truly lucky to be even enrolled by the school itself! She sighed and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Even more, the school session is so different as your session starts in fall instead of spring, so you have few weeks to yourself while others work hard.\" Tomoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, at least I have to study more harder then you guys.\" You said, \"Besides, I'm not going to look down on you or others just because I got into the good high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tomoko looked at you slowly and hugged you. She was always emotional as even the lightest love story would make her cry. You petted her head as tomoki got off from you, you noticed a written paper on the table. You picked it up and noticed that it was written by your parents. They written that they are going to Tokyo to do some business. You sighed as you put the paper down, you stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's that?\" Tomoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My parents will be out for while.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hearing that, tomoko immediately told you that she'll take care of the house as she would be an house keeper until your parents come back. You told her she don't have to but she insisted. You sighed and let her do what she wanted, and once she told you she'll start making something for light lunch, you went to your room to see what shiro was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once you got in you saw shiro...</span></div></div>",

She continued to beat her belly drum and noticed you and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Hi master, you...you heard that?\" Shiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She blushed little and her fat belly turned back into her usual plump size and covered it with her tail. She was embarrassed that you've seen her do the belly drum and her face was blushing. You were little blushed as well and you came to her and sat next to her. You pet her shoulder and once she looked at you and you smiled to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry shiro, I won't say anything bad about what you were doing.\" You said, \"Besides, I like the sound of the taiko drums and yours were like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But...I've done this out of my feral instinct.\" Shiro said, \"It's too embaresing for me, being a female doing this kind of thing to you, a male.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You scruffled her head as you told her if you heard her doing this kind again you would just leave her alone.

You smiled as she noticed as well and chuckled. You and shiro came to the table and sat down on the chair, thanked for the food and started to eat the soba noodles. Tomoko was happy to see you admitted to the good high school and were little jealous that you now have an shikigami as your partner. She then had the idea that you would do something naughty in the night and got little paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Will he do it in the night? what if he did??' tomoko thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"something wrong?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tomoko got to her sense and fluttered little. Shiro looked at her fluttering face and lightly smiled as she might understand what she was thinking or why she was thinking that way then turned to your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Master, will you permit me to go out for the tour of sapporo with master tomoko?\" Shiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh?\" tomoko spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure, why not? I have to prepare for tomorrow.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had thought that shiro might have a good tour to understand the area more while you prepare for the school for tomorrow. After the lunch, you told tomoko you would clean the bowl and she nodded, getting ready and both tomoko and shiro bid farewell to you and left as you bid them farewell and went to the kitchen to start washing some bowls. Outside, Tomoko was giving shiro a good tour around the city of sapporo from good eatery and scenery. Shiro liked this tour as they were in Oodori park, they were sitting on the bench sipping on canned coffee tomoko bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So what do you think about the city, shiro san?\" tomoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It is very nice to live. Thank you for the tour, master tomoko.\" Shiro replied with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You..don't have to call me master, you know?\" tomoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As long as master is my master, I shall respect his friends.\" Shiro replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tomoko just laughed lightly and took some sip of coffee. It was little chilly as it was the beginning of the fall and tomoko was already at the school since her school starts in spring. It was sunday and the school was off so tomoko had time to see you. Just as tomoko and shiro was about to go back to your house, they saw four people standing. It was two male students from the Ootomi Academy with their shikigami, one was bakeneko and other was wolf shikigami and they were blocking the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Excuse me, please let me by!\" Tomoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, not only that poor boy got into the Ootomi, but this poor bitch is in it too? how lame.\" Boy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, so lame!\" Wolf shikigami spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was little confused as they were mistaken her as being  part of the Ootomi student since shiro was next to her. Shiro just huffed as she was silent, tomoko came in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"For your information, I'm not a student at Ootomi.\" Tomoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then why the fuck you have the shikigami? only the Ootomi Academy distributes them.\" Other  boy said, \"Anyway, maybe we could use you for little fun time before the school starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They came toward her and grabbed her arm. She gotten mad and slapped him and threw him to the side. The male student got mad and leap forward tomoko but she quickly took a jab on his stomach. He coughed as he backed off little, shiro was surprised to see her fighting. Tomoko breathed out and made knuckles as she took a stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"don't think I can't fight. My parents is Japans Self Defense Force and my grandpa was part of the imperial army!\" Tomoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is that true?\" shiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and nodded, and they were about to leave until the bakeneko caught tomoko by back. Shiro tried to get her off but the wolf got her back as well, making it little hard. The two students got up slowly and came toward tomoko as she struggled, the shikigamis power were very strong and couldn't get out of it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"you bitch, you asked for it!\" Male student spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then slapped her face. She endured the pain as he slapped twice more, shiro gotten little angry and chanted few words and the smoke screen were made, surrouding the area. The two boys and tomoko coughed as the smoke was thick, the boys heard their own shikigami scream in pain and once the smoke was gone they saw their own shikigami beaten to the pulp and tomoko gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Where is that bitch!?\" student spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looking for us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The shadow overloomed the boys and they turned and looked up, seeing the huge shiro standing before them. The two boys were in deep fear as shiro revealed her feral side, her skin covered with animal skin and her brown, relaxed eyes turned bloody red with rage.  Tomoko was very surprised to see the shikigami in this state and she was looking down at the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Leave this girl be, or I will not hesitate to eat you!\" Shiro spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They gotten more scared and got their shikigami and ran off. The tanuki sighed and put the teenage girl down and the smoke made again, and once it was gone tomoko saw her to her normal size, but her belly were no longer plump but had some abs on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shiro san...your belly..\" Tomoko spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"For me to use that kind of power, I need alot of youkai power. I keep my belly plump to store my youkai power within me.\" shiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And how do you keep your youkai power stored?\" Shiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Food and drink is one, and clean air is second.\" Shiro replied, \"I might need to eat soon so I could reenergize my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and told her that she could eat more later.

She told you what caused this and tomoko told you from now until your parents come back from business, she'll handle housework and cooking when she finishes both school and cram school. You told her she didn't have to but she was determinted to do it. You nodded and all of you relaxed until the sun started to go down. Tomoko bid farewell and went home as you turned and made an quick dinner and once you and shiro ate the dinner you two done taking bath, brushing teeth and changing to pajamas and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Next morning came, and once you two got up you put your uniform on. You apologized to shiro that you didn't have the uniform for her but she chuckled and used few magic and transformed her pajamas to some sort of kimono (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/4da6/f/2014/049/7/8/mamizou_futatsuiwa_by_hellothisisdog-d770hg9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://orig01.deviantart.net/4da6/f/2014...</a>) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's neat.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, master.\" Shiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and both of you went down and got quick breakfast and got your bag and went out.

You also felt some jives around you as some students and their shikigami were staring at you as you were target for their bullying and such. After few minutes the teacher came as it was short black haired women with business outfit and a tall, fit male with yellow/brown hair, yellow eyes and had burgundy/orange/white cloth with a tiger pattern around the abdomen along with white, frilly pants under his dress and black shoes on his feet.  The female teacher put the stuff down to her teachers desk and stood before the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good morning, highschoolers. I'm your homeroom teacher Ms.Moriyama. This is my shikigami Toramaru so behave yourself.\" She spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and the rest of the students got up and bowed to the teacher and sat back down. Ms.Moriyama started to speak about the Ootomi and what to expect for the freshmens in the future of their time in the school. While you were listning to the the teacher, both shiro and toramaru noticed one of the student about to throw something toward you. Shiro stealthy threw something toward the student and it hit his face as it was a green leaf. The student coughed and panicked as his shikigami helped get it off and once it got off he got up looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You bastard!

The students, the teachers and even your friends were jealous of you going to such school as Ootomi was very prestigious to the point even puts the Tokyo University to shame.

You opened up the bento box and it was rice and lots of croquettes. You noticed that tomoko loves cooking and you sighed and thanked for the food and both of you started to eat the food.

Ryou sighed and tilted his head to right, giving signal to mana and she stood up looking at the two classmen and their shikigami. Her eyes were locked on them and her nine tails were spread, making them quiver and stopped bickering. After that, mana spoke to the two students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You have right to complain, but you do not complain too much as you are just an freshmen.\" Mana spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll talk to this young man, ok? now you all are dismissed.\" Ryou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The four bowed to him and the female students and left the scene.

You wondered what you would like to join as shiro told you she could be in any club. You thanked her for the encouragement and today was the day when the club search begins.

You were intrigued by it and as you got finished reading the introduction, you started to read the first chapter of the book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <div align=\"center\">The ootomi private academy, which once called the ootomi academy for boys and youkai, is considered to be the oldest operational school in the japanese history. Legend speaks that the academy were found and erected by the legendary warrior Yamato Takeru during his journey home, while others says that it was created by prince shoutoku, but many historians agree the theory that it was created during the nara period, run by the shinto priests and priestesses. It had long history of peace until the buddhist monks and priests took over the academy in 1459. They strongly implemented the buddhist teachings until 1760 where the taoists drove them out and controlled the school until 1919, where the shinto priests regained the school and controlled the academy since then.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"this is interesting start, master.\" Shiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It is.\" You replied, then continued to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <div align=\"center\">During the early days of Ootomi, many youkais who once hid themselves from the humans or done some evil deeds, came to the academy to have truce between the humans and themselves. Humans felt little uneasy but gave in and worked together. The buddhists have implemented some minor change such as putting a statue of buddha on the main hall and putting new academic rules including club activities. The taoists brought dicipline and strict order in the academy, and once the shinto brought back the school to them, they took down the buddhist statue and taoist reference, but kept the idea to the schoo. The youkais who allied themselves to the humans promised to give birth to a new generation of the youkais so they could further deepen the friendship and companionship to the students and teachers.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n You understood and was about to read more until...</span></div></div>",

You heard one man shouting 'after him!' and started to chase you. You were actually good with running, but noticed kyoko were getting slow. She stopped to get rest and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Go ahead, master. I'll deal with them.\" Kyoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No!

The student who grabbed nanami looked up and saw the oni looking down to him and gotten fear. Gouki picked him up with his left arm and tossed up in the air, and once coming down, he punched the students body. It flew straight and passes many blocks of street. You and others mouth were open and the other boys and shikigami ran away.

You reflected todays work and were kind of tired after the studying and a student getting beatened up by the tiger shikigami. You knew there was a strict code of conduct in most school in japan, but you never knew Ootomi take it seriously. You then wondered why ms.moriyama speaks so unmannerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh..well, I should take a bath.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you got up and went downstairs, you saw umi teaching kyoko how to make some knit mittens. Your mother was fragile women as she had the body that could get sick easly. Dispite that, she refuses to admit her weakness and worked hard for you. You smiled and went to the bathroom and took bath. You sighed in relief that it have been 3 years since your father went out to business and havent returned since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dad..when are you coming back?\" You said to your self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you rinsed yourself and got into the tub, you heard a bathroom door open and saw your fox shikigami fully naked and smiled. You blushed red as she came to you, she knelt before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"can I take bath with you, master?\" Kyoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But..I thought mom was taking care of you with knitting.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She saw you and told me to take bath.\" Kyoko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n you sighed deeply and agreed to let her stay. She thanked you and you got out of the bath and helped her wash her body and head. As you were washing, kyokos tail wagged alot, making your body little ticklish and once you dumped water on her head, you washed her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say kyoko..do you like this house?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"of course master. I love it dearly.\" Kyoko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You smiled and once done, both you and kyoko got into the bath tub together. It was little cramped because of her tail but you didn't mind. You two stayed in for at least 10 minutes and got out of the place and dried yourselves. Once putting a pajama on and got to the living room, umi was waiting for you two with the glass of cold calpis (calpico in america)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Here's your little drink, my dear.\" Umi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks mom.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, umi-san.\" Kyoko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You two drank the calpise and once done with the teeth brushing, you two went upstairs and went to bed. Next morning came and once you two got to the homeroom, you saw kaneda looking at you with some hateful eye. You wondered if it was about ms.moriyama since you saw some stitch on his mouth area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n (if he dare to attack you, I will defend you, master.) kyoko mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (don't worry, everytthing will be ok.) you whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, ms.moriyama and toramaru came in. Toramaru got his chair and sat down as ms.moriyama put her suitcase to the side and book on the desk, she looked to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, you little fuckers.

After japan opened itself, the shinto reclaimed the school by the order of the emperor and the royal family chose one of the intelligious and rich person to be the principle, and the principle is the current descendant of that person.\" ryou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were suprised to hear that then had one thoght: on the shikigami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then what about the shikigami? isn't that impossible to aquire during the buddhist and taoist rule?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That is true.\" Sakura said, \"But there was a way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How?\" Kyoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The buddhist and the taoist had noticed the ritual the shinto priest and priestess were doing and made a decision that they should be kept in the school. Hypocritical, yes, but they kept the tradition of the human/shikigami system.\" miku replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were astonished to hear that and then ryou spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In 1946, the principle that time enforced the ranking system to see the harmony between the student and the shikigami. It worked well for while until 1949 where douglas maccarthur tried to americanize the school. The principle refused such thing, so he created a student council where it decided into three  catiogory: Educational committee, disciplinary committee and financial committee. They worked hard to defend against the american government. Fortunatly, it worked and the american government leaft us alone, and it became privatized in 1953. Since then, the students and the shikigami have worked together in harmony.\" Ryou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and sipped on the tea, then the bell rang. You knew that the homeroom were over and the first class were starting. As you got up to get excused, miku chuckled and sakura spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, if you want some advice and such, come to the disciplinary committee, ok?\" sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakura smiled and bot hyou and kyoko left to go to the first class.

Ms.Sachiko clapped her hands, telling them to stop and she rose up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The privacy of the students are valuable thing, but we do not want to see the same incident that occured 2 years ago.\" Ms.Sachiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They went silent, knowing what she ment. As the silence lingered, isamu tapped his masters shoulder and whispered something. Moment later, Ms.Haruka nodded and turned her attention to the principle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Madam principle, if I may, can I take off now?\" ms.Ayaka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ms.Sachiko wondered why, then turned to isamu who were blushing. She remembered something and smiled, then sat down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...Only thing I can say is to watch on eyes on Mr.Ayakami and his inari shikigami.\" Ms.Sachiko said, \"Meeting, ajourned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The teachers and the shiki bowed, and everyone left. Back in your house, you were laying down on the bed. It was 10:30 pm and you finished homework, but couldn't sleep. You were thinking too much about kyoko until your cellphone rang.

You looked at the class and saw many students saw you and then hurried not to look at you as the rumors were getting around about you and your fox shikigami. Ms.Moriyama told you to go sit down to your seat and once you did, your teacher then spoke to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright dipshits. Today, the school will return to the original schedual. Some of you might know what happened yesterday, but I'm going tell you now: don't provoke anyone or else your see your same fate as the other asswipes.\" Ms.Sachiko said, \"Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes Ms.Sachiko!\" Class responded quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After 10 minutes, the school rang and the scheduel became back to normal except for you since your shikigami were detained and do the 100 hours of service time for the punishment. During your classes, you were worried about kyoko who might be sad and scared being alone away from her master. During lunch, you were talking to your senior class mate nanami that Ryou came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr.Ayakami.\" Ryou spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"G-good afternoon, sempai!\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You bowed and he just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyway, Mr.Kondo. I have to talk to you, so can you excuse yourself to nanami?\" Ryou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You understood that he was serious so you parted way with nanami. As you two got out of the cafeteria, both you and ryou were walking through the hallway until you two arrived at the room for the student council. As you two walked in, you saw both miku and sakura sitting on the chairs. They noticed you and Miku spoke 'hey' to you with smile. Ryou stopped and turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Kondo Ayakami. The reason why I wanted to talk, is that you are indeed an S-rank.\" Ryou said, \"And you cannot be left unsupervised. Hence, by word by the principle, you must be part of the student council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that. You had never thought you would be part of the student council. But you remember that you were already part of the literature club and you explained to him about it. He thought for moment and then turned to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say sakura. Is it possible for him to transfer his membership from the lit club to this?\" Ryou asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure thing.\" Sakura responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were amazed as the power of the council but you were worried about Your upper classmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But, nanami sempai needs me or her club will fade!\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do not worry. I will fill in somebody to replace you at the area.\" Ryou replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you could say anything, ryou took step forward, being close to you. Your heart raced as he was truly close to you. You could tell his seriousness as his eyes pierced through your eyes as if he was looking into your soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr.Kondo, this is a serious matter. I cannot allow such student that have unlimited power loose.\" Ryou said, \"It's like blind man making nuclear bomb. Your choice is only one: be part of the council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were slightly fear this guy then miku cut the middle, separeating you two. She could tell this was tense and then she smiled at ryou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ryou, you know you could be scary sometime.\" Miku said, \"Don't give him hard time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ryou sighed and turned around as miku turned to you and smiled, walking and stopped at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look. Ryou's worried.  Me and Sakura's worried. Heck, even the principle is worried about you. So please, join the council so the same mistake would not follow.\"  Miku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her tone was calm as she was comforting you. You knew they were worried, but you were just a freshmen! you gathered your mind and after few minutes you sighed and looked at miku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright...I'll join.\" You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"*Giggle* thank you.\" Miku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, few minutes of paper work and you were now part of the council.

It was an oni...and she was naked! she looked down at you and then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you the new master?\" Oni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes, I am the one.\" You replied. \"I'm Kondo Ayakami.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and scruffed your head.

Alright, thank you!\" Oni replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After that, the instructor came back with the school uniform..XXXL size. He gave it to yamato and once she wore it, it was a perfect fit. You thanked sachiko and bid farewell to her and she did the same. While you two were walking down the sidewalk, you looked at yamato. She looked very intimidating for a shikigami, but you remember that she is one of the one who protect you from any danger (like a body guard).

This is my shikigami toramaru so behave yourself.\" She replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They all got up and made an bow to her and then sat down except the two students.

They had cafeteria in the school, but was slightly expensive since they had good brands of food in it. While you were writing the note, you got hit by a paper ball on your head. You looked around and noticed two students that you saw yesterday, the one yamato fought. One had cast on his arm since yamato broke his arm. They snickered adn you just ignored them but they continued to throw you the paper ball until yamato were going to do something against them until kusakichi came to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What'ssss your problemsss sstudentss?\" Kusakichi spoke, \"Why must sthrow the paper ball at him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I..ah-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr.wakanabe, don't do it again.\" Ms.Yamaguchi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She resumed to teach while kusakichi went back and the students went silent.

You weren't too good with the math since elementary school, but you could tell that yamato would glad to help you with the study. As you were hearing the teaching and jotting down some notes, you looked up at the chalk board and noticed toramaru were cracking his knuckles. You were afraid of him and shivered little, then toramaru noticed your stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why stare at me young child? you should listen to my master.\" Toramaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You jolted, and said 'yes sir' and continued to jot down the notes while the students snickered at you.

I at first thought she was just talking bullshit, but after this class, she was not shitting.\" Ms.Moriyama said. \"You should be fucking thankful you got here, or you would be at those stupid assed, public school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had one thing in your mind: Does she have to swear? yamato didn't say anything since it was a rule that freshmens shikigami were not allowed to talk with teachers until sophmore years. You wanted to ask the question but backed off since you didn't want to make her mad. The bell rang again and you sweated little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh no, I'll be late for next class!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry kid, just tell the next instructor I sent you, got it?\" Ms.Moriyama said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You smiled and bowed, thanking her and left the class.

You looked at your shikigami smiling, you notice she's checking her lunch box for a water bottle that Umi put in for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, don't mermaids need to stay hydrated?\" You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, without a good source of clean water I won't be able to last a single day.\" Etsuko replied. \"But at the bright side, I'll be able to be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm happy to be with you too.\" You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 10 minutes for you two to get to Ootomi. You two walked in and got to your homeroom. You slided the door open and saw many students with there shikigami. As you got in, some students looked at you for moment, then returned to there business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was two seats open: at the far left and one at the far right.

The students got to their seats and the women put the files on the table and looked at front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Greetings, you highschool pricks. I am Ms.Moriyama, your homeroom teacher and also your math teacher. And this here is my tiger shikigami toramaru.\" Lady said, \"You all better behave yourselves unless if you want early detention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The students mumbled as how she was talking.

Ms.Moriyama, I think?\" Male teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I heard from principle that she was once a leader of yakuza.\"  Female teacher replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and etsuko started to worry about that as you put the purifier on the nose and turned the water on and started to fill the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yakuza? isn't that dangerous for the school?\" male teacher asked with hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It is.

You and the class then started to learn. Today you had to learn about the history about the early days of the soviet union. As you were listning to Mr.Otoyami, you could hear someone whispering something to each other and snickered. You didn't mind, but Etsuko felt uncomfortably.

You told her what you wanted and once she understood, she snapped her finger and one of the employer went back to the curtain and came back with the egg. He came to you and once handing the egg to you, you felt some weight on it. You observed the egg as the size were little smaller then the ostrich egg but it was big, and it had black/white color with school emblem in the middle. Ms.Sachiko told you the egg will hatch in the midnight and you thanked her and was about to leave the building until the egg started to move. You looked at it and it started to hatch, making you wonder why starting to hatch now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms..sachiko? I think it starting to hatch!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What? Impossible, they hatch in the midnight.\" Ms.Sachiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The egg then made a small light and within moment later it hatched, burst with light that consumed the whole gym area. You and others covered eyes as the light were very bright, and when the light faded away, you and others lowers the arms only to realize the eggs were nothing more then the shell on the ground. You and ms.sachiko couldn't believe that the egg hatched immediately, and ms.sachiko were thinking about this phenomena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What happened to the egg?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you heard someone bumping on you and fell. You turned around and saw an headless girl lying before you!  You freaked out little as the body was still moving, somehow you felt some sort of presence behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you the one who chose me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You freaked out and turned around to see the floating head with long white hair with one huge strand in the shape of scyth sticking out and her here were black sclera with gold colored iris. Your heart was beating fast as you have seen the dullahan in real life, and you slowly breathed in and out, then turned to the floating head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am. I am Kondo Ayakami, nice to meet you.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see. Can ya help me with placing mah head to the body, will ya mate?\" girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You could sense she was using her irish accent and you agreed to help her out. She rested on your arms and you came to the head which it got up and you put her head on top of the neck and then she moved her arms to rearrange it and finished it. She thanked you and you nodded, then ms.sachiko came to you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Well, congradulation on getting a new shikigami. Why don't you name your new shikigami?\" Ms.Sachiko spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmm...Then I'll call you Anya.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dullahan got embarressed little and then looked to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, if ye like that name, then Ah don't mind.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were glad that she liked it and ms.sachiko gave some cloth to the shikigami. After she wore it, you and ms.sachiko discussed about the rules and conditions about the school and you two bid farewell and left.

You looked at anya and noticed that she was having little difficulty with the chopstick. You quickly helped her out with chopstick while umi giggled little as she was little happy that you were teaching her how to use chopstick. After few minutes anya got the hang of it and you told her she can make noise as a sign of good gesture. She nodded and start to eat the miso ramen while you ate too. After the lunch you thanked for the food and turned to anya only to see her head got off and set to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-Anya, what are you going to do!?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Drink the soup, of course.\" Anya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The body picked up the bowl and started to drain through her esophagus. You were little anxious about this while your mother just spoke 'oh my' while looking at her drinking the soup that way. After 4 minutes of drinking the soup she finished it and you were very surprised to see this and then anya put her head back to her body and adjusted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't you feel hot after doing that?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The soup is hot indeed, but I'm fine.\" Anya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After the lunch, your mother asked anya if she wanted to go do some shopping for her.  Anya asked you if it was alright and you told her it was ok. She thanked you and after your mother done the dishes she got ready and both Anya and your mother got out to do some shopping. You then walked up to get ready for the school tomorrow until you heard a bell ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They came back?\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You went to the door and opened it to reveal the postman. He greeted you and handed over small package, asking for either the stamp or the signature. Once you went and came back and stamped the receit you got the small package and the postman bid farewell. You shut the door and wondered what the package was as you went to the dining room and opened it, revealing a faux leather box with school emblem on the top and once you opened it you saw an military like insignia that had school emblem and angel wings on the side of the emblem. You then noticed a letter behind it and it wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <div align=\"center\">Dear students of Ootomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thank you for choosing the Ootomi High School. Here at the Ootomi, we dedicate our work and service to enrich the students mind and body with learning, discipline, activity and companionship. The insignia that you see before you is the insignia that defines your year. The one that has an school emblem with angel wings are freshmen, one with two wings is sophomore, one with two wings and one sword behind the emblem is juniors and one with two wings and two swords crossing behind the emblem is senior. The students must wear this insignia all the time during the school year and inside the school property as the proof that you are one of the student of Ootomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n We hope that the years in Ootomi would be benefecial and academic for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sincierely yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sachiko Hanamichi, principle of Ootomi High School<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n <br>\r\n You looked at the insignia again and it had the school emblem with just one set of angel wings, letting you know that you were freshmen. You smiled as it was the proof that you were one of the student and you got up to your room to prepare for the school. During the shopping, Umi bought some cloths for anya that included bras and underwear. Afterwards Umi bought toiletries for her and they got out of the department store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you for buying these stuff for me.\" Anya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"These is no problem Anya chan.\" Umi replied with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Anya was carrying the bag full of cloths and toiletries, They noticed a short haired male with normal cloth walking with mid-long blond haired women with kimono on. Umi was surprised to see that as they both exchanged bow and crossed, Anya looked at the two and turned back to the front.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I'm surprised to see a foreigner wearing a kimono.\" Umi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's not foreigner, an inari shikigami.\" Anya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh? then that boy..\" Umi spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was surprised to see another student of Ootomi High, then she turned back to go back home so she would tell you that she walked across the student of Ootomi. Back at home you finished ironing the school uniform for both you and your shikigami and once you put the uniform up to the wall you heard someone coming in. It was your mother and Anya and you came down to greet them both. Anya told you how fun it was for her to do some shopping and once she got up to your room, umi came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know, I'm glad you were accepted to that school.\" Umi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm glad as well.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then told you she met a person that were same person who would go to Ootomi. You were surprised to hear that and after that, afternoon turned to night and everyone had dinner, bath and done everything and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

You had some hard time sleeping as mami were hugging you like an pillow when she was asleep, and her breasts were pressing on your back, making you awake for while. You sighed and once you two got dressed you two went downstairs and you went to the kitchen to make some toasts.

I will do my best to transfer from my school to yours!\" Megumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This surprised you and mami saying `wow`, you then smiled and nodded your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope you get in too.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and bid farewell to you two and left the scene.

It took 20 minutes for you to get to the school and once you got in and changed shoes, you got to your homeroom via reading the map, you got in and saw many students talking. Some of the shikigami were standing besides their master, some talked, and some even played together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is interesting, master.* Mami spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes it is.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then took the front row and then....</span></div></div>",

You covered yourself as the light was bright, it lasted for minute and once it faded away you lowered your arms to see a very tall naked teen girl with white hair and wolf ears and tail standing above the egg shell.

After moment, the light faded away and you opened your eyes only to realize the egg was nomore then just a fragments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wh...what happened? Where's my egg?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then heard someone coughing behind you and you turned around to see a chestnut haired girl with goat horn, furry arms and goat legs. You immediately blushed as she was also naked standing before you, and the girl just giggled at you for blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ahaha! so you're the one who gave me power to be hatched!\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes, I am. I am Kondo Ayakami, your new master.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The baphomet, who has the body of young girl just snickered and came toward you and hugged you.

I like it.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She hugged you tighter, letting you feel her small chest. You told her to get off in politely way and once she got off from you both the principle and you talked with each other for moment and then bid farewell.

She gave birth to you and you were taken cared by your grandmother during your early years while she was in high school. You slightly remember her going to collage to become an accountant, but because of the costs of collage rising up she had no choice but to quit collage and she got the job as house keeping. Since then you remember her working from dawn to dusk, the only day she could have day off were Monday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you see, I can help you with finances and welfare since I can tell you're in tough situation.\" Koban said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um....who are you? how did you get into my house?\" Umi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly came to the action and got koban. You were laughing with little panicky voice and sweated little as if she was harassing her with no consciousness. Umi were little confused and looked up to you. You saw how bad the bag under her eyes were as you could tell she didn't get enough sleep last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"S-sorry mom! I mean, you know you should get some sleep since today's your day off.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Kondo....who's that child?\" Umi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You explained to her what was going on and about Koban. After brief explanation to her about the school and koban, you saw her face bright up little, letting you know that she was proud to see you were being officially accepted to the prestigious school. Her tears poured down little and sobbed as you gotten little worried and came to her to comfort her by hugging her lightly and petting her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm so glad...that you have been accepted to the school....I'm so proud of you Kondo.\" Umi said with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's all thanks to you mom.

Once she left you scolded koban little about what she done as she told you she was just giving her an deal for her so she could have some breathing room for the financial area and such. You thanked her but you told her that it's not a good time right now as your mother have enough stress already and she needs no more stress in the future.

You called koban and once she got in she noticed the food and sat down to the table.

She was always tired after work, and you remember your grandmother making dinner for her every night before and you asked her if you could learn it and she agreed to let you learn some. Since then you had some interest in going to cooking collage when you graduate Ootomi and you were aiming that idea by keep practicing the cooking. During the lunch you wondered about the clothing for her and made an idea that she would need some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey koban, after lunch maybe we could go shopping to get you some cloths.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's fine, but do you have some financial backings?\" Koban replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My grandma  gave me some allowances and some year round money, and I have kept it for while.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see...Well, in that case I will be honored to shop with you.\" Koban said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You smiled and after lunch you washed the dishes and others, then gotten ready to go to shopping. You two got out and walked at least 30 minutes and you two got to the thrift store. It was a same place where your mother always bought clothes for you and to herself since her mother knows the owner of the thrift store and once you two got in you were greeted by an young adult women that were around mid-20's with red dyed hair and brown longs sleeve shirt and khaki pants. She was Sen Mochizuki, an collage student who takes part time job in this thrift store, and she knows you and your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, kondo kun. Here for shopping?\" Sen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, for her.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sen noticed koban and she introduced herself to her. Sen wondered if she was your girlfriend and you explained to her blushing about her and how you were accepted to Ootomi High School. She was both surprised and shocked to hear that as she wanted to go to Ootomi when she was younger but failed to get in as she failed the entrance exam. She felt little jealous of you, but knew she could never go to such prestigious school such as Ootomi and congratulated you. You thanked her and once you got into deeper area you let Koban choose what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright master, let me check...\" Koban spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then picked some Shirts, jeans and underwear for herself. When she got the bra for herself, you asked if she got everything she wanted and she nodded and went to the cash register. Sen scanned through the clothes and once she was over she turned to your attention as you got the wallet out to pay for the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The total will be 7,850 yen, kondo kun.\" Sen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, hold on..\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Hold on!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You turned to koban and she was looking at the prices of the bill. You and sen didn't know why she interrupted the payment and then she took the abacus from the cash register and started to fiddle with it. You could tell she was good with abacus as she was flicking and picking the ball with pretty fast pace and once it was done she looked up to sen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You see ma'am,  7,850 yen is quite decent amount but since you know these stuff are already used...\" Koban spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She plucked more things on the abacus and showed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..Why don't you give us 25% discount? is fair and all.\" Koban said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I'm sorry but we're not suppose to do some haggling.\" Sen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You were imbarressed to see this as koban was trying to haggle the price. Sen continued to refuse the haggling but koban insisted that the price should be discounted 25%. Sen knew you and your mother lived in lower middle class and after moment of talk she gave in and gave you two an 25% discount. You thanked her and once you paid the price she gave you the bag and you two bowed to her and left the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That...was not bad, but please don't do it again koban.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What can I say? I'm gyoubu danuki, it's in my blood.\" Koban replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sighed and you two went back home. Afterwards, you put the clothes in the closet and ironed the school uniform.

You cooked some  breakfast and once you two ate and cleaned up, you put your and kobans lunchbox to your book back and both of you got outside. You felt little chill as the fall was on, you wondered why the new semester starts in fall instead of spring, but you didn't complain as you were now part of the Ootomi student. It took at least 20 minutes to school and once you got to the entrance you seen some students looking at you with some mean look. You felt little awkward about this but ignored their stare and both of you got to the shoes box and changed to indoor shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now lets see...\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You took out the map and scheduel from the bag and looked at it. You notice that your homeroom were in third floor and it took at least 5 minutes for you two to get it and once you got it, you two went into the room only to see the board eraser drop on top of your head. You coughed little by the dust as the students and their shikigami laughed at you for falling into the childish trick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Haha! Look at that peasant, getting hit by that eraser!!\" One student said with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were getting irritated and looked at Koban only to realize her eyes quickly turned stern and changed from normal white sclera with yellow pupil to black sclera with red pupil. You could tell she was mad and she walked toward the student and quickly grabbed at his collar. They felt chill from the shikigami as their shikigami tried to help him out, koban quickly looked at them intending to kill them and they backed off. She then looked back at the student and showed her fang as she was not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You better not mess with my master or I will ruin your familys fortune so bad you will never recover. understand!?\" Koban said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He...hehe, you don't know where I live, so how can you do it?\" Student replied with both cocky attitude and fear mixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Want to see that in reality?\" Koban replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then stopped her, letting her know that both you and herself is at school right now. Koban looked at the student for moment and then let him go and turned to you. The student coughed as you picked your seat across from him, he glared at you with hate, you just ignored him as the moment passes a teacher came in. It was a long black haired women with business cloth on and she had some good chest size while behind her was a tall physically fit man with yellow/brown hair and had some sort of ceremonial cloth on, and you noticed that he had tiger ears and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, you high school pricks. I am Ms.Moriyama and this is my tiger shikigami toramaru. You all better follow the damn rules or you all will be fucking punished!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised how her speech was so laxed and so casual. She then told everyone that the shikigamis must be in chibi form so they can help their master easier. Every shikigami turned into chibis and you saw your shikigami turn to chibi as she had big brown eyes and her tail gotten little longer.

She stopped and observed as she was crunching on the cucumber, Koban looked at the kappa shikigami and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is there something wrong?\" Koban asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nope, just observing, friend.\" Mizumi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were little confused as she called Koban 'friend' but you continued to do some work. As Mizumi finished her cucumber and trotted back to her master, she took out another cucumber from the desk and went to her seat to eat it. You noticed that she was eating the cucumber quietly and after 45 minutes of class, the English class was over. You got up as koban jumped onto your shoulder and sat as the students went you went out as well. As you walked, you noticed that some students were murmuring about you and you just sighed, ignoring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know master..\" Koban whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"During lunch maybe I can offer these little snobby punks a deal that they could never refuse.\" Koban whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You really didn't want her to do it but you just wanted to have the peaceful high school life.

You became curious and decided to take it, and once you told her that ms.sachiko told the employee to get the egg. Once they did they handed over the egg to you and handed to you. You felt the weight as it was kind of heavy and the egg were big and had green and gold color on with school emblem in the middle of the egg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The egg will not hatch until the time hits the midnight. You have all the necessary items including the school uniform, correct?\" Ms.Sachiko spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes ma'am.\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then bid farewell to her and got out of the building. You were excited about this as starting tomorrow not only you would go to the prestigious school but you would get an shikigami as your partner! You walked back to home and once you got in, you were greeted by your father and your mother. Your fathers name was Tetsuya Ayakami and your mothers name was Umi Ayakami, and they met when they were childhood friend since kindergarten and married when they graduated high school and started the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome back Kondo, how was the entrance assembly?\" Tetsuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It was good, though I seen some students looking at them.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just don't pay attention to them, kondo...by the way, why do you have such big egg?\" Umi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You told them about what happened and once you explained everything they were very surprised to hear this were proud of you. Umi told you all that there will be a yakiniku for tonights dinner and you were happy to hear that as things like that were uncommon things to do as beef were somewhat expensive. After you ate lunch you got out to stretch and went to the park to see your old friend. Once you got to the park you saw someone sitting at the bench sipping some can of orange juice. It was a blond haired girl with blue eyes and were Caucasian. She was Jessica Einburge, girl born from Manhattan New York and moved to Sapporo when she was 3 years old. You met her when you were in elementary school and you two became fast friend and when you were accepted to Ootomi, she was saddned to see you go as she were not accepted to Ootomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, kondo kun.\" Jessica spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi Jessie.\" You replied, calling her by her nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sat down next to her and chilled off. She asked you how was the Ootomi so far and you told her it was ok so far as it was just an entrance speech. You two agreed that it was strange that the school would start in fall instead of spring. When students were accepted to Ootomi, they would have an special permission from the school itself to be off from any school until the end of august and beginning of September. In exchange they must study about the history of Ootomi and how they operate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know, I'm jealous that you're going to Ootomi.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why don't you transfer there?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you kidding? Transfer rating is below 5% over there!\" Jessica replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were aware that it was a tough school, but you didn't know that it was THAT tough. After that you and Jessica hanged out for while and once the sun started to go down, you and Jessica was ready to go home. You asked Jessica if she wanted to come over to your place for dinner, but she politely declined and bid farwell. Once you got back, you went to the dining room and saw the table were ready set up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You thanked for the food and started to eat, and once everything was done, you ironed the school outfit and hanged it, done everything and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

Once you put the tea away to fridge and washed the cup, you went back to your room until you saw a flash of light on the sides of the door. Once the light faded away you went to the door and opened it up and saw a naked, long blond women kneeling before you. You flustered as she was naked, you noticed a egg shell around her letting you know that this female was the Valkyrie shikigami. She slowly got up and opened her eyes, revealing her blue eyes toward you (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/monstergirlencyclopedia/images/c/c5/260_valkyrie.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140524063439\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/mons...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you the one who summoned me?\" Valkyrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes I am.

You fluttered more as her chest were perfectly big and you could see her nude more  closer and once she stopped in front of you, she put her hand on her chest and bowed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In the name of god, I shall accompany you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah...thank you.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then got to your dresser and gotten the underwear and shirt that you normally wear and gave it to her. She thanked you and wore it, and you told her that since it was late, she could use your bed for sleeping. She asked you where you would sleep, you told her you will sleep on the floor. You then noticed her pout and then grabbed your arm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I cannot let you sleep on the hard floor! You must sleep on the bed with me!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But...that bed is for one person.\" You replied, \"Don't worry, it will be ok.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...I see, alright...as you say.\" She replied, bowed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then turned to the bed and laid down.

You were sweating little as if you thought that they were feeling awkward talking to the stranger. You quickly went to the area to explain to them then your father spoke up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"good morning kondo.

After you changed to your school uniform, you got your bag and went downstairs to get some breakfast. It was fried egg, sausage link and some toasts with strawberry jam. You and the Valkyrie thanked for the food and when you started to eat, your mother spoke up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know, does your shikigami have name?\" Umi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come to think of it, I haven't named her yet.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked at your shikigami and she told you anything will be fine.

It was slightly chilly as it was September and the fall has started. You were wondering why the new semester starts in fall instead of spring, and you thought that you would ask the principle once you meet her again. It took 20 minutes for you two to get to the school and once you got to the entrance you two changed the shoes.  You got the map and the direction as you remember what the schedule and you went toward the homeroom. Once you two got to the place you two looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I hope we would have a great year.\" Asta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope so too.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once you two got into the classroom, you seen the students..</span></div></div>",

It was a luck that you, the middle class girl, to be here. The only reason why you got to this school is because back in your middle school days, the principle have some how convinced the principle of the Ootomi to take you in. As you walked into the school ground, you saw many students in good suits as male wore an black top and good pants with the school emblem on his shoulder while the ladies wore a navy blue top and a long skirt with a school emblem on her chest. You were excited for a new class and once you got into the building, you changed the shoes into indoor shoes and walked through the hallway. You noticed some students whispering each other and you overheard one of them talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you see her? that's the middle-class girl that were accepted here in Ootomi.\" Male student whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, I don't even know why a girl like her were accepted.\" Female student whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't care about what they say: you were in the prestigious school! the school that both your parents and your big brother who went to america to become a truck mechanic. You went to the principles office and meet the principle. It was a women in good blue shirt with white shirt inside, and had a long blue skirt. Her name was Sachiko Hanamichi, 45 years old and she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're hear ms....Shizuku Shichibana.\" Sachiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, at present!\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and told you to come with her. You slightly knew Ms.Sachiko since she was your mothers colleague during her days. You wondered maybe that was the reason you got into this school. As you two walked, the students and the teachers greeted her and she greeted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this school, young lady?\" Sachiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's great! I cant wait for my freshmen year to start!\" You replied in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again and then both of you went to the main gym area. You departed with sachiko and once you got to the freshmen line, you saw sachiko go to the podeium. She coughed and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, students of Ootomi. I am Sachiko Hanamichi, your principle. Students from sophmores to seniors already know me, and I do hope you seniors graduate from this school successfully while juniors learn hard to take place, and sophmores continue to smile and study while freshemn have a new experience.\" Sahicko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the rest of the students clapped there hands. Sachiko spoke some news and before it was over, sachiko spoke up to the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. Students from sophmores to seniors, you can go home since today is just an entrace speech. Freshmens, please stay put for moment.\" Sachiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered why she said that, and after all the sophmores, juniors and seniors left, two other teachers came to sachiko and she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freshems, listen up. This school is not an ordinary school that you know. This is a school where you have your own shikigami as your partners, who will help you with study and so forth.\" Sachiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students mumbled as you and them were surprised to hear that.

Satoru got up to get you free but his shikigami quickly jumped into action and defended him as she growled at him. He looked at you and then slapped your face with full force. Soma got very mad and he immediatly scratched the shikigami's face and pushed her aside. He immedatily came to the male teen and scratched him several time and once he let go of you soma grabbed his collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You do something like this again, I will not hesitate to make you turn to cat food!\" Soma spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The boy got afraid by somas furious green eyes and his attitude he got off and ran off with his shikigami. You thanked soma for what he did and he just told you he'll be always here to defend you and satoru. You two thanked him and resumed the tour then went home.

It's also important to know how to craft the spell, failure to do so often result the spell losing a lot of it's potential, or in some cases the spell backfiring and leaving the caster fatigued.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a lot to take in.\" You sweat dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well starting off the basic ones can really help with the harder ones.\" Kenshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi then looked forward and raise his right hand in front of him.

You thought maybe he use a magic spell that made him more resilient to the punch(or do warlocks have good resilience to begin with?) Kenshi smirk and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that suppose to hurt me? Now, it's my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi then did a palm strike that cause some sort of magic blast attack that launch the student off the ground and collide right into his tanooki shikigami! The other student notice this and order his phoenix shikigami to burn down Kenshi.

They walked through the gate and the oni shikigami opened the locked door with the key. Once they got into the building they walked through the hallway and reached the elevator. The elevator was not known to the students and only a selected few employees know this elevator and once the three got into the elevator they went down and it took at least 1 minute and once they got out they were at the huge room that had some working devices and looked like the principles room but with some gadgets. Ms.Sachiko walked toward the desk and behind it revealed an male adult around 40 years of age, some grey hair and had an Shinto shrine priest outwear. He noticed Ms.Sachiko and the shikigami and he stopped writing and the three bowed to him lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I expected you to come earlier, Ms.Sachiko.\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I apologize for the lateness, Academy Master Tanaka.\" Ms.Sachiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mans name was Tanaka Jiro, the man who funds the whole Ootomi Academy from school Items to Employees paycheck. He was also the provider of the shikigami eggs since he was also the elder Shinto priest. Reason he funds here is because he loves to see the children grow with education and making bonds with the shikigami. Tanaka got up from the chair and walked side as Ms.Sachiko got up from the bow and then he spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms.Sachiko, I have heard a word that one of the freshmen of this school is actually from an middle-class.\" Tanaka said, \"Is that true?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, Academy Master. His name is Kondo Ayakami, son of Umi Ayakami, my childhood friend.\" Ms.Sachiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jiro was thinking for moment and then turned his attention to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms.Sachiko. I understand that you want this academy to be open to anyone, even to the unfortunate. But you must understand that we're not running a charity on the enrollment.\" Tanaka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, it's true. I have done this out of my selfish way, just so my friends son would have the same education and her.\" Ms.Sachiko said, \"If you wish to fire me, then please do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jiro thought for moment as though he was known for having some strict rules but in secret he was a soft man. He never wanted to harm anyone who were in bad situation, and Ms.Sachiko was one of them as she came from the poor working class. It was Jiro who gave her the job as a janitor of the Ootomi and when the previous principle quit work he put her as the next principle. He thought for moment and then sighed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Ms.Sachiko. I will let this through since you had hard time. But if you are going to do something like this again, please tell me beforehand.\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, Academy Master.\" Ms.Sachiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She bowed and Jiro told her to go home to get some rest. She understood and bid farewell to him and went back home with two shikigami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Next day...</span></div></div>",

Once you and kenshi got to the seat, some students noticed you and the shiki and were looking at you for moment. You were little afraid by their stair but kenshi assured you nothing will happen. After moment of stare, the door opened and a women with business cloth came in with male with yellow/brown hair and yellow eyes came in. You could tell she was the homeroom teacher as she put her work bag to her desk and the man stood next to the teachers desk, the female came to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"'Morning highschoolers, freshmens and others alike. I am Ms.Moriyama and this is my tiger shikigami Toramaru.\" She said, \"You all behave youself because I hate people who fucking annoys me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised by how her speech was used. You wondered if she was even a teacher then when she turned around to write some words on the black board you saw a tip of some sort of picture on her lower neck area. You wondered what that picture were but listened to what your homeroom teacher were talking about. She was talking about what the freshmen expect in their stay at the Ootomi and what the shikigami will be doing in their role. While she was speaking, you got hit by something on your head as you looked back, it was the same two students that were harrassing you yesterday. They played dumb as you turned back, the boy threw the paper ball again toward you. Kenshi saw this and used his power and stopped it and throw it back to him and hit him. He giggled as he got mad, he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey! What's the big idea, using your power!?\" Male student shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The class looked at him while ms.moriyama sighed and stopped writing as toramaru was in ready if anything happenes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was giving you a same exact medicine you gave to my master.\" Kenshi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You...bastard!!\" Male student shouted with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as he was about to order his shikigami to attack kenshi, toramaru leap over and immediately landing in front of the shikigami and overwhelms her.  The female shikigami, who were ho-no-tori, made an scared noise and her bladder released its urine out of fear. You were very surprised to see this while kenshi was still vigilent, ms.moriyama came next to the student.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Didn't I said I hate dumbasses?\" Ms.Moriyama asked, \"You're having detention after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What...but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Toramaru just roared toward both his shikigami and himself, making the phoenix jump and hide behind her master. The student closed his mouth tight and ms.sachiko spoke to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope you freshmens don't end up like this dipshit. Don't you all abuse the privilage you have given here.\" Ms.Moriyama said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With the school bell rang, the homeroom was over.

It was science room alright, since they had many experiment desks and science stuff. In a few moment a woman in science coat and a school uniform came in. She had chestnut hair and it was twin ponytails and had the glasses on. Behind her a rather slender man with green hair and brown snake like eyes came in. You and then rest of the students bowed to the women as it was the science teacher and got to the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings class, I am Ms.Yamaguchi, and this is my snake shikigami, Kusakichi. Behave yourself alright children?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" You and the students spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the class were told by Ms.Yamaguchi that the shikigami must be in chibi form during the class so there would be more room for you and the students to walk. Kenshi nodded made an puff of smoke, the smoke went away and Kenshi was now in his chibi mode, with big purple eyes and was riding on a neat mini broom.

Today you're going to learn about the ecology.\" Ms.Yamaguchi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were writing on your notes, you could hear someone whispering something to each other and hearing some 'hmph' sounds. You didn't mind, but Kenshi wanted to punish them. However he was awe that shikigami are not allow to use their powers and abilities to fight, unless it's self-defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives? Do they seriously have issue with us?\" Kenshi said as he float around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long they don't do anything aggressive don't worry about it ok?\" You said as you search for your easer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but if they do cross the line, I will defend you.\" Kenshi replied as he gave you the easer. \"Here you go, master Shizuku.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kenshi.\" You said before thinking.

You noticed some students got out of the door with the gym uniform on, you made the assumption that the place beyond that door is the changing room. As you and Kenshi was about to go there, someone tapped your shoulder and turned around, only to see a huge muscular women with horns on her head. It was an oni, the oni looked at you and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you freshmen?\" The oni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm Shizuku Shichibana.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The changing room is through that door and both yours and your shikigami uniform is in the named lockers. Better get changed quickly.\" Oni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and both you and Kenshi quickly went to the locker room. The locker room were clean as it had some row of lockers with the names on. You search for yours and saw your name closer to the exit area. You were about to change into your uniform until you quickly realized your warlock shikigami is in the same room with you, you blush by this and Kenshi took notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you blushing master?\" Kenshi ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um... we have to change.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ah! I see where you're getting at!\" Kenshi said, knowing what you're implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both turned around and changed into your gym uniform without peeking on each other. The female gym uniform had the blue bloomer pants and short T-shirts, while the male uniform had long loose pants and white long shirt while. After you two was fully dressed, Kenshi looked over and notice your how the gym uniform really showed your figure. He quickly turn away and chuckle when you looked over to him. You looked at a mirror as you were a bit embarrassed by this and though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They really did grew again. I'll be a d-cup if this continue.' You thought as you looked at your rather large c-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two got out and got into the group, you saw a man that looked like an body builder with tight shirt and sport pants on standing with the same oni you saw earlier next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello young freshmans! I am Mr.Okazu, your gym teacher and this is my oni shikigami Chikara!\" Mr.Okazu spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikara nodded her head toward the students. You and Kenshi felt the fear from her earlier but now you don't feel that anymore. After Mr.Okazu called for the students name, he smiled and gave the roster to Chikara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright students!

Alice was strict, but when someone complain to her too often she loses it and yell at the person like an drill seargent in the the boot camp. After the moment of yapping alice broke her silence and turned to her monkey shikigami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Xiao lin, I need tea.\" Alice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He nodded and turned to get tea as alice turned to the teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look, If you have problem deal with it yourself.

It was a male teacher who had some what of raggedy hair and had an line of scar on his left eye area. Behind him was an blue haired girl with blue jeans and white tank-top on her. You noticed that she was eating some cucumbers and once the man put the book down he turned to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone. I am Mr.Imura and this is my kappa shikigami Mizumi. I hope we all get along fine.\" He said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then asked everyone to get the text book out and he begun the teaching. You were listening to his teaching while Kenshi was helping you out, he noticed Mizumi trotting around the class observing the students and their shikigami then she came to your area. She stopped and observed as she was crunching on the cucumber, Kenshi looked at the kappa shikigami and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong?\" Kenshi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just observing, friend.\" Mizumi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were little confused as she called Kenshi 'friend' but you continued to do some work. As Mizumi finished her cucumber and trotted back to her master, she took out another cucumber from the desk and went to her seat to eat it. You noticed that she was eating the cucumber quietly and after 45 minutes of class, the school was done for today. Everyone stood and bowed to the teacher and became casual as Mr.Imura and Mizumi left, you packed your stuff and both you and Kenshi got out of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's that, can't wait to get home.\" Kenshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, glad I made it through the first day.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you change shoes close the locker, you both walk outside the building and were stopped by...</span></div></div>",

You were little scared as they had some injury on their body and their shikigami were pumped up for battle. Kenshi were calm and were next to you as you took step back. The boys with their shikigami stepped forward and then their shikigami did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you want? I don't want to fight.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"you don't want one, but we do want one bitch!\" One boy said, \"Get her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His phoenix shikigami made some fire and flew toward you two. Kenshi was ready to fight as you were defending yourself, you all noticed something came down from the heavens. It was a sword and it was shiny as ever, and when kenshi looked to the side he saw an black haired male with angelic wings on his back. You and others were amazed to see an angel flowing down from the heaven and from behind someone jumped over you and landed next to the angel. It was Xiao Lin with his staff and got to the fighting position and you turned around and saw both Ms.Sachiko and Alice walking toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms.Sachiko, Alice sempai.\" You spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they came to you, alice asked if you were alright. You told her you were alright and once she nodded, she turned around looking at the students. They were little afraid of the angelic being and the wise monkey before them and the male students were shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A...Alice, and the principle is here too?\" Male student spoke in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course. Mastema here told us about what you guys are up to.\" Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Gentlemen. I want you all to stop this nonsense and refrain from violence.\" Ms.Sachiko spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The soft voice of Ms.Sachiko was calm and you and kenshi could tell both her and alice showed no fear. The boys were getting erritated as they thought the two females were intimidating the three and their arrogence got over their thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We are children to powerful lawyers! You dare tell us to refrain!? I'll teach you a lesson!\" Male student shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They ordered their shikigami to attack the two. You were afraid they would be hurt but ms.sachiko just sighed and alice lightly smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'mastema, do your job.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Prove your strength, xiao lin.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two shikigami nodded and xiao lin rushed toward the enemy shikigami and pounced their jaws with his staff. Their brain jiggled and paralized the enemy and mastema quietly and quickly chanted some words and pointed at the enemy. The enemy shikigami engulfed in light and when they screamed, the light quickly turned with darkness and it immeditaly turned into eggs. You and kenshi were surprised to see this as the male students limped back by fear, the eggs flew towared ms.sachiko and hovered around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Gentlemen, for aggrivated assault and endangering the student, I herby declare you three expelled from this school forever.\" Ms.Sachiko spoke, \"now leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn..DAMN!!\" Male shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They then ran off with tears in their eyes. You were glad that they were here and once ms.sachiko turned around, mastema followed her and walked back into the building as you wanted to thank her. Alice told you she will be busy so she should be left alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say Alice, is it bad to be expelled from this school?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If the employers and other good school find out you were expelled, they will never hire you or accept you.\" Alice replied. \"I hope you two will not make any mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and kenshi nodded and both alice and xiao lu bowed and bid farewell. You nodded and once you and kenshi started to walk away you noticed someone waiting for you. It was souta and miwa and they were waiting for you.

You and souta was talking about their classes while kenshi and miwa was in the air chatting about magic. After 25 minutes of walk you reached soutas residence. It was normal as it had two stories and it had blue roof. Souta opened the gate and let you in and after few steps he unlocks the door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, welcome to my house.\" Souta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, sorry for the intrusion.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You got in and the area were pretty decent for the middle class child like himself. As you put your shoes off and got up, he took you toward his room as it was upstairs. Once you two got upstairs and walked toward the room on the far right, he opened the door and you saw what the boys room looked like. His room had hard wood floor with one bed on the top right and had study desk next to it.

Kenshi cast the fiery fireballs as Miwa cast the floating ice mines. The mines look like floating white sparks that's giving off a cold fog, then burst into a icy explosion when the fireballs collide into them. After a couple of minutes, Souta came in with the tea as the shikigami were finishing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I haven't miss anything exciting.\" Souta smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does magical fireworks count as exciting?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shikigami were reading their spellbooks on what magic they should do next, you decided to talk with Souta about the shikigami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Souta, what do you think about the shikigami?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just really liked the idea of having a shikigami, especially the ones we have.\" Souta replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what he meant, you always thought that witches and warlocks were old and ugly looking due to the stories you heard. But they can't become old since they have eternal youth or agelessness if you want to call it that, thus making the warlocks handsome young men and the witches beautiful young women. You also like how the magic looked as Kenshi and Miwa were firing multiple magic missiles at a crystal they created. As the crystal was being bombarded by the projectiles, confetti started to appear around the crystal until finally the crystal burst into a mini firework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome, magic is sure is cool!\" Souta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're glad you two liked it.\" Miwa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I'm not the only one who liked it.\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that master?\" Kenshi ask before thinking. 'What a sec... is she referring to...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the 'making girls happy' spell.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Hey what's she talking about?\" Miwa said as her smiling face inching closer toward Kenshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... she's just playing with us.\" Kenshi replied as he back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, I wanna see these 'make girls happy' spells myself.\" Miwa said as she gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Souta chuckle at the sight of the witch chasing the warlock until Miwa trip and landed on Kenshi where Miwa's bust happen to be resting on Kenshi's head. You and Souta sweatdrop at the accident as Kenshi bring himself to cast the light orb. The rest of the days passed and you manage to finish the first week of Ootomi, the students continued to harass you in some areas but thanks to Kenshi and the student council the harassment went down. During the homeroom your teacher told you and the class that the students have an mandatory enrollment to the club activity so they will get some credits for collages. The entrance would start on the beginning of the second week as the deadline was on the ending of that same week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...The second week of Ootomi high school... became interesting at this point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The area had more lively and cheery decorations such as party items and such. You had this excitement that it would be a good day. Once you parted with souta and went to your homeroom, you got to your seat and moment later ms.sachiko and toramaru came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Morning you virgin shits.

You gotten more curious as kenshi noticed your curiosity and asked if you wanted to go there. You nodded and once you two go to the area, the female student noticed you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Greetings! I sense you got curious with magic club?\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Magic club?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl nodded, \"Yup! I am the president of the magic club Fuyuna Kobayashi. Me and the club members study about the magic that was used by mages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and kenshi were surprised to hear that and you made an consideration and fuyuna gave you the panphlet for it. You bowed and once you two left the area you saw souta and miwa talking to one of the president. You two came closer and noticed the advertisment wrote as 'alchemy club'. You and kenshi wondered why he was at the alchemy club then the two noticed you and kenshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, shizuku san!\" Souta spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey souta. You're interested in alchemy?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He nodded and told you he liked something like this and you met the male student who had light blue hair and he nodded at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello there, I am the president of the alchemy class Shoutaro Kawakuchi. Are you interested in the club?\" He spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You pondered as souta told him that he might be interested in joining the place. He understood and you told him you were the same as you have not forgotten about the magic club. You, souta and both shikigami looked through the clubs until the lunch time arrived.

As you four arrived at the park, it was your normal-looking park as it had sandbox, sled, jungle gym and some benches. You all went toward the crepe stand and the owner of the stand noticed you all. The owner were adult female with short black hair and had casual clothing with white apron on. She was Aceline Bellamy, Frenchwomen who moved to Japan to experience the culture itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, hello there Mademoiselle shizuku. Where is your elder sister?\" Aceline asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's at her clinic doing her job.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and noticed souta and the shikigamis. She asked you who they were and you explained to her the details. After the moment of explanation, souta and his shikigami introduced themselves as kenshi did the same, she nodded and petted your head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm glad you got yourself an handsome classmate.\" Aceline said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made both you and souta blush while kenshi and miwa giggled by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms.Bellamy, geez!!\" You spoke with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Haha! anyway, I'll cook you two some crepes. My treat.\" Aceline said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and souta thanked her as she prepared to make the crepes. You liked her cooking as when you first meet her during your middle school era, her cooking technique were very well gifted and talented. You wonder why she opened up an food stall instead of making some sort of French restaurant. She started to cook the dough and all of you smelled the sweet smell of the dough and once she cooked them she started to put in some ingredients inside and about 14 minutes she made four crepes for all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Four pudding crepes up!\" Aceline said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you ma'am.\" Souta thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem monsieur.\" Aceline <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You all bid farewell and went away. Once you found the bench you all sat to the area and started to eat while the shikigami were eating in the air.

You go into the nature and walked through the trees until you saw the same girl standing before someone on the bench. You hid behind the tree and peeked, realizing that the person who were sitting were none other then Alice herself. You didn't know why she was here then she spoke to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is good takoyaki and crepe...maybe I should speak to father about this vendor.\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm glad you liked it.\" Bully spoke, \"Now about that little thing about my transfer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice looked at the bully and she shivered. You could even feel the shiver and fear from alice as if she was hiding her menacing stair at her without showing it off. She put the food down and got up, walking toward her and stopped infront of her just a few inch away from face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just because You've done this doesn't mean I let you go easely.\" Alice said, \"Your transfer from this school to Shikatoni High will not change.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She shivered as you know where shikatoni high were. They were public high school with just an mediocre reputation. You felt sorry for the young girl as the school have decided to transfer her from Ootomi High School to Shikatoni High school. The bully begged for the student council president to stop the transfer but alice just returned to have some takoyaki and crepe.

He told you he had some business with his fathers work place and when he observed you more, he noticed that there was a mud stain on the back. He asked why it was there and kenshi told him you fell to the puddle of mud by accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see. Well, good thing the school don't use silk since they know it could get dirty soon.\" Masuo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really?\" You asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yeah, the superintendent of ootomi takes precaution about this and uses good fabric but not a fragile one.\" Masuo replied, \"Anyway, good luck with the school years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both him and nelly bowed and left the scene. You felt that there might be a good people inside that school and once you got back to the house you got in and went upstairs to change. Kenshi gave you privacy and once you got out with your casual cloth on, you went downstairs to see if hinata was there but once you got to the living room you didn't see her.

While it was washing you were thinking about some random things in your mind until you looked down to your chest. It was big, and you feared that it would become more bigger since you had your grandmothers genes that she and your mother once had a great figure during their youth, including a huge breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Haa...I wish it won't grow any more..\" You mumbled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then touched your chest and moved it little.

The patient had some bad stomachache and hinata subscribed him to the stomach medicine. Once he left the clinic hinata leaned back on the chair and relaxed. She was thinking about what to do since tomorrow was day off for her, she heard someone knock the door. Hinata looked and saw an middle aged man with some grey hair and a business suite on. She could tell he was someone with important background and got to her seat straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome, how can I help you?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you Hinata Shichibana?\" Man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um...yes, I am.\" Hinata replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He dug his hand to his chest pocket and took out the business card and gave it to her. Hinata looked at it and was surprised alot as she saw the name of the man as Hikaru Yamakata, and his occupation were the superintendant of the Ootomi High School. She looked at the man and he bowed to her lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It is pleasure to meet you. I am Hikaru Yamakata, the superintendent of the Ootomi Academy.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah...G-greetings! what can a high class gentlemen like you would come to such place like this?\" Hinata replied with some sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She hardly seen any powerful people come to her clinic. The only time the powerful person ever came to her clinic was the principle of the John Hopkins University come to her clinic to look at her work area. After she never seen anyone else that powerful come to the clinic. She wondered why such a powerful man coming to her clinic and then Hikaru spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tell me something, are you the elder sister to Shizuku Shichibana?\" Hikaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes I am sir. I am Hinata Shichibana, graduate of Tokyo U.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see...I have heard about you since I've seen the entrance paper your younger sister wrote.\" Hikaru said, \"And it got my attention that even though you're indeed an graduate of Tokyo U, you're working in the clinic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This clinic was run through my family since 1944, and I would like to keep it afloat.\" Hinata explained.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I see. Anyway, I came here for one reason.\" Hikaru spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He got his bag and took out some paper and handed over to hinata. She looked at it and it was an application form for employment. Hinata had the idea that he wanted to hire herself and the superintendent continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Currently our nurse at the Ootomi are going to retire soon due to age. Not alot of people are qualified enough to be part of the nursing field and since I know that your little sister is one of our student, I had idea that maybe you could work at the Ootomi.\" Hikaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was purely a good offer to hinata. She always wanted to have more experience in the medical field and she heard a word that if one nurse works for Ootomi, he or she would have guaranteed medical coverage, good pay and good retirement funds. She thought for moment and had the urge to work there since she could also see you every day, but wondered about the clinic itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But what would happen to my family clinic?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, Ms.Shichibana. You can continue to keep your clinic, and I will arrange for the person who would be your replacement.\" Hikaru replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hinata nodded, felt little easy that at least she would continue to hold the property and the clinic itself. She thought for moment and then decided to go for it and agreed to do work for the Ootomi. Hikaru was pleased and it took 20 minutes for hinata to fill the application and then giving it to him. Once he did, he got the paper to the bag and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then, welcome to the Ootomi High School. I will let the principle know about your coming, and you shall come tomorrow to meet with her and get your own shikigami.\" Hikaru said, \"Now then, excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He got up, both of them bowed and the man left the scene. Hinata were happy to hear this as she was now working for the pristigous school and she could keep the family clinic. She got up and packed her stuff up as she was going to leave for tonight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back at home you and kenshi were..</span></div></div>",

At the principles office, hinata greeted herself to Ms.Sachiko and she nodded with smile. The principle explained to hinata about the rules of conduct for the school and how it is operated. Hinata were listning to her and once she was done ms.sachiko got up and came to her. Hinata could tell she was another powerful person and then she spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then, I am going to give you the egg where you could get the shikigami. Unfortunatly, because the entrance ceremony was long gone, the eggs I could offer is very limited.\" Ms.Sachiko said&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you don't mind me asking, do you still have the warlock shikigami?\" hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She chuckled little as she remembered that you have chosen the warlock shikigami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see you would want that, but unfortunatly we don't have it.\" Ms.Sachiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She understood and the principle told the employee to bring the egg in. The employee understood and went to the other room and in 30 seconds he came back to the room and handed over the egg to hinata. She could feel the heaviness and then suddenly it started to hatch.

As you were waiting for the teacher to show up, you talk with Kenshi about what club they should join since the deadline is only a couple days from now. Ms.Moriyama and Toramaru came in, the students and the shikigami stood and bowed to her and sat down and the teacher took out the math book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, whoever gets the high score don't have to do homework.\" Ms.Moriyama said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" class spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and begun teaching her class as she told them she'll grade them later. The students and you listened to her while she was teaching. After 45 minutes, the bell rang and everyone was headed to the gym class. After P.E. was over, you were flushed and embarrassed from today's activity, which was dodge ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, why did they had to pick me?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you meant is that during dodge ball, everytime you narrowly dodge your breasts bounce and jiggle which cause some perverted eyes to look at your glory. Mr.Okazu and Chikara did told the students to stop which made you a little happy, but that doesn't change the fact they got some eye candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Kenshi came next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, at least Mr.Okazu and Chikara are looking out for me.\" You replied. \"Just need to finish the next few days, and we'll be done for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi nod and turned around so you could get changed first. You opened the locker where you see Kenshi's uniform was there, but you realize that your school uniform was missing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kenshi...\" You said. \"My school clothes are gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! But then...\" Kenshi replied as he search the locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... Kenshi...\" You start to quiver in fear. \"I can't go to lunch like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, what now?\" Kenshi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you couldn't go out in your gym uniform since it showed your figure. Kenshi sudden had an idea, he dug in the school bag to bring out his magicbook. He flip through the pages until he stopped at the spell he was looking for. You were wondering what's on his mind until he ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm one step ahead of those clothes thieves.\" Kenshi smiled. \"Master, you don't need to go out in your gym clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't?\" You made a light smile at the newfound hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go out and bring over Miwa to loan over one of her's magic clothes, or I could cast a spell to summon one of my owns.\" Kenshi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief that people won't be ogling you for the rest of the school hours. But which clothes do you want to wear? One of Miwa's witch dress or one of Kenshi's warlock wear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to try out...\"</span></div></div>",

Kenshi and Miwa follow the thief into the small forest area until they got to a clearing that looks fit for a duel. The thief took off the hood and it turned out that Souta was right, it was Itsuki. He looked around and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop using your chameleon ability sweetheart.\" Itsuki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he talking to?\" Miwa spoke to Kenshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, but let's stay hidden for a little longer.\" Kenshi replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, a female person with lizard like eyes and tail appeared out of nowhere. The spellcasters were amazed that the shikigami has the ability to hide like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, a shikigami? How did he get one?\" Kenshi spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're about to found out, look.\" Miwa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spellcasters continue to stay put as the felon and his shikigami walk toward the center of the clearing where they met up with a man in a fine suite, in other words, his client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon Itsuki, how did the job go?\" The cilent asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went well at first, until that teacher with the tiger smack me from behind.\" The felon replied. \"Good thing the shikigami you gave me helped me out back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not mentioning that warlock burnt my master's face!\" The lizard shiki spoke. \"He's going to pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now friend, wait till we're out of the clear first.\" Itsuki said. \"Now then, let's get down to business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi and Miwa knew what's going on, Itsuki was given a shikigami to do the dirty work for someone. But who is his client? Is he a felon as well? Either way Miwa was ready to stop them, and Kenshi too. Kenshi didn't want his school outfit to tear up if it turns out to be a battle, so he cast a spell to turn his wear to his other one where the silver haired warlock was wearing black pants, dark blue shirt, dark purple/red mage cloak and scarf. (Something like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/powerlisting/images/1/10/Dark_Swordsman.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150131180836\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/powe...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy holstaur! You look awesome, I take that's your personal wear?\" Miwa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lets go!\" Kenshi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiwa took to the skies as Kenshi took ground combat. Miwa cast her first spell to create a giant wall of emerald to block the villain's escape route. Itsuki and his shiki was caught surprised by this, but his client remained calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itsuki, I thought your shiki said, nobody is following us?\" The client asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must of used their chibi mode!\" The lizard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk. You disappointed me Itsuki, I thought you're better then this?\" The client mocked the felon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! All we need to do is kill these bozos and we'll be done with it!\" The felon shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, just to let you know, you call for this, not me.\" The client replied as two more shikigami appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shikigami that joined in is another lizard shikigami, but this one is male. And the other one is... some sort of gigantic blob-ish youkai that had a plump stomach.</span></div></div>",

Even though their master were not around, the lizard shikigami had one major flaw, they were only a couple days old and had yet to mastered their abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess training with Kenshi was worth it after all.\" Miwa spoke happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rahhh! For my master!\" Yelled the lizard shiki as she tried to slash Kenshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Predictable!\" Said Kenshi as he counter attack with a magic sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the female lizard backed off, she quickly use her chameleon ability, hoping if she could attack Kenshi off-guard. Miwa took note of this and cast 8 homing sparks that easily found her, thus canceling her chameleon ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I love magic attacks with enemy targeting.\" Miwa smiled. \"Not even hidden enemies can hide from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard shikigami were losing the fight against the witch and the warlock, yet the client haven't used his other shikigami. The felon was getting worried by this and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, your worthless shikigami aren't going to win against those bozos!\" Itsuki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I still have a tricks on my sleeves.\" The client spoke. \"Now then, I think it's time for one of you, to fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe client gave a nod to one of the lizard shikigami and he understood, he ran up a tree and jump to knock Miwa off her broom. Then that plump shikigami shot out his large long tongue and wrapped around Miwa's body and she was caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miwa! No!\" Kenshi shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what a lucky catch. I've always dreamed of wrapping my tongue around a smoking hot witch, dreams can come true!\" The tongue shiki greedily played with Miwa with his tongue. \"You're like a ripe fruit, tasty and delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go you sick creepo!\" Miwa tried to struggle free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Miwa! Give me a sec!\" Kenshi said as he craft the magic circle for a powerful attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't bookworm!\" The client smirk. \"This time, we have the advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi was going blast his way to get to Miwa, but then he saw the tongue shikigami was sucking Miwa in, making her panic. This made Kenshi stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful. If you fight back, I might just make this tasty witch my next meal.\" The tongue shiki spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you...\" Kenshi grind his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about casting the spell! Or else this girl is going to pay for it!\" The lizard man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Kenshi hated it, he had no choice. He couldn't let Miwa get hurt. He cancel the incantation and didn't move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now stay still.\" Said the client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first lizard shiki rushed toward the warlock and slash him in the chest, causing him to reeled back for a couple steps from the attack. Then the other one spun her tail around, sending a large impact that threw Kenshi to the ground. Miwa couldn't stand to watch Kenshi getting beaten up like this. She tried to break free, but the tongue was quiet sticky and she was coated in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it! Leave him alone! He can't defend himself like this!\" Miwa continue to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now my darling. That bastard will soon be no more.\" The tongue shikigami resume playing Miwa with his tongue. \"This is like a erotic fantasy story! Only a hundred times better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how is it better?\" Itsuki looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters there's... this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue shiki moved the tip of the tongue into Miwa's cleavage and exposed her bust. Miwa screamed with embarrassment as the villains and their shikigami looked on drooling and with pervy looks in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Those are some nice bosoms and a sexy bra!\" Said the lizard man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that again!\" Said the female one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU PERVERTS!!! I'LL FREEZE YOU ALL FOR ETERTAL FOR THIS!!!\" Miwa yelled as she struggle with all of her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kenshi heard Miwa screaming he looked up and saw what was going on. The lizard shiki were advancing toward him, and in the background he saw what that tongue shiki was doing to Miwa. When he saw what was going on he get up on his feet, however the injures he has suffered has started to take it's toll. He couldn't do anything, but watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dammit, their going to get away with this!' Kenshi thought. 'Am I just going to sit here and die while she gets treated like this?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Fuck the count system, this is way more justifiable then a lazy ass judge can bring up!\" Itsuki laughed. \"So kid, got any last words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi stood and said nothing. The client order his shikigami to launch the killing blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenshi! NOOOOO!!!\" Miwa yelled as tears started to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi closed his eyes and waited for the final slash that would end him.

But I have to help Miwa!\" Kenshi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, this will be done...\" The warlock smiled. \"...With 3 attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warlock took a few steps forward, Kenshi didn't knew who this person is, but he's definitely not from Ootomi since the emblem doesn't match with his. The client was too a scared to move, he wasn't expecting THEY would find him. The first lizard shiki rush to claw him down, but he pull out a doll and from mere inches, the lizard was under the voodoo influence. The warlock then slam the doll to the ground in turn the shiki did the same, turning it back into a egg... with the same unknown emblem on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike 1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second lizard used her chameleon ability to attack him unseen, the warlock closed his eyes and waited for the sound of footsteps. Once he heard them, he went into some sort of countering state as he was wait for the attack. The attack connected and the warlock instantly teleported behind the lizard shiki with ring of kunai form by metal magic around her. A snap was made, and the ring of magic kunai stab her to death turning her into a egg as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike 2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warlock looked at the tongue shiki who had Miwa captured. He made a couple of steps toward them, causing the tongue shikigami quiver in fear. He completely forgotten about Miwa, until he remember he had her captured. He threated not to come closer, or he'll swallow the witch. The warlock didn't listen so he started to pull Miwa in. The warlock cast a small lightning spark that touched Miwa and giving her an electric aura, keeping her safe and zapping the tongue shikigami to death, and turning him into an egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike 3...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Miwa was freed she fix up her clothes then ran over to Kenshi, as the warlock continue to make his way to felon and the client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miwa, are you ok?\" Kenshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just slimy that's all.\" Miwa replied. \"But you centrally aren't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiwa was checking the wound until they heard screams from where the unknown warlock is. They looked and saw the felon chained to the ground, and his client with a scythe up to his neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I yield! I yield! Please don't hurt me!\" The client said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's too bad. I was hoping me and my master would bring you back headless.\" The warlock smirk. \"But double cross my master again, and I'll show how beautiful death really is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe client nodded and he was then trap in that prison orb like the felon was. Miwa helped Kenshi to walk toward the warlock as he put away his scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you and boobilocks alright?\" He spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, t-thanks for helping us, but who are you?\" Kenshi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Izayoi, I'm sure you two can tell that I'm a warlock.\" Izayoi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, Izayoi. Well I'm Miwa and he's Kenshi, let us repay you for helping us.\" Miwa smiled, then yelled. \"AND DON'T CALL ME BOOBILOCKS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Nah, I'm good.\" Izayoi calmly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Come on, you saved us back there. There has to be something on your mind for an reward.\" Kenshi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, No thanks.\" Izayoi said as he vanish into a dark blur along with the client and the three eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gone. Izayoi was it?\" Kenshi said. \"I have to admit, those were some pretty impressive magic skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, let's bring this felon back and explain to the others.\" Miwa said. \"Kenshi hold on, let me heal you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiwa didn't had very much magic, but it was enough to ease the pain. Kenshi couldn't help but blush at this, he felt like he knew Miwa so much to the point like she's his girlfr...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aww, cut it out Kenshi. We're only like 2 weeks old.' Kenshi thought then spoke. \"T-Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, come on let's go.\" Miwa replied.</span></div></div>",

You wanted to help stop then nelly jumped in the middle and drew her sword, pointed at alice and summoned a smaller sword and pointed at sen. They stopped as your shikigami were about to use his magic as well, and then masuo clapped his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now now ladies, please stop.\" Masuo said, \"student president, she's a senior, so you should respect her.

He understood and got back as alice did the same. You sighed in relief that there would be no violence, then sen spoke to the student president.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You might have become more powerful, but continue to be arrogant, and you will go same path as your father.\" Sen said, \"now excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then left the scene. masuo just comforted alice as you were about to leave... </span></div></div>",
