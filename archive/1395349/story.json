Their bodies are very muscled and can perform a number of different tasks with relative ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the hair on the back of her neck stood on end as a chill ran down her back.  Cindy tried to step forward, her legs moved like she was wading through a lake. They felt so heavy, she couldn\u2019t move.  Her heart skipped a beat when she realized another feeling. She felt\u2026 taller. Then she felt a draft at her midsection. Her chest was rising upward, taking her shirt with it, leaving her skin exposed. Her navel was already peaking out from the white cloth. Before long, her shins began to burn as they too started to stretch upwards, the cuffs of her pants rising to show her bare ankles.  Cindy quickly took a seat at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy asked one of the students to continue reading from the textbook.  As she sat there, a bubbling, rippling sensation swept over her legs as individual muscles started to spasm into growth. Her pants tightened as her flesh filled all available space within them and continue to push outward. Only too late did Cindy come to her senses long enough to attempt to undo the button. The pants were already snuggly in place around her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest kept moving upward toward the sky at its slow pace while she looked down at her legs, twisting her body to see them from the left and from the right, but every angle she tried only revealed a pair of legs that were becoming increasingly less human. Her calf muscles bulged, starting to pull apart the cuffs of her pants at the seams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPains started to emanate from her waist. Her pants were too tight. Way too tight. The pants started tearing from the building pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cindy entered the restroom, she locked the door behind her.  She heard a muffled pop and gasped in relief as she felt some of the pressure drop off around the seat of her pants, only to be replaced by a nagging pinching sensation. Cindy grimaced as she glanced down behind her to see strands of thick hair, course and black, spilling out of a small hole in her pants. Much of the hair was still trapped inside, new growth spewing out with nowhere left to go. Slowly, she put her hand around the base of her tail, though she hated to think of it as that, and pulled its length out. Its unstoppable flow spilled downward and soon swished around her bare ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swelling in her jeans became unbearable. Her thighs, her entire backside was inflating like a water balloon. She felt like she was going to burst! Another loud pop. Then all a sudden, all the pain ceased. Maybe it was over? No such luck. The seams on both sides of her legs had been torn apart, forming an ever-widening canyon in which dwelled her thickening, undulating flesh. The tear crept down her legs as the muscles pulled at it and her waist widened. The belt straps finally snapped away and the denim fell around her knees, revealing a supple round rump, equipped with a fully functional black horse\u2019s tail. She was glad nobody could see her exposed like that. With caution, she looked down to examine herself, and discovered that she was more mare than woman. From the waist down she looked very much like a peach colored pony wearing sneakers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cindy realized she couldn't let anyone see her like this.  She had to get out of the school.  Fortunately, the next class had started and the hallways were empty.  Cindy ran as quickly as she could out of the building.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cindy tried to open her car door, sick crunching noises emanated from her joints as they repositioned along her leg, particularly from within her shoes. The laces snapped, though she didn\u2019t feel any pressure at her feet. Her foot pushed forward, breaking through the toe of the shoe, and she could see a large black substance covering the tip of it. It wiggled as her toes would, though the joint seemed to be much deeper inside the shoe than before. The dull black coating enveloped her toes, penetrating to the bone. She winced\u2026 they were hooves. She began to lose her balance as her heal melted away, being sucked into her body as the arches of her feet stretched longer, breaking though the back of her shoes as well. She tried to settle herself down, but found it too difficult with a foreign set of leg joints which didn\u2019t function the way she expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tops of her shoes burst open, leaving her tottering on only the soles. Her legs wanted to balance on the hooves, her foot arches now a foot long and no longer designed to support weight in that fashion. She took in a deep breath and tried to rise on top of the hooves. She started to fall face forward toward the ground. She couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being in a natural horse position, and instead kicked at the ground, leaping backwards and settling on top of her hooves, her arms swinging around her as she regained balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra height nauseated her, and the tattered remains of her pants still wrapped around her legs threatened to trip her. Her stance widened as her legs moved to the sides of her massive butt, pulling at the pants until a good kick tore it to scraps which fell to her hooves. She could only watch in silent horror as new muscle definitions spread across her legs, and then bulged into fine highlights. Her now slender legs looked more powerful than ever. She carefully placed a hand on her flank and could feel the promise of coiled strength\u2026 not something usually felt in a butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to wonder if this was where the changes would end. If it was over\u2026 she could have the tail removed\u2026 surgery on the legs\u2026 for her feet\u2026 maybe something prosthetic? Her lengthening spine\u2026 she had no idea if it would stop. Her shirt was still slowly moving upward over her belly. It itched now, and she scratched at it without thought. Her belly felt\u2026 furry. She moaned as she looked down to see a dark, muddy brown hair covering her navel. It spread across her abdomen like a field of grass in the wind. Beneath it, she could feel her skin becoming hard and tough. Leathery. Her legs were covered in it soon, and she felt it moving up her chest; her arms; her face\u2026 No, her changes were not nearly done. She suddenly understood that her normal life was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest billowed out, still rising from her legs. Now it was her shirt that faced the fury of the curse. The top two buttons popped off instantly and her bra was revealed for the entire world to see, a bra which no longer had breasts to conceal. Her arms slid forward, tearing the back of the shirt, and still her chest grew. Her belly grew plump and heavy, removing most of the remaining buttons. Her haunches exploded with muscle, no longer a miniature version, but fitting of a full grown horse. Her spine twisted to realign itself with it and she felt herself falling again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on all fours; her arms seemed to fly out from her to meet the ground.  She shook her head violently as her own nose came into view, her skull creaking and groaning as a thick muzzle grew from her. Her cheeks and jowls fattened, inflating, her neck rising from her body, a statue of finely sculpted muscle. Her chest thrust forward, freeing itself from the futile confines of her shirt, now also in pieces on the ground. She winced as her eyes were shoved to the side by her still growing muzzle, her teeth reforming and her lips growing fat and leathery. Her nostrils flattened and flared visibly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an arm into the air, and it seemed to move away from her, muscles growing and pushing it away like the pistons of a terrible machine. She gasped as her hand fell off. Or, rather, stretched fast enough to appear to do so. In a short time, her fingers had given way to a second set of hooves. Tears rolled from the giant pools that were now her eyes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHer neck, her chest, her arms, her legs, her face\u2026 they all thickened as one now. Her head fell to the ground as she stared forward, her chest heaving with enormous lungs, as she watched the last changes: she saw her hair, once soft and smooth, turn dark and rough like her tail.</span></div></div>",

When she finished changing, her muscles seemed to tense up a few times trying to get used to the sudden change in appearance. \"O-ow..'' She said clinching her eyes together till the changing seemed to finish. Because of the pain of changing, she seemed to forget about the boar that was circling her. He was now two feet taller then herself and much more stronger then her it seemed. The changing had zapped her energy causing her to even be lucky to be standing, her legs shaking where she stood. She braced her legs, which were amazingly supporting her off the ground, and she panted trying to find the energy to run or scream or something. Her ears seemed to react as the boar let out his own grumble sound and that caught the female's attention. She gasped and turned to see him positioned right behind her with a look of lust on his face. Melissa's body shook in fear as she tried to get away, but the boar picked up on this and started to move closer and closer to the female. Licking his lips, his tucks seemed to curl over his nose, but when he reached the female he pressed his snout to the female. When he pushed in deep enough, taking in the scent of the female pig's sweet mating glands, Melissa let out a squeal in reaction to having her crotched being touched. Taking in the scents, the mating system of the male began to go on over drive as his cock began to become errected and full in view under him. Pushing his body against the female pig, he managed to push his upper body on the back of small pink pig and possitioned himself ready to mate at the right moment. Melissa's body tightened up, trying to refuse the male to mate, or hopping something would help her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Melissa approached the barn, she noticed all the cows were lined up for their morning milking.  She figured she could be a help in getting all the cows into the barn and connected to the milking machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Melissa watched she absently scratched her lower abdomen. She felt a bit of something at the base of her spine. She hooked her thumbs in the waistband of her jeans and adjusted her clothing. That seemed to easy the slight discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Melissa was struck but a sudden headache. It was almost as if someone had shot a thunderbolt through each temple. The pain caused her to almost loose consciousness. Melissa casually chewed her gum and felt a general contentment after the blast of pain. She actually gave it no further thought. She failed to realize that she hadn\u2019t been chewing any gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the first set of cows into the milking machines, Melissa took a seat on a nearby stool.  She figured she would try milking a cow by hand, the old-fashioned way, and compare that to the automatic machine.  As she was sitting on the stool she noticed that her jeans felt uncomfortably tight across her stomach, but figured it was due to her current posture. The cow\u2019s tail kept getting in the way, and Melissa almost had to bat it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished the milking, Melissa stood, set the stool aside and turned to take the bucket away. She still noticed the tightness of the jeans across the abdomen and fumbled with the button and zipper as she took a couple of steps. The cow\u2019s tail caught her arm a glancing blow and she made to bat it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa suddenly realized she was a good six feet from the cow and the tail couldn\u2019t possibly have come from that source. In the same instant, she heard a ripping sound and looked down. The sight that met her eyes was almost as staggering as the earlier blast of pain had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jeans had split along each leg. Legs that had somehow gained size and muscle since her last inspection that morning. She noticed a bovine tail swishing near one leg and tracked it to its source - the base of her own spine! Just then, the jeans opened up and what could only be described as an under-developed udder fell forward and down, easing the tightness of the jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026what is happening to me?\u201d she gasped. She started to raise a hand to her forehead, but saw that the hand had only three finger, all black, and all as hard as if covered totally by a single nail on each. She then noticed a fine furry down on her arms. A furry down in a familiar black-and-white randomness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmigod,\u201d she gasped again. \u201cI\u2019m turning into a cow? How? Why? This is impossible.\u201d <br>\r\nMelissa felt her ears moving independently and as if hinged, she knew they now stood out on either side of her head. Her arms and torso began putting on bulk, as her chest expanded, her breasts were absorbed until her chest was as flat as when she was a little girl. With a last ripping blast her jeans fell away, followed by her destroyed panties. Her expanding chest destroyed the red blouse she had so carefully tied under her breasts that morning and the bra beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to run but found that she could barely balance on her now hooved feet. The bucket of milk fell from a hand that could no longer grasp it, but it went unnoticed. Great clumps of Melissa\u2019s beautiful, below-the-shoulder hair fell to the ground of their own accord. The wind blew away the hair and the tattered rags of Melissa\u2019s clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe over-balancing became too much and Melissa fell to all fours. Not hands and knees, but to all four hooves. Her spine and pelvis cracked and shifted position. She would never walk upright on two feet again. She tried to call for help but only a lowing and a bawling of a young heifer could be heard.</span></div></div>",

Animals have provided you with such pleasures, but you did not raise and care for these animals.  You only enjoy the benefits of their hard work and sacrifice. Perhaps all of you need to spend some time and learn what these animals go through.  Maybe once you have been sheared, given milk, pulled a plow, or provided someone with companionship, you will have a greater respect for these animals\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the spirit blows a powder over all the family members.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each of you will randomly transform into different animals that serve or provide for humans and you will remain in that form until you have fulfilled their purpose.  Perhaps this way each of you can learn the roles that each animal serves\"  Then the spirit disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family is shocked by the apparition and the supposed curse, but they continue to eat their meal.  After dinner everyone washes up and prepares for bed.  By the following morning they all had forgotten about the curse placed upon them.<br>\r\n</td>",
