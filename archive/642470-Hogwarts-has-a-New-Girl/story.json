Carmel colored eyes and shoulder length nearly black hair. Transfer from a small school in Arkansas. Professor Lupin's daughter. She can turn at will into a wolf, because she is part werewolf (she's an animagi). She is a pure-blood, and never mentions it. A very good Keeper on her old quidditch team and she has extraordinary magical talent, except when it comes to Herbology. Somehow both Harry and Malfoy are attracted to her. She befriends everyone in her house(Gryffindor), and become's especially close to Harry, causing sparks to fly (romantically speaking)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdriana O'Connel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunningly beatiful, stuck up, rich, pure-blood Slytherin. She has long auburn curls and shocking teal eyes. Doesen't have extraordinary talent for anything except potions. She likes Malfoy and only associate's with rich pure-bloods. Until she meets Fred Weasley (and forgets that she's rich and has a crush on Draco). She is semi-evil and she's from Russsia. Befriends Pansy Parkinson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren Johnson<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShort, hot-tempered yet patient Hufflepuff. She has short red hair and she's from Ireland. She is slightly bossy and ditzy. Amazing talent for Divination. She completley steals Malfoy's heart even if she's a mudblood. End's up as Ginny's best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney Donson<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty girl with long jet-black hair and blue eyes. She's a half-blood Ravenclaw who was a beater on her old Quidditch team in Germany. She is distantly related to Harry. She ends up being Harry, Ron, and Hermoine's best friends. She falls head over heels in love with Oliver Wood. Amazing at Herbology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who do you wanna be? </span></div></div>",

Did I skip anythiiiiinnngg\" You say as your clumsiness takes over as you go to sit down and you miss the chair. They all start laughing. Harry offers you his hand to help you up and your eyes lock. It was like you could get lost in his eyes. He was looking into yours in the same way. \"whoa\" you say as you stand up and this time hit your target, the chair. Hermoine and Ron are sniggering, but you have a feeling that it wasn't because you fell. You really think Harry is cute. What happens next</span></div></div>",

He takes your hand and pulls you in front of a portrait. \"Blood is stupid\" the portrait swings open. That was the new password. You both go in. You are extremely tired and head off to bed. You wake up an hour later, ubable to sleep because of the full moon. You climb downstairs and go out onto the grounds and let yourself turn into the beautiful white wolf you had been part of since you were born. You let out a long howl and run around for awhile. The moon starts to shrink below the horizon and you ease back into your human form. The night was still young, but if you stayed like this too long, bad things could happen. You go back into the common room and sit on the couch. Or not the couch. You fall backwards when you realized you sat on someone, not the couch. You felt arms catch your shoulders. \"What were you doing outside, there was a wolf out there, you could have gotten hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you tell him</span></div></div>",

Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns red and grins wider.

But despite the cheery atmosphere, something troubling you is settled in the back of your mind: how are you going to tell them what has happened, that you are in Gryffindor, that you've fallen in love with a poor blood traitor? You shake your head vigorously, trying to get the thought out. As far as you were concerned, you didn't care what Fred's status was. At that moment, he looks curiously at you. \"You ok Adriana?\" he asks. \"Yes, I'm fine, I probably just need some rest.\" you say, and he nods. \"Very well, you need your beauty sleep\" he grins, and you giggle. With that, you walk up to the girls dorm and fall into sleep as soon as your head hits the pillow... you see your parents' faces, red with anger and humiliation, they've just found out what house you are in, who you were kissing, what future lies ahead for you.
