Today was his 13th birthday and for this milestone event, his father decided to unveil the latest renovations to his sons playroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is son, in the middle of this playroom is a city currently inhabited by over one million people. The population consists mainly of the lower class and common criminals, so you needn't be too careful. Our ties with government organizations and the small size of this city shouldn't make it too hard to replace in case of any damage, so you shouldn't feel too bad if things get a little hectic. So, what do you think? Do you like it?\" Mark asked, already knowing the answer from the glow of happiness on his sons face. Without much free time to devote to his only child, Mark was hoping he finally found a way to keep his son entertained while he was at work. When the government was looking for a way to reduce unemployment and crime rates, Mark knew he found his solution. Proposing his recently banned ShrinkSnap, Mark convinced the government that his low-cost technology was the best way to manage the countries undesirable population. Five years later, his son was gifted the greatest gif any thirteen year old boy could ever ask for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH DO I! I can't wait to have Cody over! He isn't even gonna believe me when I tell him!\" Anthony exclaimed, still unable to hold back his enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can always have him over tonight when we cut your birthday cake, but for now, you should probably start getting ready for your soccer practice, the driver is gonna be bringing you in 15 minutes.\" Mark told his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you would bring me sometime dad, I know you're busy and all but I can't even remember the last time you came to a soccer event!\" Anthony knew that his dad had to work extra hard to ensure the success of his company, and although this success made Anthony wealthier than almost all his friends, he also wished he would be able to spend more time with his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sport, I promise, once I finish with this government contract, I'll come to every other game of this season! Promise!\" Mark promised his young son even though he knew it was a promise he would surely break. The sad truth is Mark was a business man, and as much as he loved his son, his business came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing, I am gonna leave you the only civillian model of the ShrinkSnap ever made. This is NOT a toy! You coyld use it if ever you want to make the city bigger or smaller but remember the serious harm that could come about if you use it in the wrong way! At the right size, anything will pop like a bug! Now go get ready for practice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Anthony went off to his soccer practice with the driver. After practice, his friend Cody came over for a sleep over. Mark implored that Anthony not tell Cody about the playroom until after the birthday cake, as he was on a limited time schedule and had to be back at work within the hour. After the cake, and a thoughtful little gift from Cody, Anthony was barely able to contain his excitement anymore. He asked Cody if he wanted to see his new gameroom, to which he immediately agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doors the the newly constructed play area opened, Cody couldn't help but notice the gigantic lego city in the middle of the room. He curiously approached the Lego city before he came to a strange realization. The more he examined the city, the more clear it became that this was not made from Legos. Before he could even say anything he noticed a tiny movement on the top of one of the taller buildings. Upon further examination, he made out was clearly a tiny human, barely more than half an inch tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a state of complete disbelief, Cody turns to his friend and says...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We are literally like gods to these people!\" Cody shouted out, clearly fascinated by the sight before his eyes. \"You're so lucky! I wish my parents would get me something this awesome!\" Anthony looked down at the floor in contempt. Although he was fairly certain that no one else in the world had this \"playset\" it still didn't substitute having his father around to actually spend time with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well it is pretty cool. What do you wanna do now?\" Anthony replied, trying to hide his sadness from his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo excited to notice his friends bummed out mood, Cody asks \"Can we pretend to be giants and stomp through the city? I've always liked Godzilla and it would be so cool to destroy our own tiny city!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but don't you think we should get ready for bed first? We wouldn't wanna stain our soccer uniform in case things get a little out of control!\" Anthony suggested, not wanting to explain to coach all the blood stains that would be on his kit after the massacre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing to this, both boys went to get their pyjamas on. Both boys, being on the same team, had no qualms about changing together. They both went into Anthonys bedroom to get out of their soccer uniforms. As they took off their shoes, the effects of soccer practice clearly invaded the oxygen supply in the room. Both boys turned to each other with a sour face. \"Man, practice was tough today!\" Cody laughed as he proceeded to remove his socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony did the same, but instead of just throwing the sock on the floor, he lifted it to his nose to get the full idea of his foot stench. The moment the smell entered his nose, he swore his could feel all his little nose hairs slowly decomposing. \"Oh my god that is fucking gross!\" Anthony recoiled in disgust. \"Coach should take it a little easier on us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys finished changing and went back to the playroom, clad only in pairs of pyjama shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, you ready to make our entrance?\" Anthony asked his friend, eager to try out his new toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready as ever!\" Cody replied, before opening the grand door to the newly renovated play room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys entered the room, they wasted no time getting to the main attraction. Making sure to put extra emphasis on their footfalls, the giant preteens arrived to the edge of the city and stared down with a mischievous grin. Cody \"kicked off\" the fun when he looked down at his feet and noticed a tiny car trying to dodge the massive appendages. Without any second thought, Cody swings foward his leg rather rapidly towards the shrunken car...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DRIVER POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on your way to your new job when off in the distance, you could see two young teen boys making their way over to the city. You came to this city about 3 years ago, after losing your job and having your house repossessed. Not putting much thought into your future at such a tiny size, you quickly hoped on board with idea. The thought of never having to struggle financially, and providing a great life for your family, was more than enough for you to pack up your family and move over to the shrunken metropolis. Looking over in the horizon now though, you should have known that this city had a more sinister intent. Pulling your handbrake and turning your real as fast as you can, trying the flee the scene before the giant boys spotted you. Amidst all the panic however, you only manage to catch the boys attention even more. Looking in the rear view mirror, you can only watch in fear as a plump foot the size of a city block itself slowly creeps up from behind you. In a last minute attempt to save yourself, you decide to jump from the car, despite the current 100 mph you are currently traveling at. Opening the door, you decide it's now or never and make the jump. Eyes closed, you eject yourself from the car and hear the sound of metal compacting behind you. Surprisingly, you aren't injured at all. In fact, you don't even remember falling! Opening your eyes to deduce how you even survived such an event, you fall to the floor in horror when you find yourself standing on a huge, flesh colored plateau. You must have landed on the boys foot! Looking down, you see that the fall from here would be enough to break your legs for sure. You tried to look for an escape, but at this height, you were fairly sure you were stuck here. And then the smell hit you. At your size, the odor from one boys foot was akin to the entire locker room changing at once! The unnatural odor slowly made its way through your nostrils, slowly invading all your senses. Knowing that there was nothing you could do in your current situation, you just layed in defeat, cursing yourself for every agreeing to this weird experiment. You may have been the first victim today, but you knew you wouldn't be the last. With no other solution you call the police in a panic, hoping they may be able to get this under control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boys POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's foot made quick work of the tiny car. With one swift kick, he sent the car flying across the city before it impacted into a small building of about three floors on the opposite end of town. The impact of the car, while not enough to tear down the building completely, certainly was enough to create a decent sized hole in the infrastructure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody couldn't believe the sheer amount of power he had over this doomed city. Only determined to do more damage, he finally steps over the border of the city and places his first foot in the city limits. Placing his foot down with a satisfied crunch, he notices his foot landing on a tiny Chevrolet dealership. Placing his other foot in the lot, he made short work of the dealership, making sure to crush every last car on the lot. The metal was no match for his young soles, as every car quickly quickly compressed under the weigh of the gargantuan boy. \"Might wanna recheck the roof safety value on those cars!\" Cody laughed, eager to try leveling more satisfying targets. Too bad it was night time, Cody was eager to stomp out any car salesmen too! Done with the car dealer, he slowly made his way further into the city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony could only watch in awe as his friend revealed a side he hadn't previously known. Although his friend did always enjoy snuffing bugs out under his feet, Anthony never thought he would be capable of doing this to actual people. Seeing his friend dominating the miniscule city down below made him feel a strange tugging in his shorts that he never felt before. Looking over at Cody's glistening body, making short work of the vehicles at his feet, Anthony decided he...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wanted in on this action! \"Wait for me!\" Anthony called out to his friend as he jumped onto the city streets, the ball of his soft foot landing on a city bus on his way in. Anthony jumped up in pain, the feeling akin to stepping on a Lego. The sudden, unexpected movement caused Anthony to lose his balance and fall onto a building down below. \"Ow! Fuck!\" Anthony screamed as his bubble butt landed on the 6-story apartment complex down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this moment, the city down below was in pandemonium. Everyone walking down Main street could only watch in horror as a giant young boy, no older than 13, approached from the horizon. People were flooding the streets in swarms, evacuating buildings, and warning loved ones by telephone about the incoming danger. Though the tiny inhabitants were used to seeing giant scientist and the like, they knew these boys for here for much darker reasons. As the boy approached the area where the hardwood floors met the the concrete city streets, his presence became much more disheartening to the people down below. The ground began to shake, as if the area was just about to be devastated by an earthquake of a large scale. Coffee mugs and microwaves began flying off peoples counters and soon, even people who were fast asleep were checking their windows to see what the cause of all this commotion was. The moment people saw the massive bare feet approaching the city, they immediately evacuated their families and ran for their cars. Onlookers on the street watched as the giant took his first step into the city. Unfortunately, a bus filled with people happened to be right in the trajectory of his foot fall. People were mortified as they watched the giant foot descend on the defenseless city bus. Though it all happened in an instant, it seemed like an eternity passed before  the pudgy boy foot completely wiped the bus out of existence. The scarier part was yet to come however, as the boy yelped in pain, and proceeded to fall backwards, onto a residential apartment building. The building stood no match for the giant, toned butt, quickly succumbing to the equivalent of a fuck ton of pounds in their now incredibly minute scale. The people who didn't evacuate the building in time had no prior warning before the enormous, short clad bubble butt eliminated them from the gene pool. It was clear to the people down below that these two boys were quite active, as they were very lean and barely had an ounce of fat on their smooth bodies. They also left a strong aroma in the city air, with the air quickly clouding with the smell of pre-pubescent pheromones and summer sports. Most people were long gone but a few people stuck around to see what sort of damage this young colossus caused. As the boy was out on his ass, he brought his normal sized bare sole to his face, looking to see what he stepped on that hurt so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I stepped on a bus!\" Anthony yelled out to his friend, peeling the scrap of metal off his delicate sole. He could make out a faint squelching noise as he broke the adhesion his sweat and the blood of innocents made to his grimy foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you're such a pussy! I stepped on a whole parking lot just before!\" Cody teased his friend, just as he spotted his own tiny bus making its way away from the two boys raw feet. Without second thought, he brought his massive sole down on the bus just to emphasize how much of a pussy his friend was. To his surprise, however, the boxy shape of the bus did prove to be a more damaging opponent than the standard automobile. He too yelped in pain, although always having cat-like reflexes, he managed to keep his balance. \"Alright, that did hurt, but you still suck!\" Cody continued, not letting his friend have the satisfaction on winning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony got up from the pile of debris and promptly dusted himself off. Despite the fact that his friend was three streets down, it took Anthony about 10 strides to catch up. Not wanting to deal with that pain again, he made sure to avoid any cars down on the road. Once Anthony caught up to his friend, they started their trek towards the large park at the center of the city. Despite Anthony's' caution to the city down below, people still found themselves in danger in the form of Cody. His giant, foul smelling feet made sure to crush absolutely everything in their path. From cars, to people, and especially cyclists, as they slid very nicely between his plump toes, no one was safe from the rampage fixated young boy. When they finally got to the park, they sat down in grass and decided on what to do next. That is when they decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was so fun in fact that both boys needed some rest at this point and sat on the park, unknowing that these little people was still playing until they took some amount of space majority.  It was good to take a breather and have some fresh air it seems realistic when feeling it this way.  It would take some time before Anthony had to figure things out and found a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay Cody, do you think it should fun if we could have a wrestling match right now?\u201d  Anthony had some thoughts about this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo like Godzilla vs King Kong type of thing?\u201d  Cody wondered before he receive a nod from his best friend, and that\u2019s when he smiled and nodded in reply.  \u201cAlright, I like the sound of that!  I\u2019m sure I\u2019m gonna beat you down so easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, tough talk eh?\u201d  That made Anthony smirked and stood up like he is firing it up.  \u201cWell let\u2019s see about that then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that, Cody followed suit and stood up to get themselves ready for a wrestling match between two gigantic monster in the miniature city.

This place will still be here tomorrow.\" Anthony sleepily agreed with his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure thing.\" The boys got up from the small patch of grass that barely contained their massive bodies, when Anthony hatched up a brilliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cody, what if we brought our sleeping bags out to this park and crashed here for the night?\" Anthony suggested to his friend, curious as to what would happen overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be cool, if we weren't almost twice as big as their puny park!\" Cody replied, looking down at his massive bare feet, trying to draw an exact comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lucky for us, my dad left me a ShrinkSnap that we could use to make ourselves small enough to fit in the park! We'll still tower over everyone, but at least we won't have to worry about waking up every time we roll over a building!\" Anthony exclaimed before grabbing his friend by the wrist and guiding him out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny residents watched defenslessly as the two giant boys whoses faces have been lighting up local news for the past hour began their overhead. People ran in fear as the temperatures began to rise with the heat emanating from the ripe, pungent boy feet.<br>\r\nDespite their best efforts, the people down below were helpless as the mighty sole claimed many, washing their existences away with a river of salty foot sweat. The most unlucky, however, were those who were caught between the massive walls of flesh that were the gaps between the boys toes. They were instantly buried alive in the mounds of toe-jam between their active toes, with just enough air to keep them from dying and just enough pressure to keep them from moving. The odor was intolerable here, but the residents were forced to endure it until their newfound gods finally decided to have a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLargely unconcerned with the wet pops beneath his slimy soles, Cody followed his friend until they stood on the edge of the cityscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just wait right here. I'm just gonna go grab the sleeping bags. I'll be right back.\" Anthony told his friend before running out of the room to complete his task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody has a look around the playroom while his friend is off getting their sleeping bag. He knew Anthony for most of his life and Anthony's house has sorta always been the designated chill space. Being richer than all the other already pretty wealthy kids, Anthony always had the coolest toys and the newest Lego sets. All these years later, who would have thought that he would even have a full city to play with as well. While, looking through all the other goodies, Cody notices a device that looks like a camera sitting on the computer desk. Curious, he walks over and picks it up. Upon further examination, he could make out the ShrinkSnap logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! He actually has one! Oh man! This is so cool!\" Before Cody could really examine it, he hears his friends voice call out \"Alright, I brought the sleeping bags and my tablet so we could watch a movie. I also brough some snacks......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody drowned out his friends voice as he was only able to think of the power he currently held in his hand. With this device, he was pretty much a god of size. He could make any living thing as big or as small as he wanted! Having only a split second to react before Anthony returns, Cody decides to use this new-found power to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, he could see his surroundings. The sleeping bags Anthony had brought in were now on top of him. He realized this, and couldn't believe that Cody had shrunken him like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony managed to find his way out from the sleeping bag and got a look at his surroundings. He couldn't believe how big the room was! He looked back at the micro city. He wasn't as small as the citizens, but he wasn't that much bigger either. He had to be around 2  inches tall. That's when he heard Cody's footsteps, which sounded more like booms to him. Anthony turned around and saw his gigantic friend smiling down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was amazed at how well the device had worked. He had shrunk his friend down to 2 inches tall!

The floor below shook as the stinky-footed giant made his way over. When the massive feet were close enough for the terrified bug boy to taste their odor, the much larger boy smiled down at his tiny friend and dictates his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, as cool as it is, having a tiny city under your control... it feels a little impersonal\" Cody says, as his giant toes slowly creep over the bug below him. \"I don't know any of these people down below, it's easy to bend them. Turning you into my own little slave however, that'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody brings his foot down, sure to trap his between his big and second toe. As Anthony is battling the mountains of toe cheese and the distinct odor of boy feet, he is in complete disbelief that his own best friend can put him through this! \"CODY YOU ASSHOLE! TURN ME BACK! THIS IS MY HOUSE AND MY TOY! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT YOU----\" before he could finish, Cody clenched his toes, squeezing all the lint and dead skin accumulated from the earlier soccer match right into his unprepared mouth. As Anthony chokes on the vile creation, Cody laughs hysterically up above at the misfortune caused by a slight twitch of his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww man, kinda seems like I have every right, when me simply clenching my toes has that much power over you!\" Cody taunted his tiny friend, still grinding him into the sludgy concoction between his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, it's no secret that you kinda want this too. I saw you checking me out earlier. Mitch always thought you were a fag, but you confirmed it just before.\" Cody said down with a cocky smirk.

If you keep being a disobedient fuck, you'll be coming as a stain under my superior sole, got that, bug?\" Not even caring for an answer, Cody just continues laying down his law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for starters, I don't want my little slave to be so weak and scrawny!

Anthony knew how bad they were then and thought it could only be worse at his size. Slowly he was moved towards the pit. The hair dripped with sweat and the odor getting exponentially worse as he approached. Struggling once more Anthony wanted Cody to drop him. He would rather die than go into that armpit. However no matter how much he struggled nothing could be down. Cody began to laugh hysterically as his friend made contact with his sweaty armpit. Rubbing him around like deodorant, he forced sweat into every inch of Anthony. To Anthony it was pure torture. The terrible odor caused him to gag and almost vomit. The pressure Cody put on him forced him to swallow some of the pit sweat. Every sense was being assaulted from the terrible pit. After what seemed like an eternity. Cody removed his friend and set him back on the floor. Anthony looked as if he just went swimming. Once freed, Anthony gasped for clean air.

Immediately the tinies are frozen in fear as they stare at the foot above. Sweat begins to drip down causes some of the tinies to gag as it hits them. Cody slowly lowers his foot down, as he increases the weight he can feel their struggles against his sticky soles. To the littles it was hell, the smell of post-practice feet assaulted them. Many gagging and passing out from the horrid stench alone. As Cody increased the pressure, they began to pop under his foot. Cody felt amazing, lifting his foot back up he admired his work.

His massive feet bulldozing all the in the path. Soon the giant feet stop as sweat drips off pooling nearby. The smell of Anthony's feet is not as bad as Cody's however it isn't pleasant either. Tinies cover their nose as they flee the rancid feet, the smell so strong it causes their eyes to water. A few are completely incapacitated from the terrible odor, prone in the street fighting against the miasma flowing through their streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody continues his rampage. He has designed a new torture for them. Digging out a small hole in the park he begins to collect fleeing tinies. The walls deep enough that none are able to escape. The tinies fearing for their lives as they are trapped in the earthen prison. Soon Cody is happy with the 50+ caught, standing to his full height he stares at the struggling tinies. The fear in their eyes only amplifies the fun he is having. Heaving up a loogie, he spits it into the hole. The mucus lands on a few tinies trapping them in the terrible fluid. The other tinies try to help free the trapped people only to become caught themselves. Soon everyone watches in horror as the trapped humans slowly drown in the teen's spit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody couldn't stop laughing at the humiliation he was causing, however if they thought a little spit was bad, they have no idea what was coming next.

Cody chuckled before Anthony laughed too, pointing to his friend's rancid pits. \"Dude that's nasty, i mean that's cruel even for you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging his broadening shoulders, Cody knelt down, towering over the city as he pulled off his shirt, revealing his smooth, flat teenage stomach, some tinies looked up in awe before he lifted his arm, revealing the handful of hairs sprouting within his glistening sweaty pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny people that were trying to help their fellow tinies out of the pit turned and ran as fast as they could as the giant teenager licked his lips and leaned down, exposing his armpit to the city before moaning a little as he knocked over some buildings with his extended elbow and placed his armpit over the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the hole, all hell broke loose, those that were still struggling at the surface of the rancid spit pool watched in terror as the 'sun' became dark as the giant boy's arm loomed over them, before the smell hit them. Many gagged and some, in their desperation, dived down into the spit to try to get free of the powerful, unwashed stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody meanwhile was having a blast, just laying down, flexing his long toes near the feet of his best friend, whole Anthony was laughing and enjoying himself too before Cody chuckled slightly before moving his armpit slightly and pressing it down into the hole \"Come on little bugs, be useful to your new Gods, lick my pits\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do?</span></div></div>",

Cody giggled as Anthony's toes entered the hole and touched the bottom, feeling a couple of the tiny helpless people inside being smeared against his big toes. \"This is so cool, hey bugs, start worshiping my toes, NOW:, Anthony boomed down into the hole, causing some of the sweat-soaked earth to collapse into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the hole, a small group of teens had been breathing through their t-shirts and not been touching the giant armpit above them. \"We have to get out of here\". one of the boys screams before they screamed in terror as the gigantic toes entered the hole and the two oldest teens were caught beneath Anthony's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey screamed for a moment before they were crushed by the toes and everyone inside the hole was bathed in a fresh, intense scent of musky, unwashed teenage boy toes. \"Oh god, that stinks, I'm gonna be sick\".

I never knew these are real humans in this tiny little city.\u201d  Cody was astonishingly shocked to learn what he saw when seeing up close to the buildings and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!  Everything you see here are all real, and can be replaced if any damage happens, so it\u2019s a fun thing to look at.\u201d  Anthony replied, whilst he was delighted to hear his best friend\u2019s reaction of this new playroom, he couldn\u2019t wait to experience something his Dad made just for him to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tell ya, these puny people are so lucky.  I wish wanna be just like them and explore being little for a while.\u201d  That\u2019s when Cody had this great thought and could imagine himself being amongst those people in this miniaturised city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Anthony was concerned, he was deeply surprised to hear what Cody had wished for.  But luckily, his Dad left the ShrinkSnap for him to try things too, and responded to his best friend with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat can be arranged, since I got this device just about here.\u201d  Anthony says and shows the remote device right in front of him.  \u201cWe should get changed to our pajamas first before we can do make this happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I think I\u2019ll be okay being like this.\u201d  Cody responded when he decides to make an idea.  \u201cHow about we can play hide and seek.  When you go out and get changed, I\u2019ll shrink myself down to size and hide somewhere around this city, so you can find me from there.\u201d  That would be his idea, which Anthony seems to be impressed by this particular idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try that then!  So get ready while I\u2019ll be right back, mini you!\u201d  Anthony joked and walked out of the room and closed the door from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Cody though, he couldn\u2019t wait to get started and takes a look at the device in hand.  He wouldn\u2019t believe at this point things can be real, but whatever happened to this city or more would surely be a true reality and takes deep breaths before triggered the device on himself.  It wouldn\u2019t take long to feel the effects, and it so happens when Cody had started to shrink down and was now the size like the rest of these people in miniature city in all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!  This looks so cool!  A youngster couldn\u2019t believe it in shock and walked through the streets to see the busy looking city flowing through.  Everything seems real!  Even the people looked real when being spoken to in greeting.  \u201cMan, I\u2019m sure Anthony had the best birthday he can ever have.  Speaking of that, I better hide and wait for my friend to come and find me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody nearly forgot about that, and so he had to take a run and explore to see where\u2019s the best place to be hidden, so that he wanted to make this a surprise.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Thirteen year-old Anthony is your average North American kid. At 5 feet 4, he isn't all that tall, but he isn't too short. With his long blond hair and bright green eyes, he has that typical surfer boy charm found in most coastal California kids his age. The one thing that separated him from the rest of the population however, was his not so normal life at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony's father, Mark, was the CEO of a big Silicon Valley tech firm, meaning that he rarely spent any time with his son. Due to the fact his wife passed during childbirth, Anthony spent most of his life under nanny supervision. This was okay at first, but as Anthony grew to be more mischevious, many nannies refuse to work for the family anymore. Despite all this, Anthony normally does pretty good at caring for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong searching for a way to keep Anthony distracted from the complications that arise from his own lack of time, Mark figured the perfect solution to his problem when he finished working on one of his products five years back. ShrinkSnap, a fully functioning shrink ray shaped like a common camera, was a way to shrink humans down to rather minute sizes in order to engage in escapades normally unthinkable to the common mind. In spite of the ad campaign demonstrating a product that was virtually harmless, with commercials featuring a giant boy watching his friends ski down an ice cream sundae, the ATF quickly considered the ShrinkSnap to be far too dangerous for public use and banned its civillian use. Despite this, the product was quickly adopted for use within government ranks and was used to manage the undesirable population. Among the ShrinkSnap's success, Mark started another company where he would take care of people who the ShrinkSnap were used on. The people would be held in a miniature city in the playroom of his multi-miliion dollar mansion. A city which was oddly erected on the day of his sons 13th birthday. This is where the story begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTLDR: 13 year old boy has a miniature city in his playroom complete with tiny people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES: Not much of a conformist although there will be some basic rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Firstly, keep interactions all male. You don't have to make Anthony gay but there will certainly be no girls in this playroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, no one-liners. If I wanted to read one sentence at a time, I'd hit up my local elementary school. This is writing.com and hence people should actually write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, I won't be hating on people who misspell or misuse words. Not everyone speaks English as a first language and I by no means seek to put down anyone's effort. The only thing I do ask however, is if you know English isn't your strongsuit, don't be afraid to use spellcheck, that is what it's there for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from that, add or don't add to your hearts content!<br>\r\n</td>",
