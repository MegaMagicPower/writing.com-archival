You then took of your coat and through it on the floor. Laying down you look up at the cieling glad to be home. It was getting late, and the only reason your mom let you out this late was because you were at you schools football game. <br>\r\n\"Damn how could this day get worse?\" You asked.<br>\r\nAs if in answer a book from your shelf above your bed hit you on the head. You rubbed you head and looked at the book.<br>\r\n\"Thats obviose\" You said picking up the book \"Naruto huh?\" <br>\r\nThe Manga was worn out from you reading it so many times. The cover was bending from you holding it open. You opened it to a page. Naruto was standing on top of the pole after getting back to the village hiden in the leafs.<br>\r\n\"Their lucky not having to deal with the problems of everyday life\" You said.<br>\r\nYou went back to the reason why this day sucked so bad. First of all made you come to her nail salon. Next you went to a fast food joint with your girlfriend, and then you had to pay for that. That you didn't mind but when a skinny, brown haired nerd accidently slipped spilling all his food on you that's what sucked. Your girlfriend was cracking up while trying to help you. Then you went to a game,and sat there for acouple hours just to see the team lose. But, worst of all you got into a fight with your girlfriend and SHE DUMPED YOU!! Got that was the finishing touch to your day.<br>\r\n\"I'll have to talk to her tomorrow\" You said while moving to your side and pulling the blanket up \"God I wish I could just leave all these problems behind me!!\"<br>\r\nYou turned off the light, and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow who's your girlfriend...</span></div></div>",

You look down and see pink hair laying on your chest.<br>\r\n\"What the Hell!!!\" You yell jumping out of the bed not caring about the girl on your chest.<br>\r\nShe groaned again and lift her head. She opened her eye's, and looked at you. Thats when you realized it was sakura from that manga you looked at before you went to bed.<br>\r\n\"Baby what's wrong?\" She asked \"did you have another nightmare?\"<br>\r\n\"Baby? Why are you in my bed?\" You asked.<br>\r\nShe raised an eye brow \"Are you okay?\" She asks \"I'm your girlfriend, remember I stayed the night last night?\"<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend?\" I said \"but...\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure your feeling all right?\" She asked while getting out of bed.<br>\r\nYou looked away almost beat red. She was only in her underwear. She looked over, and giggled.<br>\r\nShe walked over to you \"You don't have to blush,your in your underwear too\" She said smilling \"anyway I'll be at the Hokages place, so stop by\"<br>\r\nShe gave you a kiss, and started to get dressed. When you came back you realized that she was right you were in your underwear. You grabbed pants out of the closet and frantically put them on. She giggled again before walking to the door.<br>\r\n\"Bye baby\" She said.<br>\r\nAfter the pants were on you noticed she was gone and grabbed a shirt, and coat.<br>\r\nThis is nuts...whats going on? You thought too yourself. When you were dressed you decided that the best way to figure things out was to leave and talk to some one that might be able to tell you something. So you left... Bad Idea<br>\r\nYou didn't know where to go so...</span></div></div>",

Now I have to go to the hokage's mansion\".<br>\r\n            Then a light bulb went into your head \"Well...that sucks. But, since your going to the Hokage's Mansion I might as well accompany you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slept strangely that night. You dreamt of flying through a forest, leaping from tree to tree, laughing and having fun as two others your age chased you. One that was most prominent was one you knew as the shy Hinata Hyuuga. You knew this as a dream at that moment, but you didn't care. You enjoyed the time.<br>\r\nYou woke up the next morning, the memories of the dream already fuzzy and fading. You smiled, though, as the feeling of joy still filled you. You sat up and yawned, disturbing someone beside you. At first, you simply believed your girlfriend had spent the night with you, but as your mind finally threw off the shroud of sleep, you recognized the girl beside you, not as your ex, but as Hinata. Your eyes grew wide as you scrambled out of bed, except, you fell on the floor and hit your head. This got her awake and as you moaned in pain, she crawled overto look at you. <br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" She asked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes, but obviously concerned. <br>\r\nYour only response was \"Oowww...\" <br>\r\nThat made her giggle a bit before getting out of bed, revealing her navy blue bra and panties. She walked over to you and took the hand you currently had clamped on your head and moved it aside. You looked up to see the heiress of the Hyuugas, almost completely naked, caring for you. You simply sat there, stunned, as you tried to process what was happening. <br>\r\nHinata, meanwhile, was running her hand through your hair, smiling at you. You recovered enough to realize she seemed to be waiting for something from you. You, being the reserved guy you were, took her hand away from your hair. \"It's not that bad. You don't have to comb my hair apart to find it.\" You insisted. This elicited another giggle from her, which you were beginning to like. \"Well, you made such a big fuss over it, I figured you wanted the attention.\" She replied with amusement. <br>\r\nYou both went back and forth like that a few more times before she kissed you, which awoke something inside you. You slowly began remembering everything from the life before you woke up here... but also were gaining memories of your life here. Growing up as a ninja in training... Life in the Academy... Getting teamed up with Hinata and Shikamaru... Dating Hinata... All of these memories slowly came to you and more. You knew many jutsu, understood chakra control, and knew every tool you had and how to use it. <br>\r\nBy the time Hinata broke the kiss, you were only half done. You weren't paying attention when she went downstairs to make food. You stayed there for several more minutes, reconciling your new memories with our old ones. You struggled to work it all out, but the smell of food drifting up to you and your grumbling stomach make you set them aside to deal with the present. You looked around your room and spotted a dresser to one side of the room and you rummage through the drawers and found a decent outfit. You knew this to be your house, and these to be your clothes, still it took a bit to get used to everything. <br>\r\nOnce you were clothed, you went downstairs to find Hinata setting out plates and utensils. \"Your finally ready to eat?\" She asked, teasingly. You scoffed. \"I'm always ready for a good meal. I thought you knew that.\" From your new memories, you ate about as much as Choji did, but you actually trained enough to make use of all that food. \"Maybe... but you seemed to take longer than usual.\" She responded, a bit of concern showing. \"Well... I was thinking about some stuff.\" You stated.<br>\r\n\"Like?\" <br>\r\n\"Just memories. About the Academy... About the others...... About us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I remember when all of us first met at the Academy. Kami... I was so nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I believe we fixed that problem rather quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gosh... I remember that. You spent that whole month trying everything you could think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it was actually getting you to confront Naruto that finally broke your stutter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess it would have happened sooner or later anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think even after everything he did to get Sakura, he turns around and starts dating Ino. Ino, of all people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I never would have expected it. I felt kinda bad for him when they broke up, but they never seemed good together anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" <br>\r\nThe two of you drift off into silence to finish your meal. Going through your memories, you knew that originally, Hinata and Naruto got together at one point in the story, but you never really payed attention to that part of the story well, so it was kinda fuzzy. Still, you were dating her now, and if your new memories were anything to go by, you were a capable ninja and leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal was finished, you cleaned up and prepared for the day. Speaking of which... What was going on that day?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once everything was cleaned up from breakfast, you paused, a fresh memory of 'yesterday' appearing. \"Kurenai-sensei said we had a mission today, right?\" You asked, wanting to double check. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. She said it was B-ranked too, so hopefully it'll be interesting.\" Hinata confirmed. She gathered her things and gave you a kiss. \"I'm gonna stop by my house before meeting up with you, so my father knows everything's ok.\" She explained as she headed for the door. \"I'll see you later!\" She waved as she left.<br>\r\n\"By.\" You waved back as she left and headed back upstairs to grab your gear. You were ready within seconds and headed out the door soon after. Knowing Shikamaru, you headed straight for his usual place, your memories telling you he was always absent if you or Hinata didn't wake him up and make sure he actually got there. You found him sleeping in a tree, though how he did so comfortably was beyond you. <br>\r\nYou threw a kunai and cut off the branch he was laying on and watched with amusement a he woke with a yell. He landed on his back and took a second to get up, sleep not entirely banished from his body. \"Aw... Riku! Why'd it have to be you today? At least Hinata only shouts at me. Gah... So troublesome...\" He grumbled as he sat up and rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n\"You wanna know why I do it?\" You asked with an amused grin on your face. You only waited a second before answering. \"Cause you're a lazy ass who needs to get an alarm clock. You do remember we have a mission today, right?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" He sighed. \"What a drag.\" He slowly got up and stretched a bit. \"Well... Let me go get my stuff and I'll meet you guys there.\" He waved before sun-shining away. <br>\r\nYou left not long after, headed straight for the meeting point. Kurenai-sensei, who was your team's jounin teacher, was waiting for you when you arrived. \"3 minutes 48 seconds... That was slower than yesterday.\" She commented, having tracked you the second you left your house. \"Well, if Shikamaru would actually get up when he's supposed to, it wouldn't take me that long.\" You replied, fully aware that she had higher standards for you than she did the other two. You were always the first one to every meeting and were often early. You also had high academic scores and placed high in both combat tactics, and physical strength. It took a lot to take you down, and most of your fellow chunnin were worn out before you had even really begun. Kurenai often called on you for special training with herself or other jounins, much like you knew Naruto and Sasuke did in their team. Each new memory you gained of these experiences also seemed to give you strength. You could feel your body getting stronger with each memory of training you gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes after you arrived, Hinata walked up, waving. \"I'm here. Hey Riku.\" She called with a smile. Kurenai didn't say anything until Shikamaru arrived, which was another 5 minutes later. \"Nara... So you decided to join us. 5 minutes 57 seconds since your rude awakening. I believe that's a new record. You actually seem to be trying today. Lets hope you keep that up.\" She noted before handing you a scroll. \"Don't open that, no matter what.\" She demanded, just as you took hold of it. This immediately made you shove aside your curiosity as to its contents. \"Your mission is to ensure that scroll gets to the Raikage. You are to deliver it personally and return immediately after it is delivered. The route you'll be taking is known to be littered with bandit ambush sites and highwaymen, so be on your guard. Make sure you're prepared for the journey and bring plenty of medical supplies.\" That was all she said before dismissing you. <br>\r\nAs official team leader, you were given the map noting the route you were to take, and you were the one in charge of the scroll. You discussed this mission with the others for a bit, going over combat roles and suggestions for equipment before heading to the market. After a brief shopping trip and a few goodbyes to your friends, the three of you were off, out the gates and on your way.</span></div></div>",

You barely had enough time before the door bursted open and in walked a big breasted, blond haired women with a small diamond on her forehead \"Where have you been?!\" the women you reckognized as Tsunade asked \"You know I only get a small time off from work and you just decide to go and leave me waiting for you at the restaurant!!!!\"<br>\r\n                             You could practically see the steam coming out of her ears \"Woh why are you here?!\" you asked.<br>\r\n                             This seemed only to make her even angrier \"I am you girlfriend!!

Whats going on where am I?\" You asked more to yourself than to Tsunade<br>\r\n                             Tsunade put her finger on your forehead in a flicking manner \"You know I am so close to flicking you through that wall behind you!!\" Tsunade yelled \"Is that what you want?! Cause if it is keep acting stupid with me and I will gladly do it!\"<br>\r\n                             Your eyes went wide remembering her strength from the manga \"Okay...okay I am so sorry...uh baby\" You said raising your hands and shaking \"I'm sorry that I missed our date...I...uh...promise I'll make it up to you\"<br>\r\n                             She glared at you for a minute and then she took her fingers off your forehead. She crossed her arm's and started to think, and you figured that she was either thinking of the ways to hit you or what she could get out of you. She sighed \"fine...but you deffinetly owe me one baby\" Tsunade said kissing you \"and I think I'll take what I want at my office.<br>\r\n                             Tsunade turned around and for a second you could have sworn she purposly put a sway while she walked out the door. You fell to your knee's and sighed the biggest sigh you have ever sighed. While you were getting back to your brain you started to wonder why she became so calm all of a sudden. You could remember when your girlfriend in the real world got mad at you and it had taken alot of sorrys along with five boxes of chocolate. In which you still had to take to an expensive dinner. She must have something really bad in mind for you.<br>\r\n                             You put that in the back of the mind before you realized that you have to do something to figure out what has happened.
