Today was a Saturday, but today was also the day I was going to a new school. A boarding school to be more precise. That ment that I am living there for the next few years. I packed just enough to last about a two week stay, then I could wash my clothes afterward. After I got packed, I decided to change my outfit to make a better statement. I wore my blue shirt with stripes on it, my tan cargo pants, and my all black shoes. I grabbed the necklace that my dad gave me and put it on. It is a family heirloom. It wasn't very valuable, but it was to me. I grabbed the suitcase, and met my parents outside. My mom was crying, but she still managed. They drove me to my new school; Pokey High School, or PHS for short. It was really big than other boarding schools, but this one had many students attending. I walked out of the car, and we were greeted by the principal. He wore a strange red and blue suit, and a light blue tie. His hair was a strange blue tinted white, and was up in a goofy fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Taylor!\" said the man. \"I am the principal of PHS, but you can refer to me as Principal D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents talked to him while I gazed up at this magnificent school. The main gates almost looked golden, and had statues of strange creatures on top of them. They seemed rather familiar. My mom hugged me for the last time, and I shook hands with my dad. They drove off, and I followed Principal D inside. The inside was greater than the outside! The walls looked like they were completely made of marble. Although, I was quickly pushed into his office. He closed the door, and wiped his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That took longer than I have expected\" he said. \"Now I can switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I said anything, Principal D pressed a button on his watch. He became distorted, and then he changed shape. When it stopped, I couldn't believe my eyes. Standing in front of me, was a Deoxys! A living, breathing, Pokemon! His arms unfolded into tentacles and he slowly walked towards me. I was slightly scared, but thrilled at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then Taylor\" said Principal D.  \"What are you thinking right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am thinking that I have no clue what is going on!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable. After all, you are the only human here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PHS really stands for Pokemon High School. Pokemon gave been going to this school secretly for years. Although, some Pokemon are what you humans call...anthros. Here, we have a combination of school classes and popular Pokemon activities. But my question is this; Do you want to attend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wouldn't attend such a beautiful school\" I said. \"I don't care that I'm the only human here, I couldn't be happier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal D smiled as he floated over to the door. \"Very well then\" he said. \"Let me introduce you to your guide.\"</span></div></div>",

I couldnt help but to notice that the ends of his arms were longer as well. He stretched out his hand, and I shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor, I would like to introduce you to Steven\" said Principal D. \"He will be showing you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am honored to meet a human\" said Steven. His voice sounded very brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh believe me, the honor is all mine\" I said. I might have sounded a little too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal D gave me my schedule and a map of the school. He gave me a \"hand\" shake and we left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" started Steven, \"What's your first class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Geometry\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Zam is very intellectual. You might like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Zam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a Alakazam. He is possibly the smartest Pokemon in the entire school. I am his star pupil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for that class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Taylor, but today's Saturday. No learning classes today. Only Pokemon classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are Pokemon classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pokemon classes are battling and contests, as well as Pokemon sports and relays too. The weekends here are always filled with excitement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, looks like I do get a break on the weekends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I better show you to your dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven walked down a series of hallways, and passed though a weird-looking door. When I passed through it, the entire scenery changed. Everything now looked like something from a hotel. There was an elevator and everything! Steven grabbed my paper and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to your schedule\" said Steven, \"Your room is 12O.\" Steven smiled after he saw the room number. We got to the room, and I stopped. Steven handed me his rooms number before he left. I took in a deep breath, and put in the key. I went through the door, and saw my roommate.</span></div></div>",

She had a wide chest and wide hips. Her skin was dark blue, and her fur was white. She had a horn out of the right side of her face, long pointed tail, and claws on her hands and feet. She looked at me with the same possible reaction as me. A few minutes past, and I finally decided to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello\" I mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hi...\" she said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stook my hand out, \"I-I'm...T-Taylor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out and grabbed my hand. Her claws were kinda long, and her hand was slightly bigger than mine. \"My name is Zasha\" she said. Her voice seemed more calm this time. \"Might I ask what you are doing here human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman, there was that word, human. I felt kinda bad, and I was going to feel worse when I was supposed to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the new student here\" I responded. \"And this is where I am staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZasha looked shocked at this. \"You!? You're the new student!? What is a human doing here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now felt worse than I ever had. I just walked over to the empty bed, and sat down. I didn't expect anyone to actually like me here, although Steven was just about the only one. I fely a paw on my shoulder, and I looked up. I saw Zasha. She looked kinda worried now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" she said. \"I didn't mean to be offensive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine\" I replied. \"I thought this school was a normal school, that's why my parents signed me up for it. But when I got here, I found out that this place was a school for Pokemon. Then and there, I hoped that some Pokemon would be nice to me. Steven was already nice, so I thought that others would do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there are bound to be other students. I'm so sorry that I treated you a little unfairly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. We will get to know each other soon, since we are roommates. Although, I have never shared a room with a girl before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have never shared a room with a hu..I mean boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZasha was about to say human, but she didn't. I was glad she did not.</span></div></div>",

I noticed that Zasha had a dresser as well, but she wore no clothes. I also just noticed that she was skinnier than I have realized before. She looked at me, and I looked back at my suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably wondering why I have a dresser but I wear no clothes\" she said. \"Well, I will explain later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to unpack. I placed the bag full of my games beside the suitcase. I saw Zasha move closer. \"So, how old are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 16\" said Zasha. \"I recently turned 16 in March.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about to turn 16 in June. So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw her pick up my bag of games and grabbed a game out of it. I realized what it was, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They make a Pokemon game?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" I sighed. \"You see, to humans, Pokemon are not real. Pokemon are a video game, card series, and cartoon series. I have watched nearly all the episodes of the cartoon, and nearly own or have played every game known. That's one reason I was disliked in my old school. I was considered a nerd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems a little unfair. You seem like a nice kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But, everyone is kinda stereotypical. Once they find one thing about you that is embarrassing, they constantly make fun of you for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is harsh.\" Zasha kept looking at the game. \"So, is there anything in here about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know a lot about most Pokemon. Absols are Dark-type Pokemon that have the ability to sense natural disasters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it right so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although they can sense natural disasters, they are blamed for it. Absols usually go to the site of the disaster, and are mistakingly blamed for the cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a little offended by that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you are not the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished unpacking, and looked around the room again. There was a desk with a computer. I brought my laptop with me, so Zasha could use that one. There was also a small room for the bathroom. We heard some commotion outside, and someone knocked on the door. Zasha opened it, and a anthro Lopunny came in. She had just about the same body figure as Zasha. Her cream colored fur on her ears reached down farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zasha! The battle is about to start!\" said the Lopunny. Her voice was high. She reminded me of o cheerleader. She looked at me and tilted her head. \"Who's that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry\" said Zasha. \"Lily, this is Taylor. He is the new student here at PHS.\"</span></div></div>",

It felt really warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" she said. \"You are so adorable! Are all humans this cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" I was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily, I think you hugged him long enough\" said Zasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily put me down and blushed. I knew why. She was much bigger than me, so I looked like a doll to her. \"Sorry\" said Liliy. \"I get a little carried away sometimes. anyway, someone challenged someone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" asked Zasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily and Zasha ran out the door. I tried to run after them, but I ran into somebody. It was Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Steven\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine\" he replied. \"So, are you ready to see what a battle here looks like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. The only time I ever seen a Pokemon battle was in the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked like he knew, and he led the way. As I ran through the school, I saw a wide variety of Pokemon. Some were anthro, others were normal. Steven led me to the arena, and it was huge! The stadium had large sets of seats, a large screen, and everything else! I followed Steven, trying not to get lost. I sat down beside Steven, and I saw Zasha sitting beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey!\" she said. \"Sorry about leaving you back there. I get kinda excited when a battle begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine\" I replied. \"I am a little excited too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Loudred walked onto the middle of the arena. \"Hello everyone!\" he yelled. He didn't seem like he needed a microphone. \"Welcome to another exciting battle! As always, I wil be annoucing the competetors. In the blue corner, is the challenger! He is the the master of songs, the bug of all time, Klark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA anthro Kricketune walked out. He had no hands, but longer arms. He seemed nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the red corner! The reining champion of PHS for years! The short but powerful, Thorn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Weavile walked onto the battlefield. It was surprising, because that Weavile looked smaller than what it should be. He looked kinda evil. I saw Steven's and Zasha's expresion, and they each had the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Thorn?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thorn is a bully\" said Steven. \"He usually always wins. If he doesn't, he finds the Pokemon that beated him and tries to kill them. He usually plays dirty though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzzer sounded, and the battle began. Thorn took in a deep breath and released a Blizzard attack. Klark just covered his face and took the attack. Thorn then ran forward and readied his claws. Klark's wings turned orange and shook. Klark was using the attack Bug Buzz. Thorn stopped running and covered his ears. Klark stopped, but Thorn hit him with another Blizzard attack. Klark was forced back and landed on the ground. Everyone was silent. I could clearly hear Thorn's laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just give up?\" he said. \"Do it so I do not have to embarass you anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt mad. I knew somne tough and annoying bullies in my old school, but Thorn was something else. I stood up and yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Klark!\" I yelled. \"You can do it! Don't let that bully win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThorn turned to me and looked mad. I saw that I got Klark's attention as well. I thought that I was the only one trying to fight against Thorn. I was even on the main screen! I ignored the difference between me and everyone else and started to chant Klark's name. Steven and Zasha started as well, and everyone else joined in. Thorn was looking around the arena, staring at everyone. Klark slowly got up, and crossed his amrs. They glowed blue, and he ran at Thorn. Thorn turned, and he was slashed in the face with a X-Scissor attack. Thorn was knocked back greatly. It seemed that Thorn wasn't as strong as I thought he was. Thorn got up, but he was slashed by another X-Scissor. He was knocked back into the wall, and he looked like he couldn't battle anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klark from the blue corner is the winner!\" said the Loudred. Everyone cheered, and Klark looked happy. we all parted out, and I followed the others to the blue end of the arena. I met up with Klark and shook \"hands\" with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you\" he said. \"But, now Thron will go after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I might be a human\" I said, \"But I will help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at me, and we walked out. A paw grabbed my neck and slammed me against the wall. I looked up, and saw Thorn. Two other Pokemon were behind him. One was a Gengar, and the other one was a anthro Skuntank. I could smell the Skuntank from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a lot of nerve interferring with my battle!\" he said. \"I think you need to be taught a lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was scared. I always tried to be brave against bullies, but I could never finish it. I saw his right fist glowing light blue, and ready to attack. Suddenly, Thorn was wiped out by a Shadow ball move. I turned and saw A Mismagius. She wore some glasses. I fell to the floor, and she helped me up. Thorn was accompanied by the Gengar and Skuntank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will regret this!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran off with his croonies. I bowed at the Mismagius. \"Thank you\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not a problem\" she replied. \"My name is Maggie. I once ran into Thorn myself. But, someone brave like you came and helped me. I swore to help anyone like me in that situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is very kind of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZasha and the others ran up to me. I felt faint, and I fell over.</span></div></div>",

Every Pokemon is allowed to use one item in battle. He never used the item in battle, and must have used it on you. The poison wasn't too dangerous, so you will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so relieved. I heard a knock, and several Pokemon came in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I glanced up at the creature that I ran into. I was almost certain that I wish I hadn't. A anthro Seviper was on the ground. She had an appearance of a naga more than a human. It was a female due to the appearance of breasts. She had the yellow markings on her back, and other markings on her face. Her eyes were blood red, and her fangs were very white. She got off the ground and stood up straight. She was about 7' tall, and her tail was nearly twice her size. A long, blade-like tail was at the end. She slithered towards me, and I slowly backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't hurt me!\" I yelled. \"I'm sorry and it will never happen again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seviper lady stopped and looked at me strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurt you?\" she asked. \"Why would I do that? It was my fault. Please forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached her hand down, and I grasped it. She tried her best not to hurt me with her claws either. I got up, but I kneeled back down. There were papers everywhere; probably hers. Each one had an amazing picture of a Pokemon. Each was colored and Drawn with incredible skill. I handed all of the papers to her, and she bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" she said. \"My name is Jasmine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Jasmine\" I replied. \"My name is Taylor. I'm the new...student here at PHS.\" I was trying to find the word that didn't make me sound different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you, you are the one who stood up during Thorn's battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I only heard. Honestly, I don't really like battling. I'm not bad at it, but I just don't like to watch. It seems like everyone is obsessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this may come from s human's point of view, but I do not think the same. Sure, some people are insane about being the best(Thorn). However, battling should be more of a fun activity, to increase the skills of all of the competetors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes much more sense. You seem like a very reasonable human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that word...<i>again</i>. Well, I guess that is what you should expect. I tried to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" I said, \"Did you make those yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes\" she replied. \"I did draw these. Are you interested in art?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, she grabbed my arm, and dragged me into a room. I was surprised how strong Jasmine was. The room was splatted with different colors. Some other Pokemon were in there drawing and painting, but Jasmine pulled me to her area. The desk that she had was covered in different drawings. Most of them were unfinished though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are amazing!\" I exclaimed. \"I wish I had your art skills!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, these are not that great\" she said. I saw Jasmine blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really! These are good! I'm a good artist myself, but I lack in comparison to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's face was bright red. I thanked her and left the room. A few doors down, I heard the sound of clanging metal. I walked to the door, and opened it. I saw what looked like a blacksmith workshop. I turned my head, and saw two Pokemon. One was a Machoke, and the other was a Magmortar. The Machamp was using a hammer and bending a piece of metal, while the Magmortar was using his hands and heating the metal. I felt a poke on my shoulder, so I turned around. Behind me, was a Scizor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" it asked. By the sound of it's voice, it was a guy. He said that loud enough to catch the attention of the Macoke and Magmortar. They walked up behind me, and the Machoke grabbed me. I froze in fear. He turned me around so he could state into my eyes. He kept me like that for a while, but then turned to the Magmortar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look like it is Daryl\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember anything?\" asked the Magmortar. \"This is our new student!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Machoke nearly dropped me. The Scizor grabbed me with one of his claws, to prevent me from hitting the floor. Machoke and Magmortar towered over me. The Scizor was just above my height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for this misunderstanding\" said the Magmortar. \"I am Mr. Heat. My partner is Mr. Strong. We are in charge of the Metal Shop. The boy behind you is Zang, our star pupil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZang crossed his arms at the sound of their comment. I looked at my schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have Metal Shop as a class\" I said. \"I might see you later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can ya work with metal?\" asked Mr. Strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will find out soon enough\" said Mr. Heat. \"But now it is time for lunch. Zang, could you show our new student here to the cafeteria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked out of the room and up a flight of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Taylor by the way\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you\" replied Zang.</span></div></div>",

The walls were decorated with different designs. The cafeteria was sort of like a buffet style. Almost every lunch food I could think of was there. There were many Pokemon already here, but majority of them were just talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost every kind of food that you can think of is served here daily\" said Zang. \"You name it, they serve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI headed to the lunch line and grabbed a tray. You were allowed to grab no more than five items. I grabbed two slices of pizza, a soda, and some fries. I walked out and looked for a table. Thankfully, I saw a table with nearly everyone that I knew. There was Steven, Klark, Zlily, and Jasmine. I walked over and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you again\" said Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat down and ate. Klark was saying how Thorn never went after him, but I said nothing. I did not want him to feel bad. After I finished my lunch, Steven gave me a tour of the rest of the school. The gym was huge, the science labs were very complex, and the teachers I met seemed thrilled to have me here. By the end of the day, I was exhausted. It was nearly 10:00pm. I went to my dorm, and finished my unpacking. There, I set up the rest of my items and I headed for my bed. Zasha was getting ready as well.</span></div></div>",

I grabbed my phone and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetie!\" said my mom. \"How was school today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is perfect. Almost everyone is nice to me here. I even have some friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I wanted to ask. I knew you would make some friends; you're very lovable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" I caught the attention of Zasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I would like to meet you're new friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, its like 10:00!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not by phone, in person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze up, Zasha saw my reaction, and sat down beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You want to meet them in person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do! I would like to meet the new friends that you have made. Tomorrow around dinnertime. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll see if we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hanged up, and I put my phone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong?\" asked Zasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom wants to meet you and my new friends tomorrow night\" I replied. \"What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to ask Principal D for permission first. We also have to stop by somewhere before we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and went to her bed. I fell asleep into mine quickly. The next day, I woke up even earlier than I expected. I waited patiently for Zasha to wake up before I got ready. We visited Principal D's office before we continued with today. He approved, and we then searched for the rest of them. They all agreed, and we went through a \"normal\" Sunday. There were more battles today, and for once they didn't include Thorn. However, I learned that there are two sides in the entire school. The Red Team is Thorn and everyone who is with him. All the rest are the Blue Team. I also learned that the Blue Team is losing a lot of members. Besides that bad news, the battles were great. This school even had some Pokemon from the Unova series, and they came out a few months ago! I also stayed for a contest, which Lily was in. She was stunning! Sure most of the other girl competitors looked good, but the way Lily used her moves only enhanced her beauty. Around 6:30, my parents said they would pick us up. I met everyone by this one room. Everyone was there: Zasha, Steven, Klark, Maggie, Lily, and Jasmine. Strangely, they all wore clothes. We entered the room, and there was a very large machine. There was a single glass casing that could fit one of us. Near the control panel, sat a...</span></div></div>",

It floated out of his chair and approached us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again Zasha\" it said. It's voice sounded like it was generated from a computer. \"What are we doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Qwerty\" replied Zasha. \"Allow me to introduce you to Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked forward and we shook hands. \"I always wanted to meet a Porygon-Z\" I said. \"Although, why is your name Qwerty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qwerty is the first six letters on the top row of a keyboard. My creator gave me that name.\" Qwerty turned to Zasha and them. \"Now then, who is first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZasha walked towards the machine. Qwerty opened the glass casing, and Zasha entered. The case closed behind her, and then Qwerty pressed a few buttons. The machine started to hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this machine Qwerty?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the PokeHuman Transformer\" he replied. \"We Pokemon have a device that gives us the <i>appearance</i> of a human. We use this machine to actually make us human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humming got louder, and the case was glowing. Qwerty pressed a few more buttons, and then the machine stopped. The case opened, and Zasha walked out. She looked just like a human! Her eyes were red, and her hair was white. She had a black streak on the right side of hair; probably the horn. Her skin had a dark tint to it, and her teeth looked slightly pointed. She was wearing a white T-shirt with a black heart on it, blue jeans, and black shoes. Her nails were painted black, and Zasha also had a black belt. She walked down and stood next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't stop staring, but I eventually answered. \"Y-Tou look beautiful...\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily hopped into the machine and Qwerty did the same procedure. Lily stepped out with a whole new appearance. Lily's hair was cream colored, and was put in the sane style as one of the fur tufts on her ear. She had blue eyes, and dark skin. She wore a pink blouse, a white skirt, and pink heels. She had cream colored bracelets around her wrists. She walked out as happy as could be. Everyone else did the same procedure. Steven came out dressed in a semi-casual attire. His hair was green, and his eyes were red. Klark cane out in red suit. He still had his brown mustache, and his hair had the same coloration and style. Maggie came out in a purple dress that covered her legs. She wore a hat that looked similar to her head, and she still wore glasses. Jasmine came out of the machine with a dark purple tank-top. It was covered in the sane designs that were on her back. She also wore Jean shorts. Jasmine's hair was a mixture of black, yellow, and red. Her eyes were red as well, and she wore tons of jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're all ready\" said Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet\" I replied. I walked over to Qwerty, would you like to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQwerty quickly pressed the buttons and ran into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess that is a yes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machIne stopped, and Qwerty came out. He had pink hair that stood up in the center. Qwerty's eyes yellow, but he had glasses that resembled his original eyes on his forehead. He was wearing a pink shortsleeved jacket with a blue undershirt and a blue stripe going across the jacket. He was also wearing black pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's a bold fashion statement</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're ready\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked out to the front of the building, and stopped at the gate.

The drive took longer than expected, but we finally made it. My house was a standard two story building ( three story if you include the basement). As soon as we entered the main entrance, everyone stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Taylor\" said Zasha. \"Your house is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must agree\" said Maggie. \"I enjoy the different artifacts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you rich?\" asked Klark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom giggled after he made that comment. My family wasn't rich, but we did traveled a lot. My dad and mom liked bringing home souvenirs or different artifacts to bring a memory home every time. They always displayed it at the main entrance. I honestly didn't think it was that great, but then again I grew up in this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kids have fun\" said my mom. \"I'll call you back up when the pizza is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lead them downstairs, and they did the same reaction. The basement wasn't really decorated, but it was probably the most high-tech area in the house. I had several game systems and tv's in my house. Steven and Qwerty automatically went up to one of them, but the others looked around. Besides video games, the basement was also where we stored all other games and other objects. Maggie was taking a look at the books, and I followed Jasmine over to the other end. On the other side of the basement, was like a office area. My dad used to use it, but now it's usually where I draw. I saw Jasmine pick up some of my drawings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine handed me some of my drawings, and I recognized them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, many people believe that Pokemon are not real. Some of them have enough creativity and skill in drawing and try to create their own Pokemon. I try too, but I'm not the best at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are not bad\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine filed through them, then stumbled upon the drawings of real Pokemon. Jasmine laughed, and she handed one to Klark. It was a drawing of Kricketune, what Klark was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what I really look like?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" I said, \"That's what Kricketune looks like in the game or anime. You are an anthro form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure know a lot\" said Maggie while reading through a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did play it for years. I know almost everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does the game say about me?\" asked Klark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kricketune is a musical Pokemon that makes sounds similar to a violin when their hands are strung together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" asked Qwerty while playing against Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Porygon-Z is a Pokemon created from a computer. It was upgraded to serve as a being that can live in alien worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! Darn it Steven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see the \"Player 1 wins!\" thing flash on the screen. My mom walked down with the pizza, and we all grabbed a slice. My little brother came down afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" asked Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, meet my little brother\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Taylor's new friends?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded, and my little brother looked funny. \"Taylor never gets this many friends before\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tate!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Taylor is a great person\" said Zasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you just leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTate shrugged his shoulders and went back upstairs. After about another hour of talking, my mom drove us back. We stopped by the PokeHuman Transformer before everyone headed to their dorms. Still, it was around 8:30pm. Steven pushed me somewhere though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to properly introduce you to some of my friends\" he replied. \"You see, we only do not get access to our dorms. There are also meeting rooms based on your type. Like mine, I can meet in the Psychic and Fighting-type rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stopped before a door, and pushed in the key.</span></div></div>",

I heard someone hitting a punching bag, and turned to see a Hitmontop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh...Hitmon brothers...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw Steven walk in and jumped down from the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven!\" said the Hitmonchan. \"How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it a pain for you to show around the new kid?\" asked the Hitmonlee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a set of arms grab me and lifted me up. \"Hey Chan!\" said the Hitmontop. \"I found a punching bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at me funny.

We left the room, and I went to my room. I opened the door, finding Zasha asleep. I gently closed the door, and tiptoed to my bed. I quickly fell asleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I was up at the same time Zasha was. Today was Monday, so I had classes. Zasha informed me that I only had certain classes on certain days. Today, I had Algerbra, Gym, and History. The rest of the day I was able to do another class, l wanted to do Metal Shop with Zang. Possibly even art with Jasmine. I left the room, said goodbye to Zasha, and headed off to my first class. The halls were even more crowded than I thought, and bumped into several people. I got a few glares and stated as I went through as well. However, I managed tostart out my day even grater by knocking down someone. I looked and saw...</span></div></div>",

Although, it was more in the structure of a Dridder( Author's note: a Dridder is a mythological creature that has the upper body of a human, and the lower half of a spider). Four of it's legs were legs, as his two front mandibles were arms. He was covered in yellow and blue fuzz. He had two big blue eyes and four smaller ones in the middle of his forehead. When he got up, he was nearly a foot taller than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why is every Pokemon so tall?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind watching where you are going?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was too excited to speak, I only stuttered. \"Y-You're a a a G-G-Galvantul-a-a-a....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I know. Don't be scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared? Are you kidding!?! Your my favorite Bug-type Pokemon from the Unova region!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wait, from the what region?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and both of us were worried. Strangely, we both went in the same direction. I stopped in front of Mr. Zam's room. I opened the door where a Alakazam stood at the front. There were many other Pokemon in the room, most of them staring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are late\" said Mr. Zam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my fault\" I confessed. \"I ran into him and knocked him down. I only stayed to see if he was alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Galvantula stared at my lie, but removed the look to help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true that you bumped into him\" said Me. Zam. \"But you stayed because you were in a combined state of amazement and fear. There is no use in lying to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw man, I forgot he was a Psychic-type. I just did not want the Galvantula to get in trouble.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But since it was a act of kindness, I will excuse both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and the Galvantula ended up sitting beside each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Taylor\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlgebra was pretty long. The problems were from a range of easy to difficult. Jake did all of them in a matter of seconds. I learned that there were a lot of Unova region Pokemon here, I just ran into one of gem. Jake was stil confused from the whole \"region\" thing, but I told him I would explain later. After about an hour, the bell ran again to signal the change of classes. My next class was gym.

Actually, I was looking down, but that's beside the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think your <i>so</i> tough bow don't you human?\" he asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm...\" I managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!

I flew into the wall, but went through a door. I hit metal lockers and passed out. I don't know how long I was out, but I heard some voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing?\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda cute\" said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it wearing clothes?\" asked a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we take them off?\" asked a fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snapped myself out of consciousness and woke up. I looked at the group talking, and nearly fainted. In front of me were the seven evolved forms of Eevee as anthros. All of them were there; Vaporeon, Flareon, Jolteon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, and Glaceon. All of them were around 6' 11\" and had a very curvy hourglass figure. Probably the most busty female Pokemon yet. Some of them were different though. The Vaporeon did not have the white collar around it's neck, the Espeon was the tallest, and the Glaceon was the bustiest. They were all staring at me in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" said the Flareon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine Flare\" said the Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon helped me up and I thanked her. My back now hurt, a lot! They all seemed to care and three of them rubbed my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you guys anyway?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the Eon Sisters!\" they all said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Vapor\" said the Vaporeon. \"I am a master at swimming, underwater battles, underwater contests, just anything that has to do with water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Flare\" said the Flareon. \"If you are ever cold, I can warm you up easily. My fur is also very soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jolt!\" said the Jolteon a little perky. \"I have tons of energy and always ready for action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Espey\" said the Espeon. She walked slowly and calmly up and bowed. \"I am the most intelligent and the most understanding. Ever need help cone to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Umbrey\" said the Umbreon. \"Ever mess with any of my sisters, you will pay!\" She made a fist and held it infront of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now in not sure who I'm afraid of more; her or Thorn.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Leafy\" said the Leafeon. \"I can help in anyway that I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Glace\" said the Glaceon. She had a bit of an accent, but I wasn't sure what kind. \"I am very sweet and kind and will help anyone with good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of introductions, I had to give them mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...my name is Taylor.

She stepped onto the mat and posed in a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" asked Mrs. Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" exclaimed Zen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to get my own battle stance. I placed my right foot forward, and made two fists, \"R-Ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEGIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even seeing, Zen suddenly appeared in front of me and delivered a strong kick. I was knocked back and I landed on my back. I slowly got up, but was picked up by Zen. Her clawed hands dug into my clothing, but not my skin. She threw me into the wall, and I landed onto the ground face first. I looked up, and saw her pacing in her stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on human!\" shouted Thorn. \"Make a move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly got up again, and looked at Zen. She looked fierce, but something in her expression showed something else. I ran forward trying to throw a punch. She put her amrs up to block, but I sweeped her legs. She fell down, but jumped up and uppercutted me. I can't even explian the pain. I believe she used Sky Uppercut. When I regained my vision, I saw something troubling. Flames were forming at Zen's feet. She ran forward and swung her legs around. I ducked and jumped, trying to avoid all of the attacks. Eventually, I was hit by a flaming foot, and my shirt became burned. I hit the floor hard. I was offered a hand, a clawed hand. It was Zen. She helped me up, but I almost fell back down. My entire body ached. I wrapped on of my arms around her neck and she helped me off the mat. Everyone but Thorn was clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for beating you so hard\" said Zen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay\" I replied. \"I'm still new here.

After everyone took there seats, he went right next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, this is Taylor; the new student\" he said. \"Now as you can see, Taylor is a human. Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is there a human in PHS?\" yelled a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked to the back and saw a anthro Luxray. It was a guy, and boy did he look scary. I was almost afraid to even ask him something. Another student spoke up. It was a female anthro Frillish. She still had tentacles for legs, but she had hands at the end of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you the one who shouted during that battle on Saturday?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still in a scare from the Luxray, but I answered, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few students laughed and others chuckled. \"I'm surprised that your even alive!\" exclaimed the Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class! That's no reason to laugh in class!\" shouted the Claydol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew this was a school for Pokemon\" I replied slowly. The entire class and the teacher became instantly quiet. \"My parents signed me into this school because of what happened in my other schools. I never fit in at any class. I've been mocked, beat up, and even threatened. I knew that this school wouldn't be any different, but I hoped it would be better. Now, I stick out even more here. I don't expect to be treated with respect, but I just wish some would be nice. I got lucky with Thorn, and met a few good Pokemon, but that's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped after that because I was on the verge of crying. All those memories of the bullies and the pain they have inflicted shot through. I walked over to the empty desk in the front and slouched over. The tears were starting to come out. I felt one hand on my shoulder, one patting my back, and another one wiping the tears from my eyes. There was the Frillish, the Luxray, and a female anthro Infernape. I let out a smile and cheered myself up. The three sat back down and we started the lesson. Ironically, the Pokemon students were learning about human history. I knew some history, but not a lot. So the lessons were just as hard to me as the others. The three students that I met I learned their names. The Luxray was Luke, the Frillish was Pearl, and the Infernape was Blaire. Pearl was shy, Luke was tough exterior but had a nice interior, and Blaire was...I don't know really....she seemed like she liked me, <i>a lot!</i> I was surprised that no one else that I knew was in that class. The teacher was Mr. Relic, and he surprised me. He mostly used his psychic abilities to give or receive things to others. He rarely had to leave his desk. The bell rang again, and everyone let out a big sigh. I guess that other students were glad to have a free period in the day. Although, it was lunch time. Pearl bumped into me before I left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hello Taylor\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Pearl\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl rubbed the back of her head and blushed, \"I was wondering if you would cone to eat lunch with me and my friends?\"</span></div></div>",

I followed her to a table where three Unova Pokemon were. There was an female anthro Alomomola, a anthro male Lampent, and a Golett. I wasn't really sure what gender the Golett was, but it looked male. The Alomomola looked nothing like a fish, except for the tall fin on her head and the small fins on her hips. She also seemed to have been swimming, because her pink skin seemed wet and reflected the light around her entire body. She had a similar figure to all of the female students here have. The Lampent had the longer arms than a regular Lampent but had no hands. The Lampent was reading a book, the Golett was talking, and the Alomomola was eating a salad. When Pearl arrived, they all stopped and greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Pearl\" they all said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to introduce you to...Taylor\" she replied calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated out of the way and I walked forward.

So, I'm Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jasper. The Golett is Gary and that Alomomola is Amy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary waved but Amy just glanced back. I wasn't really hungry, so I just talked. Gary wanted to talk a lot, Jasper was too involved into his book, and Amy gave me angry glares. I ignored her as best as I could, but I somehow couldn't. Pearl told everyone the story of my arrival here. Amy laughed slightly when she heard about me being beat up. I really couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might ask what your problem is?\" I asked. \"You've been giving me the evil eye since I got here. I thought Alomomola was a caring Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stood up and looked down at me. I hated it that almost every Pokemon here was taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust you humans one bit\" she said. \"I really don't care how you got here. Maybe you should just leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer yelling caused attention from the rest of the group. She ran out of the cafeteria almost crying. Everyone went back to talking except for our table. I turned to the rest, \"What did I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was silent for a while, but Gary was the one to speak up. \"Amy's parents were injured severly by humans when she was little\" said Gary. \"She hated them ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should apologize to her\" I replied. \"Anyone know where her dorm is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"13K\" said Pearl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to the dorm area and went to her room.

Her skin felt smooth and moist. She stopped crying for a moment, and turned her head. Her eyes were still watery and red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Amy?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing I knew, I was covered in pink. Amy was hugging me tightly. Her body was very smooth. My head was buried in her chest. She was crying uncontrolablely. I rubbed her back to try and calm her down. Her crying did subside, but she hugged me even tighter. She eventually let me go. Something formed on her face that I have never seen yet, a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if anything I've said made you sad\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friends told me only a little about your past.

However, two men with weapons tried to take my mother's purse. She comied, but they attacked. My father told me to run down this ally to be safe. But when they were done with my patents, they went after me. I had to attack them, I used a powerful Hydro Pump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Hydro Pump for a young Pokemon?!

I followed the sound of clanking metal. Soon, I found the precise room.

The horns on his head looked sharper than normal. He caught me looking at him and lowered his head. His face was right in front of mine. He smiled slightly, \"You seem afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it because of the way I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...I-I mean n-no...well....\" I took a deep breath to try and calm down. \"I am afraid of you. It is natural that humans are afraid of something that is bigger than them. But, that's the only thing I'm afraid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up one of his hands and his claws lengthened, \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped but he chuckled and lowered his hand. He rose up and chuckled some more. \"I'm sorry kid, I just like doing that\" he said. \"My name is Armor, nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My name is Taylor\" I replied. \"So, what exactly do you do in metal shop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Heat walked in calmly. \"Welcome to Metal Shop\" he said. \"Before we get started, I would like to introduce the first human in PHS history. Taylor, please come up to the front of the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up and walked to the front. I turned and faced everyone. Almost every Pokemon, anthro or not, was a steel-type Pokemon. Each one had a different look, for once I would like a class that has the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we have that established, we can get started\" continued Mr. Heat. \"Now then, those of you learning how to repair yourselfs go into the Metal room with Mr. Strong. Those of you that wish to make items and goods, stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA majority of the class left the room. The only ones in there were me, Armor, Zang, a anthro Empoleon, and a Bisharp. Mr. Heat walked over, grabbed a few sheets of metal, and walked into a different room. There was a large furnace, a coal pit, and a anvil. Around these machines were several tools. He placed the metal down and walked over to the anvil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here at Metal Shop, we put no limits to what someone can make\" he explianed. \"The thing to start out with are swords and shields. Each one takes valuable time and patience to make. Zang has mastered some of these procedures. Now, I will put you each at a station. Each one of you will make a sword out of iron and I will evaluate them later on. Zang will help out when needed and so will I. Begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over and grabbed some gloves. I grabbed a sheet of metal, but Armor walked over and took a bite out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I was hungry!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I looked back, most of the metal was gone. There was a smaller, more rugged piece. I had to either take that, or the one with a bite out of it. I grabbed the smaller piece and began to work. I noticed that I grabbed the attention of Mr. Heat at my decision. I grabbed a hammer and went to the coal pit. To bend metal, it needs to be heated. After it got enough, I placed the metal over the anvil and began to hammer it. I needed to get all of these dings and bumps out of it first. The others were doing better, but I focused on my work. It took about ten minutes, but the metal was know flawless. I then began to shape it. The Bisharp was already done his. After another ten minutes, the blade was shaped. Zang handed me a hilt and I inserted the blade. The anthro Empoleon was done as well. I walked over to the grindstone and began to sharpen it. I looked at Armor, who was eating more metal than fashioning it. The sharpening took about twenty minutes since I was lacking in some areas. Eventually, I had my sword. I handed mine to Mr. Heat, who placed it with the others. Mine was the dirtiest and looked the crapiest of them all. Armor even had his done before mine, and I saw him eating the entire time! Mr. Heat looked at mine first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, as you can see this isn't the brightest blade or the best looking\" he said. \"More of an eyesore if anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of laughter, but then Mr. Heat raised the sword and sliced it at a vertical bar of metal. My sword sliced straight through the bar with ease. Some gasps were heard and some looked jealous. \"But, looks can be decieving\" he continued. \"This sword is carefully crafted and shows excellent time and patience. Well done Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class clapped and I could have felt better. Teh other swords were goo, but not as good as mine. Zang's was the only one that was better. Mr. strong walked in, and grabbed my sword. He swung it a few times, and then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Heat, this blade is perfectly made\" he said. \"Not to heavy, not off balance, and evenly sharpened. Who did this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sword is Taylor's\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human's?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Heat nodded and Mr. strong walked over to me. \"Boy, we could use some talent like you. We sometimes sell objects like this to help gain the school money. And this could easily sell for a good price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I was never good at anything at my old schools...\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zang, get ready for some help around here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class walked in and observed my craftmenship. They gave me thumbs up and high-fives and I felt like I belonged there. Afterwards, I saw Armor eating some more metal. Some of them were the other swords, but not mine. For once, I felt good.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I spent about another few hours in Metal Shop. I stayed and made a shield with my sword. Zang helped me in some areas and I helped him where it required two people. By the time I was done, it was bedtime. I walked into my dorm and Zasha instantly laughed at me. I looked down and saw that all of my clothes and face were covered with smudges and other marks. I cleaned up quickly, and went to bed. The next day, my entire body was sore, probably from the fight against Zen. Today actually rushed through quickly. I had History again, along with Biology, English, and a Contest class. Biology was taught by a Cofagrigus named Mr. Grigus. I was slightly startled by his appearance, but he wasn\u2019t so bad afterwards. English was taught by an anthro Chatot named Mrs. Spectra. She was very colorful, in body colors and language. She was capable of mimicking any voice she heard, including mine. However, my day went sour after that class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the door after English. I felt a thud against the door and looked around it. Thorn was knocked out behind it. Some of the other classes saw this and stayed to watch. I tried to move but something caught my legs. It looked like\u2026my shadow! A small form rose up from it and showed the face of a Gengar. Now I understood, Gengars can hide in anyone or anything\u2019s shadow. Thorn regained consciousness and walked over with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got him boss!\u201d said the Gengar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood work Gabriel\u201d he said. \u201cYou thought you could hit me and run eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an accident\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was delivered a punch to the chest. Gabriel\u2019s hold on me kept me upright, so Thorn could keep punching me. I grabbed his fist and threw him into a wall. A <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Ball hit Gabriel and he flew into Thorn. Maggie floated up beside me, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like throwing up\u2026\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the punches?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, from staring at their faces for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and was interrupted by a close encounter with an Ice Punch. Suddenly, everyone was lifted in the air. Principal D floated in with his eyes glowing. He was using Psychic on us to stop our fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaggie, Thorn, Gabriel, you all remember that al fights will be in the arena on weekends\u201d he explained. \u201cTaylor, you did not know so I will excuse you. All of you must go to your next class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped the Psychic and let us down. Thorn and Gabriel glared at us, \u201cWe\u2019ll battle you on Staurday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo against one isn\u2019t fair!\u201d I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be in the fight too human!\u201d shouted Thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt all of the heat from by body drain out. They smiled before walking out. The other students had a mixed expression of worry, anticipation, and shock. They left along with Maggie. Qwerty entered and saw the whole thing. I turned to Principal D, \u201cThis can\u2019t be allowed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Taylor\u201d he said, \u201cAny student is allowed to challenge any student here. I\u2019m afraid that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQwerty hovered next to Principal D and whispered in his\u2026.ear\u2026? D changed expressions but nodded at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaylor, Qwerty believes he knows a way to even the playing field. You are aware of the PokeHuman Transformer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it can turn Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon into humans and back again\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Qwerty believes he can throw the machine in reverse and turn you into a Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him in shock before turning to Qwerty. His eyes changed to look like a check mark, which meant he was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince this involves you, I\u2019ll let you choose\u201d said Qwerty.</span></div></div>",

He was nowhere in sight, but one of the screens on the control desk had him on it. I almost forgot that Porygon-Zs can enter computers. He appeared again and he lifted the chamber. I walked inside and it closed in around me. He approached the glass, \"Taylor, I need to inform you on some things before I actually start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This machine usually takes the Pokemon's DNA and looks to change them human. I'm afraid I'm not sure what Pokemon this will change you into. I'm also not sure if it will be regular or an anthro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any Pokemon would sound good right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, after I transform you, your human look will change depending on what Pokemon you become.

The machine whirled above me and glowed slightly. A beam shot down and enclosed around me. I felt the energy flowing through me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this actually feels...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy words were cut off because a surge of pain coursed through me. I screamed and I felt my skeleton rearranging. The pain was so great  I passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Pokemon is Taylor turning into.

The process was a complete success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to stand up, but I fell over as soon as I stood up. I rubbed my head, it was furry. I looked at my hand, it was a black paw with a white thorn on the back. The fur on my arm was blue. I felt my head some more, and felt ears. On the back of my head, were four growths covered with hair. My feet were digigraded, meaning I stood on my toes instead of the ball of my foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh please tell me I'm not dreaming...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the desk and slowly got up. A tail was felt behind me. Qwerty smiled and held up a small round mirror. My face was different as well. I had a muzzle, fur covering it, and red eyes. I was a Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qwerty....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is AWESOME!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled some more and circled me, \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to stand up without the desk, but I couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Now, your body will be different. Since you have a tail, and the new feet, your body's balance will be different. Also, your speed, strength, agility, and enduranced has also changed. I believe we should try to get you to stand first. Then walk, and then maybe run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha. Let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let go of the desk, and I was able to stand up properly. I took one step, and almost fell. Qwerty caught me before I dropped. He helped me up again and I was able to take a few steps. We did this over and over again until I was able to walk properly. I stayed with walking for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should show the others...\" said Qwerty. \"I mean, I bet your friends are deeply worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your right\" I replied. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out of the room and into the hallways.

There were two other Pokemon in here that I never met before. There was a Machoke and a Meinfoo. The Machoke was female, but it was kinda obvious. Her figure was that of a girl, with a slimer waist and smaller limbs. She looked like she had less muscle, but she probably could be strong either way. The one distinct feature that told she was a girl was that she was wearing a tight black tank-top. I was kinda glad she was, Machokes are probably the most human-like Pokemon I can think of. The Meinfoo was a female too, with a slight bust.

I wonder if that metal thing around them were actually removeable. I shook that thought out of my head and stepped back. She came even closer though, but Steven helped me. Zen walked beside me, \"Careful Taylor, Blaire is a huge flirt. And now since your a Pokemon, you are so in her league now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why she acted like that before...\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Taylor\" asked Lee, \"You want to practice some moves or battle against me like you promised?\"</span></div></div>",

Instead of learning Bone Rush, I learned a move that looked like a steel-type version of Blaze Kick. \"That's a really weird move, how about we try in our battle?\" Lee asked. \"Sure. If it does a lot of pain, I am sorry, but not to Thorn when he is nailed with it.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when I and Lee were about to begin, I was called down to Qwerty's Room. \"Look's like our battle will have to wait. Sorry Lee.\" I said. \"It's Okay.\" He replied. I went downstairs and entered Qwerty's Room, and he confronted me. \"Taylor, I have made something that you and you're friends will like.\" He said. Qwerty moved, I saw Everyone Else had watch like inventions on. \"Here. The Portable, Poke-human Converter!\" Qwerty said. I slipped the watch on, and saw there was a small dial, that had 2 options: Human, and Pokemon. \"Let Me guess. By turning this dial here, I can transform into a Lucario, or back to Human if please.\" I deduced. \"Man, He's smart.\" Jasmine said. \"Now, everyone. Please try the dials.\" Qwerty said. You saw he indeed also had a watch on, and everyone turned the dials at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, everyone was in their human forms. I walked over to the mirror to see what I looked like. I had blue hair with black streaks, and a Blue Shirt with Black Jeans. I also had blue eyes, with a greyish tint. \"Taylor. You look amazing.\" Zasha said. \"Thanks, so do you.\" I replied. I then got another call from my mom. \"Hey Mom. How the Family?\" You asked. \"Not Good, Tate caught a very high fever, and his one wish is to see You and your friends again.\" Mom said over phone. \"Sure we'll be there.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys. We need to high-tail it to the Hospital!\" I said. \"It that so? Well everyone is supplied with a vehicle, You have a Driver's License, right Taylor?\" Qwerty asked. \"Yeah.\" I said. Everyone ran out side, Zasha and I had Lambourgine's while, Jasmine had a Ferrari, Steven had a Simple Skateboard, and Qwerty had a Bicycle. Zasha and I jumped in My Car, and everyone else got in and/or on their vehicle. And we set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at the Hospital, we rushed to my brother's room, and saw my Mom, Dad, and Tate on his Hospital Bed. \"Tate! We're here.\" I said. \"What's with those weird watches honey?\" Mom asked. All I could think is \"Crap. I am screwed.\" \"Taylor, what do we do?\" Zasha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe came up with a drastic plan, and started it. \"You guys ready?\" I asked. They all shook their heads. We held the watches up, and turned the Dial to Pokemon. We all transformed back. \"What the Hell?\" My Dad said. \"Taylor, is that you?\" My Mom asked. \"Yeah. and these are my friends, in their real forms.\" I said. \"My brother's a...Lucario?\" Tate said. He jumped off his bed, and ran around each of us, like 12 times. All he could repeat is, \"My brother and his friends are Pokemon!\". We all changed into humans. Then the alarm on the watch bleeped. \"We have to get back to classes and such, Tomorrow's Saturday. I'm prepared to give a beating.\" You said leaving the room. Everyone headed to the School, and went to Bed...</span></div></div>",

'you better watch Thorn, I'm gonna give you a warning you will never forget' You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in the Arena, Thorn and Gabriel were already focused. You turned into Lucario, and prepped yourself. \"Taylor! Get ready to die.\" Thorn muttered. The Battle began, and right away it was a Ghost Match, between Maggie and Gabriel, and Thorn launched a Ice punch at me. I grabbed his arm and tossed him at the wall. I launched an Aura Sphere at him, when he hit the wall. He went for a Shadow Ball, but I jumped it and hit him with a Hi Jump Kick, it was powerful enough to make him faint. \"Maggie? Need Help with Gabriel?\" I asked. \"Please!\" Maggie said struggling. I did the mind thing, I developed from Mr. Zam. And predicted where he was going to be. I jumped and did Slam Kick. I hit Gabriel so hard, he also fainted. Everyone in the crowd cheered. Zasha ran up as soon as I turned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did amazing!\" She said hugging me.

I was given the honor of attacking first. I placed my hands together and focused. I was trying to use Aura Sphere, a signature move for Lucarios. Nothing seemed to happen at first, but then I saw a small blue orb form. It grew to the size of a basketball and I hurled it at Lee. He swung one of his legs at it, but it exploded on contact. He was launched to the side of the ring. He got back up and jumped as high as he could. I jumped out of the way, and he crashed back don. He kneeled and grunted after that. The move he probably used was Hi Jump Kick. It causes damage to the user if there is no target. I ran over and tried a different move. I focused energy into my paw, and a small yellow orb formed; Force Palm. It slammed my paw into Lee, and he was forced into the wall. He fell on his face but slowly got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done\" he said. \"Taylor, are you sure you haven't battled before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is the first\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's fight again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook hands with Lee to show good sportsmanship. I left that room since I already learned two moves. I stopped by the Steel-type room to learn others. Steven took even longer trying to explain to them. The room looked completely composed of metal. I met Armor again, chewing on a piece of iron. I battled a few of them and learned other moves. In the end, I learned four moves; Aura Sphere, Force Palm, Flash Cannon, and Metal Claw. After a long day, I decided to go to bed. Qwerty said he had something for me in the morning. I jumped into my bed and quickly fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

I got up, waited for Zasha, and ate breakfast. Qwerty called me down to his room immediately after breakfast. He also warned me not to run into Thorn. I managed to go unseen and made it to Qwerty's room. He had the PokeHuman Converter up and running. He approached me, \"If Thorn sees you like this he'll expect what's coming! That's why you need to become human, so you don't get much attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...then let's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to warn you Taylor. Your human appearance will chance due to your transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQwerty nodded and I stepped into the machine. The clear doors closed behind me and the energy beam fired. I didn't feel pain, I felt funny. I could feel my tail disappear and my feet change. The funny feeling stopped, and the doors opened. I stepped out and looked into a full-body mirror that we set up. My face structure didn't change much, just a few differences here and there. My eye color changed though, my eyes went from brown to red. My hair changed even more. My hair was originally brown, now it's blue with black streaks. The style in the back matched the aura sensors that were on my sides. My shirt was tan, around my neck was a necklace with a charm that was identical to the spike that was on my chest. My skin was more tan, around my wrists were black bands with small spikes on it. My pants were blue, and my shoes were black. I thought I looked cool. Qwerty made some sounds that made him sound content. I thanked him and left but I bumped into someone. It was Abby, and she was once again taller than me. She looked at me in shock, but that shock soon changed into admiration. \"That's a good look for you\" she said. I thanked her for her comment and checked my schedule. I had the Contest class that I missed yesterday. I ran to the room that was indicated on the schedule. However, it was the opposite end of the school. I ran as fast as I could...</span></div></div>",

An female anthro Milotic was glaring down at me. It honestly looked more like a Milotic with breasts and arms, but I'm not one to judge. And I must also say she was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are late!\" she exclaimed. She had a French accent to her voice. \"I will not tolerate such behavior in my class, especially since you missed my class yesterday!\" She waited for an answer, but I was out of breath still. She placed her hands on her hips and lowered her head, \"Well, what do you have to say for yourself?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally caught my breath, but that one loose thought came out first, \"Gosh your beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy words made her turn and blush. \"Oh Monsiuer, you are too kind.\" I stood up, only to be greeted by her giving a curtsie gesture. \"Hello, I am Madame Aquatail. I am the head instructor for this class. May I do remind you that you shall never be late for my class ever again, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see Lily.

You see, we pair to the class to contestants and helpers. But since you were late, everyone was paired up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Madame, we still have...\" said Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, her....Taylor, you will partner up with the young girl at the end. But be warned, she is a little...trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and walked down the room. The room looked like the backstage to a Beauty Pagent. Each booth had different items and accessories.

She was a Mawile, a female anthro Mawile. I couldn't see her very well, she was hunched over crying. I couldn't just stand there, so I approached her slowly. \"Are you okay?\" I asked. I got no reply, just sobs. After a while, I got my answer, \"...ugly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up and yelled at me, \"I'm ugly! Can't you see me?! Can't you see this thing on my head?! I am hideous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were in her eyes, so her yelling wasn't out of anger. I had a better chance to look at her now. Her hair was long and black, actually her hair looks more like a part of the growth on her head. Her eyes were a shade of silver, a shade filled with sadness. It took me till now to realize how tall she was. Most of the other Pokemon were about a head taller than me when I was human. She was about eight feet tall! That's nearly two feet taller! Her height wasn't the only big features about her, but I'm just going to say she had a large hourglass figure. Before I could actually talk, she slumped back over, covered her eyes, and cried. I wanted to pat her back or something, but that extra mouth scared me slightly. After a few more minutes, her crying subsided and she uncovered her face enough to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you still here?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her the truth, \"I can't leave a beautiful girl crying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately raised her head and stared at me, \"You think...I'm...beautiful...?...!\" But, her expression changed straight back to sadness. \"No...no I'm not beautiful....I'm not even cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that about yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted to be in a Contest, but I was turned down every time. I asked the others why, and they said that the hideous growth on my head is the problem. But when I was asked to compete, the teacher said I couldn't. Now I know why, all because if my growth, I'm a hideous monster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You're not ugly! Listen, I'm pretty sure half of the girls here would die for your beauty. So what if you have a giant mouth on your head, that shouldn't matter. Your beautiful, no matter what others say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl still seemed to distrust my words, so I decided to show her. I walked up and hugged her waist. That was actually the only thing I could hug. She slowly lowered her body and returned the hug. She was crying, crying tears of happiness. \"You know\" I said, \"I never got your name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Vivian...\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, it's the freak, and the freakshow!\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see...</span></div></div>",

I headed towards her desk. She was painting a picture of a Lucario, which I assumed was me. As soon as she saw me, she hid the picture behind her and used her tail to block my view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Taylor...what a surprise...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Jasmine, I didn't see it\" I lied. \"I just need some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?

See ya later!\" I shouted. I ran to the metal shop and saw Mr. Heat and Mr. Strong in the room alone. \"Excuse me, Mr. Heat and Mr. Strong, but do you have any armor schematics, I am going to go against Thorn on Saturday and I wanna try my own skills instead of fighting as a pokemon.\" I asked. \"You know some would take serious offense from that, not wanting to fight as such a varied and proud race.\" Mr. Heat said. \"A fight huh? And you want to build some armor and weapons. Well since Thorn is a quick one, use thin and flexible pieces of tempered iron and distribute them everywhere, especially on the joints. As for weapons, go for a attached self-reloading crossbow and short katana. Good for fast varied combat with a tricky opponent.\" Mr. Strong explained. I took his advice and made the armor and weapons just like he said it. It looked like a lighter version of English armor. I walked back to my dorm, and on the way, Qwerty intercepted me. He said \"Taylor, I heard you're going in a suit of armor?\" \"Yes\" \"Then allow me to make a suggestion: why not be extra careful and go as a pokemon in armor. It would also look cool on the side. Or do you still want to try and become a pokemon later?\"</span></div></div>",

And when I looked down, there I saw sitting on the floor was an anthropomorphic Ambipom playing Mortal Kombat... against himself. He had a more humanoid figure, about 5\"6'. He was skinny yet his purple fur covered body suggested that he was vey agile. He had Ambipom ears, large eyes, a head that looked equally human and Ambipom. His hands, arms, feet, and feet were human sized, but more pokemon than human in structure and appearance. \"Hey come on in you must be my new roomma- holy cow, you're a human!\" He exclaimed. \"Why is that a big deal?\" I asked. \"Well, you're the first human PHS has seen, ever scince that other guy. Poor kid.\" He said mumbling that last part. \"Yeah, but still. I just hope I don't get treated differently by the other students.\" I said. \"Aww, don't  ya worry about it. Now sit down so ol' Harvey can kick you butt as Sektor.\" He handed me the other controller and we had  a small tournament. It then hit 9:30. \"Ah, I'm gonna hit the hay, you comin'? You'll need the energy if you're going to survive a whole Saturday of awkward interaction with beings not of your species. Whelp, good night!\" And then he instantly conked out. 'Here's to tomorrow.'

What's the meaning of this!\" I yelled. \"Shh, be quiet. Students are allowed to be up this early, but most aren't. Come on get dressed, I have to show you something.\" Harvey whispered quietly.

One year ago, there used to be another human student. His name was Zel. However, a horrific accident stripped him of his humanity. People don't like talking about it because he was just an innocent human boy, who, like you, didn't know this was a school for pokemon.\" Harvey said sadly. \"So why are we heading to the machine room?\" I pondered out aloud. \"Because that's where Zel lives. He has no family. The machine room holds not only the central core of the school's entire system of technology, but also a machine that can turn pokemon fully into what they would like as a human, anatomy and all, and vice versa with humans.

He even had a Deoxys's arms, core, slit on his face, and red and blue color scheme mixed with the color scheme of Zoroark while all of it being lighter than normal due to Ninetails's fur. He stood up like a human with a slight slouch. He didn't seem to notice us. \"Um, hello, Zel? Hey, there is a new student here. And he is human.\" Harvey said. At that, Zel's ears perked up. \"I noticed. Being part Deoxys means I can sense living beings and wether a being is a pokemon or human, and scince I am not fully Deoxys machines don't hinder that sense.\" Zel tuned to fully face us. \"Oh, hello there. I am Zel, a former human and the guy who keeps the machines up to tip-top shape from here. So why are you here?\" His voice sounded soft, lowish, and full of different emotions at once. \"Yeah, I'm Taylor and Harvey just wanted me to meet you.\" \"Are you sure that's the only reason? Maybe you want to test run your inner pokemon self. The machine is all fine even though it exploded a year ago, cAusing this.\" He gestured at himself. \"I know Harvey originally took you down here to show you how worse off a human can be, but ten bucks says he also want to see you as a pokemon.

The folded steel blade, beautiful handle and diamond hard edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty cool.\" I hear a voice from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shoot up and hold the Katana I remembered from my samurai training.

I bet after hero guy left, she kept pounding the tar outta me! I wish I could cuss at her.<br>\r\n\"Good to see you awake,\" Gengar sighed.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, when the coach came, you fainted and hit your head on the table and cut it on some broken glass. He told Neeli to take you to the nurse. So... She took advantage of that and fake dropped you to the exit, then threw you at the exit and you didn't make over. So she kept doing that until I got ya.

'duking' it out.\"<br>\r\n\"Kyle...\" I started, but I didn't get to finish.

wingspan was covering her body.Not only that,her eyes were swirling in a circular motion,but I could tell that her butt was sticking in the air.I froze in place,afraid to say anything.<br>\r\n\"Ahem...\"Mr.D slightly coughed.The Emolga did a quick shake of her head.<br>\r\n\"Right,right,sorry.\"She said,as she stood up...on what seems like stubby legs.I could see that she was in a different form that I thought.(I could have been more descriptive...but this is rated 13 :P)<br>\r\nShe had a wide chest and hips,and with her small waistline,I could tell she had an hourglass figure.Her arms had three fingers had the ends,and that wingspan was covering her arms and sagged behind her on the ground.Her main body was white,and everything else was black,due to the wingspan,plus she was about my height.I also saw how her cheeks were yellow instead of white,and so was her eyes.She had two circular ears at the top of her head,which I thought was the weirdest part.<br>\r\n\"Hi...the name's Mushu,but you can call me Mushi,if you want.\"She greeted,as she held out her hand.I could see that the wingspan was connected to her arms and hands.<br>\r\n\"Um...I am Jake.\"I said,as I shaked her hand.<br>\r\n\"Alright,let's go!\"She exclaimed,as she turned around an ran down a hallway.I could see her tail was leading straight to her tailbone.<br>\r\n\"Um..quick question...can she use moves,relative to electricity?\"I asked,without even turning around.<br>\r\n\"Yes,in fact she can.Why?\"Mr.D said.<br>\r\n\"No reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute,I finally caught up with Mushi and we were both walking to my assigned classroom.<br>\r\n\"So,what's your first class?\"She asked.It was strange,almost every time she opened her mouth,I could see small chipmunk-like teeth on the roof of her mouth,but she still talked as normal as ever.<br>\r\n\"Let's see...Chemistry class.\"I said.<br>\r\n\"Chemistry...Mr.Al is the teacher of Chemistry.I think you may like him.\"She said,stopping in front of a door.I did too.<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess I will see you la--\"I was about to enter the door,but then Mushi blocked it with her body.<br>\r\n\"Whoa,hold on now.It's the weekend,silly.\"She said,sticking out her tongue.Oh...right.Today is Saturday,I forgot.<br>\r\n\"Right...\"I said,as I turned around.I skipped the classes,and thought about where I would be staying.<br>\r\n\"Hey,Mushi...do you know the room...uh...32B?\"I asked.Her eyes,somehow,lit up with hope...of some sort.<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!That's the same room I am staying in!\"She squealed,which I backed up a step from the sudden response.<br>\r\n\"Really?\"She grabbed my arms.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,really!Let's go!\"She then yanked me along with her.You wanna what the funny thing is?I was...literally,floating in the air,as she yanked me across hallways and corners.That's how fast she's going!<br>\r\n\"Whoa,whoa!Can you slow down!?\"I yelled.<br>\r\n\"Hm?What was that?\"She asked,turning her full attention to me...and not looking was going!In fact,I could see we were heading towards a marble wall!<br>\r\n\"Look in front of you!\"I yelled,and by the time she turned around,it was too late.She had ran straight into the wall,and I was slammed against her on her back.After we both groaned of pain,we both fell back,where I landed on the ground,and she landed on me.<br>\r\n\"Whoops!I'm sorry!\"She said,quickly picking herself,and me off the ground.<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it,I was just excited and--\"I cut her off by closing her mouth shut.<br>\r\n\"Mushi,it's alright.You were just excited to have the first human in a Pokemon school to stay in the same room with you.I can understand that.\"After I said that,I let go of her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Okay...thanks...I think.\"She started scratching her ears,which I slumped my head out of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calmly walking to Mushi's dorm,I entered it,quickly seeing that the room was painted bright yellow,and that there was a pink bed in one corner,and a blue bed in another corner.The floor was colored yellow,too,and it was carpet.<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah,I didn't really expect for someone to say in the same room as me.I hope it's alright.\"She said,sounding a little disappointed in herself.<br>\r\n\"It's alright,Mushi.In fact,yellow is my favorite color!\"I said,quickly throwing my bags on the blue bed,and closing the door behind me.<br>\r\n\"Alright,so my next class is--\"Before I can even read it,Mushi lowered the paper and covered it with her wingspan.<br>\r\n\"Let's forget about the schedule today.I want you to meet my friends.\"She said.<br>\r\n\"Well...if I am going to a new school,I should probably know some new people.\"I said,which Mushi grabbed both of my arms,and started to gently pull me.<br>\r\n\"Good,I want you to meet my best friend.\"She said,as we stopped at another door,which was labeled 32A.Mushi knocked on the door,as loudly as she can.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...who is it?\"The voice was too muffled for to define if it's a boy or not,but it surely sounded annoyed.<br>\r\n\"It's me Mushi.I want you to met someone.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?I'll be right out.\"<br>\r\nAfter

scary!?\"I screamed.<br>\r\n\"That's just her way of a warning sign.\"She said.<br>\r\n\"Warning sign?\"<br>\r\n\"She's very protective of me.She is even willing of jumping in the way of a life-threatening projectile that was aimed at me!\"<br>\r\n\"She is?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,now come on.\"She turned around a started walking down a hallway.<br>\r\n\"Hey!Where are going now!?\"I asked,following behind her.<br>\r\n\"To meet more of my friends,silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of walking,we had stopped in front of a door that said 10B.Mushi again,knocked as loudly as she can,and unlike last time,the door opened quickly and she was pushed against the wall,but it wasn't that harsh of a push.<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\"I looked towards the door to see a Cacturne,with his eyes closed,and those rhombuses turned in a U-shaped manner.<br>\r\nThis guy was the same height as the last girl,and he had his arms to his sides.Funny,I thought he would have his arms out into the air,but okay,whatever.I also couldn't tell if that was grass,or green hair from behind him.<br>\r\n\"Hey!Why did you do that,Cactine!?\"Mushi yelled,angrily pointing towards the Cacturne.<br>\r\n\"Do you know,how loud you knock on doors!?Jeez,you could wake up a whole neighborhood.\"He said,as his eye turned to me.<br>\r\n\"Eh...who's this boy?A Ditto?\"He started scratching one side of his head.<br>\r\n\"No!He's a boy!A real human,boy!See!?\"She said,as she started pinching my cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Ow,jeez.\"I said,as I gently knocked off Mushi's hand.<br>\r\n\"Ha...rough first day I see.My name's Cactine.Nice to meet you.\"He said,holding out one of those spiky arms.<br>\r\n\"Uh...my name is Jake and...uh...can you somehow make those spikes go further into your arms.\"I asked.It's not that I didn't want to shake hands,it's just that his arms were making me uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"Pfft...I wish I could.\"He said,as he pulled his arm back.<br>\r\n\"Is Vile up yet?\"He asked.<br>\r\n\"No,she's asleep.Why?\"I thought I was saying what Mushi was about to say.<br>\r\n\"Good...Mushi and Jake,I wanna tell you something.\"I started listening very carefully,and so did Mushi as she walked beside me.He then crouched down to our height.<br>\r\n\"Don't tell her this,but while my girlfriend was asleep...I took a picture of her butt.\"He said,laughing a little as he took a camera out of his hat.Suddenly,the wall behind me and Mushi came tumbling down,and right in the ruble...was a very angry Vileplume.<br>\r\n\"You did what now!?\"She screamed,as I could see an angry vein on her head.<br>\r\n\"Um...see ya,Vile.\"Cactine ran back into his room,and then heard a click.Vile jumped over our heads,and angrily yanked the door open.<br>\r\n\"Get your butt over here,so I can kick it!!\"She yelled,as she ran into the room,and closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n\"Oh Cactine,when will he ever learn?\"She asked,comically,as we heard a few punched being blown to somebody inside the room.<br>\r\n\"And while they settle things...let's go to the gym!\"I said,as this time I started to run ahead of her.<br>\r\n\"Hey,wait the Gym is that way!\"She screamed,which I ran in the other direction,with her following me shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally,after much running and catching our breaths,me and Mushi were standing on front of the Gym doors.How did I know!?It said 'Gym' above the 7 feet tall doors.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure,you wanna tour the gym Jake?\"Mushi asked,as she crossed her arms across her chest.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,I mean I ace every Gym class there was,why?\"I said,as I placed a hand on the doors.Mushi started tapping one of her cheeks with a finger.<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm not sure,that you may ace this one.\"I gave her a confused look as I opened the doors.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"I then looked through the door...and I felt my jaw dig into the ground.The Gym was huge,and there were cages all around,having Pokemon-Anthro and normal alike-fighting against each other.I closed the door and turned back to Mushi,which she shrugged,and gave off a nervous smile.I sighed then,I opened the doors back open,and walked in,with Mushi following me shortly.<br>\r\n\"Okay,so what is Gym class?\"I asked,turning my attention to Mushi.<br>\r\n\"In this school,gym class is mainly a place where Pokemon,anthro or not,show their strength against other Pokemon.\"She said,but then her eyes widened when she looked at the bench.I looked at the bench,too and my expression was the same as hers.<br>\r\nWhat we saw on the bench was...</span></div></div>",

finger,because they moved like they were.Her hair seemed weird to me,which was just a big curl of air,in between the ears.<br>\r\n\"Snitch...what does that count as?\"She asked,as she wiped a green towel across her face.<br>\r\n\"49-0...at this rate,you will even surpass our own teacher!\"I heard.<br>\r\nOn the side of the Zangoose girl,was a Sneasel anthro girl.She had black fur all over her averagely sized body,and white claws as toes and feet.She had...uh...6...red 'feathers' on her head.One was jabbing straight up,two were beside it,and three were jabbing towards the ground.<br>\r\n\"Great...now I wonder who my next victim will be.\"The Zangoose girl said,as she tapped the side of her face with her claws.I could somehow read Mushi's mind,like she was saying 'please don't let it be us'.We then started to walk backwards,towards the door,not saying a thing...but before we even reached the doors,we both had bumped into something behind us.Mushi seemed to freeze in place,while I slowly turned around to see...a Lucario girl.<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing?\"She asked,in a angry tone.Me and Mushi both backed up about two steps.<br>\r\nThis Lucario girl was about foot taller than me.She had only wide hips,and average sized chest.She had a swirl of hair that curved down her right eye,and came back up at the cheek. <br>\r\n\"Oh,um...hi,Mrs.Lucane.\"Mushi said,as she took another step back.<br>\r\n\"Um...we were just leaving,and um...\"I started,trying to come up with an excuse.<br>\r\n\"If your going to leave,then your going to have to fight in a match to show your strength.\"Mrs.Lucane said,as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n\"B-B-But,I am not good with fighting,I barely know any mo--\"<br>\r\n\"Not you,Mushi.\"She then pointed towards me,which my eyes grew really wide.<br>\r\n\"Him.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait...what!?I'm just a boy,a regular boy!How do you expect me to fight somehow without getting mau--\"She interrupted me by grabbing my hair,and dragging me with her.<br>\r\n\"Ow,ow,ow.\"I cried.<br>\r\n\"Human or not,your going to show your strength if you even have a change to make it in this school.Zan,get over here!\"Mrs.Lucane whistled,which I then saw the Zangoose girl appear right in front of my eyes,which made me really worried.This girl was just about a head taller then me.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"Zan replied.<br>\r\n\"Your next match is against this human,uh...Jake was it?\"She asked me.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"I said,as I felt really angry,for some odd reason.<br>\r\n\"So,your the new student...well,seems like your my practice dummy.\"She joked,as she calmly placed on of those claws on my right cheek.I flailed my arms,which made her pull back her hand.<br>\r\n\"Look I don't care,if your one of the best.I can show you,that a simple boy can beat any living thing,any day.\"I said,bravely.She just giggled.<br>\r\n\"Hm...feisty,I see...that's not really gonna help you.\"She laughed,as she walked into some kind of steel cage.I then angrily walked into the cage,and before Zan closed the door,I looked towards the gym door,seeing that Mushi was not there.She was probably too scared,or too shocked to see me get hurt,especially when it's my first day here,but it wasn't time to think about that.Right now,I had to face against this...extremely fast looking girl.The cage soon closed behind me,and Mrs.Lucane walked up to the side of the cage.<br>\r\n\"Alright,this match is a winner take's all match,which means that if one person loses,it's over!\"She yelled.Zan had already,took her fighting position...and...I didn't know anything.Dang it!I knew I should have taken those karate classes back when I was 9.<br>\r\n\"3...\"<br>\r\n\"2...\"<br>\r\n\"1...\"<br>\r\n\"GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan had already dashed towards me at the speed of lightning,which I quickly jumped out of the way,before she claw my chest off.Already,she looked confused,when she looked towards me,and I did the same reaction.<br>\r\n\"Hold still,squirt!\"She said,dashing towards me again.I decided to play it...'video game style'...as I ran up to her,and right at the last second,slid on the ground with one of my legs stuck out,hitting one of her feet,and making her toppling over and landing on her head.She angrily got back up,and I could see at least two angry veins on her head.<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed,usually people would lose in the first 5 second of the match.\"Mrs.Lucane said,behind me.<br>\r\n\"Uh...I play too many video games?\"I shrugged at Zan.She then came at me like a raging bull,which I then ran towards a corner of the cage,and used it to jumped higher,like a wall bounce.She stopped right under me,with her eyes wide open,which I used my hands to play 'leap-frog' on her head,like I just bounced off a video game characters head.She stumbled forward until she grabbed onto the cage to hold her balanced,which I then started to hear people gasping and saying how was I doing that.I then saw how Zan's claws tore through the metal,and she slowly looked at me.Dang!!Her pupils shrunk so much that I couldn't even seem them anymore,not to mention the fact that she was constantly growling.She then ran towards me as fast as lightning,and as she was to claw at me from above my head,I jumped backwards,walked fast towards her,then pushed her in her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Ever heard of something called taunting?You should try it?\"I joked,almost getting clawed in the face,if I had not leaned back.Good thing I have extreme reflexes.She was trying to claw,punch,and kick every way she could at me,but I simply dodged each attack accordingly.Many Pokemon were cheering my name.However,she got a lucky shot,when she grabbed one of my arms,and pulled it behind my head,which made the crowd gasp.<br>\r\n\"Ha!What are you going to do now?\"She was right...what was I going to do?I tried to fee my captured arm,which my free arm,but she captured that one,too.<br>\r\n\"Now,we can do this the easy,or the hard way.\"She said,tightening her grip on both my arms.<br>\r\n\"Jake...get out of there.\"I quietly heard,which I looked along the many crowds of Pokemon,and as I saw Mushi,I smiled.She wasn't alone though,Cactine and Vile were along her side.<br>\r\n\"Already,time to go hardcore.\"I bravely said.<br>\r\n\"What are you saying!?\"Zan asked,angrily,right before I slipped my left leg behind her legs,and tripped her from behind,making her let go of my arms.I then grabbed both of her legs,and started to spin around at a fast pace.<br>\r\n\"Let...Go...Of...ME!\"She yelled,as she tried to claw at me,but I was just too far.After about 8 swirls,I then let go of her legs,which made her flying across the cage,and land face first onto the mat,and her butt sticking in the air.<br>\r\n\"I win!\"I said,as I put my hands into my hoodie pocket.Many people cheered wildly,and constantly yelled my name.<br>\r\n\"Zan!?Zan,get up!\"The sneasl yelled,trying to wake up Zan.She didn't even budge.I feared that I may have spun around too fast,but all of that went away,when a robe like cloth covered me from behind.<br>\r\n\"Jake,your amazing!How did you do all of that!?\"Mushi asked me,sounding very excited.<br>\r\n\"Dude,that was epic!!\"Cactine said,which I saw two bandages on both of the arms.<br>\r\n\"You know,your not as bad as I thought.\"Vile said,giving me a pat on the head,which forced me to bend my head over.<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"I said,as I dropped a bead of sweat.</span></div></div>",

voice,right beside me.I looked around,and I saw that I was in Mushi's room...or our room,and in my bed.I had forgotten that I have<br>\r\n\"What happened?Did I hit something hard?\"I asked,turning to Mushi.<br>\r\n\"Cactine patted you on the head,with those arms of his turned upside down.You fainted on touch.\"She said,giggling a little.I nervously laughed,right after I head some kind of punch being thrown,outside of the room.<br>\r\n\"Ow!How many times do I have to say i'm sorry!?\"That sounded like Cactine.<br>\r\n\"100 times!I can't believe your my boyfriend!Not to mention the fact your still alive!!\"That sounded like a really ticked Vile.<br>\r\n\"Well,anyways,the doctor said,that you're going to be fine.\"Mushi said.<br>\r\n\"Good thing to hear that.\"I said,relieved.Just then,I heard some kind of ambulance,that was greatly sounding louder with each passing second,making me feel worried.<br>\r\n\"Make ways,for the handsome babes!\"I heard,as I also heard car doors open and slam back closed,which then the bedroom door slammed open.<br>\r\n\"Hellooooooo,cutie!\"Two voices said.Strange...there were two...uh...well...um...<br>\r\nOkay,they both have the body of a Pikachu,but had the features of a Plusle and Minun.They both had nurse dresses and caps on,both have different tails than a Pikachu,one's a minus sign and one's a plus sign.Not only that,the Plusle has this big curl of hair the swirled over her left eye,and the Minun's swirl was smaller,but had many tiny swirls behind the bottom of her head.I could see their wide chests for their sizes,but they didn't even look like an anthro,plus I could see three tiny fingers on the end of each arm.they appeared to reach up to my knee,in height.<br>\r\n\"Wait...what?\"I kind of flinched at the word...Cutie.<br>\r\n\"Time to take your medicine,honey bun.\"The Plusle said,as she jumped onto the bed,and poured down a brown-ish liquid into a spoon.Why are they calling me these names?<br>\r\n\"Mushi...do they usually do this?I'm talking about the part,with the names.\"I quietly asked.Mushi scratched her head in confusion.<br>\r\n\"No,they usually call people by their names.\"She said.<br>\r\n\"Now open wide,sweetie.\"The Plusle...Pikachu shaped girl said,as she held the spoon of dripping brown liquid,near my mouth.I backed my head up and pushed the spoon back to the girl.Mushi stood up and walked beside the door.I wondered why she did that.<br>\r\n\"Come on...you know you want to.\"The Minun said,quickly jumping on the bed,next to my feet.<br>\r\n\"She's right you know,now open wide,please.\"The Plusle pushed the spoon next to my mouth again,this time bending over to get closer to my mouth,which I moved my head away this time.I then looked at Mushi,which I saw her blushing,before she covered his body in the wingspan of her's.<br>\r\n\"Um...I appreciate the help,but I really don't need it.\"I said,which made the Plusle look at me curiously.<br>\r\n\"Alright then...Ming...\"She said,which the Minun lifted up her foot.<br>\r\n\"You got it Ping.One medicine down the throat,coming up!\"The Minun said,as she slammed her foot down...right on mine's.That really hurt!!<br>\r\n\"OOWWW--\"I screamed,right before the Plusle...or Ping shoved the spoonful of medicine down my throat,which I swallowed on reflex.<br>\r\n\"How does it taste?\"Ming joked,as she walked up to Ping's side.<br>\r\n\"Gugh...jugh...\"That didn't go so well...wait a minute...actually...it did!The medicine did taste good for the first time,in my life.However,I got very suspicious,and I raised one of my eyebrows.<br>\r\n\"Don't raise your eyebrows at us,Mister.\"Min said,as she lowered my raised eyebrow.I did a quick shake of my head,and made them both back up a step.<br>\r\n\"Who are you two,and do you usually do this to everybody?\"I said,a little bit hard.<br>\r\n\"We are the puny sisters!\"They both said,flapping their arms,right before I heard something...like two darts jab into something,which the girls yelped in response.They both reached behind themselves,and pulled out darts...more specifically,tranquilizer darts.The girls busted into laughter,right before they both feel over.<br>\r\n\"Sorry,about that.My sister are just crazy for you.\"I turned to the door,to see that Mushi was holding a normal Pichu in her arms.<br>\r\nThe Pichu was wearing swirly red goggles on his head,and was wearing a blue neckerchief.He was also holding a peashooter.<br>\r\n\"Uh...what do you mean by crazy?\"I asked,as I felt the girls twitching.The Pichu jumped out of Mushi's arms,and onto my bed.<br>\r\n\"I mean that,they think your cute,and would completely fall head,over tail for you.\"He said,as his somewhat small body,picked up the two Pikachu look alike,over his head.He was also smaller than them.<br>\r\n\"Wait...who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm the Puny...ugh...brother...Maxwell!\"He managed to say,right before the combine weight of the sisters,made him fall over,with the sister on top of him.<br>\r\n\"...But you can call me Max for short.\"He said,trying to push the sisters off of him.<br>\r\n\"Here,let me help.\"Mushi offered,as she picked up the two sisters,and walked outside.<br>\r\n\"So,uh...who are your sisters?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"They are the assistant nurses of this school.My dads are the doctors,and my mom is the cook.\"He explained,smiling.I just smirked.<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm Jake,the only human at this school.Nice to meet you.\"I then held out a finger.<br>\r\n\"I heard about you,and you seem like a nice guy.\"Max said,as he took my hand with both of his arms,and did a quick movement up and down.<br>\r\n\"So,uh...I can see that your a quick sharpshooter.\"I said,as I picked up the tranquilizer darts the girls dropped,when they fainted.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,I know.I've been very good at shooting objects...other than my own lightning.\"He said,as he took the darts,and somehow put it in his neckerchief.<br>\r\n\"MAXWELL THUNDER!!What did you do!?\"We both heard,which we both flinched at the booming voice.Mushi  ran back into the room,shivering from the voice.<br>\r\n\"Okay...see ya.\"Max said,as he ran out of the room in a panicked matter.I looked at the clock,and it read '10:30'.<br>\r\n\"Mushi,I think it's time for us to go to sleep now.\"I said,as I pulled the covers over my shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,it is late.Goodnight,Jake.\"I heard,right before I went to dreamland.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After me and Mushi visited all my classes and meet all of my teachers,we were relaxing inside our dorm.Apparently,it was raining outside,so not much was about to go on.<br>\r\n\"Mushi,do you ever wonder about Cacy and Vile?\"I asked,while I was unpacking my things.<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask that?\"Mushi asked,as she walked up beside me.<br>\r\n\"I saw them trying to fight each other outside a minute ago..\"I said,as I pointed to the window,also walking up to it,with Mushi by my side.We can see Vile and Cacy,running around in circles,with Vile holding a bat in her hands.<br>\r\n\"Uh...sometimes.\"Mushi said,as she dropped a bead of sweat.I returned to my bag and unpacked my 'un-important things',which were basically my clothes and my games.<br>\r\n\"So,Mushi...do you have any more friends,you could introduce me to?\"I asked,as I placed my bag of DS games aside.Mushi started to tap two fingers together,and started looking somewhere else.<br>\r\n\"Well...there is this...on girl...but I don't think,you would like her.\"She said,as little shy.<br>\r\n\"Why?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Well,she is a bit...um...\"She started to blush.<br>\r\n\"Whoa,whoa,whoa!Hey!\"We heard,from outside the door.It grabbed both of our attention<br>\r\n\"Whoops,sorry.Sorry.\"That voice sounded different,like it was different from the crowd.<br>\r\n\"Hey!Watch it!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry,trying to get to my friend's room.Sorry!\"I turned to Mushi,which she crouched down,and covered herself with her wingspan.<br>\r\n\"Mushi...who is that?\"I asked,trying to open up her wingspan.Soon the door slammed open,and I turned to see an anthro,holding a very big cake.<br>\r\nThis anthro...was a Spinda.She had red fur,but her underbelly,face,and stubby legs,were covered in white fur.She was about a foot taller,and her eyes were blue,plus she had two ear coming out the upper part of her head,both have swirls at the center of them.She had wider hips and chest than Mushi,and she also had two long tails of fur,half blue,half red,that were crossed in between her eyes.She had two circular red spots on the swirls of her ears,and a heart shaped one at her bellybutton.<br>\r\n\"Hello!Do you know the one called Jake?\"She asked.What,did nobody tell her?<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake...the only human at this school.\"I said,as I raised one of my eyebrows.The cake was pink,with a white rim,and was about my height.Now that's creepy...<br>\r\n\"Wait,you're Jake?\"She set the cake on the ground,and I saw a large series of pony tails,all touching the ground,and covering her tail.How can she hide something that big,behind her back!?<br>\r\n\"Yeah...why?\"She blinked...next thing I know,her eyes were swirls instead of blue.I shivered the moment her eyes changed.<br>\r\n\"AAAWWWWW!!Your so cute!!\"She squealed,as she started staggering towards me,with her stubby arms out.<br>\r\n\"Um...no thanks,I don't need a hug.\"I said,as I put my arms out to block her.That didn't seem to work,because she completely glomped me,and I almost hit the wall.Her grip was very tight,and she squeezed me hard against her body.<br>\r\n\"Are humans always this cute?\"She asked,not letting her grip go.<br>\r\n\"Your...grip...too tight!\"I squeaked out,which she let go of me,and I fell to the ground,gasping for breath.<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"She said,as she staggered back over to the cake.I crawled to Mushi's wingspan tent,and peeked inside the hole.<br>\r\n\"Mushi!?Who is she?\"I said,even though I can't see anything.<br>\r\n\"Um...hehe...she's a little...naive,I think.\"Mushi said,as she opened up her arms,making the wingspan tent go away.<br>\r\n\"Her name is Spiny,and...she's a Spinda.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"Spiny asked,as she turned to us,with the cake.<br>\r\n\"Nothing Spiny...um...what's the cake for?\"Mushi asked.<br>\r\n\"It's my special cake to Jake!It's a 'congratulations' from me,it had my secret recipe in it!\"Spiny exclaimed,as she blinked and her eyes turned normal.<br>\r\n\"Special recipe?\"I said,looking a little suspicious at the cake.She staggered towards me again,but the cake seem to be unaffected by gravity,and her staggering.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!Try it!\"She placed the cake down,pulled out a knife from the cake,and cut me a slice,and handed it to me.<br>\r\n\"Um...thanks?\"I was unsure,as I took the cake,that was not on a platter,and shoved it in my mouth.Hm...it was alright...it was sweet,but isn't that what all cakes tasted like?<br>\r\n\"It's great!\"I lied...well...technically,but I didn't want to hurt her feeling in anyway.<br>\r\n\"Really!?\"She said,as her eyes turned to swirls again.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it's great...in fact,it's one of the tastiest thing I ever--\"Mushi grabbed my arm,which made me stop my train of thought.<br>\r\n\"Uh...Jake,can I see you for a moment?\"She said,as she pulled me away from Spiny.<br>\r\n\"Does that cake really taste good to you!?\"I flinched,from how hard she said that.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...It's good,and it doesn't leave a bad after taste.Why?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Really?Her cakes taste like sweaty socks.\"I gaped my mouth open,which made the chewed up cake bits fall onto the ground.<br>\r\n\"Mushi!How can you say something like that!?She's your friend!\"I angrily whispered.<br>\r\n\"Say something like what!?\"Spiny appeared out of nowhere,looking very curiously.<br>\r\n\"Spiny,oh hi...um...we were just saying how your cake,taste--\"<br>\r\n\"AAAGGGHHHH!!\"The shout came from outside,which we all looked outside the window,and we could see that Cacy had an umbrella,and was running into a box that said 'Warning:Explosives'.Vile was trying to stop him.<br>\r\n\"Cacy and Vile are fighting,again?\"Spiny asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"Mushi said,looking annoyed at the two knuckleheads.<br>\r\n\"So,as I was saying,your cakes tastes really good.\"I complemented.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"She said,as her eye changed into swirls,again.<br>\r\n\"Uh...why does your eye do that?\"I asked,pointing towards her eyes.<br>\r\n\"I'm a Spinda,silly,I can't have normal eyes forever.I have to have swirls as eyes,every now and again.It's just a natural thing,so don't worry.\"She explained,as she patted my head.<br>\r\n\"Which is also natural that you stagger a lot,right?\"Mushi asked.<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n\"Anyways...\"Mushi turned to me.<br>\r\n\"Jake,why don't we...\"</span></div></div>",

tasted better every time I took a bite.<br>\r\n\"Okay,let's go.\"I patted my hands together,and walked out the door,which Spiny tumbled after me,and Mushi walked out into the hallways,which me and Spiny followed shortly.<br>\r\n\"So...um...Jake.I noticed that bag full of games you got...what games do you have?\"Mushi asked.I really didn't expect her to say something like that.<br>\r\n\"Well...there's Pokemon...and--\"<br>\r\n\"Pokemon!?\"They both asked,sounding confused as ever.<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah,there's this game where it has every Pokemon up to date in it.It also has these little Pokemon entries in them.\"I explained.<br>\r\n\"Really,what does it say about me?\"Mushi asked.<br>\r\n\"The entry said that Emolga's can store electricity in their membranes...\"<br>\r\n\"They got it right,so far.\"Mushi said,as electricity started to stream out of her ears.<br>\r\n\"But that is released,when they glide.\"She started blushing,and covered herself with her wingspan.<br>\r\n\"Oh!What does it say about me?\"Spiny asked.<br>\r\n\"It says that the dots on Spinda's different from each other.\"<br>\r\n\"I already know that...\"She tilted over,and staggered over towards a locker,and accidentally banged her head on it.It was hard enough for the locker to be left with a big dent in it.<br>\r\n\"I mean about my stumbling!\"She said,as her eye turned to normal.<br>\r\n\"Your stumbling is used to mess up opponents aim.\"<br>\r\n\"Oooooooohhhhhhh...\"She said,as she tumbled over,but got back up quickly.<br>\r\n\"So,Mushi...\"I started,hoping to change the subject.<br>\r\n\"When will we get to the Cafeteria?\"<br>\r\n\"Right now.\"She said,as she came to a complete stop,which made me do the same,but Spiny did a half a u-turn,then stopped.<br>\r\n\"This is the Cafeteria?\"I said,looking through the window of the doors.The first thing I saw was an...uh...<br>\r\nI really couldn't tell.This girl had long blue hair,and ears that jabbed out into the air from it.However,I noticed how her body color was blue,for the upper torso,and she was wearing white pants...I think.She had a bust and hips the size of Mushi's,just a little more,about a head taller,and a plush ball shaped tail,with a jagged tail going right into her tailbone.She seemed a little bit heavy...but not much,just a little.No!She's not fat!!<br>\r\n\"Hey,Mushi?Who is that?\"I asked,tapping my finger onto the glass.The girl's ears twitched,right before she turned towards the door,with a muffin in her mouth,which I ducked my head.<br>\r\n\"That's Azu,or Azurill,if you want to.She's a real nice girl,just don't touch her tail.\"Mushi explained.<br>\r\n\"Um...what would happen,if you do?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...um...she would go nuts,and...you'll find yourself in the infirmary.\"She sweat-dropped.<br>\r\n\"Did you happen to touch her tail.\"<br>\r\n\"No...she told me.\"I sweat-dropped.<br>\r\n\"Well...I think we can get along together.\"I looked through the window again,and I saw that her back was turned back to me.I tapped the window again,and she turned around quicker this time,with a confused look,which I ducked again,snickering.<br>\r\n\"I really don't think you should do that...\"Spiny said,kinda worried.<br>\r\n\"Why?\"I asked,as I looked and saw that her back was turned again.As soon as I raised my finger...<br>\r\n\"Jake!Don't do it.\"Mushi said,a little hard.<br>\r\n\"Fine,I will greet her the right way.\"I said,as I opened the door,which the girl turned around fully and snapped a bone in half,with her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Were you the one ticking me off?\"She said,intimidatingly.I stopped in my tracks when she said that.I could she that she had long,but stubby blue arms.Her blue eyes,didn't seem to calm down the situation.<br>\r\n\"Whoa...sorry about that,I was just trying to have a little fun and--\"She stopped up,angrily,and snorted.I could see that she was somehow standing on Digitigrade legs,but stubby feet and toes.<br>\r\n\"Um...sorry,I just wanted to know you a little more.\"I said,as little shy.<br>\r\n\"Azu,please listen to him.He's likes to have fun,trust me.\"Mushi said,walking up to my side.Spiny tumbled forward,however.<br>\r\n\"Your a friend of Mushi!?Oh!Why didn't you say,so?\"Azu said,more calming than before.She then walked up to me,and reached out her hand.I can lightly see a roll of fat on her arm.<br>\r\n\"Um...my name is Jake,and why are you so...plushy?\"I asked,as I started to feel her arm,which she pulled it back.<br>\r\n\"I'm not fat!!I have--wait...what did you say?\"<br>\r\n\"I said plushy...you know,like a cute pillow like ani--MAL!!\"She pulled me into a tight hug,almost as tight as Spiny's.<br>\r\n\"Awwwww...it's like you know just what to say!\"She squealed,letting me go.<br>\r\n\"By the way,your a human,right?Are humans always this cute?\"She started to mess up my hair,even though it was already messy.<br>\r\n\"That's the same question I asked!\"Spiny said.<br>\r\n\"Hey!Give that back!!\"We all heard.<br>\r\n\"Make me!!\"I turned towards the door,and I saw Cactine quickly running past the doors,holding a green bag,and his hat,somehow.Soon,Vile came running in his direction,with an umbrella in her stubby arms.<br>\r\n\"Oh man.Azu,can give Jake the full tour?\"Mushi quickly asked,which I started to shake my head in response.<br>\r\n\"Sure!It'll be my pleasure.\"Azu said,as she patted my head.<br>\r\n\"Good,come on Spiny.\"Mushi quickly dashed out the door,which Spiny ran into a wall,and then ran out the doors.I felt like my hair spiked up,as Azu tapped me on the shoulder.<br>\r\n\"So,Jake.Tell me about yourself.\"She then started to walk out of the door,which I followed behind her.<br>\r\n\"Well,I wanna know about you.What were you saying before?About you having something?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.You see I have this ability called thick-fat,which is why i'm so pudgy.\"She started poking at her tiny roll of fat on her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Your not,really that pudgy.Your just soft.See?\"I said,as I carefully started to poke her stomach.She started to giggle.<br>\r\n\"Your a very good kid.Probably,the first one who didn't judge me,for my weight.\"I raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Wait...you mean...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,Mushi and Spiny said I was fat at first sight,but they didn't mind at all.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow,that's brutal.By the way,where are we going?\"I asked,as I started to look around,seeing things I haven't seen before.<br>\r\n\"We're going to see Tops!\"<br>\r\n\"Who's Tops?\"<br>\r\n\"He's right over there.\"She pointed down the hall,and I saw...</span></div></div>",

holding the door open.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,yeah...Jake,can we talk to you for a minute?\"Zan asked.I turned to Tops,and he just shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Sure...\"Azu said,as she started to push me towards the door with her tail.I did a harsh gulp,right before her tail pushed me out of the door.<br>\r\n\"Alright,what do you wanna talk about?\"I asked,turning towards Zan.<br>\r\n\"This is private.\"She said,as she grabbed the doorknob and slammed the door.My eyes widened,thinking she may try to murder me,so I tired to hide behind Tops,out of fear.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,dude,she's not going to kill you.Trust me.\"Tops said,stepping aside.I was then grabbed by my hoodie collar,and I was staring into the face of Zan.<br>\r\n\"Look,kid...\"She put me down,so my feet were touching the floor and she let go of my hoodie.<br>\r\n\"Lucane told me to give you this,as a congratulation gift,on beating me.\"Zan reached into her tail,and pulled out a gold ribbon,that said 'Champion' on it.<br>\r\n\"Wha?\"I said,really confused.I only beat one person...oh wait,the best fighter in the school...to be more specific.<br>\r\n\"You're one of the best fighters now,dude.You beat my best friend,and changed her record to 49-1.Mrs.Lucane,not only saw a different side of you,but she also thought you were something else,due to the fact that you were the first one to beat her on the first try.\"Tops explained.<br>\r\n\"Really...wow.\"I scratched my head.I didn't know that a simple win,could have major effects on everyone on this school.<br>\r\n\"So...go ahead,take it.\"She didn't seem happy,nor sad,nor angry,when she held the ribbon close to me.Even though is looked pretty nice...I thought this may be a good opportunity to make a stable friendship with Zan.<br>\r\n\"Look...it's pretty nice...but you can have it,if you want.\"I said,as I pushed the ribbon closer to Zan.<br>\r\n\"What!?\"Both Zan and Tops said.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I can have it!?What?You are afraid of gold or something!?\"Zan said,angrily.I did a quick deep breath.<br>\r\n\"Zan,my record is 1-0...your record is only 49-1.It wouldn't matter,if you lost one time,your still the best in fighter in the school in my book.So really,it belongs to you,not me.\"<br>\r\n\"Really!?\"She seemed really excited,but then she tried to look cool,like it didn't happen.<br>\r\n\"Really?Thanks,kid.\"Me and Tops chuckled a little.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,right Zan.We know your excited to get a ribbon.\"Tops said,smiling.<br>\r\n\"I know!See ya!\"She ran past us at lightning speed,creating a quick wind that blew across the hallway,behind us.I couldn't help it,but I looked at the clock.7:59.<br>\r\n\"Anyways,Jake,your really something else.You gave up a good ribbon...uh...for what now?\"Tops asked.<br>\r\n\"So your girlfriend won't kill me the next time we have a match,if we ever.By the way,that Sneasel girl...where is she?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"What you mean Snitch?She started arguing about is giving you the ribbon,so we tied her up and put her in this closet,here.\"Tops opened a closet,which I looked into to see Snitch,all tied up in chains,had tape over her mouth and ready to yell angrily.An angry vein appeared on her head,when she looked at me,next thing I know,I am hearing something about a ribbon.I walked up beside her,and then she started to get real jumpy.<br>\r\n\"Look,if your wondering about the ribbon,I didn't take it.Instead,I gave it Zan,so you can calm down now.\"I started undoing the rope,which she looked at me in a confused manner.She then ripped the tape off of her mouth,and smiled at me.<br>\r\n\"Really!?Wow,your really something,Jake.\"She said,as she ran down the hallway,in the same way Zan ran.<br>\r\n\"Hm...guess I better go,too.See ya!\"Tops ran down the hall,and turned to corner,almost hitting the wall.I walked back to Mushi's dorm,and opened the door,seeing Mushi laying on the floor,and Azu on Mushi's bed,reading a book.They both looked at me at the same time.<br>\r\n\"So,how did it go?\"Azu asked,me as she put the book down.<br>\r\n\"Zan delivered a gold ribbon to me,but I turned it down,and gave it back to her.\"<br>\r\n\"Really!?You turned down a gold ribbon?\"Mushi asked,looking really surprised.<br>\r\n\"You are a strange kid,Jake.\"Azu said,as she started walking to the door.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,I need to get to bed.See you tomorrow.\"I had to duck,so her tail wouldn't hit my head,and I waited until it got outside of the door,before closing it.<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should get to bed,too.\"I suggested,as I yawned.Mushi yawned,too.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,we should.\"Mushi jumped into her bed,and pulled the covered over her shoulder.I did the same.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight,Jake.\"Mushi said,before turning out the lights.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n\"Wat da funk jon boi!\"We both heard,making both of us chuckled,before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh...by the way...what kind of dream was I having?</span></div></div>",

scattered about.<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself,dude.\"I turned to beside me,and then I saw...MYSELF!?!I'm not kidding,I am looking at myself!<br>\r\n\"Whoa!Who are you!?\"I asked,pointing a finger accusingly.<br>\r\n\"I don't know,but--\"He stopped in his tracks,when we both heard a call for help.<br>\r\n\"Help,please!Anybody,somebody,please!Somebody do something!\"For some odd reason,it sounded like Azu.<br>\r\n\"Azu!?Where are you?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Over your head!\"We both looked up to see a ball shaped cloud,with Azu's silhouette in it.She looked really panicked.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Mushi.I got it.\"The clone said,as he poked the cloud with his finger and it popped like a regular balloon,which Azu fell to the ground,with a thud.She looked very confused,when she quickly looked at me,and then at my clone,and then back to me.<br>\r\n\"Wha--who--Jake?And Jake?Which one's the real one?\"She asked,scratching her ears.<br>\r\n\"I am.\"I said.<br>\r\n\"He is.\"My clone said,which me and Azu gave a confused look at him.<br>\r\n\"What?Even I don't know who I am.\"He shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Anyways...Azu do you know,how you got here?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"No...all I remember is being knocked out by something,next thing I know,I am here in this so called dreamland.\"She said,looking around.<br>\r\n\"Do you know,where the others are?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.While I was floating in the balloon,I saw Mushi shoved into another cloud down there.\"She pointed downwards,which me and the clone looked through the cloud,to see other clouds,however,one cloud caught my eye,which was making a constant noise,and I could see kicks and struggles coming from it.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmph!Mmmph-mmph!\"I heard.It sounded a lot like Mushi,which I pulled myself through the clouds and landed on the one below it,which I then saw Mushi's cloud float over my head.<br>\r\n\"Mushi?Can you hear me?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Mm-mmph?Mmph!!Mmmph-mmmph!!\"She yelled.Azu landed beside me,on her face.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,I got it.\"I poked,the cloud,which popped out Mushi,and she landed on her bottom.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.Now what in the world is going on here!?\"Mushi yelled,angrily.<br>\r\n\"How am I suppose to know?I woke up here,too!\"I replied.<br>\r\n\"Same with me!What happened to my bed!?\"Azu asked.Instantly,the clouds changed...into water,and the ground beneath us also turned into water.Somehow,we were floating above it.<br>\r\n\"You just had to say your bed,Azu.\"Mushi said,in a annoyed tone.<br>\r\n\"Why?What's her bed like?\"I asked,out of curiosity...right before gravity acted upon us,and we fell into the water.I however,quickly swam back up to get air,gasping for it.<br>\r\n\"Mushi?Azu?Are you alright?\"I asked,getting no response.It was all quiet,from me shivering in fear,right before the water currents started acting up,and I found myself swirling in a large circular path.<br>\r\n\"Whoa,whoa,whoa!!\"I yelled,as I was getting closer to the center,but as I was swirling,I saw something in the center of the vortex,causing it.It was Spiny,spinning around in a circle!<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeeeee!This is fun!\"She said,as she continued spinning around.<br>\r\n\"Spiny!Stop spinning before,I am sucked i--\"Too late.I already got sucked in and pushed downwards...right until my back hit a solid wall.I jumped from the wall,and turned to see a building...an unknown building.I don't remember seeing this building...but that quickly faded,when two black claws ripped through the center!<br>\r\n\"Why is everything happening so fast?\"I asked,myself,right before the claws separated the building,exposing the face...of a really huge Zan!She was looking at me with a very evil grin!<br>\r\n\"Here's Zanny!\"She joked,as she lifted up her paw,and slammed it down on top of me,which for some odd reason,I was doing quite well at holding the paw up,but I couldn't hold out for long.<br>\r\n\"Oh crud!\"I screamed,as my face was getting closer to the ground with each passing second,but before my hair touched the ground,I was tackled out of the way,which the paw hit the ground,and created a crater on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"I said,as I looked up to see that Mushi was my savior.<br>\r\n\"No problem.You would have done the same for me.\"She said.<br>\r\n\"Your little brats!\"Zan said,as she stepped out from the building,showing that she was about 30ft tall,and her shadow was looming over us!Me and Mushi hugged each other in fear.<br>\r\n\"We're going to die aren't we?\"I asked,shivering like mad.Zan lifted up her foot,and was about to bring it down on us.<br>\r\n\"Goodbye,Jake.I'll remember you.\"Mushi said,as she buried her head on my shoulder.<br>\r\n\"No!\"We both heard,which we saw Tops tackle Zan to the ground,which created a blast of wind,that would have knocked us into the air,if we didn't hold onto each other.<br>\r\n\"AAAGGGGHHHH!!I'm getting out of here!\"<br>\r\n\"Wait for me!!\"Vile and Cactine both ran past us,in a panicked motion.<br>\r\n\"Dudes!We need to get out of here,pronto!\"Max said,as he ran up beside us.Me and Mushi were still hugging each other out of fear.Either that,or Mushi wouldn't let go.<br>\r\n\"Wait,hold on!Where are we,anyways!?\"I asked,which then Snitch and the Puny sisters ran past us.<br>\r\n\"Somebody hold me!!\"We heard,as Azu ran past us.<br>\r\n\"I told you it was a bad idea!\"A Whimsicott yelled,as it ran by us.<br>\r\n\"Your the one who came up with the idea in the first place!\"A Cherrim yelled,in it's sunny day form.<br>\r\n\"No time!Just run!\"Max said,as he picked us up,with his stubby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about three minutes of running,I found myself in a dark place...with nothing in sight.Somehow,I still see my whole body in this pitch-black place.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"I asked,which then a bright,blinding light shined right into my face,and I couldn't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

that seem really real?Anyways,it was just a dream,so it wasn't real,no matter how real it felt.Luckily,I wasn't much of a screamer,so I didn't yell when I was shocked awake,so I didn't wake up Mushi.I got out of my bed,and changed my clothes...which were the same clothes I just took off.Yeah,go figure,I have like 20 pairs of the same clothes.I looked at the clock... 6:59.Mushi told me that classes don't start until 7:40.Why am I such an early bird?I opened the door,and closed it back,simply heading to the bathrooms,to just wash my hair.After that I went to my first class.Mushi said that I have certain classes each day.Today was Algebra,earth science,world history,and P.E. in that specific order.I finally got to the classroom,which before I even touch the door,I heard something...like a ruler banged on top of somebody's head,and it sounded like it broke too.<br>\r\n\"Ow,i'm telling my daddy.\"A toddler like voice said.It sounded like it was joking,too.<br>\r\n\"You two are in so much trouble after school today!NOW GET OUT!!\"I heard,which soon the door flung open and out came running a Whimsicott,and a Cherrim,in his sunny day form,both,however,laughing.Wait a minute,they looked very familiar from my dream,but that was just a coincidence.<br>\r\n\"Mom,maybe you shouldn't go so hard on them,sometimes.\"Another voice said.It sounded sweet,and kind.<br>\r\n\"And sometimes I should.I mean,why would they think it was funny to doodle all over the board?\"<br>\r\n\"They are dumb like that mom,and you know it.Not to mention that this is the 5th ruler you broke on their heads.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,I know,but that is how they should be taught to not doodle on people's boards.\"I finally look in the classroom,to see two normal Lilligants,one was smaller,and one was bigger,just about a foot taller.<br>\r\n\"Um...excuse me.\"I said,a little shy,which caught the attention of the two.<br>\r\n\"Oh hi!Your the new guy I meet the other day!Nice to meet you...again.Why are you so early?\"The taller one asked.Her name was Mily,I remember from yesterday.<br>\r\n\"I'm an early bird...most of the time.\"I started to rub the back of my head.<br>\r\n\"Well,Jake,since your an early bird,this is my daughter,Lily.\"Mily pointed to the smaller one,and she waved a me.<br>\r\n\"Hello...um,by the way,who were those two that just ran out of this room?\"I couldn't help,but think of those two.<br>\r\n\"Two idiots,who have the worse grades out of all the students in the school.\"Lily said,as she turned towards the board and started erasing all of the doodles.The doodles consisted nothing of Whimsicotts and Cherrims,all of them doing something random.<br>\r\n\"Uh...is that your assistant?\"I asked,as I pointed towards Lily.<br>\r\n\"No,just my 12-year-old daughter.\"<br>\r\n\"12?Then,why is she in middle school?\"<br>\r\n\"She already graduated,when she was 10.\"I froze in place,when I heard that.She must be very smart.<br>\r\n\"So,just get comfy.Classes don't start until 7:40.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"I reached towards my shoulder...not feeling backpack strap on it.<br>\r\n\"Um...I forgot my bag in my dorm,I will be right back.\"I dashed out of the class and quickly turning the corner,stopping in my tracks as soon as I saw the two from before,spray painting the walls.<br>\r\n\"~Doodle,doodle all day!Doodle,doodle every way!~\"The Whimsicott,as he was spray painting the walls,and not looking at what he was doing.<br>\r\n\"Dude,that was so 1337!You should try chorus!\"The Cherrim said,doing the same thing the Whimsicott was doing.I couldn't help myself,but to try to stop them.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"I yelled,but somehow in a soft manner.They both turned to me,vanished...just completely vanish.It made a little 'pop' sound as they did so.I walked over the spray cans they were just holding,and then I looked at the walls they spray painted,which I saw a large drawing.It had the two guys,and Zan,who looked like a monster in this drawing.Why was she monster looking?What happened to make them draw this?I know,I will feel bad for this,but I put the tiny spray can in my pocket and started heading off to Mushi's dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining what happened to the walls,the classes has started I was sitting in my assigned seat,right behind Zan.I still couldn't help to think...why did the spray paint Zan as a monster.My curiosity spiked,which I finally did a light tug at Zan's tail,which caught her attention.<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"She whispered,in response.<br>\r\n\"Zan,there are these two dudes,one's a Whimsicott and one's a Cherrim.They spray painted a wall,with you being the monster,and they're carrying sticks to try to fend you off.Do you know those two,by any chance?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes...ahh...good memories.Chum and Bum were victims of my record,and during the match,I sliced off Chum's cotton,and Bum's flowers.\"She said,smiling at all of it.I felt very nervous.<br>\r\n\"So,is that why they hate you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,pretty much.They were dumb anyways,besides,they thought sticks were the best line of defense against me,not to mention that they are--\"An explosion happened outside the classroom,which disrupted Mily's teaching.<br>\r\n\"CALL AN AMBULANCE!OH DEAR KARMA,I'M ON FIRE!GAAAHHH,I'M SLOWLY MELTING AWAY!I'M OKAY WITH THE CRISP,BUT THE FIRE!AAAAGGGGHHHHH!I BROKE PEOPLE'S HEARTS THE WAY THIS THING BROKE MY STERNUM!\"We all heard,which I saw Zan rest her head on her hands,and look annoyed.<br>\r\n\"They are a bunch of idiots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the next two classes,I finally gotten to the lunch room,with Mushi and Spiny.Luckily,we have the same lunch schedule,so I felt pretty safe...a little.<br>\r\n\"So,Mushi.How's the food here?\"I asked,hoping she didn't respond badly.<br>\r\n\"It's alright.They serve almost anything here.You name it,and they serve it.\"Mushi replied,opening the doors to the Cafeteria.I saw many kinds of Pokemon,both anthro and normal alike,which I was amazed.The Cafeteria was quiet large,too.<br>\r\n\"Alright,I am guessing those are the lunch lines over there?\"I asked,as I saw a least three lines,going into three different doors.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,you guess it.\"Spiny said,as she tripped forward.I walked up to the lines,and as I was,I saw Azu at a table,with a soda in front of her.Finally I got up to the line,which wasn't that long until I got to this tray thing,and then I saw Max who was eating a sandwich of some sort,and he was on a plate.<br>\r\n\"Max,what are you doing?\"I asked,which caught his attention.<br>\r\n\"Oh!Hello.I got hungry,so I decided to eat some sandwiches.\"He said,as he shoved a piece of bread in his mouth.<br>\r\n\"MAXWELL!!\"We both squinted,and I slowly turned to see...</span></div></div>",

had wide chests,and breasts,but that was just about it.Her tail wasn't stubby,like natural Raichu would have,and she had a long ponytail,that appeared between her ears,and then curved down her back,with a scruff of it,in a triangle shape,on her forehead.She was also wearing a pink chef's apron,which said 'kiss the cook'.For some odd reason,the black part of a Raichu's arms,looked more like gloves that tightly hugged her hands.She looked really ticked,and I could see how sharp her teeth were,which made me really nervous.<br>\r\n\"Oh...ha...h-hi mom.\"Max tried to say,as he looked even scared of his mom.When she started to stomp towards,Maxwell started to crawl backwards,until his mom picked him up by his tail.<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you to not eat all the sandwiches at once!?\"She yelled,right in Max's ear.<br>\r\n\"Sorry,mom.I just got hungry and--\"Max's mom shoved an apple in his mouth,cutting him off.<br>\r\n\"Quiet!I don't want to hear it!When your last class is over--Oh just get out of my SIGHT!!\"As soon as she said sight,she threw,Max out the door,which I had to lean to the side to dodge.When I look out the door,I could see Max in a garbage can,with swirly eyes.<br>\r\n\"Oh,hi.You must be the new student.\"I turned around and nearly screamed,when I saw Max's mom.She was about a foot taller than me,too,which really didn't make me less nervous.Her calm voice did nothing either.<br>\r\n\"My name is Clara,Max's mom.I heard my two daughters are in love with you.\"She said,as she held out her hand.<br>\r\n\"Um...hi,my name is Jake,and I heard that they serve almost anything here.\"I said,as I wiped a hand across my hair.In fact,I could hear dishes and junk being put away and shifted around.<br>\r\n\"Of course!What would you like?\"She asked,as her tail started wagging.<br>\r\n\"Just a simple peanut butter on bread,please.\"She gave me a confused look,which her tail sagged against the ground.<br>\r\n\"It that all?\"She asked,sounding a little disappointed.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.I'm not really much of an ea--\"<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"She dashed behind a corner,and came back with a slice of bread,with peanut butter on it.There wasn't a single crumb on the plate.<br>\r\n\"Um...thanks.\"I said,which I took the bread off the plate,and took a bite from it.<br>\r\n\"Your welcome.See ya.\"She dashed around the corner and didn't come back.<br>\r\n\"Okay...I see where the Puny sisters get their speed from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch I finally got to the last class of the day,which by coincidence,everyone I know had that class.There were also,many mats placed across the gym floor.<br>\r\n\"So,dude.How was the first day of school?\"Tops asked.Right now,we were all in a sideways line.<br>\r\n\"It's alright.A little frightening though.\"I said.<br>\r\n\"Oh?Why's that?\"Vile asked.She seemed less evil,even with her petals making the shadow over her face.<br>\r\n\"Well,Max's mom is a bit scary when she is mad.\"I said,which the two made a confused look,and I hung my head over.<br>\r\n\"Oh,right.I'll mention later.\"Soon the teacher walked up,which was a Mienshao.<br>\r\n\"Alright,class.Today is a special day.You guys are going to go head-to-head!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm out!\"The cherrim said,or Bum as they call him,as he ran towards the benches and planted himself there.<br>\r\n\"You and me,Vile!\"Cactine said,ready to fight at any moment.<br>\r\n\"Your on!\"Vile and Cactine ran off.Tops and Zan partnered up,and Max took Chum,which left only me and Mushi.<br>\r\n\"Oh man.\"We both said,as we started to blush out of embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"Looks like we got no choice.\"I said,as I rubbed the back of my head.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,um...I guess...so.\"She said,blushing even more than me.<br>\r\n\"Well,don't just sit around slackers!Get over there!\"The Mienshao quickly said,as she pushed me and Mushi towards a mat.I took one side,and Mushi took the other.Soon there was a beeping noise,which I flinched at the noise.<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"It's the timer...b-before...\"She didn't finish,but instead looked at her feet instead.Soon there was a loud ding,which I saw that everyone instantly starting sparring against each other.Everyone...except me and Mushi,which we soon found each other,staring into each others eyes,and fiddling with our fingers.We both stood still,frozen,and blushing.I couldn't help,but think...what is she thinking?Was she thinking the same thing?Or was she just as surprised as me?Either way,she was blushing,and I could already tell the answer to all of my questions.I soon felt my heart raising,and hitting the roof,or so I thought.What was this,feeling?<br>\r\n\"Hey,kid.Kid!\"I soon snapped back into reality,seeing that I was staring into the eyes of our Gym teacher.<br>\r\n\"You're called to the medic kid.\"She said,pointing over my head,towards the doors.<br>\r\n\"What?But,i'm fine!\"I said,feeling my face,and feeling no scratches.<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me.I'm not the one that called you.\"After that,I left the gym,which I only took a few steps towards the infirmary,before I was tripped from behind,and rushed towards the,Cafeteria instead.<br>\r\n\"Wait,what?\"I turned to see Ping and Ming,and that I was sitting on a tiny ambulance,that they were controlling.<br>\r\n\"Oh great.Now what!?\"I yelled,trying to hang on,for we were going at a real fast pace.<br>\r\n\"Hello,cutie.\"Ping said,as she jumped on my lap.<br>\r\n\"What's going on now!And why aren't we going the the infirmary!?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Well,since you didn't even budge a muscle during your fight,we decided that you needed to eat more!\"Ming explained,as she also jumped onto my lap.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!Really!\"<br>\r\n\"You are?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!I don't eat a lot,because I don't get hungry that often...and who's controlling this thing?\"I asked,which a long silence occurred,right before the truck started spiraling out of control.<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!Hold me!\"Ping said,as she started to hug my body.<br>\r\n\"Holy cow!\"As I jumped off the tiny ambulance,and my the world was spinning for a few seconds,right before the ambulance crashed into the wall,which I pushed off Ping.<br>\r\n\"Uh...wasn't Ming on that thing?\"I asked,a little worried about her.Ming soon jumped out of the rubble,looking really ticked.<br>\r\n\"Oh,yeah.Leave me to death while you have the cutie to yourself!\"Ming yelled,angrily,mostly towards Ping.<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me.I was scared an--\"Before she could even finish,tape was stuck all over her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter.Bye.\"Ming groaned,as she pulled Ping's tail,which Ping started to scratch the floor with her stubby arms.<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"After I said that,the bell rung,which meant the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then I headed off towards Mushi's dorm...</span></div></div>",

expecting Mushi to be here,but she wasn't which I sighed out of relief.<br>\r\n\"-Hm...wonder where Mushi is.-\"I thought,as I sat down on my bed,laying back and looking at the ceiling.I sighed again,but this time out of boredom.Some things rattle in my head,like the fight,and those two guys named Chum and Bum.Why did they run,when I tried to introduce myself?Anyways,after about 10 minutes,I got really bored,and started to play my DS.I had already beaten the game,but I can at least play online and stuff.Right,when I was about to put my DS down and explore the school,the intercom beeped,which I turned all my attention to the little circle on top of the roof.<br>\r\n\"Hello,Pokey High school dudes,and ladies,and welcome to another segment of Q and A,number 4.\"I raised one of my eyebrows.It sounded like Chum the Whimsicott saying all that stuff.<br>\r\n\"This time I have Bum with me in the background,say hi dude.\"<br>\r\n\"Hi!\"Bum the sunny form Cherrim sounded a little faint<br>\r\n\"That was Bum who said that.Now for the first question.\"How is your girlfriend?\".Well she's pretty and she's part nymph...o...nympho.\"<br>\r\n\"She's a fairy!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,she's a fairy.Haha!\"<br>\r\n\"That's what nymphs are!They're Fairies!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,next question...comment removed,comment removed,comment removed...Wow...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,Wow.That's a great question!\"I did a light chuckle,and I heard many Pokemon laughing outside the door.<br>\r\n\"Anyways...scrolling up...\"Will you answer this comment?\"Haha...no...oh crap!\"<br>\r\n\"Wow,what a meanie...Oh cr--dang it!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright,next question...\"Do you put awesome sauce on all your food?\".Uh...noooooa...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes...all the time.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,in fact I order french fries in the Cafeteria then put garbage in it then shake it up.\"<br>\r\n\"HA!Oh...wow,Hahahahahah!Oh god,hahahahaaaaahahaha...\"<br>\r\n\"Alright...boop-be-boop-be-boop...alright,um...\"How are you so funny?\"Well,it's basically just being yourself,when you try be entertaining.\"<br>\r\n\"But,remember the last time I tried to do a Q and A and got censored out?\"<br>\r\n\"Wait,what?\"<br>\r\n\"Well,when I tried to do a Q and A on one of our videos...well not videos,but you know what I mean,I tried being myself.I mean I was all like,\"Hey,guys,I made a Q and A\",and then people started flipping burgers!I mean it-it was like a chorus saying,\"*Mike screech*NO!\"<br>\r\n\"Heh,heh...yeah.\"Just then Mushi entered the dorm all wide-eyed.<br>\r\n\"Uh...is this what normally happens everyday?\"I asked,pointing to the little circle on the roof.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"She said,sweat-dropping.<br>\r\n\"Do you know how long it last?\"<br>\r\n\"As long as it takes them.\"Mushi said,as she sat on her bed.<br>\r\n\"Alright...so...uh...\"If you read this comment then you are willingly marring me.\"Oh god,NO!\"<br>\r\n\"Then they lived happily ever after!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,then came the divorce.\"<br>\r\n\"And then I'm left with all the bills...wait...\"I laughed about how silly the two are,but Mushi seemed unamused.<br>\r\n\"Okay,next question...\"Can I have a hug?\"Yeah,you can...just get a plane ticket and fly all the way to Russia.\"<br>\r\n\"Aw...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not paying $300,to fly to wherever you are,and give you a hug.\"<br>\r\n\"Well,it could be worth the trip.\"<br>\r\n\"Anyways...let's see,\"What happened to the cartoons you use to draw?\"Pfft...that's long gone.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it went pretty well,but then like mass murder happened,and then everything stopped!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,we all got on it for like a month,and then it got boring.\"<br>\r\n\"It was like \"Oh my god we want another animation!\",then next thing other people are like\"Shut up,no we don't!\"\"<br>\r\n\"Alright...why does this one have 41 likes on it?\"Is the cotton on your back real or fake?\"Pfft...of course the answer is,yes.\"Good thing he sounded sarcastic.<br>\r\n\"Yes...no...eh,I don't know.\"<br>\r\n\"Well,that's it for the questions,I scrolled through all of them,and that's it.So...see next time for the next Q and A.\"<br>\r\n\"Boop!\"There was a quick short beep before the intercom went off.<br>\r\n\"Okay,Mushi.How can you not find that funny?\"I asked,still slightly laughing.<br>\r\n\"I don't think,they should be doing that in a school.\"Mushi said.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n\"Well,first of all...this is a boarding school for Pokemon.Second,it seems a little bad for the school reputation.\"<br>\r\n\"But don't they have someone to stop them,if they go too far?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but--\"<br>\r\n\"Then relax,Mushi.There's nothing to be afraid of.Just get a good laugh once in a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,but,I still think it's bad for the school's reputation.\"<br>\r\n\"You can think whatever you want to Mushi.It's fine with me.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I suppose.\"She went to her dresser,and pulled it open,taking out a blue swim piece.<br>\r\n\"Um...what's with the swimsuit?\"I asked,as I started looking through my bags for my swim shorts.<br>\r\n\"They didn't show you the pool?\"She asked,turning around confused.<br>\r\n\"What pool?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh man...well,just follow me.\"She said,exiting the door,which I quickly found my swim shorts and took off after Mushi,closing the door behind me.</span></div></div>",

many fins and legs of Pokemon that were swimming about.However,I tried to do the same with Azu's tail,but that failed,and I almost got hit in the head with an iron tail from her.<br>\r\n\"I have to admit,Jake,you sure do know how to have a lot of fun.\"Mushi said,taking another bite from her piece of cake.She had gotten use to the cake's taste,which I find natural.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,except the part where I almost got hit by Azu's tail.\"I said,rubbing the back of my head.<br>\r\n\"Didn't I tell you not to touch her tail?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry,I kinda got in the moment.\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright,she forgives anyone that says sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?That's a load off of my mind...\"I then started to think about how Principal D transformed from a human to a Pokemon,with some weird thing on his wrist.<br>\r\n\"...by the way,do you have some weird device that makes you turn into a human like form shape?\"Mushi turned to me,blushing.<br>\r\n\"Um...why yes...hold on...\"She said,slowly reaching for something under her robe.She had a disgusted look,and took a deep breath,right before I heard a click and then she turned blurry,but then normal,but with a human like figure,and then taking a gasp of air.<br>\r\nIn her human form,she has pale skin color,same color eyes,black hair with two circular pieces on top,and she had a black robe that covered her whole body,and her arms.Her figure was the same,but that was hard to tell because of the saggy robe.<br>\r\n\"Wow,Mushi.You look like your from a Japanese culture.\"I said,still checking out her body.She blushed even more harsh,which made me worry about her face.<br>\r\n\"I am from a Japanese culture.\"She said,which made me wide-eyed.<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry,if I offended you in anyway...and why did you take a breath of air?\"<br>\r\n\"It's because it feels weird,for once,I don't have my buck teeth anymore!Second,uh...it just things change when i'm in human form,especially...\"She didn't finish,but instead looked down towards her bust.<br>\r\n\"Who's next!?I just drank some soda,I got a broom,and i'm ready to kick some butt!\"That sounded like Cactine from outside the dorm.<br>\r\n\"Cactine,but the broom down and get into your Pokemon form!\"That was Vile,I can tell.<br>\r\n\"Please?Pretty please?\"Weird...I didn't expect Spiny to get into this.I quickly ran towards the door,opening it as I grabbed the handle,and quickly seeing Cactine with a broom on one side,Spine and Vile on the other.All of them had their human forms<br>\r\nCactine had white skin color,a Cacturne like suit and a Cacturne hat,and was bare feet.That grassy hair behind his back was more curved.Vile had pale skin,a Vileplume-like hat,and a purple overall.Her hat still made that shadow over her face.Spiny had a red and white stripped,long sleeved shirt,white pants,two swirls on the sides of her head,and blue eyes.Cactine turned to me,and instantly started to smile evilly.<br>\r\n\"Yo Jake,check this out!\"He said,as he started to twirl the broom with one had.The broom was quite large,and it almost hit me in the head.<br>\r\n\"Hey,watch it!\"I said,ducking my head.<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\"Mushi said,quickly appearing by my side.I saw that the 'brush' part of the broom was coming back.<br>\r\n\"Get down.\"I then pushed Mushi's head down,which we both managed to dodge the broom.I angrily stomped up to him,and grabbed the broom making him stop.<br>\r\n\"Oh!So,you wanna play a game?\"He asked,which I tilted my head in confusion.<br>\r\n\"It's easy.Bye-bye.\"He then pulled the broom back,and hit me in the chest with it!<br>\r\n\"J'oh!\"I yelled in pain,as I was sent rolling down the hallway,but I stopped halfway,and landed on my back.The world was spinning around for a few seconds,while I was trying to get myself back up.<br>\r\n\"Alright,Cactine,you've gone to far this time!\"All three of the girls angrily said.<br>\r\n\"So,what?He'd survived.Besides I have a broom!What you ladies are going to do ab--Oh crap!\"I did a quick shake to my head,and I could see a dust cloud,with lots of punches being heard from it.Who knew they could be so rough?<br>\r\n\"Yo,Jake.Are you alright?\"I turned to see Tops,along with Zan and Snitch.They were still in their Pokemon form though.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Cactine hit me with a broom,and I was sent spinning down the hallway.\"I said,lifting up my chest.There was a red square on the center,and I could still feel the pain.<br>\r\n\"Oh!May I touch it!?\"Snitch said,as she raised her claws.Zan looked at her angrily.<br>\r\n\"Uh...I mean...ouch,that's gotta hurt.\"She then tried to hide her claws behind her back.<br>\r\n\"Anyways...do you guys play games?\"I asked.Snitch and Zan shrugged their shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I play this game called 'Street fighter 4'.You know it?\"Tops asked.<br>\r\n\"Pfft...are you kidding?I love that game!\"I yelled,as excited as ever.<br>\r\n\"Well now.Looks like i've found someone with my taste in fighting games.\"Tops said,giving an annoyed look at Zan and snitch,which they both looked at him angrily.<br>\r\n\"Uh...before you three start fighting,can you please show me your dorm,Tops?\"I asked,pushing Tops away from the girls.<br>\r\n\"Right!But I don't think you'll like it very much...\"</span></div></div>",

walls were black and the floor was purple.<br>\r\n\"Room mates...I have two of them.\"He corrected,rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...apparently,they decorated the room before I even got here.Why do you think my bed is the only thing blue in this room?\"He pointed towards his bed.He was right,everything was either black or purple,even the TV...which I started to get nervous.I also noticed,how there was only 2 beds.<br>\r\n\"What,if there is 2 beds in here,and if that one is your bed...then where does the leftover room mate sleep?\"I looked really confused.<br>\r\n\"They're twins,dude...they sleep together,since I took one of the beds.\"He said.<br>\r\n\"I see...besides the fact that you have twins that sleep in the same dorm...how about that game we talked about earlier?\"I took a seat on the floor,right next to the TV.<br>\r\n\"You bet!\"<br>\r\n************************<br>\r\nAbout an hour of game play,and me and Tops were still playing like there was no school tomorrow.I played as Ryu and Tops played as Ken.<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"He screamed,as he tried to do a jump kick,but I pressed the medium kick and punch buttons(Counter-attack)and he got hit,which ended the round.<br>\r\n\"No!\"He also screamed.I laughed very loud.<br>\r\n\"Yes!...No!\"I mocked.I have to admit,if you were standing there when he said that,you would have laughed too.<br>\r\n\"Pftt...yo,dude,that was cheap.\"He said,with a vein on his head.<br>\r\n\"Well,that's what happens when they put a counter feature on a street fighter game.\"I said,wiping a tear from my eye.<br>\r\n\"And that's what makes it cheap...\"He added,holding the controller angrily.<br>\r\n\"Hey,maybe we could play with some stuff in your room...\"I turned towards the clock...6:36.<br>\r\n\"We have plenty of time,anyways.\"I got up and started walking around the room,looking for something to play with.<br>\r\n\"Alright,but what can we play with?\"I scratched my head,but then I saw an umbrella near the door.<br>\r\n\"Oh!An umbrella!\"I quickly swopped it off the ground.It was quite large,and I had to hold it with two hands,and for some odd reason,it was shaped like a Mismagius.<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do with an umbrella?\"<br>\r\n\"Easy,my friend,anything can be done with a little imagination.Just hand me that marker.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright,but if Madame gets mad,it's on your head.\"He said,passing me the marker.<br>\r\n\"Watch this.\"I was very good at drawing,so I decided to draw,and what looks like the head of the umbrella...which I flinched and froze in place...when there was already the eyes and mouth of one...<br>\r\n\"Mind letting go of me now!?\"I screamed,which I quickly let go of it,and it floated in the air,which it then gave me an unwelcome frown.<br>\r\n\"Friend of Tops,I presume?\"She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes,he is,and your scaring him.\"Tops said,stepping by my side,which calmed me down.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...another friend who's...wait a minute...your that human that transferred here.Your a strange little kid,i'll give you that.You almost drew on my face.\"She said,smiling.<br>\r\n\"Um...sorry,how was I suppose to know you were an umbrella?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Pfft...I get mistaken for an umbrella a lot.I'm Madam,nice to meet you.I would shake your hand,but I don't have any.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh...so wake in comedy...\"Tops rolled his eyes again.<br>\r\n\"Wait,wait...why is your name sound very close to the other one?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"That's because we're twins...or closely twins.\"<br>\r\n\"Why closely?\"<br>\r\n\"Because,you can see her right behind you.\"I quickly turned around,to see some sort Mismagius figure appearing out of the wall.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...can you believe how brutal some of the dark type can be?Jezz!\"She angrily said...somehow stepping out of the portal.<br>\r\nThis one was strange,she still has the cloak and features of a Mismagius,but I could see stubby legs coming out from below it.Not only that she was about a head taller,and those extensions on the sides,acted like arms.<br>\r\n\"Oh...I can see what you mean by closely...\"I said,dropping a bead of sweat.<br>\r\n\"Oh!Hi!Didn't see you there.Your that transfer student,nice to meet you.\"She said,holding out one of the extensions,which almost hit my face.I could now see that she had a wide bust,which poked out a little from the cloak.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...nice to meet you too...um,Tops,can we speak in private?\"I lowered the extension,as gently as possible.<br>\r\n\"Uh...why?\"He asked,which I quickly yanked on his pants,and pulled him with me,towards the outside of the dorm.<br>\r\n\"Can we come?\"Both the sisters asked.<br>\r\n\"This is private!What do you think?\"Tops angrily asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"NO!\"Tops then slammed the door closed.<br>\r\n\"Alright...why do you hate them so much?They seem pretty nice.\"I started.<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?I despise their attitudes.\"He said,hitting a trashcan with his foot on the word despise.<br>\r\n\"Worse part is,I can't do anything about that.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a fighting type,and fight-type moves can't hit ghost-types.Not only that,they both know--\"We both heard the door creek open,which we saw the sisters with their eyes all watery.I slammed the door closed this time.<br>\r\n\"They both know Physic-type moves.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow,seems like your at a true disa--\"The door creaked open again,this time they were smiling goofy.Tops slammed the door again.<br>\r\n\"Disadvan--\"They swung open the door,which they frowned.I slammed the door closed.<br>\r\n\"Disadvantage.I also gotta say,they are very ca--\"Why do they keep flinging the door open?This time they looked like they were sleeping,and before we could do anything,they slammed the door closed.Next thing we know,they kept doing the same thing,but with a different expression every time.<br>\r\n\"Car--toon--y--I will see you later...\"I said,walking away.I instantly I heard girlish laughter,and angry yelling,behind me.It didn't take long,before I heard laughter of a different kind.<br>\r\n\"1337 funniness!\"That sounded like Bum.<br>\r\n\"Pfft...of course dude.I am famous around the school.\"That sounded like Chum.<br>\r\n\"Your not funny!Why would you paint all over the walls!?\"Sounded like a real ticked off Mily.I ignored the conversation,and kept walking down the hallways,with my hands in my pockets.<br>\r\n*********************<br>\r\nI soon meet up with Azu,Spiny,Toots,and Mushi,all in their Pokemon anthro forms.I was teaching them more about the Pokedex entries...and they seemed to shiver at the Vileplumes entry,but they calmed down when I read most of the others.<br>\r\n\"Hm...besides Vile's entry on her species...everything else seems to be just right,except for Lilligants...but yeah,everything seems to be on the spot.\"Mushi said.<br>\r\n\"Are they spying on us?\"Spiny asked,looking left and right,before her eyes turned into swirls.<br>\r\n\"They aren't spying.They made this stuff up,and what do you know,it's exactly how everyone acts at this school...a little...it's just a coincidence.\"I said,which calmed down Spiny.Heck,I even got afraid of what to say.<br>\r\n\"Um...does it say anything about Carvanhas,by any chance?\"Toots asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure,why?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"That.\"Azu pointed towards her tail,which I could see three of them,angrily chomping on her tail.<br>\r\n\"Um...you might wanna take those off,because their teeth can rip though a boat hull...and--\"<br>\r\n\"Really?They tickle.\"Azu giggled.<br>\r\n\"Azu,I really think you should get those off,before they rip your tail off.\"Mushi said.<br>\r\n\"Alright,alright...\"Azu placed Toots on Mushi's bed,and walked off...giggling.<br>\r\n\"Um...Jake,I have a question.\"Spiny raised her hand.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh...what did she say again?</span></div></div>",

and my parents could get here any minute.<br>\r\n\"-Come on,where are they?-\"I thought,looking down the hallways over and over.Suddenly,I heard an engine of some sort,which I looked out a window,and saw my mom's SUV driving on the road,some distance away.My mouth started to quiver,and I was shivering like mad.<br>\r\n\"Yo,dude.Is everything,alright?\"I quickly turned to see Tops and Cactine both in their human forms.First time i've seen Tops in his human form.He had tanned skin,a blue V-neck shirt,black pants,and was wearing a blue beanie cap,which I could see light brown hair,pouring down the sides.He was also holding Madam in his hands,and she was acting as a still umbrella.<br>\r\n\"Oh,thank goodness...wait,where are the girl,besides her?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Mushi,Azu,Toots got very nervous and fainted,Spiny still acts like a Spinda in her human form,so we locked her up in her room,Zan was too lazy,Snitch didn't care,Madame acts too goofy,so I tied her up,and we got afraid of Vile and Cactine,here,may start fighting and break their watches.Girls...what are ya gonna do?\"Tops explained,shrugging his shoulders.I sighed,out of nervousness,and annoyance.<br>\r\n\"Tough luck...I guess.\"Cactine said.<br>\r\n\"Well,my parents are here anyways,so let's just get this over with.\"I said,taking Madam into my own hands.Tops and Cactine opened the doors,which I could immediately see my sister,waving at me,on her tiptoes.<br>\r\n\"Alright,dudes follow my lead.\"Tops and Cactine both nodded their heads lightly.I then started to wave back,as we started walking to my mom's SUV.As soon as we got a good distance,I could easily make out my sisters figure.<br>\r\nShe seemed a little TOO over grown for her age,standing naturally at my height,and having wide hips.She had tan skin like mines,and has blue eyes.She also wears a white shirt,with the long sleeves being the colors of the rainbow,red khakis and white sandals.She has long,darkly colored hair,that reached past her butt,too.Get this,she's only 11...<br>\r\n\"Hello!Jake!I'm so glad to see you!\"She said,ramming right into my body,giving me a hug.<br>\r\n\"Aw...that's very touching.\"Tops said,kinda sarcastic.<br>\r\n\"Hi,Jacklyn...uh...where's mom and dad?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"They are still in the car.They are going to wait for us,while we tour the school.\"She said,letting go of me,which me,and my friends made confused faces.<br>\r\n\"Uh...who are these guys?They dress weirdly.\"Jacklyn got a closer look at Tops.<br>\r\n\"Hey,gal,you dress weirdly yourself,but besides that,i'm Tops,and that's Cactine.\"Tops said,giving an angry look at Jacklyn.<br>\r\n\"Well,jeez...take a chill pill once in a while,okay?\"She said,pinching Tops on both of his cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Oh stuff,dude...I think you're being told on by a lady.\"Cactine laughed.As soon as she let go of Tops,she ran to the front of the school doors.<br>\r\n\"Hehe...serves you right...\"Madam whispered,which Tops instantly grabbed her by the neck,and held her like a bat.<br>\r\n\"Ding-ding...go time.\"He then started to stomp closer to Jacklyn.<br>\r\n\"Dude,du-dude!We're in a public place!Do that when we're at Jake's house.\"Cactine said,as he grabbed Tops from under his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Hey,let me go!\"Tops dropped Madam and she fell hard on her face.<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*Try to calm down Tops,please,I will take care of the tour.\"I said,as I grabbed Madam off the ground,and held her body over my head.I soon met up with my sister at the school's doors,and I opened them,seeing many people,who are dressing like Pokemon,playing around and talking to each other.Oh right,I forgot to explain.During school,it was announced that everyone must be in their human forms today,because of my visitor.Luckily,everyone agreed,and some were even excited.<br>\r\n\"Wow!There's so many people!Hi world!\"Some of them waved back,some of them said hi,and some didn't do anything.<br>\r\n\"Hi!\"That voice sounded familiar.It sounded like Mushi,which I could see Spiny and Mushi heading this way.Spiny was holding Mushi over her head...and Mushi was sitting in Spiny's hands,somehow.Spiny was perfectly walking,with no tilt or tumble either.<br>\r\n\"Hello.You must be Jake's brother.Am I right?\"Mushi asked.<br>\r\n\"Right,and you must be Japanese,right?\"Jacklyn asked,which Mushi started blushing,Spiny giggled,and I started blushing,too.<br>\r\n\"It's so glad to meet you!You look like an energetic type.\"Spiny said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks,you look energetic,too.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...before you two start squealing,can we please get on with the tour.\"I said.<br>\r\n\"Of course.That way,Spiny.\"Mushi pointed,which Spiny instantly started running down the hall,she pointed to.I quickly caught up beside them,hearing my sister complaining,about how we are going too fast.<br>\r\n\"Nice job,girls.How did you get Spiny to balance,so well?\"<br>\r\n\"It's easy!All I needed was something to carry to balance,and Mushi here was the perfect weight!\"<br>\r\n***************<br>\r\n\"Careful,sis...you don't wanna call her tubby.\"I nudged Jacklyn.<br>\r\n\"Too late...hello,tubby!\"Apparently,like my first day of school,we found Azu in the Cafeteria,munching on some food,but as soon as she said tubby,Azu turned around and snapped a plate in half...which made me and Jacklyn shiver.Mushi and Spiny went to the principal,so they could warn him that my sister is here,instead of my parents.<br>\r\n\"I could see,which side of the family you get your personality from.\"Azu said.<br>\r\nAzu,in her human form,was paled skin,a blue long sleeved shirt,white polka dot pants,and she had pink hair,with ponytail extensions,that made it look like her ears were going through her head.She still had that,slightly plushy figure.My sister was frozen stiff,and her mouth was gaped open.<br>\r\n\"Ahem...\"Madam coughed silently,which I stepped in.<br>\r\n\"Azu,this is my sister,Jacklyn.\"I greeted.<br>\r\n\"Oh so,this is your sister?Hm...nice to meet you.\"Azu held out a hand,but instead,Jacklyn crossed her legs.<br>\r\n\"I have to pee...where are the bathrooms?\"She asked,constantly bouncing up and down.<br>\r\n\"I'll show you the bathrooms.This way,please.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,but please don't scare me like that,again.\"The only walked a few steps,before they turned a corner,out of site.<br>\r\n\"AHHAHAHAHA!BWAHAHAHAHA!\"Madam busted out laughing.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,hahaha...i've never seen someone so scared to need to go to the bathroom.\"She said,wiping a tear from her eye.<br>\r\n\"She has a little bit of a bladder problem when she gets scared,heck I did it myself a few times.\"I said,sticking a tongue out.Soon we both heard a toilet flush,and she got back into her umbrella stiffness,and I grabbed her out of the air.<br>\r\n\"Um...I don't think,I wanna stay any longer.\"Jacklyn said,poking her head from behind a corner.<br>\r\n\"Aw...why?\"I said...even though I really wanted her to leave.<br>\r\n\"First of all,I am afraid of someone like Azu will scare me again,and second,your umbrella is starting to scare me.So,uh...yeah...I will see you...next visit.\"She said,quickly vanishing.I sighed of relief,after hearing a large door open,and then close quickly.I also heard many people say bye,as she walked out.<br>\r\n\"I'm scary?\"Madam said,as she slowly floated by my side.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,your not scary at all.She hasn't seen an umbrella shaped like you.\"</span></div></div>",

it.<br>\r\n\"Madame...can you please,stop going through the same portal over and over...\"I said.Right now,Madame was falling through a portal on the floor,and kept reappearing on a portal above the one on the floor.She didn't respond,however.<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna hear you entry,or not?\"I asked,which she instantly stopped in the air.<br>\r\n\"Entry?What entry?\"She asked,as the portals disappeared.<br>\r\n\"What,like a journal entry?\"Madam asked,floating by my side.<br>\r\n\"No.Like a Pokedex entry.It's info about the Pokemon species itself.\"I said,pulling out my DS.<br>\r\n\"Oh!Can I read!?\"Madam disappeared,but soon it got very dark,and I couldn't see the room anymore.I suspected something,the moment something soft hit my head.<br>\r\n\"Madam!Get off my head!\"I yelled,which I could see again,and she slowly placed her body on the floor,with teary eyes.Hm...strange...how could I miss the outline of her bust,along the line of the crystals?Good thing they are averagely sized,but the crystals were placed a little bit too suggestive... <br>\r\n\"Since when did you have a bust,Madam?\"She looked down,then back up.<br>\r\n\"Ever since we meet...or was that earlier...I don't know,I forgot.\"I hit myself on the head,with my free hand.<br>\r\n\"Did a fly get on your head?\"Madame asked.<br>\r\n\"No,I just...ugh,never mind.Look I have the entry right here.Do you want me to re--\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"They both squealed,and were instantly eye to eye with me.I pushed them both back,and I turned to my DS.<br>\r\n\"Alright,alright...Mismagius...It's cries sound like incantation.It is said to rarely be imbued with happiness giving power.\"They both frowned.<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound right at all...\"Madame said...a little disappointed.<br>\r\n\"It also says that their cries cause headaches and hallucinations.\"<br>\r\n\"Now that sounds perfect!\"I raised my eyebrows,out of confusion.<br>\r\n\"Okay...how do you know?\"<br>\r\n\"Because the day before school,we both sang to Tops and he said that he got a headache and started seeing things.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh...don't sing...ever...okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright,but can I still do this?\"Madame stood up,and a portal instantly appeared under here,and above her,quickly doing what she was doing before.<br>\r\n\"Hey,I wanna join too!\"Madam held out one of those extensions,and instantly disappeared with Madame and they were falling over and over and over,again and again,it was making me dizzy.I sweat-dropped.I have to admit,it did look kinda fun,but I will get sick,if I kept falling.<br>\r\n\"So anyways,Jake,what's this?\"Madam appeared next to me,with my bag of textbooks in it.<br>\r\n\"That's my bag,Madam,can I have it back?\"I held out my hand.<br>\r\n\"Um...let me think...you have to catch us first.\"She quickly went back into the portal!Worse of all,with my bag!<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"I jumped into the portal,quickly coming into contact with some kind of black smoke,which instantly vanished the moment I touched it.I did a quick shake to my head,seeing...something...I really can't explain it.It was like I was inside the school...like REALLY inside the school walls.There were tons of pipes,and other stuff,and for some odd reason,my senses were heighten and I could hear any footsteps,or anything touching the wall in that matter.Soon,I noticed that I had a white outline,and you could see right through me.<br>\r\n\"Funny,I didn't really expect someone to actually go through the portal.\"Quickly turning,I saw Madam and Madame,both having the same outlines as me.<br>\r\n\"Uh...what the heck is going on?\"I scratched my head.<br>\r\n\"Your inside the school!In here you practically invisible,and untouchable.It's how me and my sister get through the school.\"Madame explained,while I snatched my bag away from Madam.<br>\r\n\"Okay,so how do I get out?\"<br>\r\n\"Just go through that walls,like so.\"They both ran through the walls,which I was quite unsure before about that.I soon got my courage up,and ran through the wall,quickly coming in contact with the black smoke again,and after it disappeared,I was back to my normal shape and outline.I

attention to what the girls were doing behind me.<br>\r\n\"Okay...ladies,we need to get to bed,it's 9:15.\"<br>\r\n\"Ayko,doog eyb.\"They said,before disappearing in the floor.I felt as if three question marks shot out of my head,throught the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"What did they say?\"<br>\r\n\"They said \"Okay,good bye\" backwards.They are very good at it too.See ya tomorrow,dude,I need to get

for our teacher.<br>\r\n\"Heh...luckily,we got to sit on the benches this time.\"Tops said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,you said it.My legs hurt the last time.\"I laughed.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,how did you get into PHS?\"<br>\r\n\"When I was helping my mom to pick which school I go to,I chose this one because of the funny name.I rarely saw any other signatures on the list,so my mom put me in.Nobody told us it was a school for Pokemon,however.\"I explained.Tops looked at me questionably.<br>\r\n\"Our school name is funny?\"He asked.<br>\r\n\"Pokey high school.Pokey?I thought it would be a school who's mascot was a dot.\"<br>\r\n\"Pfft...what a coincidence it wasn't.\"<br>\r\n\"But it would have been funny,though.\"Soon the gym doors opened,and before I could even look at them,a Mienshao appeared.This was our teacher,and she was always 10 minutes late,by Tops's record.<br>\r\n\"Alright,class,today is another round of head-to-head battling.\"I crossed my arms,and pouted.<br>\r\n\"Great,now I have to sit through another class,freezing in place.\"I mocked myself.<br>\r\n\"At least you wouldn't have to sit through a whole class,just sitting here.\"Tops said.We both did a short laugh,next thing we both know,we were both whip on the sides of our arms!There was nothing there!<br>\r\n\"Ow!What the heck happened?\"Tops asked.<br>\r\n\"Mienshao's are very good at combats.Their attacks are so fast,that they are invisible.She probably used that baggy fur on her arms as whips.\"I explained,as I rubbed my arms.<br>\r\n\"Now,pair up with a partner and go stand on a mat.\"The Mienshao said.Was that the reason,why the other classes were outside?<br>\r\n\"Hey,dude.How about you and me this time.\"Tops said,pulling up his pants.<br>\r\n\"Sure!Let's do this!\"I said,giving a competition like stare,which he did the same.We both got off the benches,and starting heading towards a random mat,which we both agreed on one soon,and we both got in our battle position.We were both so hyped about battling,but then Zan stepped into the middle,with her arms flailing.<br>\r\n\"Hey,what about me!?\"Zan cried.<br>\r\n\"You can go with Snitch.It seems pretty even,since you both have claws.\"Tops said,pointing to Snitch who was still on the bench,but she shivered when Tops pointed to her.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,she does.\"When I looked over the bench,I saw Snitch was gone,but Zan didn't mind,for she walked off.<br>\r\n\"Uh...Snitch is gone,dude.\"I said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,she's probably hiding in a closet as usual.\"Tops said.Soon some weird thing beeped out loud,which I instantly knew what it was.I got back into my battle position,and so did Tops.The weird thing beeped again,which I tightened my focus to only the match happening.<br>\r\n\"Ya'll ready for this?\"Tops asked.I knew what song he was joking about.Soon the thing beeped again,but it was a different tone,which I ran towards Tops,and he did the same.Unfortunately,soon enough,we both missed our punches and instead,hit each other with our foreheads.The force was great enough to make us both do tiny bunny hops,on one leg,backwards.<br>\r\n\"Well,that didn't go so well...\"We both said,as we both stood on two feet again.<br>\r\n\"Round 2...go!\"I said,which Tops quickly tried to sweep my legs,but I jumped back and slide tackled his legs,making him trip forward.He got back up,but on his head this time,and started spinning rapidly fast,then he dashed up to me,but I quickly sidestepped it,making him...turning around and coming back,which I had to jump to dodge it.He came back again,but after I jumped to dodge it,I flung both of my arms,hands open,into his spinning death.The moment I felt something hit my hands,I closed them,making him stop his spinning,with a confused face.<br>\r\n\"Wow...now that's cheap.\"He said,which I let go of his leg...for some odd reason.I don't know,maybe I wanted to see more of his moves?Why did I let go of his legs.Besides that,he got back up onto two feet,and did a swift kick to my side,but luckily I blocked it before that could happen.<br>\r\n\"You seem the have a lot of energy,Jake,are you even human?\"He joked.<br>\r\n\"No,I am an intellectual being from the planet 9000.\"I joked back.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a joke,dude.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...right.Well,let's continue.\"Hm...funny,it was like as,if we paused in real life.Anyways,Tops tried to do another leg sweep,but I did the same,and our legs connected with each other,which we both stood there...with our eyes watery.The pain was unbelievably horrible,I couldn't even explain it!We both slowly backed off from each other,before hoping on one leg,holding the other one,screaming our heads off about how much it hurt!<br>\r\n\"Yo dude,I think we can call this a draw.\"I suggested.<br>\r\n\"No.After this punch.\"Tops said,trying to punch me in the stomach,but I did the same,which both of our hand hit each other.The pain was just unbelievable as the leg kick,which we both started flailing our hands up and down.<br>\r\n\"Okay,I give,it's a draw.\"He said.<br>\r\n\"Same here...draw.\"I repeated.<br>\r\n\"What!?No way!This can't be a draw.\"We both say our teacher,who looked really into the battle.<br>\r\n\"Sorry,ma'am,but we think too alike,and we did the exact same moves.I don't think we could take it anymore.\"Tops said,pointing to his red hand.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...fine,but let me warn you two,that this is the only draw you'll have.\"She said,as she walked off,with her nose held high.<br>\r\n\"Jeez,what's her problem?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"She believes that no fight could end in a draw,and only one will stand victor.If we ever fight again,one of us will win...and then we can see who's more cheap.\"Tops said,giving a silly smile,which I punched him in the arm.<br>\r\n\"You know,I think your silliness will get the best of you,dude.\"<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n\"Thanks,Bella.\"I said,as Bella sprayed the last of the medicine on my arm.Ping and Ming were trying to see,if there were any problems on my legs,which they currently found none.Maxwell was keeping a close eye on his sisters.<br>\r\n\"N-n-no problem...it's what's friends do after another...right?\"She said,blushing.<br>\r\n\"Well,there are no problems with your legs.\"Ming said,still poking at them.<br>\r\n\"It was only one leg,why did you check both?\"Max asked.<br>\r\n\"Because,your legs are fit for a handsome--\"Max pulled out his peashooter,before Ping could finish.<br>\r\n\"I mean,fit for a marathon...yeah,a marathon,that's what I meant.\"Ping tried to hide behind Ming.<br>\r\n\"Anyways,since I am as good as new,come on Bella.\"I said,picking up Bella,who was blushing extremely harsh.<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\"She asked.<br>\r\n\"Well,Snitch interrupted when I was trying to introduce out other friends,so I want you to meet my 'good' friends.\"I said,carrying Bella on my shoulder,and I walked out.<br>\r\n\"Wait!We wanna come too!\"Ping and Ming said,behind my back.<br>\r\n\"No!\"Max said,right before I heard something shoot out of a peashooter.<br>\r\n\"T-T-They seem very interested in you,J-J-Jake.\"Bella said,sitting on my shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,you'll be surprised about how crazy they are for me.\"</span></div></div>",

Mushi turned towards Bella,which we saw that she was wrapped in some kind of black aura,with a dark portal under her,which she was soon sucked down into,before me or Mushi could do anything.<br>\r\n\"Whoa,holy cloak!Bella!\"Mushi screamed.Suddenly,Madam appeared from the portal on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Madam?What's going on?Where's Bella?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Bella?Is that the girl that almost killed me and my sister?\"Madam asked,as she lowered her hat,which Bella slid onto the ground,tied up,and shivering.<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"Mushi asked,as she started nibbling on Bella's rope capture,which it soon snapped,and Bella tried hiding in Mushi's wingspan.<br>\r\n\"Nothing much.I was going to take her into my dorm,so I could scare that cotton off of her,but with all that kicking she did,I couldn't handle it,so I tied her up.Bye now!\"Madam sunk back into the portal,which it vanished behind her.<br>\r\n\"Wait!Madam!Ugh...why is she so quick?\"I asked,myself.<br>\r\n\"I don't know,but Bella seems to be a real squirmy.\"When I turned to Mushi,Bella was encased in Mushi's wingspan,but she seem to move a lot.It seemed even to much for Mushi.<br>\r\n\"Can I have a little help,please.\"Mushi was kicking on of her leg like a dog.<br>\r\n\"-Oh man...how are we going to put up with her?-\"<br>\r\n************************<br>\r\nAfter a long time trying to calm Bella down from the ghost incident,me and Tops were just walking down the hallways,with our feet kicking into the air with each step.Kinda like a cartoon character.<br>\r\n\"So,dude.Where are we going,anyways?\"I asked.Tops said that he wanted to show me something special.<br>\r\n\"Today is Wednesday,so today is the teachers' dinner night.\"Tops said,as a drop of drool slipped from his mouth.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'Teacher's dinner night'?Are students not allowed?\"Tops rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n\"Well,yes,but--\"I stopped right in my tracks.<br>\r\n\"Then what the heck are you trying to do!?Get us in trouble!?\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I knew you were going to say something like that.Dude,i'll only do this one time.I promise I won't drag you into this,ever again.\"I started thinking things over and over,again.On one hand,this could definitely seal the deal on our friendship,but on the other we could get into major trouble for doing this.I thought...that friendship was more important than getting in trouble.<br>\r\n\"Alright,dude.But i'm not going to inspire you in anyway,nor am I going to do this ever again.\"I said,wiggling a finger.<br>\r\n\"Yes!Your the best!All you have to do is wait here,and,if any teacher comes,just bang on the door.\"Tops entered through a door,which was specifically the Cafeteria doors.I stood next to them,constantly keeping my ears peeked for any kind of footsteps.<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\nIt's been like...what...10 minutes,ever since he started sneaking food?Dang,how long does it take to just sneak food,you're not suppose to be eating!?I'm starting to get really scared now,what if somebody just appeared out of nowhere,and saw me doing this!?What if I get in trouble and get suspended!?What if--<br>\r\n\"Jake,what are you talking about?\"I snapped out of my thoughts,and I looked up to see...Mily!Oh crap!<br>\r\n\"Hey!Eh...what did you say?\"I asked,doing a light tap against the door with my foot,hoping Tops had heard it.<br>\r\n\"I said,what are you talking about?You were saying something about getting in trouble,and suspension.\"Was I thinking out loud!?<br>\r\n\"Oh,sorry.I was just in my train of thought.Sorry,if I worried you in anyway.\"I said,rubbing the back of my head.<br>\r\n\"It's alright,but you shouldn't be thinking here.There's something secret going on,that you're not suppose to find out.\"She said,putting a leafy arm to my chest.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,well,a little bird told me about it.I wasn't paying that much attention to him.\"I was trying to refer to my art teacher,which was a Chatot.<br>\r\n\"That dang Chatot!I'm going to solorbeam him one day.Anyways,you should probably leave,before someone comes.\"She said entering the doors to the Cafeteria.I quickly started stepping away,until...<br>\r\n\"Jake...can you come here for a second?\"I quickly froze in place,and I almost fell over doing it too.I didn't wanna go,but something was forcing me to move my body,and walk into the Cafeteria.The first thing I saw was Mily,and then I turned towards the main tables,which was pretty

feet.From every curve,to every bump.It's real easy once you learn and practice.After about...5 minutes I had drawn a Mawile,with it's giant mouth on it's back facing us.It looked real evil with the pencil shading I did on it.<br>\r\n\"-Blah...never wanna mess with that.-\"I thought,actually chuckling at my mental quote.As soon as I picked up my pencil,I heard the doorknob being turned,which I turned to the door,seeing that...an anthro Mawile walk through the door.<br>\r\nThis one had a normal outline for a girl,although she did seem decently busty.Her half brown,half black arms made it look like she had gloves on,and that giant jaw on the back of her head,was in the form of a pony tail,which touched the ground.It looked normal,but I wasn't gonna be fooled by that thing!When she turned to me,she had a surprised face.<br>\r\n\"Oh,hi!Your that human boy that got sent to this school,right?Nice to meet you.\"She said,waving.Even with her waving,I could see that giant pony tail smile,and showed it's razor sharp teeth,before looking like a ponytail,again.It made me shiver.<br>\r\n\"I wasn't expecting someone to come to class,this early.\"<br>\r\n\"I've been doing it,ever since school started.It's kinda my habit.\"I said,do a short wave back to her.<br>\r\n\"Really?Me too!\"She said.<br>\r\n\"Well,then,get comfortable,because the teacher isn't going to be here for a few minutes.\"I then realized something,I didn't see her on Tuesday,which was the last time i've been in the art room.<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...how come you--\"I paused.The moment I looked back at the door,she disappeared!<br>\r\n\"Over here.Sorry,for the speedy entry.\"I looked back at the other side of the table,and saw that Mawile girl,again.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,uh...forget what I was saying earlier.How can you move so fast,with that ponytail monster on your head?\"I asked.She gave a distasteful look at me.<br>\r\n\"For your information,he is not a monster.He's just playful.\"She said,as the ponytail smiled,again.<br>\r\n\"And he's very lightweight.He's no trouble at all.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh I see...well...uh...I don't know what else to say.\"I said,paying attention to my sketches.<br>\r\n\"Oh!Wha'cha drawing?\"She asked,as tried to bend over the table to see,which made a creaking noise,while it moved upwards a little.<br>\r\n\"YA!D-D-DA!I don't think,you should do that.\"I quickly said,pushing the Mawile back into her seat,which the table returned to it's normal position.<br>\r\n\"Alright,Mrs.curious,here.It's just a random sketch.\"I handed her my sketch,which she took it,and looked at it very harshly.She must be a little too serious with art.<br>\r\n\"Wow!This is very good!How did you know,I looked this evil when I was a baby?\"I blushed,as she asked that.<br>\r\n\"No,no,no,it's just a random sketch.I just got bored.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"It's...alright.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,while we wait here,how's about we draw a picture for trade?\"She said,pulling out a sketchbook,and a pencil.<br>\r\n\"Uh...what do you mean by trade?\"I asked,pulling out a better sharpened pencil.<br>\r\n\"It's simple.I draw a picture for you,and you draw a picture for me.Get the picture?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright...so what do we draw?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know...um...how about a random picture of a any Pokemon.By the way,i'm Mali.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake,now let's get drawing.\"<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n\"I got to admit,Jake,your picture almost made me puke out of my friend here.That was really scary!\"Mali said.<br>\r\n\"Whoops...a little bit too much on the eyes and shading,I suppose.\"I said,as I rubbed my head.Right now,me and Mali were sitting at a lunch table,or the one that my friends like to sit at.<br>\r\n\"What hat?\"We both heard,turning to the two seats in front of us,which we saw Mushi and Azu sitting in those two seats.Toots was sitting on the tray Azu was using.<br>\r\n\"Oh,hi girls,I want you to meet Mali.\"I greeted,as Mali waved to all three of them.<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!A Mawile!\"Toots said,as she examined Mali's ponytail friend.<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...where's your jaw?\"Toots climbed the ponytail.How did she not notice the smile?<br>\r\n\"Well,it's good to meet yo--\"We were interrupted when we heard something hit hard against the wall.We all turned towards the sound,seeing Spiny just hit her head on a trash can.There was a big bump on her head,and she was rubbing it in pain.<br>\r\n\"That girl over there is Spiny.\"I said.<br>\r\n\"She's a little off balanced on everything,just stay out of her way,and you should be fine.\"Azu said,stuffing a sandwich in her mouth.Soon,something ran straight into Azu's stomach,which made her spit the sandwich out.<br>\r\n\"Your ponytail was about bite my tail!\"Toots screamed,from under the table.Mali did a shy giggled,as she elbowed the head jaw from behind her.<br>\r\n\"Sorry,he has a mind of his own.\"<br>\r\n\"Mind of his own?I thought Mawile's jaws are connected with the body itself.\"Mushi said,tiling her head in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Well...mines have a mind of his own.\"Mali crossed her arms.<br>\r\n\"By the way,where is Cactine and Vile?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"They've been training...a little too harshly.\"Mushi seemed to put on a scared expression,when she said that.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...can those two ever get along?\"<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n\"U-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-um...n-n-nice t-t-to meet you ma'am...\"Bella said,shivering like crazy on Top's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Whoa,jeez!Your gonna make me fall over from shivering!\"Tops said,holding Bella in his hands.<br>\r\n\"Hm...very shy girl,I see.\"Mali said.<br>\r\n\"Well,anyways,nice to meet you,Mali.\"Tops greeted.<br>\r\n\"Out of the way,jerkbutts!\"We all heard,right before we were all tripped,by Cactine,holding a broom.He was in his Human form,and he was moving incredibly fast,too.<br>\r\n\"Get back here!\"Vile screamed,running past us,but stopped and turned to us.<br>\r\n\"Hi strange girl.\"She waved,as her eyes turned into a happy expression,but then into a very angry one,as she ran through the halls Cactine just ran by.<br>\r\n\"See what I mean,Mali?When will those two ever get along?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Jake,do you see it?\"Mushi whispered.Right now,me and Mushi were in the library,trying to find a book on Mawiles.I was on this big scrolling ladder,about a few feet off the ground,and I could see why this is useful,because the bookshelves were thick and high,almost taller than the moveable ladder.<br>\r\n\"No...we are in the Fighting-types.Move to the left.\"I whispered,tightening my grip on the ladder.Soon,the ladder started moving to the left,which I already knew Mushi was pushing it on the side.We soon stopped,which I saw many books,filled with a gray like cover,which is the signature color of steel types.I kept looking and looking,until I looked up,seeing a book with a normal Mawile on it,so I climbed higher up the ladder,until I was on the highest step.I could barely reach it,and I had to stand on my tip toes.<br>\r\n\"Jake,be careful!\"Mushi whispered.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,Mushi,I got it!Plus,I have cat like reflexes!\"I replied,as I grabbed the book,but as soon as I did,I heard a tiny crack,which I looked down at my feet,and then...everything thing went black and white.It was like slow-motion all of a sudden,for I could see the bar right under my feet,snapping in half,slowly under my feet.I tried to grab onto the shelves,but I was moving in slow motion,too,meaning that I wasn't fast enough before the bar completely broke under my feet,sending me falling backwards.I closed my eyes,everything went silent...until...<br>\r\n\"Cat like reflexes...pfft,my left foot.\"I opened my eyes,seeing that some kind of was covering my waist.<br>\r\n\"Jake!Oh my god,are you okay!?\"Mushi screamed,covering her mouth.Luckily,there was no one there.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,i'm fine.Uh...\"I traced the leaf,towards the top of the bookshelf,seeing that it was a...anthro female Sunflora!?<br>\r\nHow come every anthro I meet,are female?Her head was quite large,and that was the only thing I saw about her,for now.How did I know it was an anthro?Her eyes are open,and I could see blue eyes.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay,Mr.Whiskers?\"She asked.<br>\r\n\"Mr.Whiskers?Who's that?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Isn't that you name?You have a lot of whiskers on your head.\"<br>\r\n\"It's just my hair.\"<br>\r\n\"It is!?Whoops...sorry Mr.\"She then extended her leafy arm,just enough until I could stand on my feet.<br>\r\n\"Jake,what's that leaf?\"Mushi asked.<br>\r\n\"It's her.\"I pointed upwards,towards the Sunflora,which she waved her other arm in response.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for saving Jake.\"The Sunflora then jumped off the bookshelf,and landed on the ground in between us.<br>\r\nI could see her whole body now.She still had the body of one,and the leafs of one,but I could see a bust,that was noticeable.What made me wonder the most,was her legs...feet...toes?I don't know,they look like giant feet,with no ankles,or legs,and judging by the curve of the bottom,she standing on her tip toes.Even on her tip toes,she about a head taller than me.Why is almost everyone taller then me?<br>\r\n\"So you name is,Jake!Nice to meet you,Mr.Jake.\"She said,grabbing my hand and shaking my hand up and down.<br>\r\n\"By the way,you dropped this.\"The Sunflora handed me the book on Mawiles.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.What's your name?\"Mushi asked.<br>\r\n\"My name is Ms.Fin.Nice to meet you.\"She said.<br>\r\n\"Is it Ms.Fin,or just Fin.\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"It's just Fin.By the way,why do you want that book?You're not a Mawile...or are you?\"Flower's green neck stretched behind me head.<br>\r\n\"Oh my,you have a long neck,Fin.\"Mushi said,poking Fin's neck.<br>\r\n\"It's not just my neck,it's all my body parts...see?\"Fin's leafy arms grew out,too!Even though they already touched the ground,they started pouring onto the ground,almost surrounding our feet.<br>\r\n\"Okay...uh...well,besides your over stretching body,let's learn more about Mawiles,Mushi.\"I said,already heading towards a table,making sure not to trip over Fin's long arms.Mushi soon caught up with me,and we both sat at a round table,quickly opening the book and scanning through the pages.At some moments,I would stop and look at the pictures.One that mostly caught my eye,was the base of the gender differences.It showed a normal one,then it showed the difference,in a boy and girl one,then it showed the difference in a Moemon,which is something I didn't even know about.Finally,we got towards the the part,where it says info on the species.<br>\r\n\"Don't be fooled by it's cute looks.It makes the foes loosen the foe's guard and chomps down with it's huge jaw's,when least expected.\"Mushi read out loud,which,by the looks of her face,she knew that the big jaw was just fooling around when it smiled.<br>\r\n\"What's least expected?\"Fin appeared,from what seemed to be under the table.<br>\r\n\"Fin...uh...ugh,never mind,Mushi can you show Fin here Madam and Madame?\"I asked.They both had different expressions.Mushi gave a confused looked,while Fin gave me a really excited,but loving look.Not only that,two oval pink spot appeared near her mouth.<br>\r\n\"You really mean it?\"They both asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure,I mean,she's a great and happy girl,plus she's very useful in some situations that need it,so--\"<br>\r\n\"Let's go,Mushi!\"Fin had already taken Mushi and left...but shouldn't that be the other way around?<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*Girls...you never know what to expect from them?\"I shrugged,as I tried to follow them,as quickly as possible.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At night,around 8:30,me and Mushi were just now getting into bed,pulling the covers over ourselves.<br>\r\n\"So,how was Fin?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"She was little too hyper.She was always going in the wrong direction,but besides that,she was alright,a real sweet girl.\"Mushi replied,turning out the lights on her side of the room.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight,Jake.\"I turned out my lights off as well,but before I could say anything...<br>\r\n\"AARRRGGGGGHHHH!!Where's my hat!?\"Why am I not surprised,that it was Madame,yelling in very angry manner.<br>\r\n\"Sounds like Madame,but...her hat?\"I said,turning to Mushi,hoping she knows something.She just shrugged,which she and I quickly opened the dorm's door,seeing Tops was just about to knock on the door.<br>\r\n\"Oh,hey...uhh...can you guys help me?Madame lost her hat.\"Tops said,rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n\"She wears a hat?\"I asked,still confused.<br>\r\n\"Of course.Mismagius are always wearing those hats on top of their heads.What did you think it was?\"He asked.<br>\r\n\"We thought Mismagius hats were part of it,itself,but not--\"Mushi started,but Tops put his stubby hand,on her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Alright,I understand that,but I need your help!Madame is going head-over-butt crazy!She going to wake everyone up!\"We all heard some kind of thrash can get knocked over.<br>\r\n\"For some reason,I feel like I am in a video game,but besides that,we will help find her hat,befo--\"We all heard something get smashed down,like a wall or something.<br>\r\n\"Before she wakes someone up.\"I said,rushing out the door,which Mushi and Tops followed.<br>\r\nTurning three corners,we stopped,near the corner,which I looked around the corner,seeing that Madame's back was turned to us.The first thing I noticed,was her hair...it was very fluffy,and spiked around every spot.Two extensions,flowed down,past her shoulders.I could hear her breathing,harshly,and impatiently.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with her?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"She's very angry.She always get angry,when she looses her hat.She did this last year,and almost turned to school upside down!\"Tops said.<br>\r\n\"She did?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.It was brutal.\"Tops shivered,probably remembering what happened.Madame slowly started turning her head,making a snake like hiss,and her tongue was flailing like one.<br>\r\n\"Let me guess...we have to be careful not to get spotted,while finding the hat.\"Mushi stated to obvious.<br>\r\n\"Uh...right...\"<br>\r\n\"But wait...why isn't she rampaging like she did last year?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Because,it's nighttime.She's not mad,when it's night,but by the looks on her face,she is ticked off.Now,let's stop talking and find that hat,and make sure your not spotted,either.\"Tops said,giving a very determined expression.<br>\r\n\"Right.\"Me and Mushi said,which we all went in three different directions.<br>\r\n*************************<br>\r\n\"Crap,crap,crap!!\"I shouted under my breath.I can't believe it...it has been at least 2 hours,before I found myself,hiding under a desk,inside the Art room!Dude,you really don't know how scared I feel.Madame's in the room,and she is constantly looking around,left and right.Luckily,she isn't looking below her,or on the ground,not only that she is constantly moving around.I don't know,when she will leave,but I know,I have to get out,now!As soon,as I tried to lift an arm,I heard some kind of smelling noise.<br>\r\n\"I can smell you...your very near...I can tell your scared...\"I quickly sneaked towards the door,and quickly opening it,which she turned her head around,which I could see her eyes were completely yellow!<br>\r\n\"YOU--\"I closed the door behind me,before she could finish.I then pulled on the door as hard as I could,preventing her from escaping.She soon stopped,but she started saying really horrible things.Somehow,a purple hand shot out and grabbed my neck through the door.I quickly realized Madame was doing this.She wasn't choking me,but she did have a firm grip on my neck.A simple punch,made the door shatter into a dozen pieces.<br>\r\n\"Where's...my...hat...\"She growled,moving closer to me.For some odd reason,there was a second,and darker part of her cloak coming out from the original one.It covered her legs,but I can still make out the wide hips,for it was tightly hugging them,in a heart shape manner.<br>\r\n\"I don't know,but if you can calm down,we can--\"<br>\r\n\"Found it!\"We both turned,seeing Mushi holding a circular hat,and waving it happily.Madame's eye turned back to normal,but her cloak didn't.<br>\r\n\"My hat!\"Madame squealed,letting go of my neck,and tackling Mushi,and retrieving her hat from her.<br>\r\n\"Good save...Mushi.\"I said,rubbing my neck,in pain.<br>\r\n\"Jake,are you alright?\"Mushi asked,lifting me back on my feet.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,i'm fine,and it looks like Madame got a new design on her body.\"I said,still observing her body,but she was moving around too much.<br>\r\n\"Her mom dropped off her 'other' piece of her cloak.She told me when I introduced Fin to her.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,I see...but where's Tops?\"Mushi did a quick gasp.<br>\r\n\"Hey,Madame,where's Tops?\"Madame stopped flapping her arms.<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...hehe...I think I tied him up...and locked him in a closet...\"She started rubbing the back of her head,while I could see a big sweat-drop fall from her head.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Tops was right,you get very angry,when you lose your hat.It makes me think,that the evil side of you is controlled inside you from that hat,like in video games.\"</span></div></div>",

smaller each time he inhaled and exhaled.Right now,we are in algebra,and Tops has not helped with a single question,not to mention not copying any notes,that were still on the board.We were all assigned groups,to do several problems.<br>\r\n\"Hm?Huh?What?\"He asked,blindly,as the bubble popped.<br>\r\n\"Your gonna flunk this class,if you don't pay attention,Tops!\"Zan said.<br>\r\n\"Gragh...why does the world have algebra in it?\"Tops groaned,as he laid back in his chair,with his held pointing towards the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"Because,doofus,you at least need to know,what humans know.\"She said,tripping one of the legs of the chair,so Tops can fall on his back.<br>\r\n\"Ow!Well,you don't need to enforce it!Besides,algebra is boring as a rock.When will I need

did!I even found a belt with them!\"Tops stood upright.Originally,he was wearing black pants,but now,he was green khakis,and a black belt.The pants were a little baggy around his feet.<br>\r\n\"Jake,why did you try to change the subject?\"Zan said,giving me a look,which I could tell that see knew about it.<br>\r\n\"Heh...it was just so you two don't start brawling,in the

gold,in earth science class.Bella,and Madame were in the same class as well.<br>\r\n\"No,Madam...it's pyrite.\"Madam tilted her head.<br>\r\n\"So...pyrite is gold?\"Madame asked,poking the mineral.<br>\r\n\"No,it's fools gold!\"I barked,which Madame tiled her head.I sighed,as I banged my head on the table.<br>\r\n\"He's saying,that pyrite is not gold.\"Bella explained.The two were still looking at it carefully,not to mention that they weren't sitting in their seats...which is makes sense,because they have no legs...or at least one doesn't.<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I hope this makes things easier.\"I said.I can't believe that she's not afraid of Madam or Madame anymore,but she's still scared of any other ghosts.<br>\r\n\"No problem...by the way,did you see what happened in the halls last night?\"Bella asked,which I felt a bead of sweat fall down my hair.I can't let her know about that,she would be scared to death!<br>\r\n\"Um...no,I didn't...why?\"I lied.<br>\r\n\"Well...it sounded like something was rampaging through the halls...I even asked the hall monitors...but they said,that they didn't see anything.\"<br>\r\n\"-Wait a minute...-\"I started having a flashback to

bathroom,because I drank so much water.\"<br>\r\n\"So,you knocked over the trashcan in the hallway?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sorry,if I startled you.\"I can't believe that worked...<br>\r\n\"It's okay...but

and Tops avoided each other in P.E. class,but this time,I had to face against someone different...Azu.Azu...is more difficult than Tops,because no matter how much I punch her,none of them have affect.In fact,she isn't doing anything,but just standing around.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?Did your mom teach you,not to hit girls?\"She asked.<br>\r\n\"Is that a joke,or a question!?\"I yelled,angrily,as I continued my wave of punches.<br>\r\n\"It was a question...you remind me of Toots.\"<br>\r\n\"No!It's probably because...your blubber...is absorbing my attacks...making them...useless...\"I punched,every time I paused.<br>\r\n\"Are you calling me fat!?\"She was instantly in my face with her own,and she was pouting angrily.<br>\r\n\"Well...kinda...WHOA!\"I was almost hit in the head,with an iron tail!She swung at me again,but this time I jumped back.<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\"One second,she was a few feet away,then the next,she's right next to me again,giving me no opportunity to dodge the ice punch.She hit right in my stomach,which not only did it hurt,it started turning cold around me,very fast,then all of a sudden,I was frozen in place,IN A BLOCK OF ICE!!No matter how much I tried to move my body,it just wouldn't budge.<br>\r\n\"Heew eh...\"I manage to muffle.I said:Help me.I can clearly see the world around me,which I can see that Azu was laughing.<br>\r\n\"eits aht phueh!\"I said:it's not funny!<br>\r\n\"Right,right...sorry.Does this mean I win?\"She asked.<br>\r\n\"es,kow geh eh ow wof er,I haf oh ee!\"I said:Yes,now get me out of here,I have to pee!Really,I have to pee!It's been like the moment I froze!<br>\r\n\"Alright,hang on.\"Azu started swinging her tail above her head,which was getting faster and faster with every swing!<br>\r\n\"o,ish is ona ur!\"I said:Oh,this is gonna hurt!</span></div></div>",

got frozen.How do you feel?\"She asked,looking really worried.<br>\r\n\"I feel alright.I just had to pee really bad.\"I said.<br>\r\n\"Really?Strange...I didn't know,people had to use the bathroom when frozen.\"Fin's stem-like neck stretched out,so that her head was on the other side of me.<br>\r\n\"Eh...I didn't know either...wait a minute...today is Friday,right?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes,of course,but that's not what I really wanted to talk about.\"Fin's neck returned to normal.<br>\r\n\"Well,then talk about it on the way,because I want to get to the pool!\"I quickly started running,ahead of Fin...well,she clamped onto me with her leafy arms,and she was following,without her feet touching the ground.I quickly turned a corner,and headed straight for my dorm,which only took about a minute or two.I looked behind me,and I saw Fin's leafy arms...but they were stretching around a corner.<br>\r\n\"Jake...are you there...ugh...so...dizzy...\"Fin asked,as she stepped out from the corner,with her eyes swirls.<br>\r\n\"Yes.What do you want to talk about again?\"I asked,which I started to open the door,and I walked right in...uh...<br>\r\n\"GET OUT,YOU LITTLE SNEAK!!\"<br>\r\n\"WHA!!JAKE CLOSE THE DOOR!!I heard,which I instantly ran out of the door,and closed it behind me.<br>\r\n\"Mushi...who was that?\"A very angrily voice said.<br>\r\n\"Oh my wings...that was Jake.\"Mushi said,from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n\"Jake?You mean that human boy?What's he doing peeking into your room?\"The voice said.<br>\r\n\"He was probably trying to get in,for his swim shorts.\"Mali knew exactly,why I tried to enter.<br>\r\n\"Why is his shorts in here,did you catch him and rip them off?\"Why did that voice sounded like it did not like me?<br>\r\n\"No!I wouldn't do anything like that,he's my roommate!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...well,he should learn to knock once in a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Just wait for us outside,please.\"<br>\r\nSoon the door flung open,which I saw an anthro Maractus...and boy did she look mad.She had wide chest and hips,was about a head taller,and had a slim waistline.I couldn't see any legs,but the way her body was shaped past the hips,i'd say that she did have legs.The only thing she was wearing was a pink bow with polka dots,behind the yellow thorn on her forehead.<br>\r\n\"...\"She was giving me a very cold stare.<br>\r\n\"Why do you have Fin's arms around your body?\"She asked,crossing her arms.<br>\r\n\"Fin was just following me,she wanted to explain something to me...but I was a little too fast for her.\"She shifted her weight to one side,and she was giving a look that said 'I don't believe it'.I heard a rattle like noise as she did.<br>\r\n\"Uh...Fin...\"I turned to see that Fin is still dizzy,and she was having trouble keeping her balance.<br>\r\n\"Right...\"She said sarcastically.<br>\r\n\"Well...since it seems that you know Mushi,Fin,and Mali...I guess I could trust you...but remember to knock sometimes...I don't like naughtiness.\"She wagged a thorn,like it was a finger.<br>\r\n\"I can see that...what's Mushi and Mali doing?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know,probably trying to cool off after your sudden intrusion.\"She unwrapped Fin's arms off of waist.<br>\r\n\"My name is Mary,by the way,and I gotta say,you do know how to make an entrance.\"As soon as she finished,Tops and Cactine ran past us...only...Tops didn't have his pants...<br>\r\n\"HA!I'm going to get there first!Losers!\"Tops yelled,as he and Cactine turned a corner.I looked back at Mary,which she was shaking her hips left and right,which I could hear tiny seeds.<br>\r\n\"Oooohh...who was that handsome green man.\"She asked,as those big cactus on her head started flapping up and down.I could already tell,that she wanted him to be her girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"Easy...he's already taken.\"She instantly stopped,and frowned.<br>\r\n\"What!?By who!?\"Instantly,Vile ran past us,with Tops pants.<br>\r\n\"Tops!Put your pants back on!!\"As soon as I turned back to Mary,she looked surprised...and mad...her cheeks were red.<br>\r\n\"GGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!\"She growled.<br>\r\n\"Now,now,calm down.There's no need to start a fight.\"I said,trying to calm her down.<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna start a fight...I'm going...to start...A WAR!!\"She yelled.She looked ready to dash,which I quickly grabbed her from under her arms,and pulled her close to my body.<br>\r\n\"Now,come on,I don't wanna see anyone get hurt,unless it's a battle.I hope you can understand,that Cactine is taken,and he's...possibly not your type.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean not my type?He's more than my type!\"She said,as she was kicking her legs,very wildly.<br>\r\n\"He's too wild,and he gets into trouble every second.\"She instantly stopped,which she slowly turned her head to me.<br>\r\n\"Alright,if you say so.By the way,you are kinda strong.\"I let go of her arms.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,I have moments like that...are you going to the pool too?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!I was--\"She didn't even finish,before Madam and Madame flew past us.<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,how can Madam swim?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pool was a great time to be right now.There were many Pokemon that were playing around,splashing,practicing,and doing cool tricks.The one that was having the most fun,was probably Tops...who was spinning a his full speed just above the pool level.He was spinning so fast,he was creating a whirlpool around him,which many Pokemon seemed to enjoy being in...except Toots...who I was trying to teach how to swim.Spiny was helping me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See...just use your tail,if you're worried about sinking.\"I said,as I placed Toot's on her tail.She's a real fast learner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless,of course,your tail was bitten o--\"I placed one of my hands onto Spiny's mouth,so she wouldn't make Toots scared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...thanks Jake.\"She said,giving a wide smile.I smiled back at her...right before her body started moving on it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,what's going on!?\"Toots panicked,while her tail was moving towards the whirlpool Tops was creating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tail got caught in the currents!\"I yelled in response...which me and Spiny started moving on our own as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so are we!\"Spiny added,as she held onto my hair out of fear,which really hurt!It didn't take long before we were caught in the whirlpool itself,which we were spinning around in a circle at a very fast speed,and I didn't even try to swim...and I could see that Snitch was having a hard time staying above water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so stupid...how the heck does...he even do this?\"She kept sinking underwater between pauses,which I was laughing every time.Don't worry,Zan was nearby her,so she wouldn't completely drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,Spiny?Can you let go of my hair now?\"I asked,which she let go without an answer.When I turned back around,she dived underwater.I don't know why she did that,but I looked ahead of me...and I could see Cactine lazily lying on his back,and the whirlpool seemed to carry him.I paddled my feet to get close to him,avoiding many Pokemon and anthros as I can.As soon as I was next to him,I flicked one of his needles on his chest,which by the way he reacted,seemed to have woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,sleepy head.Why are you sleeping at a time like this?\"I asked.His hat tilted over his left eye,which I could tell he was still drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since,I don't have to worry about moving...*Yawn*...I figured I could sleep for now.Whoa!\"He screamed,as he was pulled underwater.I dunk my head under to see where he disappeared to.Turn out,Vile was pulling him from one of his legs.If you were there,you would have laughed.I raised my head,and I could see that Tops was still spinning like crazy...for a while.You see,with each passing second,he was slowing down his spinning,which was slowing down the whirlpool.It didn't take long,before he came to a complete stop,with swirly eyes,before falling into the pool.You can hear the cheers of the people nearby,and saying how fun it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got him!\"Madame yelled,as she dove underwater.The top of her hat was still exposed,as she swam to where Tops fell,and dove deeper,and soon came back up,with a dazed Tops on her hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo...that...was cool...\"He said,with his eyes still swirling.<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you created a whirlpool that took up a quarter of the pool.\"I said,grinning as I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say...I practiced a lot.\"Tops replied.Tops was in his Moemon state,because he said felt like it...<br>\r\n(If you don't know what a Moemon is...it's a person that dresses and resembles a Pokemon,in Tops case,it was a Hitmontop.)<br>\r\n\"Well,seems that training has paid off for you.That whirlpool was very fast,for a non-water type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,alright,I don't need any more praise.\"He said,as he raised his hands...but we did hear screaming,followed by a short boom,down the hallway.We both looked forward,seeing that many Pokemon were running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh electrode,please don't tell me.\"Tops said,sounding as scared as ever.We soon got our answer,when this girl,who had the colors of an electrode,stopped in between the hallways,and shot a discharge towards the running crowd.The discharge was heading towards us,which we ducked our heads down,to avoid the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...so,yeah,Jake...would you like to come to my room,to play games.\"I already knew what Tops was getting at...and I was forced to reply,when the girl turned towards me,and raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,Tops...that would sound swell...run.\"I quietly said the last part,before me and Tops started running away from the girl,not looking behind us one bit.At some point,Tops had to push me from behind to go faster,because the girl was right behind us.When we got to the cafeteria,the doors instantly opened,and we both slammed straight into it,causing us both to fall on out back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\"We both looked up to see Lily with a worried expression.Me and Tops both started yelling at the same time,which,even I,could not understand.It lasted about a good minute,before Lily tapped both of our mouths closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down you two...now,what's the problem.Jake,you first.\"She said,as she ripped the tape off of my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was this girl,with an electrode body,chasing down the halls!Ow...\"Why did the pain from the tape come in afterwards.Lily ripped off Tops mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then we ended up here.Ow...\"Seems like Tops had the same problem with the tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\"Me and Tops both jumped up and screamed,when we turned around to see...</span></div></div>",

game get any cheaper?\"Tops asked,as he lost yet another match.Make that 6-1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!It's called skill dude.By the way,how did you manage to find this game?\"I asked,because it was beyond me how someone would throw out a system,along with the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found it in a garbage can,in the streets.It's funny,because I didn't expect something like this to be found in a dumpster.\"He said...which I was really surprised,I found myself having my mouth open.I closed my mouth back,when I heard a sudden knock on the door.I was the first to get up,and answer it...seeing Mali and Mushi standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,ladies.What's up?\"I greeted.Mali's head jaw smiled at me,from behind her back.What was that thing planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Principal D

that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,let's go!\"And with that,me and Tops had dashed out of the room,and headed towards Principal D's office.<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n\"So...why are you two here?\"Tops asked.When we got to to Principal D's office,Zan and Snitch were at the door,too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard that they caught Chum and Bum,so I decided to pay them a little visit.\"She said,with a an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...why is she here?\"I asked.Snitch just crossed her arms,and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was dragged into this.\"She said,in a very angry tone,which she received an elbow to the side.She rubbed her side,in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"Tops said,as he opened the door to Principal D's office.The first thing,I see was Chum and Bum tied up on Principal D's desk...but Principal D himself was not at his desk.Chum and Bum were tied up,so their heads were the only thing exposed,plus they had tape on their mouths,so they<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...where's Principal D?\"I asked,as I stepped into the room.By the way,Chum and Bum's eyes opened,they must have fallen asleep on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...but,at least we can see these two knuckle heads again.\"Zan said,as she happily skipped towards the desk.The reaction on their faces,show that they were scared at Zan's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about teasing them,Zan.\"Tops demanded,as he quickly grabbed Zan by her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,alright...just calm your horn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice save.\"I said,as I approached the desk...getting a closer look at Chum and Bum.Their eyes say 'We ain't saying anythin'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,let's introduce ourselves...shall we?\"I asked,as I slowly tore off the tap of Chum and Bum's mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your fault,you know!\"They both screamed,in rage.I felt as if,a question mark popped out of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who sent Principal D after us!We didn't do anything bad,just peeked into the girl's locker room!\"Chum explained...WELL!Such an overreaction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i'm not here,to get you two in trouble...i'm just here to talk about ourselves.\"Chum and Bum looked at me,with their mouths gaped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,so that was you two!?\"Snitch yelled angrily,which Zan and Tops blocked her way,before she had a chance at charging at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways...can you two explain yourselves,like why you keep running away?\"I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can...but can you untie us,first...please?\"Bum gave me the puppy eyes...not working out.I don't fall for these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,either you two can explain yourselves,or we can do it Snitch's way?\"I turned behind me,seeing Snitch being held back by Tops,but she was flailing her arms wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,okay.We thought,you were one of the teacher's pet,so we tried to stay away,especially when you ratted us out about painting the walls,with that white and red monster behind you.\"Chum and Bum cried out.I turned behind me and look at Zan,who just shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good police,bad police thing...nice...\"Tops whispered,which I rolled my eyes,and ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,that explains one thing...why do you two cause trouble around every corner?\"I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just wanted to have fun in school...is that bad?\"They both looked up at me,with a stream of tears flowing from their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys...crying?\"I did feel a little guilty for making them cry like that...I think I went a little too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fall for it Jake.They're using Fake tears.\"Tops said.Fake tears!?That was close...I almost untied them.I shaked my head,freeing it from the guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a really cheap move,you know.\"I said,which made Chum stop crying.However,Bum tears did not disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bum...you can stop now.\"I said,but his tears did not stop flowing...in fact...he changed back to the original form.(The form before sunny day.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cherrims can't learn fake tears.\"Bum pointed out,which I slapped myself on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...dudes,we make a Cherrim so scared,we made him revert to his normal form.\"I stepped to the side,to everyone could see.They all gasped at how much Bum was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...that's cool.\"Snitch said,having an elbow present delivered to the stomach,from Tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...you two are free to go now...\"I said,as I found a knot on the back of the rope,and undid it...or tried to undo it.The knot wouldn't come off...no matter how harshly I pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Zan...?\"I started,which she quickly swiped her hand across the ropes,cutting them as she did...but the moment the ropes touched the ground...Bum had reverted back to his sunny day form,but with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise,boss sex!\"They both said,as they both instantly vanished...with no trace left behind...how did they do that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fake-real crying scam?Holy crud...they most of gotten smarter.\"Snitch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tops...take notes...when they start crying...remind me not to untie them...ever...but for now,let's get to bed.\"Zan angrily said,as she stomped out of the

Jake,</b><br>\r\nPlease take this hat for...um...well...uh...we thought you will look cooler with it.<br>\r\nThat is all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Madame and Madam...not to be confused with the other.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...at least they tried.After taking off the note,I placed the hat on top of my head.It fit well...but my hair was a problem,for the hat shifted my hair downward,(even though my hair was never that straight,since it is rebel style).and I can barely see past my hair.I wish I had a mirror for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst...Jake...Jake!\"A voice called.Sounded like Madam...but,why did it sounded like she was right beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam?Where are you?\"I asked,looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here.\"I looked down...and saw that Madam's head was phasing through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,hi!Thanks for the hat.\"I thanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our pleasure.\"She said,with a rather British tone.Didn't know she was part British...but besides that,she dunked her head under the floor board.Probably phased through the floor to get to her dorm.I made sure no one was around,before I changed into my pajamas,and then climbed into my bed,placing my new hat onto the ground,next to my bed.However...I wondered what was Mushi up to...hm...<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<i>~Saturday morning...</i><br>\r\nAh...a bright Saturday morning...a day with no school to worry about,and a day of relaxation,right?<br>\r\n<b>WRONG!!</b><br>\r\nCan you believe it?It was raining,and I meant REALLY raining.If I went outside and came back in,I would look like I have taken a shower with my clothes on.Right now,I was looking outside the window,hoping there would be some kind of sunlight.Cactine and Tops were doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,the one day my girlfriend doesn't bother me,and it's ruined by rain.\"Cactine sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys,it can't be totally ruined.\"I said,hoping to cheer them up.Apparently,they still looked like what they did 20 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can it get any better?\"Tops asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,we can play with Mily's notes.\"I suggested,mimicking a Lilligant's dance on the DS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,those things are dangerous...remember what happened Thursday?\"Tops asked...oh,yeah the note that flown towards the music teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...how's about we find Zan and Snitch and train with them?\"I suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't feel like getting a cut today...\"Cactine said,as he set his head on the window sill.Me and Tops did the same,but with our arms crossed under our heads.I can tell by the looks on all of our faces...we needed something to do...and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...how's about we find Vile and...nah,that's too weird.\"Cactine started,which Tops and I gave a curious look a Cactine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"He responded,as he saw our faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking?\"I asked,raising an eyebrow in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I had an idea...what if we stuffed pepper down Vile's flower hole,you know,the one on top of her head?\"I don't know why,but I seemed very interested by the time he finished the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in!\"Me and Tops both screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...how are we going to do that,without Vile knowing?Won't she hit us all into the ground?\"Tops added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why I came up with a plan!\"<br>\r\n**************************<br>\r\nSo,after searching the halls for Vile,I finally found her in the Cafeteria...with Azu and Mali.Shouldn't be too hard to get her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,Vile.\"I started,which grabbed the attention to all three.\"Mind if I speak with you...in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.I'll be right back,girls.\"Vile said,as she got up from her seat,and walked with me towards the outside of the Cafeteria doors.Even with a straight face,I still can't get over how scary she looks,especially with those flower petals creating a shadow over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I was a little embarrassed to ask you this in front of everybody,but...can you lift up the petals on your head to show your face?\"I asked.You know,whenever I see her,the eyes are the only part I can see on her face.She sighed,and crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,Jake,but I can't do that.\"She said,shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?Why not?\"I asked.As soon as I did,I saw Cactine appear behind Vile with Tops on his head,who was holding in his laughs,while holding a pepper shaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...because of family traditions,I can not show my face to anyone,unless I flap them for scattering pollen,but it's still pretty hard to see with the air turning yellow...\"She said...I didn't really pay attention to the last word,because I was too busy looking at Tops trying to unscrew the top to the pepper shaker.It looked screwed on tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Jake are you listening?\"Vile said,which I faced my eyes towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,I was...was I dosing off again?\"I asked,hoping she believe my lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure...it looked like you were looking at somebody else.\"As she said that,Tops tried even harder getting the top unscrewed.Dang,Max's mom really likes to screw in things tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,I wasn't.\"I can feel a sweat-drop tinkle down my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\"As Vile seemed to place a stubby arms on her waist...</span></div></div>",

was pouring pepper in Vile's flower hole.YES!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever do you mean?\"I asked,ever so innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sniff*Did someone just pour--AACHOO!!\"Her sentence was interrupted when she sneezed,very loudly.Not only that,the sneezed caused yellow pollen to shoot out from the top of her head...which looks like Stun spore.I can tell that I shouldn't touch that...but the cloud was quickly spreading around the hallway,with all of her powerful sneezes adding more stun spore to it!Tops and Cactine already left the scene!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...i'll get back to you in a second.\"I said,walking away.She didn't respond,unless you count sneezing a response.My walk soon turned into a tiny jog,trying to get away from the stun spore cloud.I guess the prank didn't work out as well as I thought...better go tell someone...<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n\"You told Snitch about the Prank!?\"Tops yelled at me.We were arguing about how I tattled about our innocent little prank,and how it went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...not only just her...\"I said,shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,who else did you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mali,Madame,Madam,and Azu...and Zan...and Spine...and Mily...and the principal...\"My voice got lower and lower with each name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told the principal!Dude,do you know how much we are screwed over right about now!?\"He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to tell someone!If I didn't,the whole school would have been infected by the stun spore!\"I yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could have just cleaned it up ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't touch stun spores,dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,we were going to get stunned by a simple touch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe argument raged on for about a good 20 minutes.After that,me and Tops went to see Cactine,who was in his room.We told him the whole story...or,at least,<b>I</b> told the whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,we could have just cleaned it up ourselves!\"Cactine yelled,the moment I finished telling the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the same thing I said.\"Tops said,crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We couldn't just clean up the spores.If we tried to clean it up,we get paralyzed,and your girlfriend would find out.\"Cactine went silent after I said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,that's true...but,do you know how much trouble we are in right now?\"Cactine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either that,or the whole school gets muscle spasms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!Why is this door locked!?\"A loud voice screamed from the other side,sounding a lot like Vile.I went straight to the point to tell her about the prank,until Tops suggested...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone be cool,alright,don't act like we had anything to do with the prank,okay?\"Tops suggested,in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...but,I need to leave...before I freak out.\"I whispered,opening the door,and seeing Vile's body towering over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,hey,Vile...I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you three whispering about?\"Vile asked...I gulped harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...we were just playing...uh...the quiet game.\"Cactine said,which gave me a chance to slip by Vile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By yeah,Jake and I lost,so...we need to go...wash our hair...because,it's filled with dandruff.\"Tops said,passing by Vile.Me and Tops calmly walked down the hallways,and took a right,which the walked turned into a full sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think,Cactine will expose our secret?\"I asked,keeping up pace with Tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,he wouldn't do something like th--\"Tops...or should I say <i>WE</i> were interrupted when a door suddenly opened,and we both ran face first into,and falling on our backs.I bit my lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\"I groaned,as I looked up to see who opened the door.It was Mushi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,sorry about that.Why were you two running?\"She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...running competition,\" I lied,\"Where were you on Friday night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why did you two pull that prank?\"The door opened more,to see Mily...which I quickly jumped up back to my feet,at her sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,fudge...\"I whispered...<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n\"Well,you deserved it...I wouldn't stoop that low for a prank.\"Madame said,with her arms crossed.Coming from her,that's really saying something...that,and the fact she told Mushi about it too.I really did it this time,I was punished from leaving the room for the next week,and to make sure I didn't leave,there are two twin female Roserade anthro guards standing on the outside of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...maybe I should think about the outcomes,before doing something that stupid,ever again.I'm lucky they didn't give me a more worse punishment,than this.\"I said,lowering my head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake...you don't have to let yourself down like that.\"Mushi said,placing one of her fingers on my chin.I looked up into her eyes.I felt like crying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,we all know you are a great kid,but sometimes,things that seem fun can also be dangerous.You probably didn't know that,when you pulled the prank with Cactine and Tops.\"She's right,I didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,your right...I promise never to do something that stupid again...\"I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you won't...Jake.\"She said,giving me a deep,affectionate hug.A tear fell from my eye,at the moment of the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...touching moments are always cute!\"Madame cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still here?Can you please exit?\"Mushi asked,without turning her head away.Madame tip-toed her way out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jake,I don't want you to look at this situation so badly.It's only for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,but what am I gonna do,while i'm 'Grounded'?\"I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not completely grounded.\"I raised an eyebrow in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still do some things,like go see fights,eat in the cafeteria,stuff like that.You just have to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...does Tops and Cactine have the same punishment as me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...a little worse.They're grounded for three weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,why three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been here longer than you,and should not have brought you into the prank,even though you willingly helped them.\"She rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,a week isn't so bad...but what about the Roserade guards?Will they kill me,if I left the room without permission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They may whip you a couple of times...\"I gulped harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just kidding.They will take you back into your room.By the way,they're some fights going on in the gym.Wanna go see?\"She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends...\"I started,walking up to the doorway turned to face one of the Roserade guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I go see the fights in the gym?\"I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...but,you'll have to lead the way.\"One of them said,saying it in a rather stale tone,and rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,come on Mushi.\"I said leaving the room.Mushi soon followed behind,and behind her,the Roserade guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we were walking through the hallways...I got curious...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My mind was starting to fill up with questions,mainly aimed towards the Roserade guards.I couldn't keep my curiosity down,so I decided to get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,Roserades,\"I started.Their eyes signaled me,that I got their attention.\"What would happen if a fi--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake!\"I was interrupted by the sound of Cactine rushing down the hall,just to greet me.Wait...if he's 'grounded',then where are his guards?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly perk my attention towards him,answering with a simple \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cactine took a few breaths to regain his strength to talk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...can I talk to you for a sec'?\"He asked,placing one of his spiky arms around my shoulder.The funny thing is,he made sure he was in a position that was facing away from Mushi and the gaurds.Soon,he tried to nudge me forward,however it was a nudge it was more of a push.The looks in his eyes were really getting me questionable about what he wants to talk about and why he is trying to get me away from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr.Cactine!May I ask,where you're guards are?\"One of the Roserade asked.Cactine,for some odd reason,flinched when he heard the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're just around the corner.I'm still under supervision.\"He said,waving his arms to the Roserade.I took the advantage of the situation to look at Mushi,who was looking at me questionably.I gave her a slight shrug to let her know that I had no idea what Cactine is trying to do.Soon,I used up my advantage time as Cactine moved his arm back to my shoulder,and started pushing me forward,and faster than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon,me and Cactine were out of sight of the guards and Mushi,and I started to get impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,Cactine,can you please explain what are you trying to get me into?\"I said,rather harshly,even for someone my nature.He quickly put his hands in the air,while he tilted his head down,and his hat slid down past his eyes.I got to admit,that was cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,hey,man.I'm just trying to help you.\"He said,while readjusting his hat.The holes that form his mouth curved upwards,giving me a very bad sign that something may get me into more trouble. Unfortunately,I couldn't help but to find out the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I mean by 'Help'?\"I repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying,you should be thankful about getting rid of those pesky guards.\"He's right,although the guards weren't annoying...at least you don't think they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a little harsh for guards,just to...babysit you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babysit!?You mean you would like to have to ask to go to the bathroom every time?To have to ask when you want to go and have a snack?To have to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,I see your point,\"I interrupted\"Wait...how did you lose your guards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy,ask to go to the bathroom,slip out the window,bam!Easy,peasy,\"He said\"This isn't the first time I got in trouble for something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to walk forward,leaning back a little.I couldn't believe he just said that to me.I'm pretty sure I explained how I never gotten into trouble like this before.At least I think I did.I wanted to just turn back and accept my consequences,but I had no other choice.I had forgotten how massive these hallways are,and I could get lost in them,seeing that he took me to an unfamiliar part,and I really didn't want to travel left and right and make imaginary maps,I can do that next week.As I turned around,Cactine's smile had signaled me that he had planned this the whole time,right before he disappeared behind a corner.I sighed as I found myself mentally cornered,and forced to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clock ticks and as the time passes,my body starts to shiver itself on the inside,not because of the temperature of the air,but out of fear of what may happen next.Right now,me and Cactine were waiting for Tops to enter through what appears to be the back entrance to the school.I managed to hide my shivers,and able to sit with my arms crossed looking at the wall,not baring a small glance at him.I was very ticked off at him,not only at what happened earlier,but what is happening now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,here he comes.\"Cactine said.I quickly turned my attention outside,who was not in favor of the rain.He was completely drenched and in a full sprint towards the door.I quickly opened the door in response,and he came rushing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,man!I knew it was raining,but I didn't know it was that harsh!\"He complained.He really didn't like the rain,he was shaking his pants like crazy,with him still in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no time to be worrying about your fashion sense.We need to get moving before we get spotted.\"Cactine said,gesturing his arms to move,as he did himself.Tops and quickly exchanged an unsure look in each others eyes,before following his league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,Tops,where do you think he's leading us to?\"I asked Tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.I've known him for a whole year,and I don't know why he's only doing this to us now.\"He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever he's taking us,I hope it's not entering us into more trouble.<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes had surely gone by,for Tops,Cactine,and I had too take a quick breather as we came to a stop.Cactine really had my nerves on edge,and I'm usually happy most of the time,but he's just getting me way too curious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,Cactine,you better explain yourself.\"I confronted him.Again,he raised his hands in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,alright,sheesh.All I wanted to do is to show you off,this little baby right here.\"He said,as he leaned again a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis door...it wasn't ordinary...it was wooden.All of the other door were plastic slated doors,but this one had the old door style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this door different from the rest?\"I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,take a look.\"He said softly,as he twisted the door knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I looked inside,I couldn't believe my eyes.The room...was so...relaxing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no idea why,but this room is giving off a rather relaxing scent in the room,not to mention a relaxing aura,too.The floors were wooden,the walls were painted yellow,and there were a few decorations scattered about the room.On the far side from where I am,I could see a few refreshments,such as coffee and milk,and a few lit candles too.This room...is just a room I need for when semesters start getting stressful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\"Cactine asked,taking a seat at a nearby desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\"Tops responded,following the same action as Cactine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if this place is relaxing to the soul,it feels...'off'...ah,whatever,it's probably nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could really get use to a place like this.\"I said,as I repeated what the other two did.I gave one,long,calm breath of relaxation,until I started hearing footsteps,coming from within the halls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh,oh!Someone's coming!\"I exclaimed,quickly running towards and shutting the door.Tops turned out the lights,and Cactine flipped over a table.I don't exactly found how that was useful,but in my panic state,I couldn't care less!I just had to hide!I quickly slid behind the table,with Cactine and Tops,crushing my skull in between my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>I couldn't comprehend what was going to happen next!</i></b></span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, he had left a trail of crumbs leading to his hiding place. You gave him a small glare as you noticed this, and he replied with a 'my fault' look on his face. You then turn your attention to Milly, who you could tell was angry. Those red irises seemed to be getting darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, care to explain yourselves?\" she said, turning to both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" the two of you started, neither wanting to put blame on the other. Neither of you wanted to throw yourselves under the bus after seeing Milly beat Bum upside the head with a ruler. It was obvious you and Tops had planned on eating the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that you guys, of all the kids in the school, did this. Especially you Jake, you just started a week ago!\" she exclaimed, then sighing and putting her hands on her hips, looking at us in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're really sorry, Miss Milly.\" Tops said, feeling kind of bad about what he had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilly went and sat down on one of the chairs in the room, arms crossed on her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you guys are sorry, but what are the teachers supposed to do for desserts tonight? We can't serve food that's been eaten of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what they don't know won't hurt 'em, right?\" you suggested, trying to fix the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I know the food has been touched, and I simply won't hand out food that been bitten out of!\" Milly said sternly.<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" you started, \"We'll remake those dishes!\"<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Tops and Milly yelled, both in shocked. \"What, no, I couldn't have you two do that.\"<br>\r\nTops started whispering to relay a message to you privately. \"Dude, are you crazy? I have no idea how to cook, let alone any of these desserts!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, bro, I know enough about cooking that if Milly helps us, we'll be done in no time. Besides, it's either this, or detention or something.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, Tops replied nervously.<br>\r\nYou turned to Milly. \"It\"ll be no problem Milly, if you walk me through the recipes I should be to cook up something similar to the food Tops ate.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Milly replied reluctantly. \"But you have to do exactly what I say, otherwise you two are in a lot of trouble!\"<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" you said.<br>\r\n\"First thing's first, Tops, go to the janitor's office and grab a broom to clean up the mess you made. Jake, come with me. We're going to start making a Bluk Berry Suprise pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later...<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, finished!\" you said, after putting the finishing touches on the Nanab's Delight Cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm impressed, Jake.\" Milly said, admiring your work.<br>\r\n\"So am I,\" Tops added, \"Who knew that Jake was such a good cook?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't really know what I was doing, Milly walked me through most of the stuff and I just followed her lead.\" you replied modestly.<br>\r\n\"Don't be so reserved, you two did a great job fixing these entrees. In fact, these look better than the first dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both were about to thank Milly before she pulled the two of you into a bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you guys so much, I'm sure the other teachers will appreciate it.\" Milly told you.<br>\r\n\"It's....no....problem...\" you managed to squeeze out, since she was hugging you so tightly. She eventually let the two you go.<br>\r\nAlright, well you boys better go. The dinner is starting in about an hour, and I need to finish fixing things up.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Tops replied.<br>\r\n\"See you, Milly, hope the dinner goes well.\" you said.<br>\r\n\"I know it will, thanks again Jake. Oh! And Tops?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Tops questioned, as he turned around, his hand on the doorknob.<br>\r\n\"You'd better take the food the food you ate off of. Either you take it or I throw it away\"<br>\r\nTops had pure bliss on his face. He quickly walked up the Milly and received the desserts.<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Milly!\" Tops exclaimed, delighted he was going to get to have the desserts after all.<br>\r\n\"You deserved it. Now shoo, shoo, I have to get this room fixed up for the dinner!\" Milly said, gently pushing the two of you out of the room and back into the hallway. You and Tops run back to your dorm to start eating the delectables. You enter and see Mushi sitting on her bed, reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey guys, you're back late.\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, we had a long day.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"But it was all worth it.\" Tops says, holding up the desserts with pride.<br>\r\n\"What's in the containers? It smells really good.\" Mushi asks.<br>\r\n\"It's desserts from the teacher dinner tonight. I'll explain later.\" you tell her not wanting to explain a long story to her at the moment. You just wanted to eat.<br>\r\n\"All right, Jake, let's eat!\" Tops exclaimed announcing the start of a delicious meal.<br>\r\n\"Oh wait, Mushi, do you want some?\" Tops asked. Mushi looked like she was waiting for him to ask.<br>\r\n\"Of course, I love Pecha Pudding!\" Mushi said, sitting down next to the two of you. All three of you begin eating when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mushi, We were wondering if you could help us with some of our home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu was in the doorway along with Vile staring at the food we eating. All of a sudden the room because an awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTops is the first to make a move, running towards the closet of your rooms, while trying to scarf down the rest of the pie he was eating. Pure chaos breaks out from there, with Vile chasing Tops to the closet (\"Gimme some of that pie!\" \"Never!\" *slam*), Mushi trying to hide her bed, and you running to a corner of your room, caught in the moment. Azu goes after Mushi first, giving you time to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzu's tail quickly wraps around your legs like a rope, and you are dragged towards her. Eventually Mushi and Tops are caught, with Tops comically having bulk berry stains all over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, thinking about sharing now?\" Azu asks with you hanging upside down from her tail. You just sigh loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a long day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright let's start with Character Description. (man, I hate doing this.)<br>\r\nThe name's Steven, a 16 year old kid from the Great Midwest. His apparel is oversized purple khaki shorts, a black shirt saying 'The Chill' on the front  and 'Chi Town' on the back. Wears a black SnapBack New Era hat, and black shoes. Stands at 6'0, caramel skin complexion, hazel eyes, dark brown hair shaped into a small fro<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alright, enough of that. If I forget something, I'll just sneak it into the story as we go along.)<br>\r\nAnyway, on with the story! (I'll leave another choice for another story at the end of this one.)<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, we're almost there!\" your mother tells you as the school shows up on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up with a start, and quickly wipe off the drool on your face. Five hours of straight driving can put anyone to sleep. You were surprised your mom hadn't driven into a ditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad that Mr.D decided to choose you for the transfer program!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, well I hope this school doesn't kick me out like the last one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve, the last school kicked you out being sent that boy into a coma. I'd be surprised if they didn't remove you from the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my fault, though. He started fighting me and I just got him to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know this is hard for you, but I guess people just don't like how I look or how I act. Even you said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are different compared to everyone else in those schools, but you're a nice person, and I don't want you growing up in a area where people don't like you because you're just trying to make something out of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at your mom, always being your support while you went through all the shit people were giving you in those other high schools, like how you were light skinned but black, making you an outcast. You had to transfer about three times because of fights, and you hoped this was the last time you had to do this. You were barely staying in the same year as everyone else your age (That would mean you are a junior.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here we are!\" mom announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a boat ride and a five hour drive in a rental car, you made it. The school was amazing. Its architecture was very modern, with a lack of windows on the side of the building you were staring at, which you found odd. You then see the school's logo, PHS with the 'S' having extended endings. You take the two bags of your stuff out of the back of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr.D said to drop you off in front of the main building and he'll handle the rest. So come on, give me a hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to your mom and pull her into a tight embrace. \"Love you mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love you too.\" she replied. \"Please make sure you set up some sort of transportation to visit on holidays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, I won't forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well then, I'll see you this Christmas then.\" she said, wiping a tear off her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there mom, no way will I miss Christmas with the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more words and another hug, she got back in the car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she eventually was out of sight, you pick up your bags and head into the building. As you walk in, you head to the front desk, and noticed a girl who looked about twenty sitting behind it. It was sort of odd, her hair was straight and medium length, but it was red with a yellow streak down the side. You take at glance at it, but then quickly ignore it as you walk up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr.D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be the new transfer student. Steven, correct?\" the red head asks. You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mr.D is right this way, I'll take you there.\" she stood up and began walking to the left of you, leading you to apparently Mr.D's office. That's when you noticed that the girl guiding you was about four inches taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, never met a girl taller than me before. Kinda weird.' you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we are here! Mr.D, Steven is here to see you!\" your guide says cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid! Send him in, Mrs. Otill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Otill motions you to go in and she closes the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr.D looked like any old principal really. Shortish, bald, the only major differences being the clothing he wore. A red suit with a blue button-up, and a green tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Sachre (That's you.)! So nice to finally meet you! So I heard you were getting in a little bit of trouble at your other schools, hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, sort of.\" you told Mr.D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it can't be helped,\" he says decidedly, \"but now you're here, and I assure you, you will have a better experience here at PHS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'd been meaning to ask about that, what does 'PHS' mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*sigh* \"Well I guess now would be to a good time as any to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, he was making a big deal about it like it has to be a secret or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you quickly understood why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of you, Mr.D was transforming into, something. You couldn't quite make out the form until he finished. At that point, you quickly figured it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you're a Deoxys!?\" you shouted, scared as shit seeing what you just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you was a Speed Form Deoxys, its tentacles stretching to both sides of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear you atleast know what I am.\" Mr.D said. \"But more importantly, yes, I'm a pokemon and yes, you have just enrolled into PHS, or, shall we say, Pokemon High School.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in shock. Was he serious? This couldn't be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been transferred to a high school full of Pokemon!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you're a little surprised.\" Mr.D commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, yes.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's understandable. It's not everyday you see one of us in real life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, answer me this,\" you ask, trying to get a grasp on the situation, \"why are pokemon on this planet, I know your not from here, there's just no way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question, no, we are not from Earth. Our planet is hundreds of light years away. We came here as an experiment to see if we could someday meet your species and compromise with them, sharing technologic advancements and bringing the two planets together as a unity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that actually sound like a pretty cool idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll go through with this, I mean, I'm already here, right, and hell, it should be pretty cool hanging out with Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! I'm glad you're adapting so well to the situation. I knew we pick the right person to enroll.\" Mr.D said triumphantly. \"Now, I'll have your new roommate show you to your room. Thera!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, and a girl walks in, wearing black and pink striped pants, a pink long sleeved shirt, and what looked like bunny ears, but after seeing Deoxys, they were probably antennaes. They were yellow and black striped, and on her back were two more antennae-like things protruding from the shoulder blades. She looked really nice, with a hourglass figure, modest C-cups, and she was about your height, maybe an inch shorter. An Ariados anthro or something you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, I'm T-Thera.\" she said holding out a shaky hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, umm... Thera. I'm Steven. Nice to meet you.\" you were at a loss for words. Damn she was attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two stare at each other for awhile until both look at the ground the same time, trying to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr.D then interrupts the awkward moment. \"AHEM. well you two should be heading to your room now, I have to get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Mr.D.\" Thera says exiting the room. \"Steven, umm... follow me to the room, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. See you, Mr.D.\" you say as you pick up your bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember that if you need anything, come to my office. I'm always here to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you walk off with Thera to your room. Mr.D goes back to sit at his desk. He contemplates on the situation at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure that boy will have a fabulous year at this school. He'll fit right in with the other students.\"<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n(Just letting you know, as author of this story line, I am reserving choice 1 for myself, I will leave choices open for other writers to use, of course.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a surprise to me but, if she were human or I were a Pikachu, we could have easily pass as sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, Pika.\" accepting the handshake, I said. \"I'm a bit nervous so please don't be offended if I seem jumpy at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPika smiled. \"Deo was just as nervous when he left here for a human school.\" softly, she said. \"He and I have been friends since what you would call kindergarten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do Pokemon call it?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intro-grade school.\" simply, Pika said. \"An introduction to grade school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, I guess.\" shrugging, I said. \"Well, I better get unpacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPika watched me with rising curiosity. Only, when I unpacked my Katana, a gasp escaped her lips. \"Sarah, you are not permitted to bring weapons onto campus!\" stunned, she warned. \"If Principal Deoxys finds out about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Principal Deoxys recommended I bring this, along with the tools of my martial arts.\" turning to Pika, I said. \"It's a part of who I am, like the defensive abilities of all Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" more softly, Pika said. \"Do you think its safe to have it in your room, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and offered Pika the hilt of my katana sword. \"Try to pull it out.\" I said. \"It won't bite you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Pika took hold of the sword handler and tried to pull it out of the sheath but it would not come. She pulled harder but the blade refused to come out. \"Is it locked in there?\" curious, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way.\" taking the sword back, I replied. \"The handle has fingerprint sensors that will only unlock the blade when I take hold of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So only you can draw the blade.\" nodding, Pika said. \"Impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These weapons are used for combat.\" serious, I said. \"They are not toys. I only brought them for the dueling classes that are required here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your signature move?\" curious, Pika asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what?\" curious myself, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a defensive or offensive move that is all your own.\" simply, Pika replied. \"Something you made up yourself to use in duels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well you'll find out in dueling class.\" giggling, I said. \"You and I will be facing each other eventually.\" I then winked. \"Unless you want to share your signature move with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPika giggled. \"Okay, you got me on that one.\" smiling, she said. \"You can't blame me for trying, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" smiling back, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished unpacking with Pika making note of the tools I had for my martial arts, which I noticed. \"This is just a small piece of my fighting style, Pika.\" once done unpacking, I said. \"I can use my hands and feet as weapons as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see it.\" happy, Pika said. \"Everyone is curious about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Let me guess, the others found out you would be my roommate and bugged you to dig up some information about me.\" slightly annoyed, I said. seeing Pika pout, I placed a gentle hand onto her shoulder. \"The same thing is going to happen to Deo at my boarding school, I'm not offended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad.\" sighing herself, Pika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and I exchanged a smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Ronan Shinonju and I\u2019m 17 years old. I was born in Tokyo, japan and raised in the country side because my family likes the peace and quiet. My father is a martial artist who taught me how to defend myself in fights when I go to school in the closest town, but soon we had to move away to America because my father found a place to teach and my mother also found some work in the gaming industry. I wear the japanese school boy uniform or my karate gi that my father gave to me when we are doing my lessons. I do have a black shirt with red kanji on it means noble heart with a dragon on the back, white pants with tiger claw marks prints on the pant legs, a long coat with a fox on the back and it is a japanese style coat, and black and white striped shoes. These clothes I wear when my parents bought them for me to start a new life. My skin color is like having a perfect tan all over your body, my hair is medium length black, and eyes are gold like wolf eyes. I\u2019m a good 5 foot 9 inches and I\u2019m still growing like any other young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Monday morning as my parents were driving me to the new school that accepted me and it was a long drive from our new house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA new school with new problems.\u201d I said as we were driving to the school<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, I know that you are different from the other boys and I taught you to defend yourself if and when you got into a fight.\u201d My father said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey did come in handy when I was out numbered in those fights.\u201d I said as I was smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, you are smart, kind, and willing to protect those who could not defend themselves.\u201d My mother said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are also a very hard worker we both know this when you are in your lessons or working on your school work.\u201d Dad said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know a few girls were following you, but I wonder why.\u201d My mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my other school, I never had friends or I never asked anyone to be my friend. The bullies that picked fights with me were over commenting about my looks and I brushed them off because I had schoolwork to do, but they decided to be stupid and attack me from behind and I dodged their attacks without looking. Soon they got tired and I walked away from them feeling fine, but there was some girls who liked my looks. These same girls followed me to my class and I knew they were there, but why they followed me is one thing I didn\u2019t understand. They were talking to me about my looks and saying I was cute, but they wanted to be my friends. I smiled and I took their friendship, but now I had friends to protect from people like the bullies that wanted to fight with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, those girls wanted to be my friends and I was happy about that.\u201d I said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son no longer the lone wolf.\u201d My father said joking and we started laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I left with my family, I told the only friends that I had the news and that was when I had my last fight with the fights and the bullies. I\u2019m slow to anger, but that only clouds my thinking so I\u2019m controlling my anger and I used the same tactics that worked from the other time, but the teachers were expecting me to fight because they knew my father. Soon I blocked their attacks and jabbed them in their foreheads because it was enough to force them to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, I kept my anger in check in that last fight and I only jabbed them in the forehead.\u201d I said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good son, but you understand what happened when you don\u2019t keep your anger in check.\u201d He said as I hang my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was walking home from school with my friends when we got surrounded by a gang and I was their only target and they were looking at my friends. I started the fight and I was able to give my friends an opening to run away from the fight and get my father. They got away free and I smiled before I started my plan to send those punks away. My anger was rising, but I kept it in check till something happened and it happened so fast. One of them said the wrong thing and I lost control of my rage and I attacked them like an animal. They were lucky enough to be alive when my father came to help me regain control and they were sent to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat only happened once and I was glad that my friends were not there when that happened.\u201d I said darkly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how you felt.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happened to me before and it was how I met your mother.\u201d He added and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the school I will be attending has finally came into our view and it was a big boarding school with the red initials PHS above the door and the gates were gold and pok\u00c3\u00a9ball statues holding the gate. Other than that, it looks any other boarding school and we are getting close to the school gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that you will do your best and try to make friends here.\u201d My father said and I nodded before getting out of the car<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was getting my bags, a man with sky blue hair, wearing red and blue suit, and a pale green tie came to see us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Ronan and his parents.\u201d The man said and we nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes that would be us.\u201d My father said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be hard to adjust into a new setting.\u201d He and my parents nodded in agreement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but hopefully we can stay in one place so our son can be taught in school.\u201d My mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me, I seem to forgotten to introduce myself. I\u2019m the principal of the school, Mr. D.\u201d the principal said and we nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon my bags are with me and my parents left me with the principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright ronan, grab your things and follow me to my office.\u201d He said and I did what he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we came into the school, I noticed the students here are humans wearing clothes with pok\u00c3\u00a9mon styles on them and all of them including the principal are wearing watches. Soon we enter his office and his secretary closed the door behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I need to get out of this disguise.\u201d Principal D said as he was playing with his wait<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis form was distorted for a moment and stood in his place a deoxys in his normal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels much better.\u201d He said and I was shocked to see a living pok\u00c3\u00a9mon, but I know that meant the others here are also pok\u00c3\u00a9mon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this is quite surprising, but there is nothing to worry about.\u201d He said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wondered why you could relate to my parents.\u201d I said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the only human that has been accepted into this school.\u201d He said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honored.\u201d I said and he smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, here is your schedule and a map of the school.\u201d He said as he handed me two pieces of paper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, I know what happened and you can talk with me about it if you want or speak with some of the teachers here.\u201d He said and I smiled knowing that they could help me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I have to show you your guide.\u201d He said as the door opened to reveal another pok\u00c3\u00a9mon</span></div></div>",

We heard something from the other door and the door opened to reveal a pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi rose.\u201d The pikachu said before noticing me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the new student, a human named ronan.\u201d Rose said and I smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are my roommate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Fiona.\u201d The pikachu said and shook my hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona had a large hourglass figure with a lightning bolt tail, red circles on her cheeks, and black eyes. She has yellow fur with brown stripes on her back and her ears are black tipped and slightly longer than a male pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, she is quite friendly and protective of me with her other friends.\u201d Rose said and I smiled with a nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. Before my family left japan, I had a few friends and I was protective of them too.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we will get along great.\u201d Fiona said as rose closed the door and left<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I said remembering what happened before I left japan on that day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Hopefully that won\u2019t happen here.~ I thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my clothes in my dresser from one bag and I put my other bag underneath my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the other bag, ronan?\u201d Fiona asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething to help me pass the time.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you help me with my schedule?\u201d I asked and she nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining that I have certain classes on certain days like Math, History, and English on Monday and creative writing, Gym, and Metal Shop on Tuesday, I can also take extra classes like art when I\u2019m done with my classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the help Fiona.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had the map I was given and I make to my first class early and it was math taught by a minun and plusle pair. Introduced myself to the class and went back to my seat ignoring the glares, stares, and other strange looks. The teachers are Miss Plus and Miss Minus are subbing for the real teacher of the class, Mr. Kazam, an alakazam. I was able to solve the equations after doing the work and getting the answers right. When the bell rang, the subs wanted to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, we think that Mr. Kazam will happy to see you when he comes back and it\u2019s nice to know that you are able to solve the equations.\u201d Miss minus said and I smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a hard worker and my parents wanted me to do my studies before I could do anything else.\u201d I said and they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, keep doing the great work and maybe you will be able to challenge Mr. Kazam himself.\u201d Miss plus said joking and I laughed with them before leaving to my next class<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext is History with Mr. Ancient.\u201d I said as I walked through the hallways<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed more stares and I ignored them as I made my way to the classroom. I have gotten there early as I did with my math class and the teacher was a xatu. My classes started and finished with me introducing myself to the class and I did the work that needed to be done. I took notes in my classes and I took into account which student would be a possible friend. I was on my way to the cafeteria when I met Fiona and rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, how was your classes?\u201d Fiona asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were fine.\u201d I said thinking about my other classes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan.\u201d Rose said knowing what I\u2019m thinking and she frowned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, ronan?\u201d Fiona asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking of my other classes from my other school and something else that happened.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat.\u201d I said and they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe each got each something different for lunch and we are only allowed five things for lunch. I had gotten beef stir-fry, chicken ramen, herbal tea, spring rolls, and miso soup. I met with them at a table and we started to eat our lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it, ronan?\u201d rose asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing.\u201d I said after eating everything I gotten to eat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you eat that fast?\u201d Fiona asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot to eat breakfast this morning.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, you should meet our friends some time.\u201d Rose said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, how does Saturday sound?\u201d I asked and they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Saturday it is then.\u201d I said as I walked to the dorm room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished my classes before lunch and I just wanted to rest before started on the schoolwork I have. I used my resting time to meditate and I practiced the stances my father taught me. Soon I started to do the homework I have received and in a few hours I completed the assignments and I put them in my books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere now I can kill time before I need to turn in for bed.\u201d I said as I pulled the bag from underneath my bed and I was playing the pok\u00c3\u00a9mon games that my mother gave me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of my games are in my room at home; I played some of the games I had in my bag before putting them back inside the bag under my bed. I pulled out some of my notebooks and started to draw a gardevoir and a pikachu as how I saw them and I draw another version of them as they were like rose and fiona. I had drawn another alteration of rose and Fiona with more curves making their bodies even more beautiful. I put the drawings in binder that was in my other bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hopefully their friends are the ones I\u2019m thinking of.\u201d I said as I was getting ready for bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Fiona came in and we got ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do in here?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid my homework and just killed some time.\u201d I said as I got in my bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep took us quickly and I had a good dream to end my first day in Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon High School.</span></div></div>",

Gym was first, then creative writing, and last was metal shop; but the art class would be kind of fun and I can hone on my skill there. When I got to the gym, it was empty and I don\u2019t think that the teachers are here; but I could be wrong. I went into the guys locker room to change into my training gi and put on my rising sun headband on before walking out and I saw a lucario walking into the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d I said to the lucario<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you must be ronan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, are you teacher or student in this class?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStudent and you can trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can read your aura and I\u2019m a friend of rose and fiona.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know my name, but I don\u2019t know yours.\u201d I said and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Aura.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura is a female lucario with a modest hourglass figure, red eyes, and blue and black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is the teacher here?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Kenichi.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, she is a blaziken.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d I wasn\u2019t surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you dressed like that?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are my training clothes and I used them for my lessons with my father.\u201d I said walking over to a mat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are only telling me what I want to hear and not the whole story.\u201d She said and I smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have my reasons and I will you and the others when I feel the time is right.\u201d I said and she nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil then I can wait.\u201d She said as she walked onto the mat I was standing on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got into our fighting stances and I waited to for her to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make the first move.\u201d I said to her and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d She said as she charged at me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to punch me, but I sidestepped and flipped her over my right shoulder. She tried to sweep kick me and I jumped over her landing on my hands and doing a back flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour very good for human.\u201d Aura said and I smiled before vanishing to get close to her and I palm strike her chest sending her off the mat and she had the look of surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father was the best and he taught me everything he knew.\u201d I said as Mrs. Kenichi walked in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAura, you have done well; but both of you were holding back.\u201d Our teacher said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a good reason for holding back.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, I could tell that you have more power than you were using and you have very good control over it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not psychic, but I can tell how good a fighter is.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe other students will be here soon as far as class goes and both of you will be my top students.\u201d She said and we both nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the other students came to class and I introduced myself, I recognized some students from yesterday\u2019s classes and I stood by aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright class, today we will begin sparring.\u201d Mrs. Kenichi said and I looked around at the students<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed one Student was a weavile and I had the feeling when I was fighting those bullies at my old school. Aura looked at me in concern because my aura was turning red and my anger was rising on its own. Mrs. Kenichi had the other students go first and I was trying to control my anger before something bad happened. The weavile student was the only other student besides me who had not sparred and aura was doing her match as we watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinner is aura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will be the last match, the human ronan vs. Thorn.\u201d Our techer said as we head out onto the mat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I get to break the human in.\u201d thorn said as I got into my stance and waited for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegin!\u201d was heard as he charged at me and I smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still angry, but I was using it as my power and I was calm as I could be. He tried to punch me, but I caught his fists and twisted his arms before kicking him in the face sending him to the edge of the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou going to let a human get the best of you? I have fought bullies stronger than you and they were lucky to be alive.\u201d I said darkly and he was mad<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting reckless and I was beating him with my skill, which result me striking him in the chest before grabbing his body and flip him over my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinner, Ronan.\u201d Was heard as I jumped before thorn could sweep kick me and I dropped kick him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay down. You will live longer if you do.\u201d I said as I walked to aura<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the students were surprised with how I could beat thorn and I smiled, but I looked at thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cheat.\u201d I said as I was holding a poison barb<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will regret this.\u201d Thorn said as I yawned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeard that before and they still regretted fighting me.\u201d I said bored<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I only used about ten percent of my real power.\u201d I said while thinking about the fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass was over and I went back to the dorm room to change my clothes before going to metal shop. I took a hot shower before putting my sword smith clothes on for the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAura must be telling rose and fiona about my fight.\u201d I said as I finished gotten ready<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a break for lunch before creative writing and art class and I can use that time to change clothes again.\u201d I said as I left for class<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Aura or any other pok\u00c3\u00a9mon could have beaten a normal human, but I\u2019m not normal.~ I thought as I smiled and I noticed that the other students were looking at me with smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think of me as a human and just because I beat someone like thorn doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides I won\u2019t be your friend if you don\u2019t ask me.\u201d I said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded and I went on my to class, but I notice two pok\u00c3\u00a9mon following me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gengar and a skunktank. Thorn must still be in pain or thought he could trap me.\u201d I said as I dodged and ice punch from thorn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThorn that is enough.\u201d Was heard as the principal appeared and used psychic on them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, I heard about your sparring match and I\u2019m proud of you. You three know that fighting is held in the arena on the weekends.\u201d He said as he let them go, but I gave thorn a glare<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to speak with you, ronan and your teachers have been informed.\u201d He said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were teleported to his office and we both sat down in the chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father taught you well to use that kind of power.\u201d He said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was the best and he told me that control is everything when dealing with power.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose, aura, and I felt your emotions when you first noticed thorn; but you did well to control your feelings and control your power.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding about those bullies and they were very lucky to be alive.\u201d I said darkly and I hang my head from the memory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo you, thorn was like one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I noticed that some of the other students had fought with him and lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to fight thorn and his two friends on Saturday.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to use half of my real power.\u201d I added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can control it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to help me in the fight. That is the only condition I have for the fight.\u201d I said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot taking any chances of that happening again.\u201d I said referring to that day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. I can do that, but are you going to be able to handle it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I said smiling</span></div></div>",

I used about five percent power to get to class and I was about a few minutes late. The teachers for the class are Mr. Char, charizard and Mr. Hammer, a machoke. I showed them my pass and I introduced myself to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe heard about your sparring match with thor and we were surprised that you could defeat him like he was a rookie fighter.\u201d Mr. hammer said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was practice, but Saturday will be the real fight and it will be three on one.\u201d I said and I smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to teach them a lesson and I have to do it alone.\u201d I added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are steel type pok\u00c3\u00a9mon here and in the other room, but they are learning to repair themselves and we are learning to using metal to make things like swords, shields, and other things. Mr. hammer is in the other room so we have mr. char teaching us. The other students in the class are a Empoleon, aggron, an anthro skaromy, and another lucario to name a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to make a weapon, a sword; but it could be any kind of sword.\u201d Our teacher said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will help and so will Leon.\u201d He added as an Empoleon stood up and nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of us got our metal and my piece of metal was a small thick piece, but it was fine with the sword I had in mind. I was going to make a katana like in the old days of the samurai. The other students are working on their own ideas for their swords and I heated my metal so I could make my masterpiece. I hammered out the metal to form the katana blade and I reheated the blade to make it stronger before hammering it again. Soon I found some water to cool the metal and reheated the metal before folding it, hammering, and cooling it. This process is long, but the work is worth it and soon my blade is done so I need a hilt and to sharpen it. I looked around seeing the other students finishing up, but I don\u2019t let that bother me and continuing working. Leon gave me the hilt for my sword and I went to the grinding stone to sharpen my best work. Soon I turned in my katana for grading and I was very proud of my work. Mr. char picked up the others and graded them before picking my katana up for grading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can look like the worst sword made or the best, but its looks are not important; how it cuts is the most important.\u201d Mr. Char said as he cut a metal pole clean in half<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say that this was the best made.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hammer came in to see the swords and noticed my work and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan worked on another surprise.\u201d He said and the other students were happy for me, but I made that katana for another reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Char.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ronan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if I could send the katana I made home to my father.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we make weapons like this to help the school bring in money.\u201d Mr hammer said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will see about it later and I might have you make another one and compare which one gets sent home and the other gets sold.\u201d Mr. Char said smiling and I smiled as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the class was over, I walked to the dorm room to change clothes again and I went to lunch. I got a chicken sandwich, potato wedges, bottle of Dr. Pepper, a container of broccoli coleslaw, and some yogurt. I went to sit down in my usual spot when I noticed the students that have fought with thorn came to sit with me and my three friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound rude, but I don\u2019t like being the popular student and I only beat thorn because he had it coming when he made fun of the human.\u201d I said and they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, your more than that.\u201d Rose said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? How so?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour past helps us understand you so that you not just a human to us.\u201d Rose said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly a few have heard of my past to understand me and I will tell you after my fight with thorn and his two flunkies.\u201d I said as they were surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to fight them?\u201d rose said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, the principal and I talked it over about it and this Saturday is the fight. Three on one and I can handle them.\u201d I said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t get the hint during the sparring match so I have to turn up the heat.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was in a fight when I was with some friends and we were surrounded. I was able to fight them off easily, but my friends were there so I had to give them a way to escape. They got away to get my father and that was when something bad happened. While I was fighting them, one of them said the wrong thing to say and I was mad as possible. I attacked them like an animal and my father came in time to stop me they were still alive. They were very lucky to be alive. I barely remembered what happened after walking up, but I quickly remembered what happened and I was not proud of it.\u201d I said as I hang my head and started to eat my lunch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quiet and most of them were eating as well, but they were thinking about what I said and I won\u2019t blame them for leaving right now. I felt something on my shoulder and looked to see my three friends looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you dealt with something that we also have been dealing with, but we will still stand by you as your friends.\u201d Rose said with fiona and aura nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see the other students at our table and they nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know what it\u2019s like to fight bullies like thorn, but humans must face the same problem.\u201d A golem said as I nodded</span></div></div>",

Class went fairly well and I revealed my artistic skill with a paintbrush, but I did a mountain landscape of japan and I add the rising sun for some beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d a smeargle said surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this, I was thinking of something from home.\u201d I said as I add some white pain for snow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Shade came by to see my work or art and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the way you paint it, it looks like you saw it before.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other students came by to see my painting and they were glad to have some friendly competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but don\u2019t surprised when I paint my best.\u201d I said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the class, I was painting the finishing touches on my painting and painting another one to be sent home to my parents. When the bell signaled the end of class, I just finished my second painting and gave them both to mrs. Shade so they would be dry and the second one would be ready to mailed to my parents. I was leaving the classroom when the smeargle from class was walking to me and I smiled at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan.\u201d It said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you learn to paint like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to paint when I was little and my parents took me into the mountains before we moved to America.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Jack.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d I said as we walked to the main hallway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were talking when I noticed thorn looking at me and I just crack my knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThorn, you and your cronies will be given the worst beating you will ever get.\u201d I said with a smile and jack was looking at me like I was crazy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see Saturday.\u201d He said and he left<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you say anything, I have a bone to pick with him and you with everyone else in the school will what I can do on Saturday.\u201d I said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you know what you are doing.\u201d He said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left jack in the cafeteria before heading to my dorm to see rose and fiona. I only came by to get my notebook and pen for creative writing, but I told them that I will talk with them later. They must have known about the fight on Saturday and I saw the look in their eyes. My past will come back in that form during the fight, but I have to teach thorn a lesson and show them how strong a human like me can be. I see students looking at me, but I can see that they will be cheering for me at the fight and I nod with a smile. I like to have true friends like the girls I knew before I left and now rose, aura, and fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Some of them think thorn will win, but that won\u2019t happen.~ I thought as I found my last class for the day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked inside the classroom to see a delcatty as the teacher and I come in the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, I heard that you like to come early to class.\u201d She said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is true.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Cadel is my name.\u201d I nodded before the rest of the class came in and I picked my seat close to the window<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I introduced myself for the last time in my last class and many asked about the fight Saturday. I smiled and told them to wait and see because I will only show what I can do then and not before. I returned to my seat and I noticed jack is in the class. I made some notes and we were given an assignment to make a story, but I had an idea though it might be hard for me to deal with. I pulled out my ink pen and I started to a haiku about my friends back in japan while thinking of a nice day in the park where the sakura trees bloom. With my mind set on what I was doing for the assignment, I looked at jack to give him a smile before returning to my work and I finished my free form haiku, but I started working on a fixed haiku with it being centered around that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClass, your assignment will be due at the end of class.\u201d Our teacher said and I nodded before finishing up my second haiku<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon class was over and we turned in our work, but I last and jack was waiting for when mrs. Cadel wanted to speak with me about both haikus and I told him I would meet with him later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, these two haikus are from your past.\u201d She said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth filled with emotion, but one with friendship and the other the will to fight and protect.\u201d I hang my head before saying anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to write something and that\u2019s what I came up with.\u201d I said and she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you will do well in this call ronan, but maybe you can try to write something like your first haiku, but some of your second to make it more balanced out.

A few minutes had gotten away when I came back into the room wearing my pajamas and I had gotten to my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI care for my friends and your three are a part of the group that are my friends, but that memory isn\u2019t the only thing that is brothering me.\u201d I said with me facing them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose friends I had before I left was something I felt that I had to protect them.\u201d I added before turning over<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will need our sleep for class tomorrow.\u201d I said before falling asleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is right about the sleep part, but this other stuff has me worried about him.\u201d Rose said and aura nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and aura left the room, but not before giving me a hug good night and I smiled in my sleep. Fiona slept in her bed tonight and it was peaceful, but not in mind as thoughts were flying in my head and they were about that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~How did I do that to those jerks and idiots?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What caused me to do that?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I hope that they are still doing alright without me.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind is like in a twister, but I see that my mind has put me in a dream and it was the day before I had to leave. Everything was the same as that day and I looked around to see why I was put here, but I felt something close to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to talk.\u201d a voice said as I turned around to see a person that dressed like me during the day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you bring me here?\u201d I asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did in a way, but I\u2019m not here to fight you.\u201d It said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person looked like me, but he sound like he is calmly angry and his eyes are like a golden red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I am.\u201d It said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the rage I that I felt on that day.\u201d I said and he showed a small smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was only protecting those who are your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou almost killed those punks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to admit that you let your rage get out of hand and I came into form of that rage.\u201d He said and I sadly nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe both were trying to control the rage and anger you felt, but it was the first time you snapped like that so your father had to stop you.\u201d He explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you have been training and have a fight on Saturday with these other punks that need to be taught a lesson, maybe I can help you with holding back your rage.\u201d He said and I looked at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but no. Not till the time is right besides I have something to prove during the fight.\u201d I said as I felt my body waking up so I can get ready</span></div></div>",

It was near the end of class when he wanted to talk with me about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard good things about you.\u201d He said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI try my best.\u201d I said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was sort of surprised to hear that you are going to fight Saturday against three students.\u201d He said and I smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy past is coming back and they should know what I have been trying to control since my family came to america.\u201d I said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sensed something about you and it\u2019s quite interesting.\u201d He said and I had to get to my next class<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ate different things for lunch to try some new foods and I looked around the normal table I sit at with my friends to see them looking at me. Some of them are thinking about the fight and the others are thinking how I could beat him or lose to him, but rose, aura, and fiona are thinking about me in general and I know they care about me. During my break between classes, I worked on my drawings while thinking of my next haiku and I play some of my games to make some progress before I do my meditation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonan, we need to talk about something serious.\u201d I heard rose said as she, aura, and fiona comes into the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what is it?\u201d I asked without breaking my concentration<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you fighting thorn and his minions?\u201d fiona asked and I sighed deeply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe made fun of the human, I felt like I have to knock some sense into them, and to show that I have control over my beastly strength.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told Mr. D that you will have to use about half your real power; what did you mean by that?\u201d rose asked and I stood up before sitting on my bed with them sitting on fiona\u2019s bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy emotions can be my strength or be used to control my strength. When I saw thorn in the gym, my rage was almost out of my control and nearly had a relapse of what happened.\u201d I said darkly and they hugged me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you not want help in the fight?\u201d aura asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I need to do it alone and I don\u2019t want you or anyone else getting hurt.\u201d I said with a real concerned voice with a bit of sorrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour answers are based on that day.\u201d Rose said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fight to protect. Or kill to protect if I have too.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father stopped me before that happened and I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d I said with sorrow in my voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to see me become a monster or a killer.\u201d I added as I hang my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was able to make an even better katana than the first and it\u2019s the first one that will be sold and the second will be sent home to my parents. The room is silent as I was thinking of the girls that were my first friends and what they must been thinking when they saw my father stop the beast that might been ready to kill those jerks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~That was the past and you have been controlling it since that day and even now you are getting stronger controlling it.~ the voice from my dream said and rose looked me with curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You will be able to handle those punks and handle the beast within.~ he said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I bet your friends are thinking about you and wanting to know how you are doing since you left.~ he added before I give another nod and a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Your right, but you know that one of my friends is reading my mind and she heard you giving me a pep talk.~ I said and I heard a chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yes, I know about her and the other two that care about you; but I want you to fight with a clear head and fight like thorn.~ he said before I nodded at rose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that, ronan?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA person I met in a dream.\u201d I said and aura with fiona looked at us confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMet who in what dream?\u201d fiona asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast night, I was dreaming about certain things and my emotions were in a twister before I met a person that looked like me, but he was calmly angry and he was too trying to hold back the rage that I felt back then.\u201d I explained to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it will help go to the principal and ask if two of you would be my back up incase something goes wrong.\u201d I said and they smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you acting like an animal?\u201d aura asked and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that fighting and psychic types might be enough to hold you back.\u201d Rose said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe kept talking and fiona with aura will be my backup with several other teachers that might be able to hold me down if my rage gets out of hand. Mr. Kazam, Mr. D said he would like to see the fight and he would join in being my backup, Mr. hammer and his brother, Mr. Champ while there are others willing to help me stay in check. I was given a choice to either to use a weapon of my choice or no weapon and I was taken to see what I can use for a weapon. I smiled before getting a wooden sword like I used during my lessons and I went to sleep so I can be ready for the big day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You think your ready to teach them a lesson?~ the other ronan asked as we met in my dream again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I know I\u2019m ready.~ I said ready and confident<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Good, I\u2019ll be ready to help when you decide to fight hard.~ he said before my body decides to wake up and the dream ends<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up early and fiona is already awake with black gloves on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what you can do.\u201d She said as I smiled before changing into my sparring outfit that I was wearing while I was sparring against thorn the first time and we walked out in the hall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Kenchi has your weapon at the arena waiting for you.\u201d Aura said and I nodded before I started walking to the arena with my friends and teachers backing me up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short run to the gym since I running to shorten the time to get there and I used about 5% power to get there even faster, but I turned to see their surprised faces and I just smiled. Soon I\u2019m holding my weapon while I see my backup in the hall as Mr. D came out to announce the fighters. Thorn and his two minions were waiting to see if I would not show up, but he started to growl when saw me walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you would run like a scared human.\u201d He said and I just shook my head with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis challenge was requested by ronan to fight thorn and his two friends.\u201d The principal said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a first knockout fight, you may use one item, and when your opponent is knocked out the fight is over the and the winner will be declared.\u201d He explained the rules and I know that there is a little bit more to that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a special fight and ronan has let two of his friends will be his teammates if he needs them, but there is a team to stop the fight if anything goes wrong.\u201d He added and I pointed to the team behind me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be weak enough to let them stop the fight when you are losing to me.\u201d Thorn said and I just smiled before laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are an idiot. They are to stop me from hurting you permanently and I\u2019ll show you how strong I\u2019m really am.\u201d I said and he started to growl from the idiot comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady.\u201d I took my stance and let my rage raise without losing control<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegin!\u201d Mr. D said before backing away and they formed a triangle to surround me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skuntank used acid spray for an opening move and I dodged it using the same 5% of power before appearing behind torn and I hit him with my wooden sword on the head. I kicked him in the back landing in the acid spray and the gengar used shadow claw. I smiled before grabbing the shadow and pulling it toward me making it fly towards me and I punch him in the face sending him into the skuntank. They got up and a shadow ball was fired at me and I noticed thorn was going to use fling to throw his poison barb at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwing batter.\u201d I said and I hit the shadow ball like a baseball and it deflected the poison barb<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill think I\u2019m a weak human?!\u201d I asked as I was raising the percentage of power used<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Thron said and I just smiled before running towards the gengar and skuntank<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh well, this is your wakeup call.\u201d I said before landing a palm thrust in the gengar\u2019s chest and he was sent flying into the wall of the fighting arena before the bleachers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was speechless just from that and I was far from done, but I stand between thorn and his other friend smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~How are you holding up?~ I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I still have more control than the rage, but you might want calm a bit before going all out.~ the voice said and I gave a nod sidestepping the charge from both sides<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at them rubbing their heads and I noticed the gengar was still trying to get up from that palm strike. I used some of my energy and I hit the skuntank like another baseball and it hit the gengar knocking both of them out, but I used a little bit more to throw my weapon into the wall next to the hall and it embedded itself in the wall.</span></div></div>",

I see him throwing an ice punch and I caught it before flipping him over my shoulder as I did the same thing before and I dropped kicked him without using any real power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithout your friends and anything to cheat with, you are fool and a coward. You should fight with honor and be a humble fighter; not a bully.\u201d I said as my fist glowed red and I hit the ground next to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to walk away letting him getting up on his own and I noticed something was weird. I felt him smiling and charge at me with a night slash ready, but I jumped over him and I kicked him across the face sending him flying hitting the wall.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cStay down this time.\u201d I said as I started to walk to get my weapon out of the wall<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cLike I\u2019m going to listen to you!\u201d he yelled before running and launching an ice beam at me again<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou should listen to me.\u201d I said darkly and he fired another ice beam, but he was aiming at rose<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the hit and I was having a flashback of what happened on that day. He walked over to my now frozen solid body knocking on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so tough are you, human.\u201d He said mocking me and rose was shocked to see me do that for her and she was reading my mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ronan, calm down!~ the voice said and I\u2019m trying, but my body started to glow red and my eyes are glowing red<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice started to crack and thorn started to back away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you tried that again, I will make sure that you lose that arm.\u201d I said as I broke free of the ice and I noticed my backup is coming to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d thorn asked afraid of me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there smiling beastly before I charged at him and I punched him a few times. I felt someone\u2019s hand on my shoulder and it was rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Good, keep trying.~ the voice said and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe will live like the others, but he shouldn\u2019t have tried to attack you.\u201d I said as I was calming down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the glow disappeared and I was back to normal, but they were still wondering about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just happened was something that I couldn\u2019t control at first, but I was able to control it now and it happened this time because I was only protecting my friends. When it happened the first time, I was fighting like a beast and berserker against a group of thugs like thorn; but my father stopped me from killing them. That incident was what caused my family to move to America and me to come here for school, but I made myself a promise that I wouldn\u2019t let that happen again. Well, it did happen again and I was able to control it before anyone gotten seriously hurt.\u201d I explained and everyone was silent, but Mr. D looked at me with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you ronan for the explanation and you are the winner of the fight.\u201d He said as everyone started cheering for me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to thorn and I helped him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans and pok\u00c3\u00a9mon are the same; there is no line between them.\u201d I said and they clapped for me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a good way of looking at it.\u201d Mr. D said before teleporting thorn and his two friends to the nurse\u2019s office<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Good job, they would be proud of you.~ the voice said and I nodded before I passed out and fell to the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey surrounded me and tried to wake me up, but soon I fell asleep and I was brought to the nurse\u2019s office as well.</span></div></div>",

As I took a step, I started out slow and careful so I couldn\u2019t hurt myself and I was doing fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think thorn will change his ways?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. I mean challenged and beaten by a human that had to hurt his ego and gave him a lesson in humility.\u201d Rose said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe had it coming.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did it felt like after you broke the ice?\u201d aura asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to hurt him for even thinking of using rose as a target or thinking of attacking her. I wanted to beat him into a bloody pulp or knock some sense into him, but I remember what my father taught me and my promise.\u201d I explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principal came in smiled at me noticed that I\u2019m trying to stand on my feet and he is holding something in his left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that fight was the best in the school that I have seen and the students know what thorn really is thanks to you; but I think your parents should see the fight and know how far you come in your training.\u201d He said and I went to sit on the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a bad idea.\u201d I said they tilt their head in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they see or know that happened again, I\u2019ll guarantee it that they will come get me out of school and move to somewhere else again.\u201d I said and I hang my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~You really think that?~ the voice asked and I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~What if your wrong?~ he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I know for a fact that is what they will do.~ I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a brief silence before the voice stopped talking to me and I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to move again.\u201d I said hitting the bed in a slight anger tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey will want to speak with me, you and rose or anyone else when it happened.\u201d I added with distain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will see about that and maybe you won\u2019t have to be pulled out of school.\u201d He said with a smile and I nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I walked back to my room with rose, aura, and fiona making sure that I have no problems and don\u2019t fall. When we get inside, I walk over to my bed and pulls my game bag from underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you an explanation for something rose.\u201d I said as I pulled my game and I turned it on letting them hear the music<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that music?\u201d fiona asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a game that my mother designed and it\u2019s a pok\u00e9mon game.\u201d I said showing them the screen on my game console and I start to play a little before opening the game\u2019s pokedex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI show them the entry for rose as a gardevoir and I see the surprised look on her face, but I turn the game off and put it back in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have more games at home, but I don\u2019t think that you can come over since that had to happen.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cell phone started to ring and it\u2019s my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d I said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello son. Have you gone into that form again at the school?\u201d he asked and I noticed that he was calm about it and I think that mom would be worried if I was talking to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs mom worried about it?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is on the borderline on the subject.\u201d He said and I noticed my friends trying to listen in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I went into the form again; but this time it was different.\u201d I said and it caught his interest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was it different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI took an attack for one of my friends and it was triggered that way; but I did some minor damage to her attacker and I had it under control even before I went into the form.\u201d I explained and he was thinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is different and better.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent a few minutes telling mom what I told him and I could tell that she was worried for me and happy that the outcome was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid we have to move again?\u201d I asked him knowing the answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, do you think we have too?\u201d he asked and I could tell he has a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we don\u2019t have to move?\u201d I asked hoping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we are not going to move and I think that you should see your old friends.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know that I went into the form?\u201d I asked and I heard him chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Your father heard the same voice you are hearing right now.~ the voice said with a chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked to believe it and almost dropped my phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother has been working on a new game and she would like for you to test it.\u201d He said shaking me out of my shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave it in my room and I\u2019ll see about it later.\u201d I said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will have to come to the school and see the principal about it. You know that I trust you, but even minor damage can be deadly.\u201d He said and I hang my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want to move again.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we won\u2019t, but I have to make sure that your opponent is fine.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d I said as I felt I lost the fight of will<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon, trust me I would feel better checking on him myself.\u201d He said and I know he is right<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe talked for a little bit longer before I ended the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose, get to the principal and tell him that my father is coming to check on thorn and maybe his friends.\u201d I said and they looked scared, shocked, and surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly walked to the door and out to his office to send my message to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention everyone, all students except for thorn and this two friends are to be in their human forms since ronan\u2019s father is coming to check on them from the fight and to make sure they\u2019re alright. The same is for the staff as well and that is all.\u201d The principal said</span></div></div>",

They noticed the drawing stuff and their curiosity was sparked. I started to hum a tune that was in my head and started to draw out an outline of a pok\u00e9mon. I wanted to at least get something started before going to sleep. I felt them looking at me wanted to know what I\u2019m drawing and seen what I have drawn, but I thinking about it on the backburner in my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to see the drawings I made?\u201d I asked them and they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d They said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled before pulling out my drawing folder and hand fiona the folder.

It was a few minutes as I heard them flipping through pages and I put some of my more recent drawings in the back of the folder. I have my drawings of them are in my pad that I\u2019m drawing her as a mightyena with her hair and eyes. I\u2019m about done with their drawings before today so I should be done by Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe poses you draw the pok\u00e9mon are natural.\u201d Fiona said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could be a prodigy.\u201d She added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d rose asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not that smart or that creative.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJudging by your skill in both your drawing and the fight it is clear that you are that smart and creative.\u201d Aura said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it was cool to see you fight like that.\u201d Fiona said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focused on my drawing as they were still looking through the drawings and I heard them stop before pulling three drawings out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese three are of us.\u201d Rose said with awe and I smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been working on them during the week and I\u2019m working on several others before I put them in the folder.\u201d I added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we see them?\u201d aura asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot till I get them finished.\u201d I said and they frowned, but knowing I won\u2019t change my mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Their special ones are in my pad, but that won\u2019t know that.~ I thought blocking rose from hearing my thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was thinking of my old friend and how she would look like after so much time has passed since I left japan.

You also have a very rare condition that allows you to generate and fire short but powerful bursts of focused static electricity. It had been dubbed Electra-kinesis  Because of your unusual appearance, condition, and name, your friends had jokingly called you Pikachu. It was not far from the truth as it was your name. However, unknown to you, it caused a mix up in your transfer papers, sending you to Poke-high; a private school for Anthro Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, due to your appearance, condition, and name, no one bothered to disguise themselves and you were stunned to find yourself at a school for Human Pokemon! You immediately walked to the principal's office to find the principal a Deoxys, which was also ironically his name. \"Um.... I don't think I belong here, Principal Deoxys.\" fearful, you said. \"I'm a human, not a Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Deoxys looked at you with his large white eyes and gave a smile, or what you believed to be a smile. \"Your first day and you already want to skip school, Pikachu?\" amused, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sir, there has been a mistake!\" begging, you said. \"My first name is Pi; my last name Kachu! I just look like a real Pikachu, look at my papers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Deoxys sighed. \"Very well... Pi.\" patiently, he said. \"I will look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of his tentacled arm, he opened a file drawer and sifted through the P section before pulling out your file. Upon opening it, his white eyes grew wide with surprise. \"Well, it seems there has been a clerical error.\" softly, he said. \"You were supposed to be transferred to Pokes-high private school on the other side of the country. Only the transfer was changed as they must have misread your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can be moved to Pokes-high soon?\" hopefully, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, no.\" motioning to the window, Deoxys replied. \"This school was built in the high mountains in order to isolate it from the rest of the world for our students' protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with me?\" fearful, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeoxys sighed. \"This is the winter season, Pi.\" patiently, he replied. \"By the time this is all straightened out, the roads will be impassible.\" he shook his head. \"That and I know of Pokes-high, you would be ill treated there by your looks alone; not to mention your very name and rare condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sob and Deoxys placed a gentle tentacle onto your shoulder. \"There, there.\" cooing, he said. \"You may not be a Pokemon, physically but I sense you have the heart of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I don't know h-how to be a Poke- Pokemon.\" stammering, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be yourself.\" gently, Deoxys said. \"I will assign an upperclassmen Pikachu to help you, her name is Pika.\" he then gave you what looked like a smile. \"Just sit tight while I summon her.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
